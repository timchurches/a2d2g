  <interventions>
    <interventions>Four 20-30 minute telephone contacts deliverred weekly (for 1 month) from trained interventionists. The telehone support will follow a script and be deliverred using computer assisted telephone interviewing software (CATI). During the telephone calls participants will receive information about the basics of a healthy diet and childrens dietary recommendations, be encouraged to make fruit and vegetables readily available and accessible, eat meals as a family and without the television on, and to identify and reduce stimuli for unhealthy eating. Furthermore the telephone calls will encourage parents to role model fruit and vegetable consumption and utilise positive parenting strategies related to child feeding.

The telephone support calls will also be facilitated by print workbook</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fruit and vegetable consumption. Fruit and vegetable intake will be assessed using scores on the fruit and vegetable subscale of the Children's Dietary Questionnaire (CDQ) which asks parents to report the frequency and variety of fruits and vegetables consumed by their child over the past seven days and past 24 hours</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then 2 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months following intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Home food environment  characteristics.
Changes in the characteristics of the home food environment including fruit and vegetable availability and accessibility the location where meals are eaten, and whether the television is on during mealtimes  will be measured using items from the Healthy Home Survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then 2 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months following intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Role modeling. Changes in the extent to which parents role model healthy eating habits will be assessed using the proxy measure of parents' fruit and vegetable consumption. Two items will be included from the 1995 National Nutrition Survey to assess parental daily intake of fruit and vegetables (serves per day).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then 2 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months following intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parent feeding practice. Changes in parent feeding practices including pressure to eat will be assessed using items Birch's Child Feeding Questionnaire and additional items from the Healthy Home Survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then 2 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months following intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parent self efficacy will be also be assessed by scores on the Parent Self Efficacy for Child Diet scale (P-SEC).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Both the PSOC and P-SEC at baseline and 2 months following intervention commencement.
Only the P-SEC at 6 months, 12 months and 18 months following intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events: Any adverse changes in child's diet will be assessed using the Children's Dietary Questionnaire subscales. Adverse changes to the amount spent on household food purchase will also be assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then 2 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months following intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subgroup analysis: change in children's fruit and vegetable consumption by risk status (i.e. those meeting vs not meeting current fruit and vegetable intake recommendations at baseline).</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months following intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Parents of children who attend preschool in the Greater Newcastle region of NSW will be invited to participate. To be eligible, parents must: 1. Have a child 3 to 5 years old. 2. Reside with their child at least four days a week. 3. Have a child without special dietary requirements or allergies which may be adversely affected by the intervention or require specialised tailoring of the intervention. 4. Be English Speaking</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment will occur in two phases. In phase one, information packs and consent forms will be mailed to randomly selected preschools in the local area. Preschools who do not return the study forms indiciating their interest or otherwise in participation in the study will be telephoned by a research assistant two weeks following receipt of the initial study information mailing. Study information sheets and consent forms will then be distributed to parents of children 3-5 years attending participating preschools. Reminder letters will be distributed through preschools to parents in the same way 1-2 weeks later. Parents providing written informed consent will participate in the study. Following the recruitment of both preschools and parents each preschool will be randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition. All parents whose children attend preschools randomised to the experimental condition will receive the intervention, while those in the control group will receive minimal support. Allocation to groups will be concealed. Random allocation will occur following recruitment of all participants in each preschool (cluster). The randomisation will be conducted by and independent statistician who is not a member of the research team at central adminstration.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation to experimental or control groups will be by block randomisation to maximise the likelihood that the number of participants allocated to each condition remains approximately equal.

An independent statistician using a randomisation function in a statistical package will perform the block randomisation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The home and family food environment are among the most influential factors in shaping childrens dietary habits. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of a telephone based intervention in supporting parents of children aged 3-5 years to modify their home and family food environment to increase their childs fruit and vegetable consumption.</summary>
