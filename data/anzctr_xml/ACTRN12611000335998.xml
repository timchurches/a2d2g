  <interventions>
    <interventions>Brief intervention for alcohol use is a validated tool for discussing alcohol use and its potential adverse effects to patients with risky alcohol drinking behaviours. It consists of a brief discussion of alcohol related harms based on a standard proforma and is administered face to face with the patient using one of two trained study investigators. Brief intervention takes no more than 10 minutes to administer per patient. An information booklet and drinking diary is also provided to the patient.

The aim is to reduce levels of harmful drinking in patients admitted to hospital due to injuries and have evidence of harmful alcohol consumption based on the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identifiation Test) screening tool. 

Eligible patients randomised to the study arm will all receive brief intervention in addition to standard clinical care</interventions>
    <comparator>Eligible patients randomised to control group will receive standard clinical care. This involves clinical care for the injury and its complications as well as routine case management. If a clinical indication for referral to Drug and Alcohol is indicated, this will be completed independently if the trial group allocation.</comparator>

      <outcome>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score. The AUDIT score categorises patients who are at risk of harmful alcohol use. A score of &gt;8 means a patient has harmful alcohol consumtion levels.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients are identified during routine hospital ward rounds by the trauma clinical nurse consultant and informed about the study. A study investigator then approaches patient and tells them about the study. Writeen consent is then obtained. A screening tool (AUDIT - Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) is then used to screen patients for at risk drinking. If the screening tool scores 8 or more then the patient is randomised. Randomisation involves opening a prefilled sealed envelope which contains group assignment. These envelopes are kept in a locked research cabinet.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computer based random number generator was used to determine randomisation sequence. Group allocations were then placed in a numbered and sealed envelope.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol abuse continues to be a major contributor to injury related hospitalisations in Australia. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of brief intervention in reducing harmful alcohol use in a group of patients admitted under the trauma service at a tertiary hospital. We conducted a randomised control trial of trauma patients who were screened with the AUDIT tool (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and deemed to be at risk drinkers. Groups were assigned to brief intervention or standard care. We compared AUDIT scores between groups and before and after intervention controlling for factors such as age, gender, injury severity and mechanism of injury.</summary>
