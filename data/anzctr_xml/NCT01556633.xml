      <outcome>Total Dialysate Clearance for Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (CLDAPD) of Oseltamivir and Oseltamivir Carboxylate for 75 mg Dose - CLDAPD is the total dialysate clearance for automated peritoneal dialysis, attributable to both continuous cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), which was calculated with the recovery method over the dense blood sampling collection interval from 0 to 48 hours post-dose.
CLDAPD = the amount excreted into dialysate from 0 to 48 hours (Aed[0-48])/ plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time zero through 48 hours (AUC[0-48])
CLDCCPD = mean of CLDCCPD from the 2 CCPD sessions, calculated as CLDCCPD = (Aed[0-8]/AUC[0-8] + Aed[24-32]/AUC[24-32]) / 2
CLDCAPD = mean of CLDCAPD from the 3 CAPD sessions, calculated as CLDCAPD = (Aed[8-16]/AUC[8-16] + Aed[16-24]/AUC[16-24] + Aed[32-48]/AUC[32-48]) / 3</outcome>
