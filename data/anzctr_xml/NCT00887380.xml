  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Pre-radiotherapy commencement of anastrozole
Treatment: other - Radiotherapy
Treatment: drugs - Post radiotherapy commencement of anastrozole

Active Comparator: Arm A: Concurrent - Investigational treatment: Anastrozole commenced before (Pre-radiotherapy commencement of anastrozole) and continued during radiotherapy.

Active Comparator: Arm B: Sequential - Standard Treatment: Anastrozole and subsequent anti-oestrogen therapy delayed until after radiotherapy (Post radiotherapy commencement of anastrozole)


Treatment: drugs: Pre-radiotherapy commencement of anastrozole
Anastrozole: 1mg per day will be prescribed for 12 weeks. Commencing within 1 week of randomisation, to be administered from a min of 1 week before and a max of 4 weeks before commencement of radiotherapy and continued throughout radiotherapy. After 12 weeks administration of anastrozole according to trial regimen, anastrozole can be continued at the treating clinician's discretion and in accordance with the preference selected at the time of randomisation and stratification. The alternative options to long-term anastrozole are tamoxifen or cessation of anti-oestrogen therapy.

Treatment: other: Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy must commence within 1 month of randomisation. Radiotherapy planning and treatment is as per the protocol.

Treatment: drugs: Post radiotherapy commencement of anastrozole
Anastrozole 1mg per day will be prescribed for 12 weeks after radiotherapy is completed. Anastrozole should commence within 1 week of the last fraction of radiotherapy and be continued for a total of 12 weeks. After 12 weeks administration according to the trial regimen, any subsequent hormone therapy is as for the concurrent arm.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Women aged 18 years or older

          -  Post total mastectomy or lumpectomy. All planned cancer resection surgery complete.

          -  Histologic or pathologic reports must verify either:

               -  No tumour contacting the inked margin of surgically removed tissue, or

               -  Focal involvement (&lt;2mm front) if the margin is at the deep (posterior part) of
                  the breast and the surgeon confirms that surgery extended to the deep fascia, or

               -  Focal involvement (&lt;2mm front) if the margin is superficial (anterior part of the
                  breast or subcutaneous) and the surgeon confirms that surgery extended to the
                  subcutis NB: In the case of focally involved deep or superficial margins, the
                  medical records or multidisciplinary meeting notes or correspondence from the
                  surgeon must indicate that the surgeon confirms the surgery extended to the deep
                  fascia or subcutis as appropriate. Patients should routinely receive a lumpectomy
                  bed boost in the conserved breast setting if there is focal superficial or focal
                  deep involvement as defined above.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether starting anastrozole prior to radiotherapy,
      so that it is taken during radiotherapy, decreases local recurrence of breast cancer in
      post-menopausal women in comparison to waiting until after radiotherapy to commence
      anastrozole.</summary>
