  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional product, CMX-020, will be administered as an oral capsule.

CMX-020 and matching placebo will be provided as 10 mg capsules. Depending on the dose level, subjects will take 5, 10 or 20 capsules to provide 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg per dose.

The starting dose of 50 mg oral CMX-020 for the present study is consistent with the Maximum Recommended Starting Dose (MRSD) proposed in the Food and Drug Administration Guidance, 2005. The 50 mg starting dose is well within the 1/10th of the NOAEL safety margin established in the 14-day repeat dose study in monkey. 
Subsequent treatment groups (100 mg and 200 mg) will be dosed in an escalating order, each dose level increased by no more than 2-fold over the previous dose level.

Subjects will be administered a single oral dose of CMX-020/placebo on Day 1 (fasted dose) and then a single oral dose of CMX-020/placebo on Day 8 (fed dose), followed by twice daily dosing of oral CMX-020/placebo from morning of Day 9 (fasted) through to morning of Day 13 (fasted) i.e. from Day 9 to Day 13, the subject will be administered 2 X 50mg doses per day for Cohort 1,  2 X  100mg doses per day for Cohort 2 and 2 X 200mg doses per day for Cohort 3.

Every effort will be made to administer each dose of CMX-020 or matching placebo with 240 mL of room temperature water, particularly with the 0, 168 and 288 hour (PK) doses. If absolutely necessary, an additional amount of up to 240 mL of water may be taken to facilitate capsule ingestion and any additional amount recorded in the CRF.

All medications will be administered in the clinical study unit under the supervision of study staff. Research personnel will ensure each study drug dose has been ingested by performing a hand and mouth check.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After informed consent has been obtained, all screening tests establishing subject eligibility will be performed within a period of 21 days before dosing. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility on Day -1.</concealment>
    <sequence>In this study there are 3 dose groups  (cohorts), each consisting of 10 subjects (5 males and 5 females); 8 will be randomised to receive study drug/ oral CMX-020 (4 males and 4 females) and 2 will receive placebo (1 male and 1 female). 
Thus approximately 30 healthy male and female subjects 18-50 years of age will be enrolled into the study.
Additional cohorts may be added based on safety and tolerability in previous cohorts, subject to HREC approval.

Subjects will be administered a single oral dose of CMX-020/placebo on Day 1 (fasted dose) and then a single oral dose of CMX-020/placebo on Day 8 (fed dose), followed by twice daily dosing of oral CMX-020/placebo from morning of Day 9 (fasted) through to morning of Day 13 (fasted).

Allocation will be concealed by use of pre labelled drug boxes containing subject randomisation numbers and use of sealed opaque envelopes.

Computerised generated randomisation schedule using SAS software will be used for treatment allocation (sequence generation).</sequence>
