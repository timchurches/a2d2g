  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients ' demographic data was recorded. The patients will be divided into two groups. Patients distributed to groups with closed envelope technique
Group I (n=50): Subcostal transversus abdominis plane block group
Subcostal transversus abdominis plane blocks were performed under ultrasound guidance after induction of anesthesia, before beginning of surgery by the same anesthesiologist who performed block at least 20 times. 1,5 mg/kg %0.25 Bupivacaine (Marcaine (R) AstraZeneca: Istanbul, Turkey)injected in the transversus abdominis fascial plane under direct visualization.
Group II (n=50):Quadratus lumborum block group
Quadratus lumborum blocks were performed under ultrasound guidance after induction of anesthesia, before beginning of surgery by the same anesthesiologist who performed block at least 20 times. 1,5mg/kg %0,25 Bupivacaine (Marcaine (R) AstraZeneca: Istanbul, Turkey)injected in the quadratus lumborum fascial plane under direct visualization. 
 The patients received patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) with 54 ml normal saline + 300 mg tramadol (Tramosel (R), Haver, Istanbul, Turkey) for postoperative pain management (bolus dose: 5 ml, lockout period: 30 minutes,without loading dose). All patients received intravenous analgesia via the same type of PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) device for 24 hours period.
When the pain level is higher than three (0=no pain; 10=severe pain), the patient can use the patient controlled analgesia pump. If the pain still exist, additional analgesic will be applied by the same anesthesiologist who assessed outcomes and the number of additional analgesic was recorded

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose:Ultrasound-guided quadratus lumbar block and transversus abdominis are effective methods for analgesia in operations involving the abdominal region of the abdominal plane and are increasingly used. Many studies have shown that they provide less complications and longer effective analgesia than conventional analgesia regimens. In our clinic, it was planned to compare these methods, which are routinely used for preventive purposes, in terms of efficacy on pain. We aimed to contribute to the literature by comparing the obtained data with the existing literature information.

Methods: In this study the patients who can speak Turkish and who have chololithiasis and planned elective laporoscophic cholecistectomy surgery, aged between 18-75 years with ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologist) Score I-II were included. We excluded patients with blood coagulation pathologies, allergies against local anaesthetics , inability to understand the study protocol, body mass index greater than thirty five or infection on the block area.

Demographic data (age, height, weight, gender, ASA) of the patients will be recorded. Patients will be divided into 2 groups of 100 patients according to closed envelope method.
Group 1 (n = 50): General anesthesia will be applied with the drugs applied in the patient's routine. Subcostal Transversus Abdominis Plane block will be performed in the presence of ultrasound after intubation. 1,5 mg / kg 0.25% Bupivacain will be applied on each side in our routine.
Group 2 (n = 50): General anesthesia will be applied with the drugs applied in the patient's routine. Post-intubation Quadratus Lumborum Block will be performed in the presence of ultrasound. Each side will be treated with 1,5 mg / kg 0.25% Bupivacain applied on the route.

After the operation, to obtain minimum level of pain, patients controlled analgesia pump was applied via intravenous way to the patients. Then the level of pain was observed through the visual analog scale at 0-1-6-12-24h postoperatively both while coughing and at rest.


When the pain level is higher than three (0=no pain; 10=severe pain), the patient can use the patient controlled analgesia pump. If the pain still exist, additional analgesic was applied and the number of additional analgesic will be recorded accordingly</summary>
