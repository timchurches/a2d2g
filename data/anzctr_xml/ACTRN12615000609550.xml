  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>NP202 is an experimental drug being developed by Armaron Bio Pty Ltd for potential use as a treatment for people after they have had a heart attack (MI).  After someone has a MI, their heart remodels, which means that it changes in size and shape.  This damage can lead to it being weaker and less efficient, and ultimately to major heart problems.  There are some drugs currently available which help prevent remodelling and are used for treatment post-MI.  However, there is still a high rate of remodelling and major heart problems in people post-MI, so new drugs are needed.  NP202 works in a different way to the drugs that are currently approved, and has been shown in animal studies to prevent post-MI remodelling.  It is hoped that NP202 will help to reduce the damage to the heart that is caused by a MI in humans.</summary>
