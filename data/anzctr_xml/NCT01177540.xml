          9. Prior chemotherapy (other than hydroxyurea) or radiation therapy for AML

         10. Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

         11. Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to provide data on the activity of a standard daunorubicin,
      cytarabine, and etoposide (ADE) induction plus epigenetic priming with decitabine as assessed
      by standard measures of complete remission (CR), leukemia free survival (LFS) and overall
      survival (OS), as well as, on minimal residual disease (MRD). It will also provide necessary
      data on the safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of decitabine in pediatric patients that is
      currently unavailable.</summary>
