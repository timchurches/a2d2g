  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 2 week observation period for all subjects will be followed by randomisation into one of two treatment groups. Each group will receive 8 weeks of physiotherapy treatment of around 45 minutes of supervised physiotherapy each week for 4 weeks then biweekly for another 4 weeks, directed at strengthening and improving control of the muscles around the knee, and advice on home exercises which they will be asked to do daily. The two groups will be doing exercises in different ranges of movement. Both types of exercises are not new and have already been in practice for the treatment of children with this condition.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>Patients all undergo a 2 week observation period after enrolment and are then randomised to one of two parallel active treatment groups. The patients are blinded to the treatment of the other group as they will not have any contact with them. The assessor is blinded as to which active treatment group the subject being assessed has been allocated to. The comparison between two treatments will be double blind randomised controlled but the within subject comparison of any treatment verses no treatment will be single blind only.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Joint Hypermobility Syndrome is a common but poorly recognised condition which mainly affects children. Joint hypermobility or double-jointedness can result in significant symptoms of pain, often described as growing pains, and symptoms of fatigue. This research study aims to find out what the best set of physiotherapy exercises is to reduce knee pain in individuals with joint hypermobility and pain. We are looking to recriut 40 teenagers aged 12-16 with knees that bend backward and are sore and give them 8 weeks of physiotherapy to see if it helps with the pain. Physiotherapy is the recommended treatment in this situation but reaserch to prove that it works has never been done, also different hospitals recommend different types of physiotherapy exercises and we will try and find out which ones work best or if there is no difference.</summary>
