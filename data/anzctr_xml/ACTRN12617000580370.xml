  <interventions>
    <interventions>We have two study group depend on propofol dose that used at anesthesia induction. In all groups, we will use the same anesthetic agent as fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium.
Arm 1 (Group L, low state entropy value target group ): For anesthetic induction, firstly 1 mcg/kg fentanyl will be administered as a bolus intravenously. Then 0.04 % propofol ( 800 mg PROPOFOL %1 Fresenius in 100 ml 0.9% isotonic ) infusion will be given intravenously at the rate of 50 mg/kg/h (10 seconds waited for every 20 seconds infusion period) by infusion pump until state entropy value reaches between 40 to 30  After adequate hypnosis, 0.6mg/kg rocuronium bromide will be administered as a bolus.
Arm 2 (Group H highe state entropy value target group ) : For anesthetic induction, firstly 1 mcg/kg fentanyl will be administered as a bolus intravenously. Then 0.04 % propofol ( 800 mg PROPOFOL %1 Fresenius in 100 ml 0.9% isotonic ) infusion will be given intravenously at the rate of 50 mg/kg/h (10 seconds waited for every 20 seconds infusion period) by infusion pump until state entropy value reaches between 60 to 50  After adequate hypnosis, 0.6mg/kg rocuronium bromide will be administered as a bolus.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study aimed to compare effects of different level of anesthesia (measured by entropy monitor) during propofol-based anesthesia induction on cerebral blood flow. Patients who are between 18-65 years old,who belonge to ASA I- II and who would have elective supratentorial tumour surgery will be included. We hypothesize that deep anesthesia level during induction of anesthesia can prevent cerebral blood flow increase according to endotracheal intubation in patients who has possible cerebral autoregulation impairment due to intracranial tumor.</summary>
