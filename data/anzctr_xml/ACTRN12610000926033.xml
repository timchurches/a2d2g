  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational study of persisting pain after Caesarean section up to 4 months after delivery.other parameters being measured are 1. Pre-operative anxiety as measured by the Spielberger State-trait anxiety inventory. 2. Acute post-operative pain as measured by a Visual analogue Scale. 3. Pain at 4 months as measured by the Brief Pain inventory. 4. Post natal depression as measured by the Edinburgh Post natal Depression Score. Additional demographic information will be collated including socio-economic status.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite Caesarean section being a common operation worldwide, little is known about the number of women who experience persisting pain symptoms, or what factors might make persisting pain more likely. Two studies from Scandinavia have suggested 18% of women have such pain problems. These studies were retrospective- looking at a group of women some time after their Caesareans. We plan to observe from before the Caesarean to 4 months afterwards, which will give more robust information. We hope to identify how many women in a UK population have persisting pain problems, and see if we can define any factors which might help is in the future to predict which women are at risk.</summary>
