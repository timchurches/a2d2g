  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects must be in good health as determined by the investigator, based on the
             medical history, ECG, physical examination, and safety laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Subjects must be identified as a non-smoker at the screening visit (a non-smoker is
             defined as an individual who has abstained from smoking for at least 1 year prior to
             the screening visit and who has a = 15 pack year history of lifetime cigarette use). A
             urine cotinine test will be performed at screening and at the time of clinic check-in
             prior to study drug treatment.</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>45</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  The subject has any surgical or medical condition that potentially may alter the
             absorption, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug such as gastrectomy, Crohn's
             disease, or liver disease.

          -  The subject has a history of clinically significant allergies. Hay fever is allowed
             unless it is active or has required treatment within the previous 2 months.

          -  Presence of a chronic condition(s) with clinical or historical evidence of recent
             exacerbation, or other information to suggest non-control of such condition(s).

          -  History of alcohol abuse or drug addiction within 12 months of the screening visit.

          -  Any subject with active cataracts or medical history of cataracts.</exclusivecriteria>
