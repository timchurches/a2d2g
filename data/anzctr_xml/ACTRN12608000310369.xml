  <interventions>
    <interventions>During colonoscopy, 0.2% indigo carmine solution was applied down the side-channel of the instrument using a 20mL syringe containing 5mL indigo carmine and a cushion of air. A minimum volume of 20ml of indigo carmine was applied diffusely to the entire right colon (defined as proximal to the splenic flexure), and in a targeted fashion to the left colon, on any suspicious areas of the colonic mucosa. Recruitment ceased when 200 patients had been recruited into each arm.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard colonocopy. Recruitment ceased when 200 patients had been recruited into each arm.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All polyps detected at colonoscopy were resected using standard colonoscopic techniques, and colorectal polyp numbers per patient were assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After recruitment is stopped, colorectal polyps which were verified on histology were assessed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>prevalence of colorectal polyp (the percentage of patients with at least one polyp)</outcome>
      <timepoint>After recruitment is stopped, colorectal polyps which were verified on histology were assessed.</timepoint>
