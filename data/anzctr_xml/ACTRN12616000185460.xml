  <interventions>
    <interventions>Our study will comprise a double-blind parallel randomised placebo-controlled trial of 12 weeks duration investigating the effect of Kyolic aged garlic extract on gut microbiota, inflammatory  markers, and cognitive function in patients with high blood pressure. The active treatment group will be allocated to two daily capsules of aged garlic extract (1.2 g Kyolic Reserve, 1.2 mg S-allylcysteine).

Compliance will be assessed by return of trial capsules, as well as diary entries.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be allocated to two daily placebo capsules (microcrystalline cellulose) matched in appearance and size to the active treatment capsules. Capsules will be packaged in identical opaque containers including a sachet of activated carbon to eliminate any odour.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical blood pressure
A trained research assistant will use a validated and calibrated digital sphygmomanometer with appropriate sized cuffs. The display of the sphygmomanometer is to be positioned away from the patient to assure blinding to the BP readings. BP measurement to be taken with patient in seated position with arm supported at heart level, after 5 min rest, after abstinence from food, nutritional supplements, caffeinated beverages, and smoking for a minimum of 2 hours prior to BP measurement at approximately the same time/day of the week. BP will be recorded as three serial measurements at intervals of 30 seconds. The mean of the three BP measurements will be used in the analysis. </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks compared to baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stool test
Enrolled patients will be provided with a test kit from Genova (www.gtx.com, USA) via Nutripath, Melbourne, Australia at their first appointment for baseline testing, and will be instructed to collect a stool sample as close as possible to their baseline appointment and sent the kit to Genova for a  Microbial Ecological Profile (GI Effects Stool Profile), providing a comprehensive profile of commensal bacterial species in colony-forming-units (CFU)/g stool by PCR-DNA analysis. PCR-DNA analysis offers a more accurate result than standard culturing technologies. The report will be used to calculate Chaos diversity, Shannon diversity index, and Firmicute/Bacteroides ratio and relevant correlations. </outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Central hemodynamic measures
Pulse Wave velocity (PWV)is a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity, and is most reliably measured by a comparison of carotid to femoral pulse wave. The SphygmoCor Xcel device (Atcor Medical) provides the gold standard validated instrument.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks compared to baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Inflammatory markers
The research assistant, trained in phlebotomy, will take a fasted blood sample for testing of inflammatory markers TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 or interleukin-10.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks compared to baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive function testing
Patients will undergo the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB) test in the NIIM cognitive function labs. The SUCCAB test consists of eight computer-based tasks assessing speed and accuracy, shown to correlate to cognitive decline through ageing, with a difference in 60 milliseconds in speed correlating to about 10 years of ageing.
Our research team has been collaborating closely with the inventor of the computerised test in a number of projects, and NIIM has recently built the laboratory facilities to undertake the testing in a controlled environment.
Testing takes about 30 minutes including a practice session of about 10 minutes for the participant to familiarise themselves with the equipment and the task battery.</outcome>

    <concealment>Active and placebo capsules will be packaged offsite in identical opaque containers containing each a sachet with activated carbon to remove the garlic smell.

    <sequence>A computer-generated permuted block randomisation schedule will be used to allocate patients to garlic or placebo groups within each recruitment site.

    <statisticalmethods>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Primary outcome measures are blood pressure change over time (SBP/DBP); and gut microbiota change measured by microbial richness and diversity (Chao richness, Shannon diversity, F/B ratio).
Secondary outcomes are gut microbiota change as Firmicute/Bacteroides ratio (F/B ratio adults/elderly (n=21/20): ratio 12.5/2.5);22 changes in inflammatory markers TNF-alpha (garlic/placebo n=31/27: change 203 fg/ml, p=0.05)3 and IL-6 or IL-10; and changes in cognitive function assessed by the SUCCAB test.

Analyses
Continuous variables will be analysed by student t-test and analysis-of-covariance (ANCOVA), and categorical variables will be analysed by Chi-square test.
Subgroup analyses will be undertaken in responders (BP change in the garlic group) and non-responders (no significant BP change).
Correlations between BP change and gut microbiota change, inflammatory marker change or cognition change, will be analysed using Pearson correlation model.

Sample size
A sample size of 50 patients was calculated based on the following assumptions:
a)	To detect a difference of 8 mmHg BP (SD=9) in BP change between the active treatment (n=25) and control (n=25) with 80% power and 95% confidence;  b) to account for 10% drop-out or non-attendance at all appointments.
b)	To detect a difference of 400 points in Chao richness in the garlic group compared to placebo at 3 months compared to placebo  with 80% power and 95% confidence (n=17 hypertensives/10 control , p=0.05). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is evidence for a link between hypertension and gut dysbiosis, microbiotical profile and  inflammation,  and inflammation and cognition. 
We postulate Kyolic aged garlic extract to influence gut microbiota, and to restore gut dysbiosis in hypertensives.
Our study will comprise a double-blind parallel randomised placebo-controlled trial of 3 months duration investigating the effect of Kyolic aged garlic extract on gut microbiota, inflammatory  markers, and cognitive function in patients with high blood pressure.</summary>
