    <interventions>In this study, ZP-Zolmitriptan will be compared to oral zolmitriptan and SC sumatriptan. ZP-Zolmitriptan is a microneedle patch system consisting of a disposable microneedle patch and a reusable applicator. The user applies the patch by pressing the applicator/patch ring assembly onto the skin site on the upper arm. The ZP applicator is designed to ensure that the same force is applied across different users.

Each of the 20 subjects will receive each of the treatments once (A-G) every 5 days i.e. 120 hours between dosing days.

In Part 1, each of the subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the five treatments (A-E) on the first dosing day. On the second dosing day, they will be randomly assigned to one of the remaining four treatments. On dosing days 3,4, and 5, they will be randomly assigned to one of the other remaining treatments until all five treatments (A-E) have been taken by each of the subjects. On any dosing day, for the 20 subjects, four will receive Treatment A, four will receive Treatment B, four will receive Treatment C, four will receive Treatment D, and four will receive Treatment E.

Treatment A: ZP-Zolmitriptan intracutaenous system MF 1663 0.48 mg
Treatment B: Two patches of ZP-Zolmitriptan intracutaenous system MF 1663 0.48 mg
Treatment C: ZP-Zolmitriptan intracutaenous system MF 1663 1.9 mg
Treatment D: Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg tablet
Treatment E: Sumitriptan Succinate 6.0 mg/0.5 mL for SC injection

In Part 2, all subjects will receive Treatment F (ZP-Zolmitriptan intracutaenous system MF 1663 1.9 mg x2).

Treatment F: Two patches of ZP-Zolmitriptan intracutaenous system MF 1663 1.9 mg

In Part 3, all subjects will receive Treatment G (ZP-Zolmitriptan 3.8 mg).

Treatment G: ZP-Zolmitriptan intracutaenous system MF 1790 3.8 mg

For each treatment, drug is administered once. Treatments B and F consist of two patches that should be applied on the same arm as quickly as possible. All drug administration and application is done by the site staff.

At the end of each dosing day, the safety data from the subjects will be evaluated. If tolerability is deemed to be acceptable by the Principal Investigator and sponsor representatives, a decision will be made to proceed to the next dosing day.

All ZP-Zolmitriptan Patch System components are to be used only in accordance with this protocol under the supervision of the Investigator. The Investigator will maintain detailed and verifiable records that document the receipt, storage, dispensing, and return of all ZP-Zolmitriptan Patch System components provided by Zosano Pharma. These records will include a listing of which study drug supplies were dispensed for particular subjects treated in the study, by whom, when, and the specific quantities dispensed and remaining at the completion of the subjects investigational treatment. Reasons for departure from the expected dispensing and dosing regimen will also be documented. All leftover used and unused study patches should be retained for drug accountability auditing to be performed by Zosano Pharma or its representatives. At the conclusion of the study, the study drug accountability records must accurately reflect the receipt and final disposition of all study drug shipped to the site. Destruction or return of remaining used and unused drug supplies by the study site will occur only upon receipt of written authorization by Zosano Pharma or its representatives.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This is the first study Zosano is conducting with the ZP-Zolmitriptan product, therefore no specific planning information is available. In previous studies of Zosano intracutaenous products in healthy volunteers, a sample size of 20 was sufficient to provide directional information on tolerability, as well as clear-cut information on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

All subjects who have been dosed will be included in the summaries of the descriptive statistics. Means will be shown for all subjects and for the group that completes all treatments. Drop-outs within a 24-hour period are not anticipated; however should they occur prior to 2 hours after patch application then additional eligible subjects will be enrolled.

Plasma zolmitriptan concentrations as a function of time following ZP-Zolmitriptan patch administration will be plotted and cross-compared among treatments. For each zolmitriptan patch treatment, the bioavailability relative to the comparator treatment (tablet) will be calculated. Both mean and median values for each treatment will be calculated.

All subjects who receive study drug and have at least one safety assessment will be included in the safety analyses. Verbatim AEs will be mapped to preferred term and body-organ system using MedDRA. The number and percentage of subjects reporting AEs will be summarized by AE preferred term and AE body-organ system. Scores of the visual assessments of the application sites will be presented by treatment group, including both mean values and cumulative fractions for each score.

Analyses may be performed to quantify the amount of drug remaining on the ZP-Zolmitriptan patch system and the amount of drug recovered from the skin of the subject following removal of each of the patches. In that case, a description of the disposition of the remaining drug will be presented. The results from analysis of residual zolmitriptan on the skin and the residual zolmitriptan on the used patches will provide a basis for the calculation of the total amount of drug delivered from each treatment.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Zolmitriptan is a 5HT1 agonist widely used for the treatment of migraine. Like other compounds in the triptan class, it has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Zolmitriptan is available as a conventional release tablet (2.5 mg and 5.0 mg), a fast melt orally disintegrating tablet (2.5 mg and 5.0 mg) and a nasal spray (5.0 mg). The last two formulations were developed to potentially provide a more rapid onset of effect than the conventional release tablet, as speed of onset is an attribute that patients often cite as important in migraine relief products.

The bioavailability of zolmitriptan conventional release tablets has been found to be between 41 and 48% mainly due to first-pass metabolism. Therefore, a product which which avoided first-pass metabolism, the potential for food interaction and lesser absorption during a migraine could have advantages over existing zolmitriptan formulations. Additionally, an important consideration for a non-oral formulation of zolmitriptan is the high incidence of nausea that occurs during a migraine attack. In 60-70% of migraine attacks, nausea is a significant symptom that patients experience. Hence, a product that can be administered without using the gastrointestinal system (and not being susceptible to being vomited up) could be advantageous for the subject experiencing a migraine.

The aim of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound and the metabolites, and tolerability of various doses of intracutaenous zolmitriptan doses to a standard oral dose (2.5 mg) of zolmitriptan. The study will provide preliminary information on the potential advantages of the ZP-Zolmitriptan system use for the treatment of migraine.</summary>
