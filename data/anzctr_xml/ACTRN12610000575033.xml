  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Behaviour Skill Builder (BSB) is an online interactive parenting intervention for parents of children with intellectual disability and/or developmental delay.  

Participants in the intervention groups will have access to the BSB immediately on receipt of participant enrolment forms and pre-measures.  Waitlist control participants will have access to the intervention six weeks after they have enrolled in the trial, on receipt of post-measures.  The intervention will be administered once, in short sessions over a period of six weeks.  Completion of the BSB involves approximately 1 hour of online content as well as time taken for parents to complete activities in their home or other settings, over a six week period.

It is expected that participants will complete Part 1 and 2 of the BSB (approximately 30 minutes of online content) in the first week of the intervention period.  Participants are advised to complete a behaviour diary during the second week, before returning to complete Part 3 (approximately 30 minutes of online content) in the third week of the trial.  Monitoring may be completed over the following three weeks.

The BSB includes strategies for managing everyday difficult behaviour based on Functional Behavioural Assessment.  Parents complete a number of activities including a Behaviour Action Plan (BAP) through use of the BSB online tool. A specific BAP will be completed for each target behaviour; tailored according to the triggers, consequences and function of a difficult behaviour reported by parents.  

Functional Behaviour Assessment is an approach to understanding problem behaviour by determining its purpose.  The aim is to replace the problem behaviour with an alternative behaviour that has the same function, and/or reduce the frequency of its occurrence.  

In Part 1 of the BSB parents are asked to identify a target child behaviour for change.  

In Part 2 participants are asked to complete a detailed description of the problem behaviour and set a goal for change.  

Part 3 assists parents to: 

1. Identify a replacement behaviour and learn how to prompt it.

2. Encourage the replacement behaviour with attention, praise and rewards.  

3. Make the difficult behaviour less likely to occur by: 
    - eliminating triggers 
    - changing the risky situations, and 
    - learning about backward chaining

4. Remove the positive consequences for the difficult behaviour by:
    - preventing escape from the activity 
    - withholding the activity 
    - using planned ignoring, or 
    - changing the object so that it doesnt give pleasurable sensations or restricting the time/place 

5. Learn about back up consequences  loss of privilege or time-out.

An initial follow-up will be conducted at six-weeks, after parents have completed the online intervention.  A second follow-up will be conducted 12 weeks after parents enrolled in the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment waitlist control

Email support comparator treatment:

Participants allocated to the email support comparator condition will have access to the online Behaviour Skill Builder (BSB) tool in conjunction with regular email support by a practitioner, intended to assist implementation of the BSB.  Email support may involve assistance developing and implementing a behavioural action plan and/or suggestions regarding measurable, achievable behaviour change goals.  Email support will be administered simultaneously to (in parallel with) the BSB.  Participants will receive 1-2 emails/week for 6 consecutive weeks after a parent is allocated to the treatment condition.  An initial follow-up will be conducted at six-weeks, after parents have completed the online intervention.  A second follow-up will be conducted 12 weeks after parents enrolled in the trial.</comparator>

      <outcome>Percentage Behaviour Goal Achievement

Percentage Behaviour Goal Achievement is calculated using Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) as parents complete the Behaviour Skill Builder (BSB).  The BSB asks participants to enter the current frequency (or duration or end product) of a behaviour, then identify a goal for change (target).  The GAS then calculates what frequency (or product or duration) would be equal to 25%, 50% and 75% goal achievement (where baseline = 0% and target = 100%).  While monitoring the target behaviour participants can take a record of the behaviour occurred in 7 day periods.  The tool will calculate and report percentage goal achievement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The BSB will calculate and report Percentage Behaviour Goal Achievement as each participant completes the relevant section of the online intervention. Timing is at participants discretion, it is estimated that parents will complete the BSB within a six-week intervention period. The final GAS percentage will be available immediately after completion of the online intervention.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Global Behaviour Ratings Score

Global Behaviour Rating Scores are measured according to four sliding scales which ask parents to visually rate the: behaviour frequency, confidence managing the mis-behaviour, associated stress, and behaviour severity. A Global Behaviour Rating Score of 0-10 is calculated for each of the four scales.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Global Behaviour Ratings will be assessed at baseline and during the ongoing monitoring of the behaviour, after parents have completed a Behaviour Action Plan.  The frequency of measurement is at a participants discretion as ongoing monitoring is not compulsory. Participants can elect to complete the sliding scale measures when they enter their behaviour record, at any time (or not at all), however only their most recent assessment will be recorded for analysis.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>To be eligible for inclusion participants must be able to read and understand written English and living in Australia at the time of trial.  They will need access to email and internet, preferably with a Broadband connection.   Participants must also have a child with behaviour difficulties in the mild to moderate range aged between 3 and 9 years.

Behaviour difficulties in the mild-moderate range are defined as everyday behaviour problems that impact family wellbeing to the extent that reducing the behaviour difficulty would positively impact family, and individual, wellbeing.  Examples of everyday behaviour difficulties include tantrums and not responding to requests/instructions.  Parents who report that the mis-behaviour is very severe and/or report high levels of associated stress, are advised to select a different (easier) behaviour to work on with the Behaviour Skill Builder and seek professional help with the severe mis-behaviour.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>If the child with difficult behaviour is not within the age range (3 to 9 years) or if the child is currently receiving services for the target behaviour they will not be eligible to participate in the study.   If the parent does not read and understand English they will also be excluded from the current study.</exclusivecriteria>
