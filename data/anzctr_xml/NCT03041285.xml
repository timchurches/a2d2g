    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - idronoxil (NOX66) suppository
Treatment: other - Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy

Experimental: Group 1 NOX66 400mg and SBRT - Group 1 patients will receive 400mg of Idronoxil (NOX66) suppository (1 suppository) daily from Day 14 to Day 26 of the treatment course. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy will be given on Days1-5 and Days15-19. Total treatment course is 26 days.

Experimental: Group 2 NOX66 800mg and SBRT - Group 2 patients will receive 800mg of Idronoxil (NOX66) suppository (2 suppositories) daily from Day 14 to Day 26 of the treatment course. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy will be given on Days1-5 and Days15-19. Total treatment course is 26 days.


Treatment: drugs: idronoxil (NOX66) suppository
Patients in Group 1 will be given 400mg of Idronoxil suppository (NOX66) (1 suppository)daily from Day 14 to Day 26. Group 2 will be given Idronoxil (NOX66) 800mg (2 suppositories) daily from Day 14 to Day 26.
All patients will receive two courses of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), to be delivered in 25 Gray in 5 daily fractions on consecutive days for each course.
The first radiotherapy session (WEEK 1) will involve irradiation of Lesion 1 (smallest lesion), 25 Gray in 5 fractions.
The second radiotherapy session will start in week 3. It will involve irradiation to remaining lesions. Patients will receive 25 Gray in 5 fractions.

Treatment: other: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
All patients (Group 1 and Group 2) will receive two courses of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), to be delivered in 25 Gray in 5 daily fractions on consecutive days for each course. The first radiotherapy session (week 1) will involve irradiation of lesion 1 (smallest lesion), 25 Gray in 5 fractions. The second radiotherapy session will start in week 3.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>safety of Idronoxil dose escalation - Toxicity and relationship with study drug NOX66 will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.3</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of NOX66 with stereotactic radiotherapy up to three months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>evidence of clinical tumour response - PSMA-PET CT will be done before and 3 months after treatment. The change in SUV in PSMA PET will be used to assess tumour metabolic response.
Pre and post treatment tumour size on CT will be measured and RECIST criteria will be used to measure tumour response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months post treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
