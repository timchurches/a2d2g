    <designfeatures>Due to difficulties in sourcing a matching placebo, the Ipratropium placebo did not match the Ipratropium active, so this arm only was open. All Cold Study Unit staff and subjects were blind to the decongestant arms (primary outcome) of the study. Staff were unblinded to the ipratropium arm at the visits, but subjects were not explicitly made aware of the differing appearances of the bottles. Data analysis was done blinded.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim was to determine whether on demand topical oxymetazoline or regular oral pseudoephedrine is more effective at relieving congestion over 48 hours in acute coryza. A secondary aim was to determine whether on demand topical ipratropium is more effective than placebo in relieving nasal secretions over 48 hours in acute coryza. 
144 normal subjects currently suffering from the common cold participated in a randomised, double-blind, triple-placebo controlled study of ipratropium, oxymetazoline or pseudoephedrine or combination ipratropium  oxymetazoline or ipratropium - pseudoephedrine in coryza. The subjects attended the Cold Study Unit for 2 visits, 48 hours apart. They were required to take oral pseudoephedrine or matching placebo, four times daily for 2 days. Oxymetazoline and ipratropium sprays where to be used on an as required basis. Subjective symptoms of congestion and runniness were measured daily on the Cold Study Unit Cold Symptom Questionnaire and on a visual analogue scale when attending for visits.</summary>
