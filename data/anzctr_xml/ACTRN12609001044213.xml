    <interventions>Intervention:  Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning.

This will be applied to the non dominant arm (wherever possible) using an arterial tourniquet at a pressure of systolic blood pressure +40mmHg.  The periods of ischaemia will be 5 minutes long, followed by a 5 minute 'washout' or 'rest' period.  There will be a total of 3 such ischaemic cycles.

Patients assigned to this group will recieve 3 identical cycles as described above. The study design has 2 parallel groups, so participants in this group will not crossover to the sham inflation.</interventions>

This will be applied to the non dominant arm (wherever possible).  A pressure of 30mmHg of mercury will be applied for a period of 5 minutes.  These periods will be for 5 minutes, separated by a 5 minute 'washout' or 'rest peroid.  There will be a total of 3 such periods.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate an innovative technique which may reduce the chance of older patients suffering heart attacks that occur around the time of surgery.

A technique called remote ischaemic preconditioning will be used.  This involves placing a special blood pressure cuff on the patients arm.  After anaesthesia but before surgery starts, the cuff will inflate and deflate, briefly interrupting the blood supply.  This process releases chemical warning signals to the heart, making it less vulnerable to damage during a subsequent heart attack.

During a heart attack, heart muscle becomes damaged.  Blood tests can measure how much heart muscle has been damaged.  The success of the effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning will be measured by using these blood tests of heart damage.</summary>
