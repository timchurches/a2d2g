    <statisticalmethods>Demographic and baseline data (best corrected visual acuity BCVA) for distance and near accommodation, cycloplegic autorefraction, subjective refraction, corneal pachymetry and curvature, choroidal thickness and axial length will be summarised by treatment group using mean and standard deviation for symmetrical distributions and median and inter-quartile range for asymmetric distributions.
Primary Aim: Detection of slowing down myopia progression.
Measurements for both eyes will be pooled and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the ocular parameters (detailed above) calculated. To detect a change in myopia progression and other ocular parameters, treatment comparisons will be made using t-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables with symmetric and asymmetric distributions, respectively. Categorical ocular parameters will be compared between the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test.
Secondary Aim: Interaction of time spent outdoors with atropine 0.01% effectiveness
Ocular parameter data from both eyes will be pooled to give a single mean value prior to analysis suing vector generalised additive models (VGAM) to account for potential skewness and leptokurtosis in the ocular outcomes. Explanatory variables for treatment group, activity levels and baseline ocular measurements will be included and robust standard errors for clustered data will be employed.
This is a pilot study. A power calculation based on the data from the ATOM 2 study (where mean change in spherical equivalent refractive error per year was -0.28 (SD=0.92) in children treated with 0.01% atropine and -1.20 (SD=0.46) in natural myopia progression) suggests that a sample size of 54 participants can detect a similar difference between 0.01% atropine and placebo groups for children with Asian ancestry. This is based on a two-sided test, a significant level of 5% and 80% power.
A significant level of 5% will be used in all analyses. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will be the first to report on the response of myopic (short-sighted) children living in Australia to low dose atropine treatment.  It will also examine outdoor/physical activity levels to inform guidelines that balance minimizing the long term effects of myopia (short-sightedness) versus the risks of increased UV exposure.
The aim of this study is to test whether a very dilute (0.01%) solution of muscle relaxing mediation (Atropine) given as a single daily eye drop, can slow the progress of myopia.  The treatment part of the study will run for 2 years.</summary>
