  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this observer-blind study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' candidate Herpes Zoster (HZ) vaccine in adults aged = 70
      years.

      Two studies (Zoster-006 [NCT01165177] and Zoster-022 [NCT01165229]) will be conducted
      concurrently to evaluate efficacy of GSK1437173A vaccine. A pooled analysis of data from both
      studies combined will be conducted contingent on each study achieving its objectives. This
      protocol posting also deals with the outcome measures related to the pooled analysis.</summary>
