  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will employ a two level cluster randomised controlled design where the primary cluster is the school and the secondary cluster is the class. Eligible schools who agree to  participate in the study will be stratified by school size and geographic location then randomly allocated to either intervention or control group. The term in which the school participates in the trial will also be randomly allocated at this time.  

Intervention Schools
During weeks 2 to 7 of the school term, students in intervention schools will receive the Shake-A-Leg program;  one session per week, during class time for approximately 40 minutes.  Students will also receive additional Physical Activity and Nutrition content at each of these sessions for approximately 5 minutes. Session will be delivered by qualified Aboriginal Health workers

Data collection 
Data will be collected using paper-based questionnaires by trained research assistants from Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD) Aboriginal Health Unit and Population Health Unit. Data collection will be conducted in all participating schools (intervention and control) at two points. Baseline data during week 1 of their allocated school term and post-intervention data will be collected in week 8 of the same term.  All data will be re-identifiable, with each child being allocated a unique study number so that baseline and post-intervention data can be matched.

Attendance of participating students will be recorded at each session. Data from students who did not attend at least four sessions, two of which must be physical activity and nutrition, will be excluded from analysis.

    <comparator>Schools allocated to the control group will participate in the data collection components of the trial only. Students will only receive regularly delivered physical activity teaching and promotion practices according to the PDHPE curriculum and locally determined school-based initiatives.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The target sample size (addressed in section 7) refers to the required sample size for Aboriginal Students. 

To detect a statistically significant change in Aboriginal students with probability (power) 0.8, an alpha level of 0.05, an intra-cluster correlation of 0.5 and control group prevalence of 50%, the trial will require 466 eligible Aboriginal participants (233 per study group) at follow-up. 

When accounting for an estimated average of 20% Aboriginal student population among eligible schools, an 80% parental consent rate, and a 10% loss to follow up, it is estimated that 3200 total students will be invited to participate in the trial, including 644 Aboriginal students.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Shake-a-Leg (SAL) health promotion program was developed by Hunter New England (HNE) Aboriginal Health Unit and has been implemented in primary schools across the Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD) over the last ten years. Shake-a-Leg has been developed as a culturally appropriate program for Aboriginal students and is delivered to whole classes, inclusive of both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students. The SAL program uses Aboriginal specific and mainstream materials and also features characteristics of effective school-based health promotion programs that are inclusive of being (1) Focused on health knowledge and health literacy competencies (2) Strategically planned to meet students developmental age, needs and local health issues, and (3) Informed by parents, community members and local health professionals.

This proposed study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Shake-A-Leg program in improving health knowledge and behaviours in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children attending government primary schools within the HNELHD. The primary outcomes are; change in knowledge and behaviours relating to nutrition and physical activity in Aboriginal students. The secondary outcomes include; increased self-efficacy as related to nutrition and physical activity, increased knowledge in oral health, alcohol and other drugs, identity, and bullying.  Data from non-Aboriginal students will also be collected and analysed. 

This study will employ a cluster randomised controlled design. Eligible schools that agree to participate in the study will be randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group and stratified by school size and geographic location. The research will be conducted and reported in accordance with the requirements of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement. All students both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal in Years 5 and 6 attending schools allocated to the intervention group will receive the 6 week SAL program during school time.  Outcome assessment via student surveys will be undertaken at baseline and post-intervention.
