  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study Arm-1 Local Infiltration Analgesia Randomized Arm
2.5mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) placed in the intrathecal space using a 25G Whitacre needle.

Study Arm-2 Single Shot Femoral Nerve Block Randomized Arm
2.5mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) and placed in the intrathecal space using a 25G Whitacre needle.
Ultrasound identification of the femoral nerve and direct guidance of a needle to deposit 20mL 0.2% ropivacaine around the femoral nerve. This will be performed after the spinal anaesthetic to minimize patient discomfort.
Intraoperative local infiltration of normal saline into the knee joint through an indwelling catheter. This is injected under direct vision into all tissues traumatized during the operation.

Study Arm-3 Spinal Anaesthesia i.e. intrathecal Morphine Randomized Arm
2.5mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) and 200mcg Intrathecal morphine hydrochloride placed in the intrathecal space using a 25G Whitacre needle.
Ultrasound identification of the femoral nerve and direct guidance of a needle to deposit 20mL of normal saline around the femoral nerve. This will be performed after the spinal anaesthetic to minimize patient discomfort.
Intraoperative local infiltration of normal saline into the knee joint through an indwelling catheter. This is injected under direct vision into all tissues traumatized during the operation.

    <concealment>Potential clinical study participants will be identified from the TKR Waiting list. 
Patients considered suitable for potential study enrolment will be contacted by the IMRI clinical research team to ascertain their level of interest in participating in this study.
A randomization code based on a pre-determined randomization schedule shall be performed by the RGH Pharmacy for each consented and eligible clinical study participant. The surgeon(s), anaesthetist(s), theatre staff, ward staff and acute pain team will be blinded to the treatment group.
Each clinical study participant will be given a study number during their preoperative orthopaedic clinic appointment. 
The randomization code will assign the clinical study participant to one of the following study arms: 
Study Arm-1 Local Infiltration Analgesia 
Study Arm-2 Single Shot Femoral Nerve Block
Study Arm-3 Intrathecal morphine
 
</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization schedule will be generated using the excel randomization software. This software has been checked by the research technical officer at FMC (Dylan De Los Angeles). Random number generators used by Excel are robust and have previously been endorsed by the US Government. 
By using a double blinded, randomised, controlled study design, neither the surgeon nor anaesthetist will choose which of the analgesia methods are employed for a particular patient.
In accordance with the randomization schedule RGH Pharmacy shall prepare the drugs needed for each study participant. On the day of surgery, the anaesthetist will prepare the necessary solutions containing either the ropivacaine mixture or saline, morphine or saline). These solutions will be labeled only as study drug and with the participant’s randomization ID number. 
The randomization schedule of Clinical Study Participants will be kept in two locations for the duration of the study and will only be viewed routinely by Pharmacy for dispensing of the study medication. 
Location 1 – RGH pharmacy for allocation of study drugs and for pharmacist reference when receiving a script from the Anaesthetist for a study participant.
Location 2 – IMRI Quality Manager will be given a copy of the randomization identification list for breaking of the blinding procedure should it be required during the trial. The IMRI Quality Manager will only need to view the randomization should he be asked to by the Principal Investigator, Co-Investigators and/or treating medical officer of the trial participant.

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis of data will be via one-way ANOVA tests to detect differences between the group mean data, with post-hoc Tukeys HSD test to determine where the difference lies if one exists. As this is a pilot study the sample size was given to assess whether any difference between the groups can be shown, as well as a proof of concept. From this result we can them perform a more accurate power calculation for sample size in a full study. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During Knee replacement surgery there are different techniques that the doctor can use to anaesthetise the patient during their surgery and differing options for managing pain relief immediately following surgery. The aim of this study is to compare 3 ways of doing this and to work out which way is best by looking at the pain relief needed by the patients in the different groups after their surgery. The 3 different ways are:
1.	Locally Administered Anaesthesia
2.	Spinal Anaesthesia
3.	Femoral Nerve Block
