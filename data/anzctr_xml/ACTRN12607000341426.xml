  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare plasma CoQ10 levels and cardiovascular measurements in patients with and without inherited high cholesterol levels and are on statin therapy and healthy volunteers. If people receiving statin treatment have lower CoQ10 levels and less favourable cardiovascular risk measurements it would suggest that they may benefit from CoQ10 supplementation, in combination with their statin therapy, to further reduce cardiovascular risk.</summary>
