  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this study is to obtain MRI inflammation scores (osteitis, synovitis, tenosynovitis) before and 3 months after a change in drug therapy for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We will explore whether changes in MRI scores mirror changes in clinical measures of disease activity that occur over this time period. 
As this is an observational study there will be no  intervention designated by the researchers.
Instead, clinicians treating rheumatoid arthritis patients will choose the appropriate therapy on clinical grounds.
We aim to use observational data to compare MRI responses in 2 groups of patients.
1) Patients who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate alone and are about to be escalated to combination conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy.
2) patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional combination DMARD therapy and are being escalated to methotrexate/anti-TNF therapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many new drug therapies are available for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but we need to know how effective they are. Currently, the patients response is assessed by counting swollen and tender joints, obtaining blood tests that reveal inflammation and combining these into a Disease Activity Score (DAS). In NZ we have internationally-recognised expertise in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); a powerful tool for measuring arthritis activity. An MRI-inflammation score (MRI-i) can be obtained and may indicate persistent arthritis activity despite clinically normal joints. It is important to detect this subclinical arthritis activity as it can lead to long-term joint damage. This project draws on our teams expertise in MRI and compares it with the current clinical gold standard for assessing arthritis activity. It is consistent with the Arthritis New Zealand aim to restore joint structure and function as detecting low-grade inflammation may trigger a treatment change, thus avoiding joint damage.</summary>
