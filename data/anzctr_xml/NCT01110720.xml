             for at least 60 days prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) and must remain stable for
             the duration of the study. No such medication can be initiated during the study.
             Subjects receiving rasagiline or CoQ10 must be on a stable dose for at least 90 days
             prior to the screening visit.

             to at least one nostril or septal perforation) or history of nasal turbinate surgery.

          -  History of a clinically significant medical condition that would interfere with the
             subject's ability to comply with study instructions, would place the subject at
             increased risk, or might confound the interpretation of the study results.

          -  Contraindication to MRI examination for any reason (e.g., severe claustrophobia,
             ferromagnetic metal in body).

          -  Structural abnormality on MRI that precludes diagnosis of PSP, such as cortical
