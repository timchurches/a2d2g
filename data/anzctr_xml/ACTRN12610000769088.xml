  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients having an arterial blood gas (ABG) will also have pulse co-oximeter probe placed for measurement.
ABG involves aspiration of blood from an arterial line into an ABG syringe which is then analysed by a machine which is able to measure haemoglobin concentration.  ABGs are routinely performed on patients in theatre.  Additional ABGs will not be performed because of this study.  The process from blood sampling to result is abuot 5 minutes.  They are normally performed up to every few minutes to not at all on patients with arterial cannulau in theatre as dictated by clinical circumstances.
The pulse co-oximeter probe will be placed on the patient's finger about a minute prior to ABG sampling (as 45 seconds is required for measurement.  The pulse co-oximeter passes multiple wavelengths of light through tissue (similar to current pulse oximeters) and a computer is able to calculate haemoglobin concentration from this.

      <outcome>if sufficient numbers for statistical analysis, accuracy of pulse co-oximeter to measure trend in haemoglobin will be analysed.  This will require the same data collected as for the primary outcome.</outcome>
