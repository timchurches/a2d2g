  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - cinacalcet capsule
Treatment: drugs - placebo
Treatment: drugs - Standard of Care

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants received standard of care and placebo once daily for 30 weeks during the double-blind phase. During the open-label phase, participants received cinacalcet with standard of care for an additional 30 weeks. The starting dose of cinacalcet was = 0.20 mg/kg based on dry weight, and could be titrated up according to plasma iPTH and serum calcium levels every 4 weeks up to Week 54 to a maximum dose of 4.2 mg/kg.

Experimental: Cinacalcet - Participants received standard of care and cinacalcet once daily for 30 weeks during the double-blind phase. The starting dose of cinacalcet was = 0.20 mg/kg based on dry weight, and could be titrated up according to plasma iPTH and serum calcium levels every 4 weeks until Week 24 to a maximum dose of 4.2 mg/kg. During the open-label phase participants continued to receive cinacalcet with standard of care for an additional 30 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: cinacalcet capsule
Cinacalcet was prepared for oral administration as both capsules for sprinkling and film coated tablets for swallowing.

Treatment: drugs: placebo
Placebo tablets and capsules for sprinkling identical to active treatment.

Treatment: drugs: Standard of Care
All participants, regardless of treatment assignment, will receive standard of care with vitamin D sterols (calcitriol and its analogs), as prescribed by the treating physician.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving = 30% Reduction in Mean iPTH From Baseline to the Efficacy Assessment Phase - The efficacy assessment value is based on the scheduled assessment(s) taken during the efficacy assessment phase (EAP; Weeks 25 - 30). When multiple assessments were available, the average of those was used. If an efficacy measurement during the EAP was missing, the mean of the last 2 available post-baseline values in the dose-titration phase was used. If only one post-baseline value was available, this single value was used.</outcome>

The efficacy assessment value is based on the scheduled assessment(s) taken during the efficacy assessment phase. When multiple assessments were available, the average of those was used.
