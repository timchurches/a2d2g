  <interventions>
    <interventions>In patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery, either subacromial decompression or rotator cuff surgery post operative pain in the first 24 hours was treated with a slow drip continuous infusion of either Ropivacaine 0.75%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              All patients had access to intra venous morphine or pethidine via patient controlled analgesia (PCA), and oral analgesics for breakthrough pain.  The maximum and average pain for the first 12 hours and second 12 hours were analysed</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether the addition of a ropivacaine infusion delivered via a continuous slow soaker pump to the operative bed reduces post operative pain following rotator cuff surgery, either subacromial decompression or rotator cuff repair in the first and second 12 hours post rotator cuff surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Self reported pain scores at rest on a scale of 0 - 10 at 15, 30, 60 mins, 2, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours were recorded. Pain at rest and with movement were recorded at 18 hours.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the effect of early pain free post operative mobilisation on the development of frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis).</outcome>
      <timepoint>After rotator cuff surgery post operatively at 2 months for subacromial decompression and 4 months for rotator cuff repair.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Shoulder range of movement with a goniometer was recorded and analysed for correlation with pain scores.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study was to assess the efficacy in reducing pain of the addition of a slow soaker infusion of Ropivacaine (a local anaesthetic) compared with a placebo of normal saline via fine catheter placed inside the sholder joint at the end of the operation. The amount of additional narcotic agents and oral analgesics required by the patients was measured between the active and placebo groups. The hypothesis was that the local analgesic did not give better pain relief or reduce the amount of extra analgesics required.
In this randomised placebo controlled trial the surgeon, the patient, the ward nurses , physiotherapists and outcome assessor were all blinded to the treatment allocation.</summary>
