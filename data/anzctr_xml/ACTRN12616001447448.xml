  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention capsule (High omega-3 oil blend)
500mg capsule - 75mg of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 250mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of triglyceride
- each participant will be randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group
- participants will be asked to consume 4 oral capsules (500mg per capsule, 2000mg total/day) per day from randomisation to 12 weeks post-partum
Women will be asked to return unused supplements at 12 weeks post-partum when a spot blood sample is taken. The proportion of capsules returned will serve as a measure of adherence. DHA concentration at the end of intervention will be used as an independent biomarker of adherence.

    <comparator>Control capsule (vegetable oil blend) with a  small amount (0.05% volume) of fish-oil for masking.
500mg capsule - 40% palmitic acid, 40% oleic acids and 20% linoleic acid (obtained from blending canola (rapeseed), sunflower and palm oil)
- each participant will be radomly assigned to either the control or intervention group
- participants will be asked to consume 4 oral capsules (500mg per capsule, 2000mg total/day) per day from randomisation to 12 weeks post-partum

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of the study is to determine whether increasing the supply of omega-3 LCPUFA, chiefly as DHA, to breast-fed term infants in the first 12 weeks after birth alters the composition of their gut microbiome, as indicated by an increase in species diversity and numbers of commensal bacteria (a composite outcome) in stool samples collected from the infants. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The composition of the microbiome  will be assessed at 12 weeks after birth. Stool samples will also be collected within the first 7 days after birth (before the mother starts taking capsules)  for the assessment of the microbiome at baseline. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the effect of increasing the supply of omega-3 LCPUFA, chiefly as DHA, to breast feeding women on the composition of the maternal gut microbiome (species diversity and numbers as a composition outcome) assessed using stool samples. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The composition of the maternal microbiome will be assessed at 12 weeks post-partum. Stool samples will also be collected within the first 7 days post-partum (before the mother starts taking capsules)  for the assessment of the maternal microbiome at baseline. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study will also establish if DHA supplementation in breast feeding women can improve gut maturation/immune profile (a composite outcome as determined by gene expression profile in epithelial cells isolated from stool samples) in the infants during the first 12 weeks after birth. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Gut maturation/immune profile will be assessed at 12 weeks after birth. Stool samples will also be collected within the first 7 days after birth (before the mother starts taking capsules)  for the assessment of the gut maturation/immune profile (composite outcome) at baseline. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of increasing the supply of omega-3 LCPUFA, chiefly as DHA, to breast feeding women on the composition of the breast milk microbiome (species diversity and numbers as a composition outcome) assessed in breast milk samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The composition of the breastmilk microbiome will be at 12 weeks post-partum. Breast milk samples will also be collected within the first 7 days post-partum (before the mother starts taking capsules)  for the assessment of the breast milk microbiome at baseline. </timepoint>

    <concealment>Women will be approached antenatally and provided with a brief outline of the study. Women who indicate an interest will be screened for eligibility by asking them as series of yes/no questions related to the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study. Interested women who are eligible to participate based on the information provided will be asked to sign a Screening Consent form, providing consent for us to contact them once they have given birth. The women will be provided with a study card that they can hand to either their midwife/nurse or a family member/friend after giving birth. This card will contain the name of the study and contact details of study staff, so that study staff can be informed when she has given birth. 

Women who sign the Screening Consent form will be contacted after delivery and their eligibility to participate will be reconfirmed at this time. Eligible women who are still interested in participating will be provided with further details of the study and given the opportunity to discuss the study with family/friends and ask the research staff any questions they may have about the study. The information sheet will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. The research staff will conduct the informed consent discussion and will check that information provided is understood and answer any questions about the study. Consent will be voluntary and free from coercion. . 

After randomisation to either the control or intervention group (based on the randomisation schedule), the study staff will collect the allocated study product (from the FMC pharmacy), 3 bottles of 126 x 500mg capsules, and provide this to the mother along with detailed instructions on the number of capsules to be taken, and importance of adherence to the study protocol. 

Baseline clinical and demographic data including contact details, age, height, weight, highest level of education, alcohol intake, smoking status, antibiotic administration, use of dietary supplements, and dietary intake will be collected by trial research staff in the Case Report Form.

A dried blood spot and dried breast milk spot (for assessment of baseline fatty acid status) will be collected from the women at this time. Women will also be provided with a hygienic collection kit for collection of a stool sample (for analysis of the gastrointestinal microbiome). Additionally they will be provided with a sterile pot and asked to provide ~10-20 mls of breast milk (for analysis of the breast milk microbiome). A soiled infant nappy will be collected to obtain infant stool for microbiome analysis and intestinal epithelial cell isolation (mother will be provided with a zip-lock bag to place the nappy in before collection by study staff). 


</concealment>
    <sequence>Women will be assigned to study packs labelled with a unique study number assigned through a computer generated randomisation schedule which is prepared by an independent consultant.

Each study pack will contain either treatment or control capsules, pre-packed according to the randomisation schedule. Participants and their family, care providers, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to randomisation group.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>This will be a pilot study which includes 45 women/infants pairs in each treatment arm (n=90 women with vaginal deliveries). Women will be screened antenatally and following confirmation of vaginal birth will be consented to the study after delivery of their infant. A total of 90 women will be enrolled to allow for a 33% cessation of breastfeeding or other reasons for non-completion of the study per protocol. Due to the limited number of previous studies which have examined the infant microbiome, it is not possible to conduct a meaningful power calculation for this study. However, this study will be one of the largest studies of the infant microbiome which has been conducted to date, and the data we obtain will make it possible to undertake power calculations for future studies in this area.

All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) using the Bray-Curtis similarity measure will be performed to assess divergence in microbiota in the maternal and infant gut and breast milk between groups using data based on operational taxonomic units defined by a 97% sequence similarity threshold. The significance of the distributions of microbiota in treatment and control groups will be assessed by ANalysis Of SIMilarities (ANOSIM) tests. Following PCoA assessments, SIMPER analysis will be used to determine the contribution of specific taxa to the variance observed and identify taxa whose levels diverge between treatment and control groups. The significance of differences in the relative abundance of these taxa will then be assessed by Mann Whitney tests. A p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered as the level of statistical significance in all analyses. All analyses will follow a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The gastrointestinal tract is host to a vast number of bacterial species outnumbering the cells of the organism by around 100 fold. The importance of the gut flora (or microbiota) is increasingly being recognised. There is now compelling evidence that the composition of the microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract (the microbiome) plays an integral role in human health and disease and that altering its composition can have a profound impact on an individuals metabolic and immune profile. 
The first few weeks and months of life are known to be critical for the establishment of the gut microbiome, however there is currently limited knowledge of the factors which regulate this development. The omega-3 LCPUFA, DHA, has been shown to promote the colonisation of the gut by beneficial bacteria, and promote gut development, in adult humans, older infants and in animal studies. While breast milk contains some DHA, the amount it contains is directly related to the amount consumed by the mother, and most breastfeeding women in Australia have a low dietary DHA intakes. Therefore, this study aims to determine whether increasing the amount of DHA in breast milk, by providing DHA supplements to breastfeeding women, will promote the colonisation of the infant gut with beneficial bacterial species over the first 3 months of life. The results have the potential to identify a safe and effective approach for promoting the establishment of the healthiest possible gut microbiome in breast-fed infants, something which is known to have both short- and long-term health benefits. </summary>
