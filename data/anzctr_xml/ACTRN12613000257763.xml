  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention period will be 6 weeks in duration and will consist of:
(1) Ongoing monitoring of progress regarding sleep extension with weekly feedback. 
A sleep diary, actigraphy device and mobile phone application will be used to accurately estimate total sleep duration for the entire 6 week period of the intervention. 
Feedback will be provided to participants once per week regarding their progress in improving their sleep via SMS messages sent to their personal mobile phones. 
(2) Mid-program information feedback and education session.
A mid-program information session will provide a progress report to participants, reinforce sleep health related education and give another opportunity for sleep-related questions to be answered. 
This education session will be conducted by a sleep physician (principle investigator) as a group session and will take approximately one hour. 
(3) Optional individual telephone consultation.
All intervention group participants will be invited to take part in an individual telephone consultation with the same sleep physician within one to two days of the mid-program education session for any further questions to be answered.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive an initial education session of approximately 1 hour duration from a specialist sleep physcian (principle investigator). 
This session will cover the benefits of increased sleep duration and quality, as well as how to achieve these improvements. Both intervention and control group players will be present for this education session. No further intervention will be carried out in the control group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to extend and optimise sleep and improve athletic performance parameters in a group of Australian Football League (AFL) players over a 6 week period using education, monitoring and feedback.

The main hypotheses are:
1. Increasing total sleep time will lead to improved overall performance in terms of improved sleepiness and vigilance. 
2. Increasing total sleep time will improve athletic performance and aid in player recovery.
