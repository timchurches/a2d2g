  <interventions>
    <interventions>Families in the intervention arm of the study will participate in the "e-prem" intervention, which is a web-based program for families with infants born &lt;34 weeks gestation. It is designed to promote child development and parental mental health by providing parents with skills, resources and information via a standardised yet flexible on-line program with one-on-one telephone coaching and counselling. e-prem has 8 age-dependent modules completed from birth to the childs first birthday (corrected). Each module contains 5-10 individual content topics, each taking between 5-20 minutes to complete. It is anticipated that parents will spend approximately 30 mins each week completing modules for the first 2-3 months of the program. For the remainder of the program parents will spend approximately 1 hour per month completing modules. The focus of e-prem is on educating parents about preterm infant development, strengthening the parent-child relationship and supporting parental mental health, and the content has been informed by cognitive-behavioural and developmental care theories and evidence-based care. e-prem begins in the NICU and will be accessed by e-prem for between 14-16 months by each family depending on their infants birth gestation. The program includes weekly/fortnightly/monthly phone calls from the same e-prem clinician, where specific modules will be completed by parents and clinicians together over the phone, guided by the web-based material. This provides individualised contact and increased support over the course of the program, and will be guided by parent-reported current challenges or issues. Clinical contact occurs weekly for the first month of the program and fortnightly for the second month to support families through the initial adjustment phase. Contact is then monthly or as needed. The approximate duration of each clinical contact is 30 minutes. The first of these clinician guided sessions will occur face-to-face with parents in the NICU. </interventions>

    <concealment>A study-specific research nurse will approach potentially eligible families within the first week after birth, following consultation with the treating medical team determining that the baby is medically stable and is appropriate for the study. The research nurse will explain the study and time commitment required, provide written information, and obtain written informed consent. Following the collection of baseline data, each family will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or control group in a 1:1 ratio. The rate of multiples in preterm infants is high. Due to the nature of the intervention, families rather than infants will be randomised as all infants in the same household will need to be in the same group. </concealment>
    <sequence>The random allocation will be computer generated by an independent statistician using block randomisation with variable block sizes, stratified by multiple births. Group allocation will be determined using concealed envelopes, labelled with sequential numbers in each strata. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>We will cease recruitment at 100 participants, and will be mindful of possible limitations to power due to the smaller than anticipated sample. 
All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis according to the caregivers randomised allocation. The primary outcome of Bayley-III cognitive standard score at 24 months will be compared between the groups using linear regression models fitted at the child level using generalised estimating equations (GEEs) to allow for the clustering of twins, and adjusted for multiple births used in the randomisation process. Secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models for continuous outcomes and logistic regression models for binary outcomes, with analyses at the child level again fitted using GEEs. Regression model analyses at the family level (parent depression and anxiety) will not be fitted with GEEs, and will be repeated for mothers and partners in separate analyses. All results will be presented as differences in means or odds ratios between the two groups with 95% confidence intervals and 2-sided p-values. As a sensitivity analysis, analyses will also be presented adjusted for baseline parental depression and anxiety and social risk as potentially important confounders. Effects of the intervention on the parent-child relationship will be examined, and the parent-child relationship as a mediator of child outcomes at 24 months. The program costs and health care expenditures will be combined to calculate the total costs of intervention and control. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for e-prem vs standard care will be calculated per 0.3 SD increase in cognitive outcome and per maternal QALY gained at 12 and 24 months (calculated from utility scores measured with the AQoL-8D). All analyses will be performed according to a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preterm birth (&lt;34 weeks gestation) increases the risk for impairments in physical, mental health and academic functioning in children compared with term controls, with approximately 50% of preterm children affected. An estimated 40% of mothers of preterm infants report significant symptoms of depression, and many parents report an ongoing negative influence of preterm birth on family functioning. This important pilot study will evaluate the efficacy of the first web based intervention designed to promote child development and parental mental health for parents with infants born &lt;34 weeks gestation. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to assess the efficacy of a web-based intervention (e-prem) compared with standard care on child cognitive development at 24 months corrected age. Secondary outcomes of child behaviour and parent mental health will be compared between groups. e-prem is a web-based program with age-dependent content completed by parents from birth (starting in the neonatal intensive care unit) to the childs first birthday (corrected). The program includes activities, resources, and an individualised fortnightly-monthly session over the phone. This study will recruit 100 infants born &lt;34 weeks gestation (and their primary caregivers) from the Royal Womens Hospital in Melbourne, Victoria. Families will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group and participate in the e-prem program, or control group and receive standard care. Child cognitive development will be assessed at 24 months corrected age. Primary caregivers will complete questionnaires on symptoms of anxiety and depression at recruitment, when infants are 12 months corrected age (post-intervention), and 24 months corrected age. Primary caregivers will complete questionnaires on child social-emotional development at 24 months corrected age. The parent-child relationship will be assessed at 12 months' corrected age. Program costs will be calculated. Outcomes will be compared between intervention and control groups.</summary>
