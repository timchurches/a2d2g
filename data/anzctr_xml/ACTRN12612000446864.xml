  <interventions>
    <interventions>For patients in the treatment group we will undertake a course of conventional periodontal  examination and treatment This will include oral hygiene instruction and full mouth cleaning over a 4 week period. These visits (30 minutes weekly for 4 weeks) will involve cleaning around the teeth under local anaesthesia, doing a quarter of the mouth at a time (upper right, upper left, lower left, lower right). Following this, regular periodontal maintenance involving a periodontal assessment, oral hygiene instruction and full mouth cleaning will be carried out 2,4 and 6 months after completion of the initial conservative periodontal treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>No periodontal treatment.

Those patients assigned to the non-treatment group will receive neither oral hygiene instruction nor periodontal treatment for the duration of the study (7 months). For ethical reasons, all patients in the control/nontreatment group will be offered treatment at the conclusion of the study (7 months from date of initial examination).</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Periodontal response to periodontal treatment.  This is achieved by a standard periodontal examination which includes measuring the periodontal pockets, clinical attachment levels, gum bleeding, gum colour and collection of a sample of gingival crevicular fluid.  Periodontal pockets and clinical attachment levels are determined using a periodontal probe which is a small metallic instrument with millimetre markings on it.  The probe is gently inserted into the space between the gum and the tooth and the depth it sinks to is recorded in millimetres.  This is a relatively painless procedure and is standard clinical practice.  Gum colour and gum bleeding are assessed visually.  Collection of gingival crevicular fluid involves placement of a piece of filter paper adjacent to the position of where the gum meets the tooth.  It is left in place for 30 seconds to collect the fluid which naturally seeps out of the periodontal pocket into the oral cavity.  This is a painless and atraumatic clinical procedure.   The levels of inflammatory cytokines (eg IL-1), CRP, citrullinated proteins and anti-CCP antibodies in the collected fluid are then measured in our laboaratory.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All participants must have rheumatoid arthritis.

Willingness to participate and return for multiple visits; presence of gingivitis, mild, moderate or advanced chronic periodontitis, partially or fully dentate patients (at least 20 teeth); no evidence of known systemic modifiers of periodontal disease such as: type I and II diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, disorders of cellular immunity (e.g. AIDS, cyclic neutropenia, or other known specific leukocyte defects which we know predisposes to periodontitis), medications known to influence the periodontal tissues, or any conditions that would contraindicate a periodontal examination (e.g. risk of bacterial endocarditis).

To be included in the RA group, all participants must have rheumatoid arthritis. Patients will need to indicate a willingness to participate and return for multiple visits and be partially or fully dentate patients (at least 20 teeth). Individuals with evidence of sicca symptoms will not be excluded because decreased salivary flow in these individuals is NOT a modifying or predisposing factor for the development or progression of periodontitis. RA patients will need to have low to moderate disease activity (DAS 2.6-5.1)</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients who will not give informed consent; aggressive periodontitis, obvious endodontic infections or other sources of oral infection, pregnancy or lactating females; patients with a significant medical history indicating evidence of known systemic modifiers of periodontal disease as described above; patients who have taken prescribed systemic antibiotics in the last 3 months; patients who would need prophylactic antibiotics before any medical/dental procedures; patients who have received previous periodontal therapy. Smokers and individuals taking medications known to impact on gingival health will also be excluded as these individuals may have impaired responses to conservative periodontal therapy</exclusivecriteria>

  <trial_design>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1.  Patients attending rheumatology clinics will be asked to fill out a questionaire relating to their periodontal health.

2.  If patients answer "yes" to any of these questions they will be invited to undergo a periodontal assessment to determine eligibility for entry into the study.

3.  If the peridontal assessment indicates the patient has periodontitis they will be invited to particpate fully in the study.  At this stage the examiner will be unaware of which group the individual will be assigned to (treatment or no treatment).

4.  Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment or non-treatment as described below.  

5.  Allocation Concealment:  Sealed opaque envelopes numbered in sequence containing the group allocation (treatmetn or nontreatment) as determined by random number assignment will be used.  The operator will have no knowledge before whether the patient will be assigned to a treament or nontreatment group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be allocated to a treatment or non-treatment group using a random assignment process generated through www.random.org to allow assignment of participants to the experimental conditions.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Because of the interventional nature of the treatment it will be impossible for the investigator or the subject to be unaware of which group (treatment or nontreatment) they have been assigned to, thus an unblinded study is our only option.  The primary outcome measures of rheumatological markers will be blinded since the investigator carrying out these assays will not know whether the samples have come from a treated or untreated subject.</designfeatures>
