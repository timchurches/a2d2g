  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention to be trialled is a response to the alert triggered by the exacerbation risk prediction algorithm resulting from Bayesian network analysis of reliever inhaler use (collected by Adherium smartInhalers), and baseline health data. The refinements to the sensitivity and specificity of the alert will occur during the initial phase of this study which is anticipated to take 6 months. The response will be trialled over a 12 month period. Depending on the sensitivity of the alert the response will occur within 24hrs of the trigger. The response will be a phone call by the practice nurse from the patients general practice, supported by a view of the patients electronic medical record, to assess the patients situation and any concerns. The number of time the intervention (response to alert) will be delivered depends on the alert trigger frequency, and will initially be phone contact, however if felt appropriate, a subsequent direct patient contact, usually in the patients general practice (during office hours), or in the 24 hour surgery out of hours will be arranged.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be a comparison of the cost of planned and unplanned healthcare. The costs of events such as GP visits, ambulance call outs, admissions to hospital, afterhours surgery visits etc will be collated from available health care resources (planning and funding CDHB, MoH, Primary healthcare organisations). participants in the study will be asked about their use of healthcare during their flare ups, confirmation will be gathered from medical records, including GP and hospital sources.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The costs of each participants planned and unplanned healthcare will be assessed at the end of the study, ie 12 months after the intervention goes live. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is a chronic lung disease, usually caused by cigarette smoking, which leads to gradual worsening breathlessness and cough. People with COPD can experience frequent flare-ups (exacerbations) of their condition. These flare ups usually require significant and increasing health-care attention, and often hospital admission. Unfortunately some people with COPD delay seeking medical attention for their flare ups and this causes the condition to worsen and then an ambulance is called. 
The group of researchers involved in this project have previously used automated monitoring of reliever inhaler use by people with COPD to determine if their health is worsening and predict their likely risk of a flare up. This has led to the development of an exacerbation alert. We now want to establish a response to this alert to help people with COPD manage their flare ups early. This response will be individualised and delivered by the patients general practice team. 
We will measure the cost of this response and determine if it decreases unplanned trips to hospital, and also if patients quality of life is improved by this exacerbation management strategy.
