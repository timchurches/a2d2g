  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Aflibercept
Treatment: surgery - Targeted laser therapy

Active Comparator: Aflibercept Monotherapy - Intravitreal aflibercept injections according to a treat and extend regimen.

Experimental: Targeted laser therapy with Aflibercept - Targeted laser photocoagulation therapy to areas of peripheral retinal ischaemia and intravitreal aflibercept injections using a treat and extend regimen.


Treatment: drugs: Aflibercept
Aflibercept is a soluble decoy receptor and is produced by fusing all-human DNA sequences of the second immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of human VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1 to the third Ig domain of human VEGFR-2, which are then fused to the Fc region of human IgG-1. By binding to VEGF-A, aflibercept prevents activation of the native VEGF receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The study sites will be supplied by Bayer with aflibercept. Intravitreal injection of 2mg in 0.05 ml aflibercept will be administered to the study eye, according to a pre-defined treat and extend regimen.

Treatment: surgery: Targeted laser therapy
In the experimental group, targeted laser photocoagulation will be applied to areas of peripheral retinal ischaemia 1 month after the initial intravitreal aflibercept. The trial design allows another session of targeted laser photocoagulation 1 month later to complete the treatment if required. Wide-field photography is planned at 3 months to determine if further targeted laser photocoagulation is required, and if so a third session can be applied. The laser settings are based on those used in current clinical practice and have been prospectively defined in the protocol.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This will be a 24 month phase IV, randomised, prospective, multicentre, clinical trial of
      laser therapy to areas of peripheral retinal ischaemia combined with intravitreal aflibercept
      versus intravitreal aflibercept monotherapy. Both arms will have 2mg intravitreal aflibercept
      according to a treat and extend protocol.

      The specific aim of the study is to test whether laser therapy of peripheral retinal
      ischaemia reduces the overall number of intravitreal aflibercept injections required to
      control DMO over a 24 month period.</summary>
