  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of moderate and severe exacerbations of COPD. This is a composite primary outcome of the number of moderate and severe exacerbations of COPD. An acute exacerbation was defined by either at least 2 out of 3 of the following, on 3 consecutive days or more, change in sputum production; change in sputum purulence; and change in breathlessness; or diagnosed and treated by the investigator based on clinical symptoms. Exacerbation severity was defined as mild if it was self-managed by the patient at home (e.g. increase in bronchodilator and/or non-prescription medication use); moderate if it required treatment with antibiotic and/or an increase in dose of, or initiation of corticosteroids by a medical practitioner; or severe if it resulted in hospitalisation or death due to an exacerbation of COPD. The number of exacerbations will be determined from the daily diary card provided to the subjects and from the investigator assessment during any study visits.</outcome>

      <outcome>Adverse events covers any sign, symptom, syndrome or illness that appears or worsens in a subject during the period of observation in the clinical study and that may impair the well being of the subject. The term also covers laboratory findings or results of other diagnostic procedures that are considered to be clinically relevant (e.g. that require unscheduled diagnostic procedures or treatment measures, or result in withdrawal from the study). The adverse event may be: a new illness, worsening of a sign or symptom of the condition under treatment or of a concomitant illness, an effect of the study medication, an effect of a comparator drug, unrelated to participation in the clinical study, a combination of one or more of these factors. Thus no causal relationship with the study medication is implied by the use of the term "adverse event". Adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject will be documented (these include from medical history, physical examination, 12 lead electrocardiogram during visit studies, laboratory data).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Comparison of baseline characteristics was done using the chi-squared test, students t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Comparison of event rates (number of events/exposure patient days) among the three treatment arms was done using a Poisson model. Analysis of variance models were used to test for differences in numbers of exacerbations among the three treatment groups. Statistical analyses for all secondary outcome variables were performed at the end of the 60-week study period in comparison with baseline values. Analysis of time to first moderate or severe exacerbations was performed using log-logistic distribution model. CRQ scores were analysed using autoregressive models and likelihood-ratio tests. All randomised patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Data were entered and managed in a Clintrial database. The SAS statistical package was used for all analyses.
The mean number of moderate and severe exacerbations per year was estimated to be 2.5 (SD 1) in each group. An analysis of variance-based F-test would require 83 subjects in each treatment group to have 90% power to detect a difference in the exacerbation rate of 0.5 per year at the 5% significance level. Thus a total of 249 subjects would be required. If dropout rate was approximately 20%, 312 subjects would be required.</statisticalmethods>
