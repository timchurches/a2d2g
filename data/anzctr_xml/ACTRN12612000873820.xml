  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment group will have a 19G spinal needle inserted into the anterior hip joint and followed by an air arthrogram (10ml of air inserted through needle).  This air will enable the braking of the suction seal of the joint to enable traction, without which the surgery cannot commence.  The position of the needle would then be verified by fluoroscopy.  This process will take approximately 3-4 minutes and will be immediately followed by the commencement of the patient's scheduled hip arthroscopy surgery.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To validate the anterior hip injection technique without imaging guidance by showing it to be safe and yield high accuracy.  Clinical assessment for all patients shall be made on enrollment, and at
7 days and 12 weeks post surgery.  The clinical assessment will be according to the investigators physical exam, assessing (and measuring) patient's range of motion, mechanical symptoms,
pain and full neuro-vascular status.  Possible side effects attributed to needle placement (sensation disturbance) will be monitored closely.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lately, a new method for intraarticular hip injection has been increasingly considered, and is believed to be very accurate, eliminating the need for imaging assistance (which enables the surgeon to apply the treatment in an outpatient environment). 

This blind method of injection will be assessed by:
1.	Injecting small amount of air into the hip prior to hip arthroscopy surgery in the operating theatre, in the same technique as it is performed on a regular basis, but via a different approach (anterior versus lateral) and initially with no image assistance. The location of the needle will then be assessed using fluoroscopy.

2.	Injecting small amount of Methylene Blue into the hip prior to total hip replacement surgery, verifying its location and injection accuracy later during the same operation.

Our hypothesis is that anterior hip injection technique, without imaging guidance, would yield high accuracy rates. Hip injections able to be performed without imaging will also lead to less expense for the patient and community with a reduction in burden on imaging services.</summary>
