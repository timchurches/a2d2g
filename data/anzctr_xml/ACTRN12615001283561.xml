  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients eligible for the treatment phase will be randomised to adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin and observation or observation alone. Study treatment to be scheduled within 6-16 weeks post-surgery.
Gemcitabine/cisplatin will be administered via IV infusion on day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks, with cisplatin (25mg per square meter of body-surface area) and gemcitabine (1000mg per square meter), until progression, intolerable toxicity, or for a maximum of 8 cycles (24 weeks).
Post-resection evaluation of tumour recurrence will be conducted following current clinical standards (CT or MRI every 3 months for two years after randomisation followed by 6-monthly abdominal ultrasound for further 3 years) until disease recurrence (radiological signs of recurrence or histological tumour detection by cytology or biopsy) in both groups.
Adherence to treatment will be ensured by all dosing being administered at the study clinic.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not treating patients with cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy helps reduce the risk of cancer returning. 
Who is it for?
ACTICCA-1 is a clinical research study for people who have a cancer of the biliary tract (cancer of the gall bladder or bile duct, also known as cholangiocarcinoma in medical terms) which has been removed in an operation.
Study details
These drugs are being tested as they have been shown to be the most effective chemotherapy combination in more advanced cases of biliary tract cancer, where the disease is inoperable or has spread to other areas of the body.
This is an international investigator initiated study called ACTICCA-1, which is being led by the University Medical Centre Hamburg- Eppendorf in Germany and conducted in Australia by the Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group (AGITG) in collaboration with the National Health and Medical Research Centre Clinical Trials Centre (NHMRC CTC), University of Sydney.
The study involves randomly allocating participants to receive either chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine or the current standard of care (observation only, no chemotherapy). The drugs used in this study are approved in Australia to treat various cancers, however they do not have a specific listing by the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) for biliary tract cancer
The total duration of the study is 5 years. 
It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide details on whether giving cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy following surgery for cancer of the biliary tract is a safe and effective treatment to reduce the chance of disease progression and increase survival time and quality of life. </summary>
