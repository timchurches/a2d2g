  <interventions>
    <interventions>Physiotherapy assessment of patients involving standard musculoskeletal assessment of patients. This involves performing a general history of presenting complaint with the patient and physical assessment of the injured body part including active, passive, resisted movements, ligament and muscle tests and mobility assessment.

Physiotherapy management will involve the treatment deemed appropriate to the patient by the assessing physiotherapist. This may include provision of mobiilty aids, education, plastering and splinting, provision of home exercises and referral for further services.
