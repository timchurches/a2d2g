  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy such as carboplatin work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining cetuximab with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with carboplatin
      works in treating patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal
      cancer.</summary>
