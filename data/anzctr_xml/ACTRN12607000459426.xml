  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the value of interval faecal occult blood test within a colonoscopy-based surveillance program for those at moderately increased risk for developing colorectal cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible for this study if you are considered to be at moderate risk for colorectal cancer development based on a personal history of colonic adenomas or colorectal cancer or have a verified family history. You also need to be currently registered with one of the Southern Adelaide regional public hospital colorectal cancer prevention programs.

Trial details.
A faecal occult blood test is a test that can detect tiny traces of blood in the stool which cannot be seen with the naked eye. Occult literally means hidden or unknown. A positive faecal occult blood test should be followed by a colonoscopy where colorectal cancer or significant large polyps may be diagnosed at a relatively early stage when there are no obvious symptoms. 

At present, participants registered with the colonoscopy surveillance program in Southern Adelaide region have scheduled colonoscopies in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Councils clinical practice guidelines (2005), at a frequency depending on risk level. Eligible registrants will be offered a faecal occult blood test (interval test) in each of the years between scheduled colonoscopies. The study compares the yield of colorectal cancers and adenomas detected at colonoscopies between participants who do have interval faecal occult blood tests and those who choose not to participate.</summary>
