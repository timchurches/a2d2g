  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of patients with a  decrease in systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 25% from baseline. Blood pressure will be measured oscillometrically.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood pressure will be measured every 2.5 min during sedation for colonoscopy. Intravenous fluid administration will be completed before commencement of sedation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg. Blood pressure will be measured oscillometrically.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood pressure will be measured every 2.5 min during sedation for colonoscopy. Intravenous fluid administration will be completed before commencement of sedation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment for hypotension during sedation. Attending anaesthetists will decide if the blood pressure needs to be treated and how it will be treated (i.e. vasopressors or further intravenous fluid administration). The anaesthetist/blinded observer will record whether treatment is given, and what the treatment is, on the case report form.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intravenous fluid administration will be completed before commencement of sedation. Blood pressure will be measured every 2.5 min during sedation for colonoscopy. Hypotension will be defined as any blood pressure that is measured during sedation that provokes treatment by the attending anaesthetist.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of hypotension. Blood pressure will be measured oscillometrically</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intravenous fluid administration will be completed before commencement of sedation. Blood pressure will be measured every 2.5 min during sedation for colonoscopy. Duration of hypotension during sedation will be calculated from measurements made during sedation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nausea and vomiting by patient report during recovery from sedation ("yes" or "no")
</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the post anaesthesia care unit. The typical post anaesthesia care unit stay is 20 minutes. The patient was asked once at the end of the post anaesthesia care unit stay.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Headache by patient report ("yes" or "no")</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the post anaesthesia care unit. The typical post anaesthesia care unit stay is 20 minutes. The patient was asked once at the end of the post anaesthesia care unit stay.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dizziness by patient report ("yes" or "no"). </outcome>

      <outcome>Drowsiness by patient report. ("yes" or "no")</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Thirst on a 100-mm visual analog scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Asked twice. Once after the administration of the intervention and comparator.
Once at the end of the post anaesthesia care unit stay. The typical post anaesthesia care unit stay is 20 minutes.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction on a 5-point Likert scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the post anaesthesia care unit. The typical post anaesthesia care unit stay is 20 minutes. The patient was asked once at the end of the post anaesthesia care unit stay.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost of intravenous therapy. The cost is equal to the cost of the intravenous fluid giving set and the cost of the intravenous fluids. Hospital pricing lists were used to determine costs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The cost will be calculated after patient discharge.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Colonoscopy is one of the most common medical procedures performed in Australia. Patients having colonoscopy take oral bowel preparation and fast before their procedure. During their procedure they receive sedative drugs. All these factors can cause low blood pressure during the procedure. In addition they can be associated with nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, thirst and low satisfaction with care after the procedure. We are testing whether a high volume (2o mL/kg) of a balanced salt solution given intravenously before the procedure will prevent low blood pressure and unwanted postoperative symptoms when compared with a low volume (2 mL/kg) of the same solution. We are testing this in adult patients presenting for elective colonoscopy at our hospital.</summary>
