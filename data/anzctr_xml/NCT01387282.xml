  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Lean Body Mass - Change in Lean Body Mass (LBM) from baseline over 12 weeks for the ITT Population. Change from baseline over 12 weeks was defined as the average of the change from baseline at Week 6 and the change from baseline at Week 12.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change in Lean Body Mass from Baseline Over 12 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Handgrip Strength - Change in Handgrip Strength (HGS) of the non-dominant hand from baseline over 12 weeks for the ITT Population. Change from baseline over 12 weeks was defined as the average of the change from baseline at Week 6 and the change from baseline at Week 12.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change in Handgrip Strength of the Non-Dominant Hand from Baseline Over 12 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in A/CS Domain Score - The Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment (FAACT) Additional Concerns Subscale (A/CS domain) is a 12-item scale that is part of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System. Each item is answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).
The 12-items are summed together to obtain the domain score. Note that negatively phrased questions are reverse scored so that higher scores always represent improvement/less symptom burden. The total possible score for the A/CS domain ranges from 0 (worst) to 48 (best).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change in FAACT A/CS Domain Score from Baseline Over 12 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in FACIT-F Fatigue Domain Score - The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) fatigue domain is a 13-item scale that is part of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System. Each item is answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).
The 13-items are summed together to obtain the domain score. Note that negatively phrased questions are reverse scored so that higher scores always represent improvement/less symptom burden. The total possible score for the FACIT-F fatigue domain ranges from 0 (worst) to 52 (best).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change in FACIT-F Fatigue Domain Score from Baseline Over 12 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
