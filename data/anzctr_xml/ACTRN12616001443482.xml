  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible general practice patients will complete a brief (approximately 5 to 10 minutes) touchscreen computer survey on a tablet device while in the waiting room prior to their appointment. The survey will assess the patient's potential health risks related to under-screening for bowel cancer, cervical (women only) and breast cancer (women only), smoking, risky  alcohol consumption and depression. For intervention participants, preferences for help with identified health risks will be elicited as part of the survey. Upon completion of the survey, intervention participants will receive printed feedback on health risks identified from their survey along with recommended self-management actions as endorsed by a range of Australian Government-supported organisations aimed at promoting health in these areas. Participants who report being under-screened for cancer (bowel, breast, cervical) will be encouraged to discuss screening options with their doctor. Participants identified as smokers will be presented with self-management options such as referral to Quitline (a telephone-based smoking cessation intervention), talking to their doctor, and nicotine replacement therapy etc. Participants identified as drinking above recommended levels will be presented with options for reducing alcohol intake such as  choosing alcoholic drinks with lower alcohol content, and discussing approaches with their doctor etc. Participants who report depressed mood will be presented with options such as attending counselling, contacting Beyondblue (a telephone-based emotional support service), and discussing with their GP  etc. The printed feedback will be given to patients in an envelope by a research assistant immediately after completion of the baseline survey in the primary care clinic. This feedback will be tailored to reflect the patient's identified health risks as assessed by the survey. The research assistant will not provide any medical advice on identified health risks or self-management actions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control condition will not receive information about their identified health risks or self-management strategies. The survey will not elicit preferences for help for control participants. Control participants will not receive printed feedback on their baseline survey results. As an exception, control participants who score 15 or more on the PHQ-9 depression assessment will receive onscreen advise to discuss with their doctor. The contact details for Beyondblue will also be provided.

    <statisticalmethods>Consent bias. The age and sex of consenters and non-consenters will be compared using the chi square test for categorical variables and the t-test or non-parametric equivalent for continuous variables. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, proportions, 95% confidence intervals and means will be calculated to describe risk factor status and demographic characteristics of the sample. The proportion of participants in each group who report one or more self-management action at follow up will be calculated. A logistic regression, with group allocation as the main predictor of interest, will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on preventive care actions. Parameters will be estimated under a generalised estimating equation (GEE) framework to allow for potential clustering of patients from the same day.  Other potentially confounding demographic and clinical variables will be adjusted for in the regression model in a secondary analysis (these will be pre-specified in a statistical analysis plan).  A total sample of 360 participants will be recruited at baseline (180 per group). Allowing for 15% attrition at one month follow up this will give an effective sample of 150 per group. Assuming a recruitment rate of 7 patients per day and allowing an icc of 0.01 for patients from the same day, a sample of this size, recruited over 42 days (of which 21 are intervention days) will give 80% power to detect a 15% increase in the proportion of patients who report one or more self-management actions at the 5% significance level.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test a primary care intervention that is designed to improve self-management of risk factors related to bowel, cervical and breast cancer among primary care patients.

Who is it for?
Patients may be eligible to join this study if they are aged at least 18 years, are presenting for a general practice appointment, and have been identified via a brief baseline assessment as being a smoker, consuming alcohol at risky levels, or have not been screened as per Australian recommended guidelines for bowel, cervical or breast cancer.

Study details
The study will take place in the waiting rooms of general practices, with participants randomly allocated to one of two groups based on the specific day they attend the practice. All consenting patients will complete a touchscreen survey focussing on the patient's previous participation in cancer screening activities (bowel, cervical, breast), smoking status, alcohol consumption, and depression. While depression is not a cancer risk factor; it may co-occur with other risk factors and impede self-management efforts to reduce modifiable  risk factors.

Patients from one group will receive printed feedback about their identified health risk factors, along with information about self-management actions for addressing these risks. 
Participants in the other group will not receive information about their identified health risks or self-management strategies.

Eligible patients who complete the baseline survey will undergo a follow-up telephone survey after 1 month to assess how many self-management actions they may have undertaken in relation to any health risk factors identified at baseline. 

It is hoped that this primary care intervention will be an effective way to increase the proportion of patients who undertake self management  actions related to their identified health risks.</summary>
