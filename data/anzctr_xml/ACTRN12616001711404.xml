  <interventions>
    <interventions>Every session has the same structure (starting with a quiz, facts and new content, exercises to practice, and ending with a self-compassion exercise) the 9 topics of the online sessions are: 
- Cyber Bullying Facts
- Understanding Feelings
- Staying Calm/Thinking Calmly
- Being Confident in our Interactions with Others
- Worry/Overcoming fear by facing fear
- More ways to stay calm
- Self-esteem
- Problem Solving
- Communicating Assertively

We do not need an activity log as the program itself monitors adherence. Any activities will be automatically emailed to the University of Sydney email account.

Participants (aged 16-19 years) will be recruited directly to the program through advertisement and on-line media, including Facebook. The online program includes psycho-education about cyber bullying and cognitive-behavioural strategies aimed at reducing the likelihood that a young person will experience cyber bullying or reducing the impact of any bullying experienced. The online intervention includes 7 core online sessions (each between 10 to 15 minutes ); two - three new session will be opened up to participants every week, and participants will be able to complete the sessions at their own convenience. When assessments have been completed, 2 additional booster sessions will be opened up for participants to complete.

Study is an open trial with pre post and follow-up assessments. The content of the sessions has been restructured into core information (7 sessions) and 2 booster sessions.

As 2 to 3 sessions will be completed each week. the 7 core sessions will be completed within 3 to 4 weeks (around 1 month).</interventions>

      <outcome>These outcome questions listed below are a composite secondary outcome and will answer the question around usability of the program. Questions are specially designed for the online program. All questions are answered online. 

Questions include:
- the automatic online log of the completion of sessions (and their components) and time taken to complete them;
- the number of correct answers to the quiz at the start of each session, which will test retention of knowledge from the previous session; and
- a feedback questionnaire completed at the end of 7 sessions asking participants to provide feedback on the acceptability and usefulness of the program.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Outcome assessed at the end of each session completed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 &amp; 9

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Qualitative feedback about the program assesses the programs acceptability to participants, as well as the components they found to be more or less useful. The questions have been designed specifically for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Qualitative feedback about the program is collected after each session (1-9) and also within the follow-up questionnaire battery (4 weeks after the 7 core session were completed).

    <statisticalmethods>The aim is to get N=60. As we have an open trial a small number will be enough to show any change. The number is still big enough to be able to compair variables like: gender, culture, age groups, ... Outcome assessed: pre, post and follow up questionnaire

Using SPSS we will have a look at different changes like:
- Self-reported victimisation (PECK; Personal Experiences Checklist and the OBQ; Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire)
- Emotional and behavioural symptoms (SDQ; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire)
- Process outcomes will be collected as part of the online intervention: online quiz about content after each session; cyber bullying actions
- self-reported self-compassion (SCS-SF; Self Compassion Scale  Short Form)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> The aim of the trial is to establish if the use of an online psycho-education and cognitive-behavioural intervention will decrease the likelihood that a young person will experience being cyber bullied, and also reduce the impact of any bullying experienced. The program is designed to decrease vulnerability to bullying by building coping responses over time. We hypothesise that young people who complete the on-line intervention will experience decreased bullying (particularly cyber bullying), increased self-compassion, and decreased emotional and behavioural symptoms from pre-test to post-test, and these changes will either be maintained or improved over the 1-month follow-up..</summary>
