    <interventions>Low-level nutrition intervention:
The low-level nutrition intervention provides standard care (a high energy high protein diet as per the control group) with the addition of a prioritised nutrition counselling session involving the researcher (an Accredited Practising Dietitian), the informal carer and the older adult participant, within seven days of admission. This session will be held in a private room at the rehabilitation facility by appointment. The session duration will be flexible depending on the needs of the participant and will provide nutrition education to the older adult and informal carer as well as individualised in-patient medical nutrition therapy (MNT). Education will be interactive problem-solving and will address the nutritional needs of older adults, weight monitoring, and a high energy high protein diet appropriate for the home environment. The education session will be complemented by written information. The MNT may include individualised recommendations, additional food items at meals or mid-meals, taste testing a range of 1  2kcal/ml oral nutrition supplements (ONS) with provision of up to three per day, and/or registration for discounted ONS in the community. ONS will only be provided if protein and energy requirements cannot be met by foods and beverages alone. After the counselling session, the participant be handed over to the rehabilitation dietitian and will receive inpatient follow-up within the time and resource restraints typical to a rural rehabilitation unit in NSW. All involvement by the rehabilitation dietitian with the participant will be monitored via the medical notes. No post-discharge support will be provided and the informal carer will not be further engaged beyond the initial nutrition counselling session. 

Intensive nutrition intervention: 
The intensive nutrition intervention provides all the enhanced inpatient care of the low-level nutrition intervention, with the addition of discharge support. This discharge support consists of 1) participant nutrition counselling prior to discharge and 2) informal carer telephone reviews once discharged from rehabilitation.
The participant will receive brief nutrition counselling within seven days prior to discharge which aims to encourage the participant in following their individualised nutrition recommendations and a high energy high protein diet once they return home. If the participant was not provided with registration for discounted ONS for purchase once discharged at the initial nutrition counselling session or by the rehabilitation dietitian, they will have the opportunity to be offered registration at this counselling session if it is considered they will still need the ONS once discharged.
Up to five telephone reviews will be conducted in the 10 weeks post-discharge at times and dates agreed upon by the informal carer and researcher. The review will be short (approximately five minutes) and follow a set protocol. The purpose of the telephone review is to assess food and nutrition related tolerance of transition into the community and provide specific recommendations based on expressed needs. These recommendations may include food-based strategies, behaviour based, for example timing of meals, encouragement to adhere to previous recommendations, new registration or amendment to ONS, or referral to community based services such as Meals on Wheels or social work. If the participant is referred to any community services, the primary researcher will make the registration/referral. No other post-discharge support will be offered during the study period.
All participants of the MARRC Study will be offered a community dietitian referral if it is considered they require ongoing dietetic follow-up at study completion (90d post-discharge).</interventions>
    <comparator>Once enrolled and baseline data collection is performed, the control group will be placed on a high energy and high protein diet which includes one 1kcal/ml oral nutrition supplement per day. The high energy high protein diet alters the menu choices for an inpatient to eliminate energy and protein poor options. Participants will only receive individualised medical nutrition therapy by the rehabilitation dietitian if referred by the rehabilitation team as part of usual care. The participant will receive inpatient follow-up and intervention within the time and resource restraints typical to a rural rehabilitation unit in NSW, however will not receive any post-discharge follow-up from the rehabilitation dietitian. The intervention delivered by the rehabilitation dietitian will not typically involve informal carers, but may involve community dietitian referrals and registration for discounted oral nutrition supplements (ONS) once the participant is discharged. Follow-up for older adults once discharged is minimal due to resource restraints and high waiting times for community consultations. The rehabilitation dietitian is not a study investigator and their involvement with study participants will be monitored by the primary researcher in the medical notes. </comparator>

    <inclusivecriteria>Study centres were chosen by convenience sampling based on location. Patients greater than or equal to 65 years admitted to the participating rehabilitation units with a patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) rating of B (mild-moderate malnutrition) or C (severe malnutrition), if they were community-dwelling residents prior to admission with the view they would be discharged back to the community and they have an acknowledged informal carer. This includes community-dwelling patients transferred from acute care. An informal carer for this study was considered an adult family member or close friend who a) lives with the older adult or b) does not live with the adult but provides care to the older adult for four days or more each week. The details of the carer will be provided by the participant in the first instance and reaffirmed by the informal carer.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment is to occur over a 12 month period, six months for control and six months for intervention groups, but may extend to 15 months if needed to achieve adequate sample size. All new admissions to the rehabilitation units will be screened for eligibility within seven days of admission. Eligible patients will be invited to enrol via informed consent. Randomisation for the intervention groups will be conducted immediately following enrolment and baseline data collection. A computer generated randomisation sequence will be created. The sequence will be generated by an independent researcher, who will then conceal the randomisation in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. Participants, informal carers and rehabilitation staff will not be aware of the intervention allocation; however the researchers will be aware of the allocation; however participation in the study will be noted in the medical notes. Any participants that receive medical nutrition therapy, whether as part of control or intervention, will be informed of their nutrition status.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer generated randomisaiton sequence will be created by an independent person using SPSS. The sequence will randomise participants to the two intervention groups (low-level nutrition intervention and intensive nutrition intervention) and will be randomised with unbalanced allocation of 1:1.5 (low-level:intensive), block sizes of four and stratification based on rehabilitation centre, type of informal carer (live-in or live-out), gender and age (65-74y, 75-84y, 85-94y, =95y). </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: The scored patient generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA), the primary outcome measure, was considered as a continuous variable with an expected standard deviation in the control group of 6.0. Assuming that the minimum difference of interest across comparison groups is 4, then 48 subjects per group will be required to detect this difference with 90% power and type I error of 5% or less (two-tailed).  Assuming an attrition rate of 30% over 90 days, and allowing 15% extra for the application multivariable modelling techniques to adjust for confounding, 96 x 1.3 x 1.15 =  144 subjects need to be approached to retain 110 subjects by the end of the study. 

The results will be analysed with an intention to treat approach. Potentially confounding variables to be included in multivariate models include: age (continuous), gender (dichotomous), polypharmacy (Y/N; dichotomous), education level (secondary/tertiary/trade; categorical) and the modified mini-mental state score (continuous). Any confounding variables found to correlate strongly will be combined for use in multivariate models. Descriptive statistics (mean +/- standard deviation, median and interquartile range) will be used to characterise potentially confounding variables not included in multivariate models, the sample population, non-participants, lost-to-follow-up, participant satisfaction and to report process evaluation. Normality will be assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity of variance using a scatterplot. If data is skewed, log transformations and parametric tests will be applied. If the data is unable to be transformed to improve the distribution, the appropriate non-parametric tests will be used. 
Outcomes will be compared at four time-points (T1, T2, T3 and T4) for nutrition status, weight and fat free mass (Table 1). Quality of life and physical function will be compared at discharge and 90 days post-discharge (T3 and T4). Nutrition knowledge of the informal carer will be compared at baseline and 90 days post-discharge (T1 and T4) and one-off measures will be compared between groups at that time point only, for example length of stay (T3). 
The Chi-squared test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare categorical and continuous data per group allocation (control, low-level and intensive nutrition interventions) at each relevant time-point. Nutrition status, weight and fat-free mass will also be assessed for within-subject changes over time using repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA). Nutrition knowledge of the informal carer will be compared using dependent t-test. Logistic regression will be used to calculate relative risk ratios for categorical dependent variables (MBI category, discharge location, hospitalisation and institutionalisation post-discharge) and multiple linear regression will be used to assess continuous dependent variables (scored PG-SGA, MNA, weight, fat free mass, AQoL-6D score, length of stay and hospital admissions) for comparison between groups (intensive nutrition intervention and low-level nutrition intervention, intensive nutrition intervention and control, low-level nutrition intervention and control).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The MARRC Study aims to address the gaps in current evidence for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in older adults. The project aims to answer: Among malnourished older adults admitted to rural rehabilitation units in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, does engaging the informal carer as part of low-level or intensive nutrition support improve nutrition status, functional status, quality of life, rehabilitation outcome (length of stay and institutionalisation), incidence of hospitalisation and cost-effectiveness of care 90 days post-discharge compared with usual care?
The two intervention streams involve low-level nutrition intervention, which is a one off counselling session involving the patient and their informal carer, and an intensive nutrition intervention, which includes the counselling session as well as post-discharge telephone reviews for the informal carer. The control group receives standard care, which does not involve the informal carer or post-discharge support.</summary>
