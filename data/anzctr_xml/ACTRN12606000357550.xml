  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Iron deficiency anaemia is a common problem in pregnancy.  It is often treated with high dose iron that cause constipation, stomach cramp and inhibit zinc absorption.  Despite these concerns, there are no studies designed to work out the best dose of iron to treat anaemia in pregnancy.  The aim of the study is to determine the dose that is most effective for the treatment of anaemia with least side effects.  Three doses of iron (20mg/d, 40mg/d and 80mg/d) will be tested, and haemoglobin response and gastrointestinal side-effects will be assessed as the primary outcome. All researchers involved in the data collection and data analysis were blinded to the group allocation of the subjects until the primary analysis was completed.</summary>
