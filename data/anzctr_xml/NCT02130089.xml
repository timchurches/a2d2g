    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Thirst Intensity - will be measured by a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale. Patients are asked to mark the point on the VAS which represents their work thirst since the last dialysis. Zero is considered no thirst and 100 is extremely thirsty. This tool has been shown to correlate to the Thirst Distress tool developed by Welsh in 2002.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to understand if more frequent education of dialysis patients
      (patients with kidney failure who get their blood cleaned and fluid removed by a machine
      instead of their kidneys) on reducing sodium intake reduces the amount of fluid weight that
      patients gain between dialysis sessions. Patients who usually gain more fluid than is
      considered ideal will be recruited for this project. Because all patients gain different
      amounts to start, data will be collected for 3 months while the patients receive their usual
      amount of dietitian education. Then the patients will receive intensive (2x/month) education
      on reducing sodium intake from the dietitian and the same data will be collected to see if
      they gain less after the education. After 3 months of intensive education, data will be
      collected for one more month to see if patients keep gaining less or if they go back to their
      old patterns.</summary>
