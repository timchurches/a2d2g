  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of two fixed doses (100 mg and 30 mg once
      daily) of saredutant compared to placebo in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. The
      secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of saredutant on disability and quality of
      life in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, and to evaluate blood levels of
      saredutant.</summary>
