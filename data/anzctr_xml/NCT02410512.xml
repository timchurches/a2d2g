  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody
Treatment: drugs - MOXR0916, a humanized agonist anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody

Experimental: Dose Escalation: MOXR0916 + Atezolizumab - Cohorts of at least 3 participants each will be treated at escalating doses of MOXR0916 in combination with a fixed dose of atezolizumab to determine the MTD or maximum administered dose (MAD).

Experimental: Expansion: MOXR0916 + Atezolizumab - Approximately 250-580 participants will be enrolled in the expansion stage to better characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic variability, biomarkers of anti-tumor activity, and preliminary efficacy of MOXR0916 + atezolizumab in different cancer types.


Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody
Atezolizumab will be administered intravenously.

Treatment: drugs: MOXR0916, a humanized agonist anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody
MOXR0916 will be administered intravenously.

    <summary>This Phase Ib, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of the combination of MOXR0916 and atezolizumab in participants with locally
      advanced, recurrent, or metastatic incurable solid malignancy that has progressed after
      available standard therapy; or for which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective or
      intolerable or is considered inappropriate; or for which a clinical trial of an
      investigational agent is a recognized standard of care. Participants will be enrolled in two
      stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage.</summary>
