  <interventions>
    <interventions>A first in human, dose-escalation study in healthy subjects, using a single-dose inhalation of nebulised SM04646. The study drug is in vehicle containing 0.9% mannitol / 0.002% tyloxapol.

Multiple dosing cohorts of 4 -5 subjects will be evaluated until a maximum recommended dose is estimated or the maximum feasible dose (MFD) of 20 mg is reached. Eligible subjects will receive a single  inhalation of nebulised SM04646 inhalation solution for 10 minutes on Day 1 and observed for a total of 90 days.
The dose of SM04646 will be escalated at the following dose levels: 0.7 mg, 2.0 mg, 7.0 mg and 20.0 mg.  Eligible subjects will be dosed in a staggered fashion such that no more than two subjects will receive study medication on the same day. The first subject enrolled in study (cohort 1) will be observed for 7 days after study drug administration and data from this subject will be reviewed by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) before remaining Cohort 1 subjects are enrolled. If the first subject experiences a serious adverse event no further subjects will be enrolled.The fifth subject enrolled into cohort 1 will receive the placebo, or vehicle, nebulisation treatment.
The SRC will meet following completion  of Day 8 assessments  for subjects enrolled in each individual cohort to review accumulating  safety and tolerability data at each dose level before proceeding to the next dose level of the dose escalation. The SRC will also meet to review all dose limiting toxicities that occur throughout the study to determine if further enrolment may continue for a given cohort or if all further enrolment is to cease.

Compliance to the study protocol, applicable regulatory requirements and investigator's obligations will be monitored by Datapharm Australia Pty Ltd on behalf of the sponsor according to ICH GCP guidelines and standard operation procedures. All electronic clinical record forms will by 100% source verified against corresponding source documentation for each subject and includes but not limited to drug accountability and preparation procedures, appropriate consenting procedures and adherence to dosing procedures.. At site monitoring will be carried out according to the schedule outlined in the  monitoring plan.and includes for cause visits if need arises.

      <timepoint>7 days  of observation of subjects after study drug administration at a cohort dose level and data from these subjects has been reviewed by SRC, 

The MTD is considered exceeded for a given dose-level cohort if two or more subjects within that cohort experience a dose limiting toxicicty (DLT) that is determined to be at least possibly related to the active study treatment. If this occurs, the MTD is defined as the previous tolerated dose level administered or an intermediate dose level between the MTD and the previous tolerated dose level, should one be investigated.

If MTD is not exceeded in a dose level cohort 4 new subjects may be treated at the next higher dose level.

    <designfeatures>1) Subjects who are eligible following screening criteria will be enrolled sequentially into escalating dose cohorts of 4 to 5 subjects, with each cohort only enrolling subjects following safety review of the previous dose level by the SRC.

2) The study will include an inhalation tolerability assessment to be performed at the Screening Visit. Potential subjects will be given a placebo (vehicle) nebuliser treatment for 10 minutes to assess tolerability of the inhalation procedure and the vehicle. Subjects will not be enrolled if, in the opinion of the investigator, they are unable to tolerate and complete nebulisation for 10 minutes without significant coughing and/or will not be able to properly partake in study medication administration (inclusion criterion 5).

3) Dose limiting toxicity for this study  is defined as the following occurring within 7 days of study drug administration and at least possibly related to the study drug:
- Significant coughs during nebulisation or within 10 minutes following nebulisation. Significant cough would be characterized as causing more discomfort than a mild, easily tolerated AE, and interrupts the subjects usual daily activities or disrupts ability to deliver the test article by nebulisation.
- A Grade 2 or higher adverse event (AE) per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 
- Specific events concerning respiratory, cardiac, and oxygen saturation levels defined as Moderate or higher
- Emesis, regardless of Grade, within 24 hours of nebulisation
- A serious adverse event (SAE)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the safety and tolerability of a new experimental drug, SM04646 This is the first time that SM04646 will be administered to humans. Samumed Pacific is developing this small molecule inhibitor (SM04646) of the Wnt pathway to be used for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The  pathway is a network of switches in the body that helps to determine what cells become. 

For this study, a solution containing SM04646 will be nebulised, or made into a fine mist, for inhalation in up to 25 healthy subjects. This study will try to find out the maximum dose of SM04646 that can be safely inhaled by healthy subjects without causing a strong cough response. The purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety and activity of SM04646. to obtain information on how the body absorbs, distributes and removes the drug from the body (pharmacokinetics), blood samples will be taken to measure the concentration of the study drug over time in the body. This study will check safety by measuring heart, lungs, liver and kidney function, number of blood cells and vital signs.

Subjects will be treated with a single inhalation of study drug SM04646, on Day 1 be observed for safety for a total of 90 days.  The first subject will be administered SM04646 and observed for a minimum of 7 days. The safety of the first subject dosed will be assessed before further subjects are dosed. Subjects will be enrolled into 4 dose groups, with 4 - 5 subjects in each group. Each group will receive a single inhalation of nebulised SM04646 inhalation solution (10 minutes) at doses ranging from 0.7 mg to 20.0 mg. . Eligible subjects will be dosed in a staggered fashion such that no more than two subjects will receive study drug on the same day.
