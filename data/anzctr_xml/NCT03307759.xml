    <exclusivecriteria>1. Has had previous high dose radiotherapy (biological equivalent of &gt;30Gy in 10#) to an
             area to be treated which includes vertebral bodies (see below).

             Note: Previous high dose radiotherapy is defined as a biological equivalent dose to
             above that of 30 Gy in 10 fractions using an alpha/beta ratio (50) of 3.

             Where a patient has received radiotherapy to an equivalent or lower dose than defined
             above, stereotactic radiotherapy of the area may be considered. In doing so,
             assessment of the volume and total dose received by any overlap region must be made,
             and documented by generating a cumulative plan incorporating both the previous and
             current treatment fields. It is the treating radiation oncologist's responsibility to
             review both the current plan and the cumulative plan inclusive of previous
             radiotherapy.

          2. Has had previous thoracic radiotherapy of &gt; 36Gy within the 6 months prior to
             randomisation.

          3. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Patients with small asymptomatic or previously treated brain metastases
             may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging
             for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic
             symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of enlarging brain metastases,
             and are not using steroids for intracranial neurological symptoms at least 7 days
             prior to trial randomisation. This exception does not include leptomeningeal disease
             which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          4. Has evidence of Spinal Cord Compression.

          5. Has a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score = 7 unless lesion reviewed by a
             neurosurgical service and considered stable (see Appendix 2).

          6. Requires surgical fixation of bone lesion for stability. All surgical fixation and
             instrumentation must be completed before randomisation on study.

          7. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of randomisation.

          8. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency.

          9. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).

         10. Has a hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

         11. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to
             randomisation or who has not recovered (i.e., = Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

         12. Has diagnosed and/or treated additional malignancy within 5 years prior to
             randomisation with the exception of: curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, curatively treated early stage cervical
             cancer, breast cancer or prostate cancer with no evidence of active disease. Other
             exceptions may be considered following consultation with the principal investigator

         13. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

         15. Has had any systemic anti-cancer therapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             randomisation

         16. Has known interstitial lung disease

         17. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         18. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         19. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         20. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         21. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         22. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         23. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of randomisation. Note: Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu- Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are
             not allowed. -</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This investigator driven Phase Ib study will examine the safety, efficacy and biological
      effects of two schedules of pembrolizumab, an antibody targeted against anti-programmed cell
      death 1 (PD-1), which will be given either before or after stereotactic ablative body
