Treatment group B will receive Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) with heated humidification delivered via a heated breathing tube

Dose: Pressure for each patient will be determined via a overnight polysomnography, pressure is increased until there is no longer any sleep disordered breathing or a apnea hypopnea index less than 5. Pressure range will be between 4cmH20 and 20cmH20.

Duration:  Subjects will use treatment at a dose prescribed to treat sleep disordered breathing every time the patient sleeps for 12 months. There is no strict number of hours that the patient is required to sleep with the device, patients will use the device at each sleep session for as long as they can tolerate optimally until they awake in the morning. Range of hours will be between 0 and 12 hours usage.</interventions>
