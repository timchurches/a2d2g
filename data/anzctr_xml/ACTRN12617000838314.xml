  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will receive a single session of the BCI-PAS intervention, and a single session of a Control intervention, on different days, 7 days apart (in a randomised order). Participants will be blinded to this order. 

During a baseline testing session, electroencephalography (EEG) will be recorded using an electrode cap, while subjects perform active ankle dorsiflexion of their affected leg, in time with a visual cue. The EEG is then analysed and the peak negativity of the movement related cortical potential (MRCP) is determined. This timing is then used to inform the timing of the BCI-PAS intervention. 

The BCI-PAS intervention will be delivered by a trained Research Assistant. During the BCI-PAS intervention, the subject will complete 50 repetitions of cued active ankle dorsiflexion of the affected leg. During each repetition of ankle dorsiflexion, a single pulse of electrical stimulation (pulse width 1ms) will be delivered to the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve (via two surface electrodes placed approximately 2-5cm anterior and inferior to the head of the fibula). The intensity of the electrical stimulation will be set to the level required to produce a palpable twitch in the tibialis anterior tendon. Each pulse of electrical stimulation will be timed to arrive in the motor cortex at the point of peak negativity of the MRCP. The BCI-PAS intervention takes approximately 15 minutes, with additional time required for setting up the electrical stimulation.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control intervention will be carried out in the same way as the BCI-PAS intervention, except that the participant will not receive the electrical stimulation (a light on the electrical stimulation unit will flash on and off but no stimulation will be given). Although the control intervention uses sham electrical stimulation, the participant will still be performing active ankle movements in time with a visual cue. Thus the control is active. </comparator>

    <concealment>Prior the study a randomisation schedule will be generated to determine the order in which each of the 15 participants will receive the intervention and control. This will be held by a third party. 
Following consent, each participant will be allocated a number between 1 and 15, and then the randomisation schedule will determine the order for that participants number.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to investigate whether one session of the Brain Computer Interface-based Paired Associative Stimulation protocol can improve measures of muscle and brain function, more than an attention- and dose-matched control, in people with chronic stroke. The study will use a repeated measures cross-over design, where each participant will receive the treatment and control, 7 days apart, in a randomised order.
