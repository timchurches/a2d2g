  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomized to the Honey arm of the trial will receive best practice of care, and in addition, swirl 20 mL of pure Comvita Manuka Honey in their mouth to coat the oral cavity three times a day from the moment they start radiation therapy treatment till 4 weeks after completion of treatment (end of the trial).</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomized to the control group receive best practice of care. This will vary for the different centres from using a dilute bicarbonate soda mouthwash, dilute salt mouth washes to difflam or oral balance. Different radiation oncologists will recommend different options. All of these will be considered best practice of care. All will recommend good oral hygiene, using a soft tooth brush, a fluoride tooth paste, avoiding hot spicey foods, alcohol and tobacco.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total mucositis scores. Mucositis scores will be done using a validated scoring system (Epstein et al., 2001). Basically the oral cavity will be divided into 14 anatomical sites and each site is scored 0-4 (O: no change, 1: erythema&lt;50% of area, 2: erythema &gt;50% of area, 3: single ulcer&lt;1cm, 4: multiple ulcers or single ulcer&gt;1cm). Scoring will be done by a radiation therapist who will have received appropriate training for this.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mucositis scores will be done 3 times a week during the entire radiation therapy (RT) treatment. After completion of treatment 2 more assessments will be done: at 2 and 4 weeks after completion of radiation therapy (RT) treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dose/time to first sign of oral mucositis. This will be measured as the dose that has resulted in the first sign of mucositis as determined by the mucositis scoring system explained previously.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mucositis will be scored as for key primary outcome three times a week for the duration of RT treatment; we expect to see the dose accumulation reaching measurable levels of mucositis 1-2 weeks after starting radiation therapy (RT) treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight measurements will be done using the same weight scales in the hospital department</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weight will be measured before start of the trial, weekly during the trial and at the completion of the trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life, using validated QOL questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3) and the EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35)</outcome>
      <timepoint>QOL will be measured before start of the trial, fortnightly during the trial and at the completion of the trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composition of oral microflora. This will be assessed by DNA/DNA hybridization checkerboard techniques.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Oral flora composition will be measured by taking small micro swabs of the ventral surface of the tongue, before RT treatment, 3 weeks after start of RT treatment, at completion of RT treatment and 4 weeks after completion of RT treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Radiation therapy to the head and neck aims to eradicate tumour cells and, in addition, can damage the lining of the mouth, varying from reddening to blistering and ulceration (oral mucositis). Although these reactions are temporary and are usually resolved over time, they can affect patients ability to eat, drink and talk, compromising their quality of life. In extreme cases, radiation treatment has to be postponed, jeopardizing tumour control and survival. There is currently no standard treatment for oral mucositis. Recently three small clinical trials have suggested that honey reduces the extent of oral mucositis in head and neck patients. 
The proposed trial aims to test these claims in 120 head and neck patients, randomized to either treatment or control group. The treatment group will use Comvita Manuka Honey three times a day throughout the trial, whilst the control group will use a standard bicarbonate soda mouthwash three times a day. The extent of mucositis will be assessed three times a week in all patients during treatment, and 2 and 4 weeks after completion of treatment. Weight will be assessed weekly and quality of life forthnightly during treatment, and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment completion.</summary>
