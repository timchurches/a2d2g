  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparison between 2 groups.

First group will be randomised to receive intramuscular Aripiprazole (long-acting injectable) 400mg every 4 weeks.  Subjects who experience adverse effect to this dose will receive a lower dose of 300mg 4-weekly.

The second (comparator) group will receive any other intramuscular long-acting injectable antipsychotics, including (but not limited to) Risperidone, Olanzapine, Paliperidone, Fluphenazine, Zuclopenthixol Flupenthixol.

All subjects enrolled in either group will go through a 3 month stabilisation period, to ensure they are able to tolerate the medications without adverse effects, and they remain stable (no relapse requiring hospitalisation).  During this period subjects receive their usual dose of respective long-acting injectable antipsychotic at the appropriate intervals.  Randomisation will occur PRIOR to the 3-month stabilisation period.  Allocated intervention will become the participants' usual antipsychotic throughout the trial, which is for 6 months post-stabilisation period.  

Following the completion of trial, patients on both groups will continue on the respective medications they are receiving.  Any adjustments to medications made following the trial period will be solely at the discretion of the treating clinician, on clinical grounds.

Intervention adherence is assessed through monthly monitoring (i.e. attendance to the depot clinic).  Failure of attendance will be followed up by the clinical team (comprising of nurse and psychiatrist) to preserve treatment adherence.  Failure to adhere to the regular regimen of the respective medication they are receiving will result in dropout.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients with schizophrenia who are on any other antipsychotics, except Clozapine

The second (comparator) group will receive any other intramuscular long-acting injectable antipsychotics, including (but not limited to) Risperidone, Olanzapine, Paliperidone, Fluphenazine, Zuclopenthixol Flupenthixol.  This group will consist of patients who are already on any other long-acting injectable antipsychotic, or on no antipsychotic.  If they are not on any antipsychotic, and require one, they will be administered one based on the clinical decision of the treating clinician, as part of the provision of clinical care.

    <statisticalmethods>Total study period of 39 weeks (9 months) consisting of a 12-week (3 month) stabilization period, followed by a 26-week (6 months) study active duration.  During the stabilization period, ineligible or unstable patients are excluded from the study.  The outcome variables will be measured at baseline at start of the study (after the 3-month stabilization period) and at the end of the 6-month study active period.
Summary statistics will be in the form of means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables, medians and interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables.
Interim analysis is done at the end of 13-weeks.
The null hypothesis is that of no difference in QoL scores between the experimental and control groups.  The alternative hypothesis that will be tested is that there is a difference in QoL scores between the two groups.  Following checks for statistical assumptions, the difference in mean QoL scores between the treatment groups will be tested through an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to detect any statistical significance at the 0.05 level.  The difference between QoL scores at the end of the study will be compared, using the baseline QoL measurement as covariate. The results will be used to inform future sample size calculations.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date there has been no documented research on patients cared for in a depot clinic of a private setting (i.e. outside the public mental health sysytem) in Australia.   This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a RCT on the Quality of Life (QoL) amongst schizophrenia patients receiving Abilify Maintena and other anti-psychotics, as managed in a Private Depot Clinic.
   
This study aims to evaluate the benefits of Abilify Maintena in the private specialist setting, independent of the public health service.  This will ultimately validate the hypothesis that it can improve Quality of Life of patients, and achieve significant cost savings for the public services, thereby validating increased use of Abilify Maintena in the community.
