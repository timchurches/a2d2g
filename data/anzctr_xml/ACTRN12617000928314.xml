Intravenous (IV) brincidofovir (BCV) 10 mg or IV placebo administered over 2 hours, twice per week (BIW)-3 active and 1 placebo. Subjects in BIW cohorts will be dosed on Day 1, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 11 (i.e., 1.5 weeks).

IV BCV 20 mg or IV placebo administered over 2 hours, once a week (QW)-6 active and 2 placebo.  Subjects in QW cohorts will be dosed on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 (i.e., 3 weeks).

IV BCV 20 mg or IV placebo administered over 1 hour, QW-6 active and 2 placebo. Subjects in QW cohorts will be dosed on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 (i.e., 3 weeks)

IV BCV 20 mg or IV placebo administered over 1 or 2 hours, BIW-6 active and 2 placebo. Subjects in BIW cohorts will be dosed on Day 1, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 11 (i.e., 1.5 weeks). The 1 or 2 hour infusion time will be determined by the Sponsor and Principal Investigator following safety and PK review from previous cohorts. 

All doses will be administered in the study clinic and will be recorded in the case report form.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the safety and tolerability following multiple ascending doses of BCV administered IV in healthy adult subjects

Clinical and laboratory safety parameters including: adverse events (AEs), absolute and changes over time of hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, and ECG intervals</outcome>
      <timepoint>All participants will attend a screening visit up to 4 weeks prior to study start. Screening assessments will include a medical review and physical exam, blood safety tests, drug and alcohol screening, and pregnancy and hormone testing where applicable. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, temperature) and ECGs (heart tracings)
will be recorded.

On study details are as follows:
- Once weekly dose groups: Two 2- night stays at clinic and 18 clinic visits, over approximately 36 days.
- Twice weekly dose groups: Two 2-night stays at clinic and 12 clinic visits, over approximately 25 days.

While on study participants will receive trial medication,  have blood and urine collected, undergo medical reviews, and have ECGs and vital signs recorded.

Subjects in BIW cohorts will have blood collected on Day -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 18, 21 and 25; ECGs on Day -1, 1, 4, 8, 11, and 25; Vital Signs on Day -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 25.

Subjects in QW cohorts will have blood collected on Day -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19,  21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 32, and 36; ECGs on Day -1, 1, 8, 15, 22, and 36; Vital Signs on Day -1, 1, 2, 7, 8, 14, 15, 21. 22, 23, and 36.


</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize plasma BCV and cidofovir (CDV) PK, and intracellular (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) CDV-PP PK following multiple doses of BCV administered IV in healthy adult subjects.

Subjects will be dosed with BCV or placebo.  BCV is a lipid conjugate of the nucleotide analog cidofovir (CDV).  Following dosing, BCV is converted to CDV and cidofovir diphosphate (CDV-PP), therefore CDV is also measured.


Plasma BCV will be assessed for Cmax, Tmax, Tlag, AUCt, AUClast, AUCinf, %AUCextrap, Clast, Tlast, t1/2, CL, Vz, and Vss following Dose 1 and Dose 4.

Plasma CDV will be assessed for Cmax, Tmax, Tlag, AUCt, AUClast, AUCinf, %AUCextrap, Clast, Tlast, and t1/2 following Dose 1 and Cmax, Tmax, AUCt, and t1/2 following Dose 4.

 Intracellular (PBMC) CDV-PP will be assessed for Cmax, Tmax, AUCt, following Dose 1 and Cmax, Tmax, AUCt, and t1/2 following Dose 4.

Plasma BCV, CDV, and intracellular (PBMC) CDV-PP will be assessed for Cmax (Doses 1 and 4), AUCinf (Dose 1) and AUCt (Dose 4) for dose proportionality; if AUCinf is not well estimated AUClast will be subject to dose proportionality assessment.

Plasma BCV, CDV, and intracellular (PBMC) CDV-PP will be assessed for Cmax accumulation ratio (RCmax), observed accumulation ratio (Ro; Dose 4 AUCt/Dose 1 AUCt), predicted accumulation ratio (Rp; Dose 1 AUCinf/Dose 1 AUCt), and steady-state accumulation ratio (Rs; Dose 4 AUCt/Dose 1 AUCinf) where possible.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 hour - BIW - Study Day 1, 11 and 1 hour - QW - Study Day 1, 22: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours post start if infusion

2 hours - BIW - Study Day 1, 11 and 2 hours - QW - Study Day 1, 22:  pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours post start of infusion

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is the second clinical study administering a new intravenous formulation of BCV. BCV has been studied in hundreds of patients as an oral formulation for the treatment of adenovirus and for the treatment and prevention of cytomegalovirus following stem cell transplantation. This second IV BCV study will investigate the safety and tolerability following multiple ascending doses to healthy subjects to observe how the new formulation compares to placebo and the oral formulations.</summary>
