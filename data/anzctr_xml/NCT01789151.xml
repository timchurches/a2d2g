  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preliminary data following a pilot study from our institution confirms the ability of
      99mTc-glucosamine (99mTc-ECDG) to differentiate between active, subclinical and quiescent
      disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma lung, and vasculitis. We propose
      to extend these findings and further evaluate this imaging modality for its clinical utility,
      limitations, and application.

      An unacceptably high level of morbidity exists amongst patients suffering from rheumatic
      disease. This is often the result of mild disease being missed or misdiagnosed, and therapy
      inordinately delayed or inappropriate. The currently used therapeutic agents themselves have
      associated side-effects adding to unfavourable clinical outcomes. There is therefore a need
      for a superior, less expensive and more easily accessible imaging modality to assess the
      degree of inflammation to guide the clinician. Glucosamine is absorbed and metabolised in a
      manner not too dissimilar to that of glucose, and it can be readily labelled to form
      99mTc-ECDG. Scans can be acquired within 3 hours of intravenous administration of this agent,
      accurately depicting sites of active inflammation/disease.

      HYPOTHESIS Glucose is a vital cellular substrate that accumulates at inflamed tissues because
      of the greater metabolic needs of the cells during active disease. Glucosamine, being an
      analogue of glucose, is metabolised more quickly in inflamed than non-inflamed tissue and
      thus 99mTc-ECDG scintigraphy like 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG-PET) scintigraphy allows for
      detection of active inflammation. Unlike current bone scans this agent has the sensitivity to
      detect subclinical inflammatory disease that would in turn provide essential information to
      ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.</summary>
