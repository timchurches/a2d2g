  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sympathetic activation is a hallmark of end-stage renal disease and adversely affects
      cardiovascular prognosis. Hypertension is present in the vast majority of these patients and
      plays a key role in the progressive deterioration of renal function and in the exceedingly
      high rate of cardiovascular events. Selective catheter-based renal denervation has been shown
      to be safe and effective in attaining improved and sustained blood pressure control in
      patients with resistant hypertension and normal renal function. The investigators hypothesize
      that catheter-based renal denervation is a safe and effective intervention to achieve
      sustained reduction in sympathetic nerve activity, BP and target organ damage in hypertensive
      End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients, which will result in improved cardiovascular
      outcomes.</summary>
