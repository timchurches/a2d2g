    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Independent Radiology Review (IRR) by Treatment Arm - PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (by IRR) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occured first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. PFS (in months) was calculated as (first event date - randomization date +1)/30.44.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization to objective progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (up to 35 months)</timepoint>

      <outcome>Objective Response Rate - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response as Assessed by IRR - Percentage of participants with objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DR) Based on IRR - DR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), as determined by the IRR, to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. DR (in weeks) was calculated as (first date of PD or death - first date of CR or PR +1)/7. DR was only calculated for the subgroup of participants with an objective tumor response. The median duration of response presented in below table was based on Brookmeyer and Crowley method.</outcome>

      <outcome>Time to Tumor Response (TTR) Based on IRR - TTR was defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) as determined by the IRR.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at Week 12 Based on IRR - Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 12 weeks is defined as the percent of participants with CR, PR or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the IRR.

All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease.

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs; All Causalities) - An AE was an untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or that worsen in severity after the first dose of study medication. AEs were to be collected from first dose until 28 days after the last dose of study medication. SAEs could be collected after this timeframe if considered to be treatment related. Grade 3 and 4 AEs in below table indicated severe AE and life-threatening consequences respectively; Grade 5 indicated death due to AE. Chemotherapy group in the below table includes data before crossover to crizotinib for participants who crossed over to receive crizotinib.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent AEs (Treatment Related) - An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study treatment in a participant who received study treatment. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs were to be collected from first dose until 28 days after the last dose of study medication. SAEs could be collected after this timeframe if considered to be treatment related.

Only those participants whose tissue sample was positive for the ALK gene fusion by FISH testing by the central laboratory were allowed to enter the study.

      <outcome>Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Pain in Chest, Dyspnea, or Cough - TTD in pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough from the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-LC13) was a composite endpoint defined as the time from randomization to the earliest time the participant's scale scores showed a 10 point or greater increase after baseline in any of the 3 symptoms. For those who had not shown deterioration, the data was censored at the last date when the participants completed an assessment (QLQ-LC13) for pain, dyspnea, or cough or at last visit date prior to crossover for participants randomized to chemotherapy who subsequently crossed over to crizotinib. A 10-point or higher change in the score was perceived by participants as clinically significant. The median TTD mentioned in below table was based on Brookmeyer and Crowley method.</outcome>

Scale score range: 0 to 100. Higher symptom score = greater degree of symptom severity.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in General Health Status as Assessed by EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D)- Visual Analog Scale (VAS) - The EQ-5D is a validated and reliable self-report preference-based measure developed by the EuroQoL Group to assess health-related quality of life. It consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and a visual analogue scale-the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system measures a participants' health state on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels, reflecting "no health problems," "moderate health problems," and "extreme health problems." The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</outcome>
