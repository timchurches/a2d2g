  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Handwriting performance is often impaired after a stroke. Although task-specific upper limb practice can improve outcomes, the effectiveness of adult handwriting retraining has not been investigated. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a 4-week retraining program to improve handwriting performance using a pilot randomised trial design. Concealed allocation, blinded assessors and intention to treat analysis will be used. A community sample of 20 people with stroke will be randomly allocated to receive either 4 weeks of tailored handwriting retraining with twice weekly coaching sessions at home, or usual care. Outcomes will be obtained by a blinded assessor at baseline, and 4 weeks and 3 months post-intervention.</summary>
