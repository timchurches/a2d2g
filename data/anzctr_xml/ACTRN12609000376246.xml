  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Kidney stones [renal colic] can be a very painful condition.  Current recommendations suggest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents [e.g. ketorolac, indomethacin] as first line treatment, although it is recognised that many patients also need strong painkillers such as morphine.  A recent report has suggested that anti-histamine drugs [such as promethazine] may also be effective.  The aim of this study is to compare the combination of promethazine/ indomethacin/ morphine against indomethacin/ morphine on the amount of pain reported and total dose of morphine needed for patients with kidney stone pain.</summary>
