  <interventions>
    <interventions>BIT225, 400mg oral, once daily on days 1 and 10, and twice daily on days 2 to 9. BIT225 is supplied as a powder to be suspended immediately before use in 25mL of OraSweet Sugar Free, a taste masking solution.  After administration the patient will be asked to drink 240mL of non-carbonated water, which is poured into the dosing cup and swirled around to collect the remaining powder, before drinking.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the safety and tolerability of 400mg BIT225 twice daily compared to placebo in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection that are antiretroviral niave.  Safety and tolerability will be assessed by comparison to placebo of treatment emergent untoward medical changes, e.g. nausea, vomitting or loss of weight,  and changes in clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and ECG.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluated daily over 10 days dosing, and continuing to day 20 (10 days post dose).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 400mg BIT225 administered daily on days 1 and 10, and twice daily on days 2 to 9 (for 10 consecutive days) in patients with HIV-1 infection</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on Days 1, 2 and 5, then on days 10, 11 and 12.  The concentration of BIT225 in plasma will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. 
On days 1 and 10 samples will be collected 30-60 minutes pre-dose, then 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes, and 3 and 4 hours  post dose.  On day 10 additional samples will be taken at 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours post dose. On days 2 and 11 a sample will be taken at 24 hours post dose.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Biotron is developing a novel inhibitor of HIV-1, called BIT225.  This early phase trial will assess the safety of BIT225 in patients with HIV-1 infection who have not received any other therapy for HIV-1. It will also assess how well BIT225 is tolerated, the level of BIT225 in the blood following oral administration, and how well BIT225 performs at reducing HIV-1 levels in the blood.</summary>
