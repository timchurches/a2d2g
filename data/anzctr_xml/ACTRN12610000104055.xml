    <interventions>Group 1 Ear Acupuncture: insertion of Vinco press needles into 2 predefined auricular acupuncture points on ear ipsilateral to site of injury upon presentation to emergency care centre. These points have been traditionally used to treat pain and anxiety.Ear is then covered with an opaque bandage and needles are left in for a minimum of 15 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2 Sham Acupuncture:  insertion of Vinco press needles into 2 predefined auricular acupuncture points on ear ipsilateral to site of injury upon presentation to emergency care centre. These points have been traditionally used to treat stomach problems.Ear is then covered with an opaque bandage and needles are left in for a minimum of 15 minutes.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Sequentially numbered opaque envelopes will be used . These are generated for each site before patient recruitment begins. As there are 3 study groups (Group 1,Group 2, Group 3) there are 3 corresponding ear diagrams which will be placed into the sequentially numbered opaque envelopes based on the outcome of the random number table. Group 1 shows ear acupuncture points used for pain and anxiety. Group 2 shows ear acupuncture points unrelated to pain or anxiety. Group 3 shows no points.
 Once informed consent is obtained, the Researcher A will allocate the participant to the next sequential study number, the envelope will be opened and Researcher A will carry out the needle insertions and/or bandaging based on the diagram.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain and anxiety are a common problem in patients presenting to emergency centres with wrist and hip injuries. Previous studies overseas have shown that ear acupuncture has the potential to help decrease pain and anxiety in these patients. Our study aims to see if ear acupuncture given in conjunction with normal pain relief, gives greater benefit than pain relief alone.</summary>
