  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a pre-screening study.
Patients will be evaluated over time to evaluate transfusion history, levels of ongoing hemolysis (i.e., LDH and Hgb), and Quality of Life (QoL) assessments to establish a baseline.
In addition, patients will be interviewed one time during the study by an independent outcomes researcher to collect their experience of PNH, its impact on everyday lives and the disease trajectory. Although no exact timing has been specified, this single interview will be completed once the patient is entered into the study. Patients who have not been vaccinated against N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae will receive vaccinations and patients who have been previously vaccinated will receive recommended boosters during this study.

Patients will be evaluated every 2 weeks during this study until entry into the ACH471-100 treatment study. There is no specific length of time that the patients will participate in this screening study. It is expected patients who are willing and eligible to participate in the ACH471-100 Treatment Study to enrol once the treatment study becomes operational in the first half of 2017 and any required vaccinations have been completed. It is anticipated that most patients will be in this screening study for 2 or 3 months.

Any patients who do not have a sufficient vaccination history will receive vaccines during this study against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y and W135, N. meningitidis serogroup B, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenza (per the respective marketed product information).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multiple-center screening study designed to obtain baseline information before a patient enters into the Achillion treatment Study ACH471100. Patients will be evaluated over time to evaluate transfusion history, levels of ongoing hemolysis (i.e., LDH and Hgb), and Quality of Life (QoL) assessments to establish a baseline.
Patients will have an initial visit and procedures to confirm their eligibility for this study and, subsequently, the ACH471-100 treatment study. In addition, the status of their vaccinations against N. meningitidis (quadrivalent ACWY and serogroup B), H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae will be determined.
Once entered into this screening study, patients will be evaluated every 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) by the Principal Investigator (PI). In addition, patients will  have LDH and Hgb measured every 2 weeks (+/- 3 days) following their visit to the investigational site; these laboratory tests can be drawn either at the investigational site or at a laboratory local to the patient..
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT) Fatigue Scale (Version 4) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaires will be administered to patients during this study to collect baseline health-related QoL information.
In addition, patients will be interviewed by an independent outcomes researcher selected by the Sponsor once during the study to collect their experience of PNH, its impact on everyday lives and the disease trajectory. Interviews will be conducted over the phone by a trained, experienced interviewer and will last approximately 30 minutes.
Patients who have not been vaccinated against N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae will receive vaccinations and patients who have been previously vaccinated will receive recommended boosters during this study.</summary>
