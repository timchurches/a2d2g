The purpose of the study is to find out whether vaccination of stem cell donors with Zostavax can reduce the infection rate of shingles in transplant recipients. In this study, stem cell donors over the age of 50 years will be eligible to receive the vaccine.
Donor will receive vaccination once only by the subcutaneous route (0.65mL shot).
Stem Cell Donor will be followed up for 1 week after the vaccination for any adverse reaction. This is approved vaccine for normal healthy population who could  also be  stem cell donor.
Stem Cell  recipients will be followed up for 12 months after the transplant.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>Donor will receive a live Varicella Zoster vaccine by the subcutaneous route 4 to 6 weeks prior to stem cell collection. The vaccine contains live virus that has been treated to reduce its ability to cause infection.  10 mls of blood will be collected before the vaccination and at the time of stem cell collection. This study only requires up to 2 blood samples from donors.  In the great majority of cases, this does not involve any additional blood sampling since blood samples are taken at the same time as tests are done for normal clinical care for the stem cell transplant. Recipient's blood will be sampled at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for VZV induced proliferation.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This investigator driven pilot study aims to determine whether vaccination of stem cell donors with Zostavax can reduce the rate of Herpes Zoster reactivations in transplant recipients. As we know, infection is a leading cause of morbidity among allogenic transplant patients. Varicella zoster virus reactivation is one of the commonest infections occurring following allogeneic transplant. Primary varicella infection in transplant recipients can cause serious widespread and sometimes fatal viral infection. Reactivation of Varicella known as herpes zoster or shingles can cause rash and severe prolonged pain known as neuralgia. Shingles typically presents as a localised skin rash. The most common complication of shingles is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Individuals who suffer from PHN report constant burning, throbbing, and intermittent sharp or electric shock-like pain. In a patient already recovering after chemoradiotherapy, primary varicella infection, shingles and PHN can markedly impair quality of life. ZOSTAVAX vaccine has been approved in Australia for the prevention of shingles and its complications in people 50 years of age and older. The purpose of the study is to find out whether vaccination of stem cell donors with Zostavax can reduce the infection rate of shingles in transplant recipients. We hypothesise that boosted immunity in these donors may transfer to recipients at the time of stem cell infusion and reduce the rate of shingles after transplant. Normal donors (Stem Cell Donors) over the age of 50 years will be eligible to receive the vaccine. Donors will receive vaccination once only by the subcutaneous route and be followed up for 1 week for any adverse reaction. We would report any adverse  event among the stem cell donor related to vaccine to the Therapeutic Goods Administration via the "Blue Card" . Stem Cell recipients will be followed up for 12 months after their transplant.</summary>
