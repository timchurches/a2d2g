    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potentially eligible participants will be identified on the wards and invited to take part in the study. Patients can be recruited at any time during their medical admission; however the study visit should be timed to deliver the nebuliser regimen as close as possible to the time of the next prescribed bronchodilator dose. Written Informed consent will take place prior to any study specific procedures. The allocated intervention will be stored in an opaque sealed envelope and opened at the time of randomisation by the un-blinded investigator. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be 1:1 via a block randomised computer generated sequence, provided by the study statistician independent of recruitment and assessment of participants. Participants recruited will be stratified in to groups that were receiving oxygen immediately prior to randomisation or those that were not. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be by intention to treat. Our primary analysis is ANCOVA with PtCO2 as the response variable, and randomised treatment and baseline PtCO2 as co-variates. For other continuous outcome variables we will also use similar ANCOVA. Exploratory analyses for PtCO2, heart rate and SpO2 taken at five minute intervals will be presented graphically and analysed by mixed linear models.

SAMPLE SIZE
A difference in PaCO2 of 4 mmHg represents a physiologically significant change. In our controlled study of oxygen versus air driven nebulisers in stable COPD (Edwards et al) the standard deviation of PtCO2 was 5.5. With 90% power and alpha of 5% this requires a total of 82 patients to detect a 4 mmHg difference. We anticipate a drop-out rate of &lt;10% so our target recruitment is 90 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A parallel group double blinded randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of air versus oxygen driven bronchodilator nebulisation on PaCO2, pH and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD.
