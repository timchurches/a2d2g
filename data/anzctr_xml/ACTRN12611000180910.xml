  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the Ecstasy Check Up Plus study sessions, we explore ecstasy use and values, offer feedback regarding use and provide with practical skills for reducing use. It is the decision of the participant to use these skills or not, and they are not pressured to quit or reduce their ecstasy use.  

Participants are randomised into either one 50 minute session of motivational interviewing based discussion or three once-weekly 50 minute sessions which are conducted by a trained psychologist.  The second and third sessions are based on cognitive behavioural and motivational interviewing discussion.  All sessions are conducted face to face at our offices.

The one-session motivational discussion is the same that is being assessed in a similar ANZCTR registered study (	ACTRN12611000136909).</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the Ecstasy Check Up Plus study will be randomly allocated to either 50 minute session of motivational interviewing based discussion or three once-weekly 50 minute sessions which are conducted by a trained psychologist. All sessions are conducted face to face at our offices.

The first session will we will explore ecstasy use, offer you feedback regarding use and provide with practical skills for reducing your use. It is the participants decision to use the skills or not, and they are not pressured to quit or reduce their ecstasy use.  The one session group is considered the control group.</comparator>

    <concealment>Recruitment efforts will involve advertisements in the free street press and postings on a range of relevant websites. Fliers will be distributed to university campuses and music venues.  When potential participants initially make contact, they will be screened for eligibility, usually by telephone. Those who are ineligible or do not consent to participate in the study will have their details kept for reporting on the reasons for ineligibility. 

When participants appear to meet inclusion criteria, an appointment will be made for a face-to-face discussion about Ecstasy use and values. Allocation of treatment is concealed via sealed opaque envelopes. E Check Up Specialists will complete the baseline assessments to ensure that research assistants remain blind to study condition.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the proposed research is to evaluate a brief motivational interviewing discussion (Ecstasy Check-Up) for regular ecstasy users (1 session) compared with an extended series of discussions (Ecstasy Check-Up Plus), which involves 1 session of motivational interviewing based discussions plus two session of cognitive behavioural based discussions. Our long-term goal is to decrease ecstasy use in Australia by motivating ecstasy users to reduce their use through providing research based information and discussion. 

The primary hypothesis of the proposed study is that the Ecstasy Check-Up Plus will be associated with lower levels of ecstasy use and problems than will the Ecstasy Check-Up. E Check Up sessions in which the specialist more strongly adheres to motivational interviewing principles are expected to have better outcomes. 

Additionally, our secondary hypothesis is that participants in the study will like and gain some positive aspects from both conditions, regardless if they have been assigned one or three sessions of discussions on their Ecstasy use. 

The research is of benefit to participants as it offers an opportunity for them to manage their ecstasy use. This lifestyle change has many benefits including improvements in physical and mental health. This benefit, however, cannot be guaranteed; it is dependent on participants engagement with the discussion. 

At the baseline session, all participants will be assured that any information they provide will remain strictly confidential (within the limits of legal confidentiality and duty of care). After written informed consent is provided and all questions and concerns have been answered, the baseline assessment will occur.

At one-, four-, and six-month follow-ups the research assistant will conduct follow-ups with all participants using the measures collected at the baseline assessment. The outcome measures will be modified to assess the relevant durations at each visit. For example, the measures will assess the last 90 days during the baseline assessment, and the past 30-days at the one-month follow-up.</summary>
