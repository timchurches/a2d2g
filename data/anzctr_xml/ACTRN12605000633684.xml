  <interventions>
    <interventions>A frequent replacement soft contact lens that both corrects vision and simultaneously produces myopic retinal defocus will be worn monocularly for 10 months by children with progressing myopia. The fellow eye will be corrected with a standard single vision frequent replacement soft contact lens. At cross-over (after 10 months) the identity of the eyes wearing the experimental and the single vision lenses will be reversed and the lenses will be worn for a further 10 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the difference in axial myopia progression rate in the eye corrected with the experimental lens compared with the that in the eye wearing the single vision lens. </outcome>
      <timepoint> Outcome measures will be made at 5 and 10 months. The experimental lens will then be crossed over to the contralateral eye and further outcome measures will be made at 15 and 20 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure changes in axial myopia it is necessary to measure both changes in refractive error (with cycloplegic autorefraction) and changes in the axial length of the eye (with partial coherence interferometry) in both eyes.</outcome>
      <timepoint> Outcome measures will be made at 5 and 10 months. The experimental lens will then be crossed over to the contralateral eye and further outcome measures will be made at 15 and 20 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To determine the accommodative status of the participants while wearing the experimental contact lens. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurements of accommodative response will be recorded one week after contact lens fitting with the treatment lens, and at 5, 10, 15  and 20 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. To assess visual function while wearing the experimental contact lens design.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurements of visual acuity, contrast senstivity and binocular vision will be recorded at baseline, 10 and 20 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The randomly generated allocations (see sequence generation below) are contained in opaque sealed envelopes held by staff of The Univeristy of Auckland Optometry Clinic not involved in the study. As participants are recruited, the next envelope in the appropriate stratum sequence is opened and the participant assigned to the stated treatment group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects are stratified (4 strata) according to the prognostic factors of gender (male and female) and ethnicity (Asian and non-Asian) using a computer generated block-randomization programme (Clinstat, St George's Hospital Medical School, www.sgul.ac.uk/depts/phs/staff/jmb/jmbsoft.htm). Each stratum has 40 random allocations of the two treatment options (1 = experimental contact lens in the dominant eye, 2 = experimental contact lens in the non-dominant eye).</sequence>
