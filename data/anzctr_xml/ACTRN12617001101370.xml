  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will be asked to complete 3 1-hour sessions of computerised cognitive training in their home per week (BrainHQ exercises developed by Posit Science) for a 12-week period. The cognitive training battery includes 6 different tasks aimed to improve participants memory, reaction time and attention for aural and visually presented stimuli. Tasks include:

- making judgements about stimuli features
- discriminating between similar stimuli 
- matching pairs of stimuli
- remembering the order and sequences of presented stimuli 
- following instructions 
- reconstructing a narrative sequence 

Access to these tasks is through an online portal, which will allow researchers to monitor participant progress and compliance. 

In addition to the cognitive training, participants will also be randomly allocated to take one of two supplement treatments during the same 12 week period:

- Bacopa monnieri (Flordis KeenMind 160mg, each capsule containing Bacopa monnieri equivalent to dry whole plant 2.16g) to take two capsules every morning with breakfast (total dosage per day 320mg).

-2 placebo capsules containing an inert plant cellulose fibre

To monitor treatment adherence, participants will be asked to complete a treatment taking log during the 12 weeks, in which they are required to tick off each time they take a capsule. In addition, they will be asked to return all left over treatments for a researcher to calculate compliance based on the amount of unused capsules.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine if Bacopa monnieri supplementation improves brain health, cognition and well-being in older adults undergoing regular cognitive training. 36 healthy adults aged 55 years or above, will be asked to complete 3 hours of cognitive training a week for 12 weeks, while consuming either 320mg of Bacopa monnieri extract or placebo per day. Participants are asked to attend three testing sessions at Swinburne University Hawthorn campus, which includes a screening and practice visit (approx. 1.5 hours) where consent is obtained, eligibility assessed and participants familiarised with study measures and procedures, and a baseline visit and final visit (3.5 hours each, 12 weeks apart) where study outcomes are assessed. Procedures measuring treatment efficacy include brain imaging using MRI, blood collection for bio-markers of inflammation and brain health, cognitive assessment of memory, reaction time and attention, and questionnaires assessing mood and everyday functioning. </summary>
