  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be categorized at baseline by the intensive care unit (ICU) research coordinator into one of eight unique and predefined social categories for the purpose of follow up at 6months for a large randomized controlled trial. 
The categories are: 
1. Less than 65 years of age  in paid employment; 
2. Less than 65 years of age and studying; 
3. Less than 65 years of age and chronically disabled; 
4.Less than 65 years of age and environmental factors impair ability to work (socially disadvantaged).
5. 65 years of age and over - living independently without essential supports; 
6. 65 years of age and over living independently with essential supports; 
7. 65 years of age and over living in supportive accommodation.
8. Other
The research coordinator will categorize the patient within 96 hours of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) by reviewing the medical record, asking the clinical nurse or attending medical officer or other hospital personnel such as the social worker. If the family are at the bedside during assessment they may be asked.  This assessment is called the "research coordinator"  or baseline assessment. This assessment will take approximately 5 minutes to conduct.
To assess if the research coordinator has accurately categorized the patient a study investigator will conducted an interview with the patient when he or she is well enough to answer questions, which should be just before discharge from the ICU. If the patient is not well enough to answer questions about their social status then the patient's family may answer the questions for them. This assessment is called the "gold standard" assessment. The gold standard assessor will not know what category the research coordinator chose at baseline so as not to influence the answers of the interview. The gold standard assessment will take 1 - 5 minutes to complete. There are 1 to 5 questions to ask.
The 8 categories are broad enough so that patients should fall within one of them. If the patient falls into more than one category this information is collected on the data sheet. 
This feasibility study is designed specifically to see if the research coordinator can accurately and rapidly categorize patients into the 8 social categories.  If they can the study investigators will use this method for a large randomized controlled nutrition trial for patients to complete a specific questionnaire at the day 180 follow up.
Duration of this observations trial is until ICU discharge.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Recruitment goal will be set at an average of thirty patients at each site (n=120) who are eligible and survived to be discharged alive from ICU to another part of the hospital that provides less invasive care.
Our primary outcome is accuracy, defined as the fraction of patients with an exact match between the categorization at baseline and at gold standard. We wish to insure that accuracy is greater than 80%. If we observe at least 83% accuracy in a sample size of 120 completed patients, then we have greater than 80% confidence that our true accuracy is 80% or above (one-sided confidence intervals) with a two-sided p-value of 0.05. </statisticalmethods>
