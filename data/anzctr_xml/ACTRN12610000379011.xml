  <interventions>
    <interventions>5 subcutaneous injection doses (sequentially) of CEP-37251 (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) will be studied. After all 5 subcutaneous injection doses have been studied, an intravenous infusion dose of 0.3 mg/kg will be studied. At each dose level, subjects will be divided into 3 cohorts. The first cohort will consist of 2 subjects (1 subject receiving CEP-37251 and 1 subject receiving placebo), the second cohort will consist of 3 subjects (2 subjects receiving CEP-37251 and 1 subject receiving placebo), and cohort 3 will consist of 4 subjects (3 subjects receiving CEP-37251 and 1 subject receiving placebo). There will be a minimum of 30 minutes between the start of study drug administration for each subject within a cohort. Each subject in both the subcutaneous injection and intravenous infusion groups will receive one dose only. There will be a minimum of 1 week between dose administration of the 1st and subsequent cohort(s) for each dose level. There is no minumum wait time between administration of the 2nd and 3rd cohorts in each dose level. The 2nd and 3rd cohorts of a dose level can be dosed in non-sequential order and can be dosed on the same day.</interventions>
    <comparator>Buffer solution containing 36 mM citric acid, 98 mM sodium phosphate, and 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.5 (identical in color and appearance to CEP-37251 drug product) will be used as placebo.  The placebo will be provided as a 1 mL extractable volume in a 2 mL vial.
The placebo for the first 5 doses will be given as subcutaneous injection. The placebo for the 6 dose group will be given as intravenous infusion.</comparator>

      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of CEP 37251 given by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion to healthy postmenopausal women</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be continuously monitored for the occurrence of adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, immunoglobulin measurements, biochemical panel test results, vital signs measurements, 12 lead Electrocardiogram findings, physical examination findings, injection-site evaluation findings, concomitant medication usage, immunophenotyping test results, and immunogenicity test results (from baseline to end of study). Subjects will be monitored (remain) at the study site for 48hrs after dose administration.</timepoint>
