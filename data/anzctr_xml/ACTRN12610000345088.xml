      <outcome>Evaluate the effect of SCH 527123 on activity and health-related quality of life measures. Assessment include the six minute walk test and the completion of the following questionnaires: Subject Comment Card, the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, the Borg Scale and the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at baseline then after 8 and 26 weeks of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the effect of SCH 527123 on plasma and sputum inflammatory markers. Asessment will be through blood analysis and the collection of induced sputum samples.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease in which airways become thick and inflamed, making it hard to breathe. Cells in the airways make more mucus than usual, which tends to obstruct the airways, contributing to cough and difficulty getting air in and out of the lungs.  Chronic inflammation present in COPD is a complex response of the immune system that may occur for a long period of time and cause undesirable consequences in the body tissues and organs.  Inflammation may not only damage the lungs but also affect ones daily living activities.

Neutrophils are a type of white blood cells found in your lungs, that if increased, may cause lung damage. SCH 527123 is a new investigational drug that is intended to block the movement of neutrophils into the airways. Treatment with SCH 527123 may decrease the number of neutrophils in the airways which may lead to the improvement of lung function, COPD symptoms, COPD exacerbations and quality of life. Reducing the number of neutrophils in the airways may also prevent or delay the progression of disease as measured by the deterioration in lung function.

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SCH 527123 in subjects with COPD.</summary>
