  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants in the intervention group received the information related to the ten health behaviours  (physical activity, smoking, Body mass index, alcohol intake, vegetable and fruit intake, salt intake, meat intake, fish intake, avoidance of full fat milk and use of spreads other than butter)associated with the health behaviour score (Prudence Score) only. The intervention material consisted of: 
(1)	Personalised tailored feedback: The personalised tailored feedback letter encouraged the adoption of at least one further health behaviour in addition to those already being followed according to the patients Prudence Score. The decision as to which additional behaviour(s) to attempt was the patients own. All the tailored feedback to each participant was provided on the treating general practitioners letterhead using their electronic signature. 
(2)	Health Promotion Information Material: One page health promotion materials were developed and distributed only to those participants whose Prudence Score indicated they were not meeting the national guidelines for a particular behaviour. For example, participants who did not meet National Health and Medical Research Councils guidelines for vegetable intake but did meet recommendations for fruit intake received only the information sheet related to eating 5 serves of vegetables per day.
The study was a factorial trial: firstly the participants were randomised into intervention and control groups and then further randomised to two groups: 1. Receiving feedback at baseline as well as at 3 months (dual intervention and corresponding control group) 2. Receiving feedback at baseline (Single intervention and corresponding control group) 
Data were collected at 3 months after baseline to assess the effectiveness of the intervention and final data collection occurred at 12 months after baseline to measure the outcomes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group received information on other health protective behaviours (sun protection, tetanus vaccination, passive smoking, mammogram and pap smear) which were different from the ten health behaviours included in the intervention.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Each participating general practitioner produced a list of adult patients who visited the general practice in the past 6 months and vetted the list to exclude any patients according to the exclusion criteria. 
The research team sent invitation letters to participate in the study on behalf of the general practitioners. Participants were randomised after receiving completed questionnaires. 
Researcher who determined the group of an indivitual in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation was concealed as it included selecting a sequence from a random container. 
None of the participants were aware of the various study groups as data were collected on all the health behaviours from all the participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each general practitioner was used as a cluster and  participants were randomised within a list from each GP. 

Participants were randomised into four groups using a block randomisation method. From a container that contained multiple sequences and firstly a sequence was randomly selected. Further from each chosen sequence study group allocations took place as each questionnaire arrived from a patient of that particular GP.
This method was followed individually for each GP involved in the study except for participants sharing a residence, who were allocated to the same study group to avoid contamination of the intervention and control groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project '10 Small Steps' encompasses the development and evaluation of a general practice based RCT designed to improve ten lifestyle behaviours known to be associated with chronic diseases. The low-intensity intervention involved providing computer-tailored feedback, based on a health behaviour summary score, to more than 4500 adult patients recruited through 21 general practitioners in Brisbane, Australia. Participants were followed-up at 3 and 12 months. The intervention was effective in improving the health behaviour score. These findings demonstrate the potential for a low-intensity intervention to improve the adoption and maintenance of health behaviours in a primary care population and for general practice as a conduit for the primary prevention of non-communicable diseases. Although the individual behaviour changes resulting from the intervention were relatively small the health score,  'Prudence Score', which is easy to calculate and interpret, appears to be a useful tool for promoting a population-wide primary prevention strategy.</summary>
