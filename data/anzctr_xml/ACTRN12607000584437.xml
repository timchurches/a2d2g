  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Laboratory studies indicate that CYT997 is able to potently inhibit myeloma cells from patients with this condition.  Given these favourable "test tube" findings, Cytopia has decided to investigate whether CYT997, when given to patients with multiple myeloma, can improve their condition and extend survival from the disease.  The effect of CYT997 in patients will be determined from analysis of blood plasma and bone marrow samples and comparison to accepted clinical standards for response in multiple myeloma.</summary>
