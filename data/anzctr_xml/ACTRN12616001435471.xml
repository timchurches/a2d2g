  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will consist of Screening, First Treatment Period,  Second Treatment Period and Follow-up Period.

During the Screening (Visit 1) subjects will be assessed for eligibility. A Washout Period may be applicable in case subjects are currently on any pharmacologic treatment with NSAID, selective COX-2 inhibitor, or analgesics. Subjects will be asked to discontinue their OA medications during the washout period which is expected to be between 5 days (minimum) and up to 14 days (maximum) depending upon the half life of the medications.

At Visit 2, subjects will again be assessed for the OA symptoms and will enter into the First Treatment Period provided they continue to meet the study requirements. Eligible subjects will be asked to record their pain scores in the diaries and instructed to self-administer the study medication - one capsule three times a day for 7 days.

As Visit 3, subjects will again be  assessed for the OA symptoms and if eligible enter into the Second Treatment Period. Subjects will be randomised to receive either CMX-020, a CMX-020 matched placebo, celecoxib, or celecoxib-matched placebo which will be self-administered by mouth orally three times per day for 10 days. Subjects will return for final assessments at Visit 4, after which subjects will enter the Follow Up Period.

During the Follow Up Period and will be followed for 7 days before final exit from the study.

The interventional product, CMX-020, (25 mg) will be  self-administered by the subjects as an oral capsule three times per day (TID): 
- in the morning (approx. 06:00 to 08:00)
- midday (approx. 12:00 to 14:00)
- evening (approx. 19:00 to 21:00)
Subjects will take 5 capsules per dose to provide 125 mg. Subjects will be instructed to take each dose with a full glass of room temperature water. Fasting will be required for one hour before until 30 minutes after the dose.

Celecoxib will be administered to the subjects as a single capsule per dose orally to provide 200 mg.  

The date and time of each dose along with the pain scores will be recorded by the patient in the diaries.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator/ control for this trial is oral 25 mg capsule of matching placebo. Placebo is OmeRx DHA triglycerides containing mixed tocopherols.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary measure of efficacy is the change between Day 10 and Baseline of the Treatment Period in the VAS measure of pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The self reported assessment will be performed by the subject at Screening (Visit 1), immediately prior to commencement of Treatment Period 1 (Visit 2), 7 days post commencement of Treatment Period 1 (Visit 3) and 10 days post commencement of Treatment Period 2 (Visit 4).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To understand the safety profile of CMX-020 during this study. Safety parameters will include: TEAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG results.
The most common AEs from taking CMX-020 repeatedly were mild headache, nausea and gastrointestinal disorders which had been assessed clinically/ history. There have been no known/ possible SAEs associated with this study drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The safety assessments mentioned above are composite secondary outcome and will be done at Screening (Visit 1), immediately prior to commencement of Treatment Period 1 (Visit 2), 7 days post commencement of Treatment Period 1 (Visit 3) and 10 days post commencement of Treatment Period 2 (Visit 4)..
The blood pressure and pulse will be assessed by pulse oximetry while respiratory rate, physical examination will be assessed clinically. Temperature will be assessed by using a tympanic thermometer while an ECG will be recorded by an instrument which involves the placement of electrodes on the chest wall.
Blood will be collected for hematology and clinical chemistry lab assessments while urine will be collected for urinalysis.
