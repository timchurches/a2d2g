    <interventions>Please refer to Appendix A table in attachment 1 on ANZCTR record.
Following randomisation, study participants will receive either standard prescription piperacillin-tazobactam, or augmented dosing, based on an ARC Dose Optimisation Protocol . APPENDIX A-Protocol
 An 8-hr urinary creatinine clearance measured on Day 1, and then every alternate day post randomisation, will be used to optimise therapy in those patients randomised to the augmented dosing strategy.  The total duration of therapy will be at the discretion of the treating clinician, although augmented dosing will cease on Day 7, or discharge from the ICU.

In those randomised to standard prescription, this will utilise the current dosing strategies routinely employed at each participating institution. This typically involves intermittent administration of 4.5g IV piperacillin-tazobactam every 6 to 8 hours.  Optimisation of dosing on the basis of CLCR measurements is not routinely performed at either site.  Those patients randomised to the ARC Dose Optimisation protocol (See appendix 1) will commence a continuous infusion (over a 24 hour period) of their currently prescribed dose. That is, if a patient is prescribed  4.5g IV piperacillin-tazobactam every 6 hours, a bag of 250mls 0.9% Sodium Chloride will be prepared with 4 doses of 4.5g IV piperacillin-tazobactam to be administered continuously.  All patients randomised to the ARC protocol will receive the total daily antibiotic dose delivered over 24hrs in a 250ml bag of Sodium Chloride 0.9%.  
Standard care dosing is to be delivered as per each units usual drug dosing policy. Dosing is dependent on the clinicians prescription for the first study dosing period.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary:
Unbound piperacillin plasma concentration to MIC ratios determined at 24-48hrs and 120-144hrs after randomisation, and scored as a dichotomous variable (e.g. = MIC or &lt; MIC).</outcome>
      <timepoint> Determined at 24-48hrs and 120-144hrs after randomisation, and scored as a dichotomous variable.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical cure at 14-days post randomisation (scored as a categorical variable)
Clinical response will be assessed as follows:
1.	Resolution  disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the infection 
2.	Improvement  a marked or moderate reduction in the severity and/or number of signs and symptoms of infection
3.	Failure  insufficient lessening of the signs and symptoms of infection to qualify as improvement, including death or indeterminate (no evaluation possible, for any reason). 

For participants discharged from the ICU prior to the test of cure date, clinical response will be evaluated by review of the patient record for the test of cure date (midnight to midnight) as follows:
1.	Resolution  absence of any SIRS criteria attributable to infection
2.	Improvement  only 1 SIRS criterion at any one time that is attributable to infection
3.	Failure  2 or more SIRS criteria met concurrently and attributable to infection. 

If the subject has a separate episode of infection on the test of cure date, clinical response will be rated for any day (midnight to midnight) in the preceding 7 days. The best clinical response during this period will be recorded. Clinical cure is defined as follows:
1.	Resolution  absence of any SIRS criteria attributable to infection
2.	All other findings (i.e., sum of 2 and 3 above)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days post randomisation</timepoint>

      <outcome>ICU-free days at day 28 post randomisation (scored as a continuous variable) by calculating the number of days discharged from ICU to day 28 since randomisation into the study.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size

Based on 50% fT&gt;MIC being achieved in 60% of patients receiving standard dosing, and an improvement in target attainment to 90% in those receiving augmented dosing, with a power of 80%, and alpha error of 0.05, a sample size of 64 patients (32 in each group) is required.

Analysis

All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis without adjustment for baseline variables. Differences in outcome variables will be compared using t-test and Chi-Squared test as appropriate if normally distributed and using non-parametric equivalents if non-normally distributed. No interim analysis is planned. Analysis will primarily be conducted using SPSS version 17 (Chicago, IL, USA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is testing different methods for how an antibiotic can be delivered intravenously (into a vein).  In this case, intermittent administration of the antibiotic (20-30 minute infusion every 6-8 hours), is being compared with continuous delivery (over 24-hours).
Treatment of infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) represents an ongoing challenge for doctors. Successful therapy relies on early recognition of infection, and the timely application of antibiotics.  Antibiotic dosing (how much and how often we give the drug) should aim to rapidly achieve adequate antibiotic levels through out the body.  This is in order to ensure the causative pathogen (the bug causing the infection), is eradicated quickly.  This tends to be more difficult in ICU patients due to their underlying illness, and the requirement for other therapies (such as breathing support machines, fluid drips, and surgical procedures). The optimum method of delivering antibiotics is unknown, and current dosing strategies are generally based on those used outside the ICU, where patients are not as sick.
Previous research has shown that trauma patients admitted to the ICU are at high risk of developing hospital-acquired infections. Unfortunately, these can often negatively impact patient outcomes (such as length of stay in hospital). Achieving better antibiotic levels in the body, by using alternative dosing strategies, may be one way to improve these outcomes.  This is particularly the case for trauma patients being cared for in the ICU, where we know that antibiotic prescription is more difficult.  However, before simply changing prescribing habits, we need to measure how effective these new dosing methods are, in comparison to what is done routinely. 

The purpose of this research is therefore to test a new method of administering the antibiotic piperacillin-tazobactam, which will hopefully result in better levels of the drug in the bloodstream.  An ICU patient is eligible to be involved in this project, because they have suffered trauma, and their doctor has prescribed this drug, as they believe your the patient has an infection.
