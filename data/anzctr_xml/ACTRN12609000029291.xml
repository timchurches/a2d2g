  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised crossover trial to compare three continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask options. Nasal mask, using "best fit" from a variety of nasal masks with and without a chinstrap, and"best fit" from a variety of full face masks in control of CPAP pressure leak. All masks are fitted by experienced  trained nurses. Patients wear each of the three interface options consecutively for a period of one month, in a predetermined random order.Patients are instructed to wear each of the three interface options whenever sleeping (day or night) for each study month.  Data is collected for weeks 3 and 4 of use, to allow for a period of acclimatisation to each new set up.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients tried all three  interface types i.e. nasal mask, nasal and chin-strap, full face mask. The order in which they used the interfaces was randomised. Once patients had consented to trial an envelope was opened and this contained a piece of paper with the mask sequence written upon it.</concealment>
    <sequence>We determined that at least 40 participants were required to give sufficient power to the study  and allowing for a number of dropouts that we needed to enrol at least 54 patients. Equal numbers of the six possible combinations for order of mask use were  printed on slips of paper. These were folded and placed into sealed envelopes by one researcher and   then numbered for order of use by another .</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Each type of interface was used for a period of 4 weeks and then patients were reviewed and the interface changed. The specific style and brand of interface for each type was varied and chosen for best fit/seal.  Only one chinstrap was  used. CPAP compliance and leak data collated for weeks 3 and 4 of each mask used so that patients had a 2 week acclimatisation period for each new interface type.
Patients completed a mask satifaction questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness score at each reveiw.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for OSA. The CPAP pressure is delivered via a mask worn over the nose or the nose and mouth. If air leaks from the mouth or around the mask  whilst being used, the treatment is not as effective  and the patient may find it uncomfortable and not use it. We have two options to control mouth leaks , add a chinstrap to a nasal mask or change to a full face mask.We do not know which is the best option.  The full face mask may leak more and is more expensive but the chin strap may not work. 
Also patients may find that one option is easier to use and more comfortable.</summary>
