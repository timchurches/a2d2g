  <interventions>
    <interventions>A Gamified and Non-Gamified version of the Mindfulness etool will be evaluated by young Australians (16 -25) who have regular access to a computer or smartphone, and are experiencing at least a mild to moderate level of distress. The outcome variables, psychological distress, emotional and psychological wellbeing, mindful attention awareness and frequency of mindful behaviours, will be assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks follow-up for all participants.

The mindfulness e-tool will be in the form of an existing website ("Smiling Mind"), which has been adapted for gamification for some participants. Gamified elements include  earning points and badges and accessing new levels. For non-gamified users, the existing mindfulness audio exercises and information will be available. 

The mindfulness exercises available to all participants are audio exercises which guide participants through meditation, breathing exercises, body scans and other techniques which are designed to increase mindfulness. Mindfulness has been shown to alleviate symotoms of depression, stress, anxiety, addiction and to improve wellbeing.

Participants in the Gamification Mindfulness group and Non-Gamification Mindfulness group will be asked to trial one of two versions of the Mindfulness etool for 6 weeks. During this time data will be collected about the use of the Mindfulness etool (including the number of times it was used; the date, time and duration of each session of use; and the sections of the website accessed and data entered). Participants will also be requested to provide feedback on the objective and subjective quality and acceptability of the etool after 6 weeks of use and again at each follow-up. 

Participants will be able to access the etool as many times as they want within the 6 week period after receiving access. Once receiving access participants will receive weekly SMS/email reminders to use the etool.</interventions>
    <comparator>Delayed-acess control group: one third of participants will be randomly allocated to a wait-list control, and will receive access to the gamified version of the mindfulness etool after the 6 week follow up. </comparator>
