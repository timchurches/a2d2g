  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pre-operative intervention involving review of diabetes treatment, medication and diet. Each person will be assessed by the consultant endocrinologist and their management tailored accordingly by the diabetes nurse consultant and dietician. The pre-operative intervention will occur from their visit to the pre-admission clinic to the time of their six week post-operative visit to out-patients (a total of 12 weeks approximately).</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: this usually means that diabetic patients are only seen following referral after their cardiac operation as required.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HbA1c- this is assessed every 12 weeks by a venous sample blood test (glycosylated haemoglobin). A pre-operative test 6 weeks before cardiac surgery and a repeat 6 weeks after surgery will allow a comparison of HbA1c levels to be made.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks post operatively. The follow-up is one visit at six-weeks after cardiac surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mastery of diabetes using the Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form questionnaire (DES-SF)</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A blinded, randomisation protocol (using SPSS 14.0) via Preventative Cardiology at the Baker Heart Research Institute, will allocate eligible patients to the study intervention or usual care (on a 1:1 basis) after successful screening (HbA1c results required to ensure the level is not above 10%) and enrolment into the study. Randomisation will only occur after informed consent has been obtained from eligible patients and via a blinded protocol using sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation by using a randomisation table from a statistic book</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Randomisation is based on HbA1c levels and those with a level above 10% will not be randomised but automatically seen by the Diabetes team (due to the unacceptably high HbA1c levles).</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a pre-operative clinical medical and educational intervention will improve outcomes after cardiac surgery (such as reduced wound infections through improved glycaemic control). This will be done by providing a rapid clinical assessment and management of patients with diabetes prior to their cardiac surgery.</summary>
