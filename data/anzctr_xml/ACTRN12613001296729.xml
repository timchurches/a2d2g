  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 200 mg BIT225 BID, compared with placebo, in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV for 12 consecutive weeks in patients with genotype 1 or genotype 3 chronic HCV infection,  that are treatment naive to antiviral treatment with RBV and/or Interferon (IFN).  Safety and tolerability will be assessed by comparison to placebo of treatment emergent untoward medical changes, e.g. nausea, vomiting, headache, and changes in clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs and ECG measures.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical changes, vital signs and ECG measures will be evaluated on Days 2, 5, 7, 10, 14 and then weekly to Week 12. Laboratory changes will be evaluated Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12.  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the antiviral activity of 200 mg BIT225 BID for 12 consecutive weeks in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV in patients with chronic HCV infection that are treatment-naive to antiviral treatment with RBV and/or IFN.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for HCV RNA assays will be collected at Screening, Days 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 14, Weeks 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, plus in follow-up at Weeks 16, 24, 36, 48 60 and 72.  HCV viral load will be determined by the Cobas Ampliprep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test (Roche Diagnostics).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 200 mg BIT225 BID administered for 12 consecutive weeks in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV in patients with chronic HCV infection. </outcome>
      <timepoint>A sub-group of 15 participants will participate in the intensive PK sub-study.  PK samples will be collected at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours post dose Day 1 and Week 12 (Day 84).
PK samples will also be collected from all participants pre-dose on Days 2, 7, and Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 12.  These samples will be used to determine the trough plasma concentration of BIT225, as well as tracking compliance to dosing.
The concentration of BIT225 in the plasma will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>BIT225, in powder formulation, has been shown to be generally well tolerated over 28 days of dosing, when given in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV.  BIT225 was effective in reducing viral load in HCV genotypes 1a and 1b.  A new capsule formulation has been developed. This trial will extend the examination of BIT225, in capsule formulation, to include a longer duration of BIT225 treatment for HCV genotype 1, and includes HCV genotype 3 patients, as there is an unmet need in the population.</summary>
