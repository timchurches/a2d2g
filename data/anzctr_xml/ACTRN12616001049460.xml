  <interventions>
    <interventions>Heat conditioning: 
Location: School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences aquatic facility (University of Otago, Dunedin, NZ). Heat sessions will be supervised by the PI and/or a research fellow, both first aid trained. Attendance will be recorded at each session by the supervising researcher.
Exposure: Participants will be seated in a spa bath at ~38 degrees C for progressive duration (see below). Following the spa bath, heat stress will be maintained for 15-30 min using long-sleeved/legged clothing with gentle callisthenic exercise (3 days/week) or seated rest in clothing for other 2 days/week. Callisthenics will be performed in temperate environment (~21 degrees C) using an elastic resistance band incorporating a range of exercises utilising all muscle groups. Contractions will be performed for 1 min followed by 1 min rest (seated or standing). Callisthenics will be performed at an average rate of perceived exertion of 16/20 (Borg scale).

Exposure time will progress as follows, if tolerable to increase: 
Week 1: 15 min spa + 30 min callisthenics 3 days/week (3 exposures)
Week 2: 20 min spa + 30 min callisthenics 3 days/week and 20 min spa + 30 min warm rest 1 day/week (4 exposures)
Week 3-6: 25 min spa + 30 min callisthenics 3 days/week and 25 min spa + 30 min warm rest 2 days/week (5 exposures)

Dosage: After six weeks, if the primary outcome is achieved (&gt;=100% increase in 6 min walking distance), participants will be randomised to either continue this dosage or reduce frequency to 3 days/week. If the primary outcome is not achieved at 6 weeks, the dosage will continue at 5 days/week as described for weeks 3-6 above. 

Duration: 3 months
</interventions>
    <comparator>Control:
Location: Dunedin Public Hospital (Dunedin, NZ).
Exposure: Participants will be encouraged to join a supervised exercise group that runs at the hospital. Exercise is supervised by a physiotherapist and consists of 30 min self-paced walking on a marked course in hospital corridors followed by 20-30 min self-selected circuit exercises in the hospital gym.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size is based on a previous intervention study of heating in PAD (Tei C, JACC 2007). A power analysis using these study results would indicate 8-9 participants need to complete intervention and control arms to achieve an 80% probability of detecting a mean doubling of walking distance over 3 months if the type I error rate is controlled at 5%. The increased sample size allows for dropout and a more conservative estimation of the magnitude of treatment effect.
The two heat conditioning groups will be compared at 12 weeks to determine the effect of conditioning dose (5 vs 3 d/w). If they are equivalent then the heat conditioning groups will be combined and compared against the control group at 12 weeks, but if they are different then peak responses will be compared against control.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Significant numbers of people are unable to engage in exercise for cardiovascular benefit due to their physical disability. However heat conditioning may be an alternative for people who face such barriers to exercise, but for whom its cardiovascular effects would be particularly beneficial. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are one such group to which this applies. Our aim is to determine whether our prior work on the benefits of heat conditioning can be translated to clinical benefit for people with this common condition. This will be tested in a randomised controlled trial of people with PAD, who will undergo either 3-months of heat-stressful health conditioning, or receive advice to undertake supervised exercise as best able. The primary determinant of benefit will be at least a doubling of pain-free walking capacity (primary outcome), along with improvements in blood flow to the affected leg(s), improved cardiorespiratory capacity, quality of life (QOL) and metabolic health. If benefits are seen in this population, we anticipate transferability to people with other cardiovascular and musculoskeletal conditions, and therefore similar obstacles to traditional exercise. </summary>
