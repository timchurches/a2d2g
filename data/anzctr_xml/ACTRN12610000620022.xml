  <interventions>
    <interventions>EMA401 Sodium Salt administered orally once daily for 7 days. The starting dose level is 50 mg for 7 days (Cohort 1) with provision to escalate to 100 mg for 7 days (Cohort 2)  subject to Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) review.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo comparator - Lactose monohydrate hand-filled into hard VCaps Plus (Registered Trademark) capsules. Within each dose level 8 subjects will be randomised to receive active EMA401 Sodium Salt and 8 will be randomised to receive placebo.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of EMA401 Sodium Salt administered once daily for seven consecutive days in a healthy elderly population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>EMA401 Sodium Salt will be administered for seven consecutive days, followed by monitoring for 48 hours. Subjects will then be discharged on Day 9 with follow-up on Days 11, 13 and 15, and an exit visit on Day 17. During this time vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory determinations, 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) reading and continuous (whilst in-clinic) five lead telemetry will be performed. All subjects will be monitored for adverse events (eg. nausea, dizziness, fatigue etc.) and concomitant medications for the duration of the study and all information received between consent and final visit (Day 17) will be recorded in the case report form.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of EMA401 Sodium Salt following administration of a daily dose of EMA401 for seven consecutive days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A total of thirty-three (33) pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be collected including five (5) pre-dose samples, one sample to be collected on each of Days 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7; thirteen (13) samples post-Day 1 dosing at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-dose; and fifteen (15) samples post-Day 7 dosing at  0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
