    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The research team will work collaboratively with participating Area Health Services and Divisions of General Practice to identify a broad range of health care providers to engage in the study by way of referring their patients to the study. The health care providers will receive education about the purposes of the study and the client recruitment procedure including written material on eligibility of clients for participation in the study and copies of the referral form. In addition to health care providers identifying potential participants, the study will be advertised widely in local newspapers and through distribution of a study brochure and referral form in the waiting rooms of health care providers, community noticeboards. Those persons that respond to the local advertisements and promotion of the study will need to seek a referral from their health care provider on their next subsequent visit. 
Enrollment of consumers in the study has five steps: (1) On receipt of the referral form, a study participation package will be sent to the consumer from UNSW. The study participation package will include a participant information and consent form, the baseline evaluation survey and a pre-paid self addressed envelope; (2) The consumer will be asked to complete the Consent Form as well as the baseline survey and return these documents to UNSW using the supplied pre paid self addressed enveloope; (3) Receipt of the Consent Form and the baseline survey by UNSW completes the enrollment process of the consumer to the study; (4) Once enrollment has taken place, the consumer will be randomly allocated (block allocation)by central randomisation by computer program to either the intervention or control program; (5) The consumer will then be notified by a member of the research team regarding which program they have been allocated to and details concerning the date, starting time and location of the Program.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of a generic chronic disease self management program by
implementing a randomised control trial. A pre-test and pilot study have previously been completed. The trial will be
conducted in Sydney West Area Health Service. The research study will be undertaken collaboratively with the local
area health service and Divisions of General Practice. Expression of Interests will be sought from a wide range of
health care providers (GPs, clinicians working for the Area Health Service, Outpatient Department clinicians,
community health and primary health care nurses, public and private allied health clinicians) to refer patients/clients
based on an eligibility criteria to the study. The participating health care professionals will receive briefing on the
referral process and be required to sign a consent form to participate. On referral, patients/clients will receive a study
package containing information about the study, consent form and baseline survey. Return of the consent form and
baseline survey by the patient/client will constitute enrollment in the study. At this point patient/clients will be allocated
randomly to either participation in the intervention group (generic chronic disease self management program) or the
control program (light physical activity program). Patients/clients who enrol in the study will be requested to complete a
self administered questionnaire before and at 4 months post program attendance, to assess outcomes associated with
attending the program. In addition, participants attending the generic chronic disease self managemet program will be
requested to complete a process evaluation survey at the end of the first session and on completion of the program.</summary>
