  <interventions>
    <interventions>Those in the NL-RISC group will receive an appointment to attend an initial consultation within a month of discharge where the nurse will review the patients cardiovascualr risk factors and medications in relation to the national guidelines. This appointment will be for one hour. The nurse will utilise psychotherapeutic skills, including motivational interviewing techniques to engage the participant in the rehabilitative process facilitating behaviour change and guiding decisions regarding risk factor modification. This will be followed by a 10-minute telephone follow-up at 2 months following discharge. More frequent follow up will occur should it be identified that further follow up is required.   At 6 months both the control and NL-RISC groups will attend an outpatient setting to have their risk factor profile measured and compared to baseline.  Lipids will be measured on a fasting blood sample, resting blood pressure (BP) using an automatic BP monitor and smoking status by self-report. Physical activity will be assessed using the 7-day International Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire, and depressive mood using the Cardiac Depression Scale.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual Care, will be as decided by the patients treating team. The patient will receive medication counselling from the pharmacist prior to discharge. Risk factor education will have been undertaken by the nurse approximately of approximately 20 minutes duration. Patients will receive an outpatients appointment for 4 - 6 weeks following discharge. Those with coronary artery disease would also receive a referral to an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program. A letter detailing their admission and follow-up would also be sent to their General Practitioner.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting serum Total Cholestrol and serum Triglicerides will be collected. High Density Lipid Cholestrol and Low Density Lipid Cholestrol will also be requested, as markers of the anti- and pro-atherogenic lipid particles. The reason for this is that some people with mildly increased Total Cholestrol may actually be at lower risk because their High Density Lipid Cholestrol  is high and their Low Density Lipid Cholestrol  is relatively low.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 6 months post-initial NL-RISC consultation visit.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in baseline cardiovascular risk profile through comparison of the following measures:
Manual Blood Pressure via sphygmomanometer
Weigh via electronic scales
Waist Circumference by tape measure starting at the top of the hip bone, and then bring it all the way around -- level with the umbilicus. 
Mood Status via the cardiac depression Scale and the health related quality of life tool
Exercise via the 7 day international physical activity recall questionnaire
Smoking, alcohol and diet via self report
Diabetes via Glycosylated hemoglobin Hb1AC serum levels</outcome>

    <concealment>Those individuals meeting the inclusion criteria without exclusion criteria will be informed about the study, a plain language participant information sheet will be given. Those individuals who consent to particpate will have a detailed history of the CVD risk factors recorded with demographic and medical history information prior to randomisation. This recording will be undertaken by a trained research assistant (RA) not directly associated with the study. 

Allocation is not concealed, there will be central randomisation via a computer program. The research assistant will contact the central adminstrative site to receive the allocation number.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will trial a Nurse-Led multidisciplinary (CVD) Risk Intervention Screening Clinic (NL-RISC) for cardiovascular disease that could be used as a model of care for risk factor modification in other settings.   The proposed Nurse-led (CVD) Risk Intervention Screening Clinic (NL-RISC) is a unique, stand alone intervention designed to complement existing services. The model of care incorporates a specialist cardiac nurse trained in behavioural change, patient centred philosophies, the promotion of adherence to risk factor guidelines, strong multidisciplinary links, detailed patient assessment, and  the use of a web-based support program. This study fits within preventive healthcare research framework as it aims to encourage those in the community with CVD to respond proactively to risk management interventions. At the broader level the NL-RISC  will provide mentorship and facilitate the development of nurse clinicians and enhance continuity of care across interdisciplinary frameworks. The intention of the research team is to establish NL-RISC as a unique model of care for CVD in Australia and if proven effective for it to be translated into other healthcare settings. There is strong evidence for the screening and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors to reduce further cardiovascular events.  Nurse-led risk factor assessment clinics provide the ideal opportunity to provide tailored risk factor management, and referral practices to improve adherence to national guidelines.</summary>
