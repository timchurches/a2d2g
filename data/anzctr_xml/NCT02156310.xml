    <summary>Background: High blood pressure is a common complication observed in cancer patients
      prescribed anti-VEGF drugs. Increased blood pressure increases the risk of heart attacks and
      strokes, thus adversely affecting survival and quality of life in this patient group.
      However, little is known about the mechanisms leading to high blood pressure with anti-VEGF
      drugs. As a result, the management of anti-VEGF drug-induced hypertension is largely
      empirical. A better knowledge of effects of specific blood pressure lowering drugs, i.e.
      antihypertensives, on anti-VEGF drug-induced hypertension would optimize therapeutic
      management and reduce the risk associated with hypertension and proteinuria in patients with
      cancer.

      Methods: Datasets of two completed GSK clinical trials using the anti-VEGF drug pazopanib,
      i.e. VEG108844 and VEG105192, will be accessed to 1) determine the way blood pressure changes
      over time after commencing anti-VEGF treatment; 2) identify whether there are any
      relationships between pre-study and baseline blood pressure values, treatment with specific
      antihypertensive drugs, and changes in blood pressure after commencing anti-VEGF treatment;
      and 3) identify whether specific antihypertensive drugs and drug combinations, prescribed
      either before or after commencing anti-VEGF treatment, lead to a better blood pressure
      control and prevent proteinuria during anti-VEGF treatment. Specific statistical analyses
      will be conducted to assess and identify associations and will account for other patient's
      characteristics and repeated observations over time. The investigators plan to conduct this
      study over 6 months.

      Studies VEG108844 and VEG105192 have been selected as they investigate the same anti-VEGF
      drug, pazopanib, in a homogeneous group, i.e. patients with renal cancer. At the same time,
      inclusion of a placebo arm as well as a treatment arm with a different anti-VEGF drug,
      sunitimib, will allow initial comparisons across different groups.

      The results deriving from this study will provide important knowledge on 1) patterns of blood
      pressure changes with anti-VEGF drugs and 2) whether specific antihypertensive drugs or drug
      classes might be better than others in preventing and managing anti-VEGF induced hypertension
      and proteinuria.</summary>
