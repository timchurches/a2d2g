  <interventions>
    <interventions>Macronutrient specific meal- High carbohydrate or high protein in obese children. 

The breakfast meals will be a milkshake. The energy content of the milkshake will be 25% of the participant's estimated energy requirements. The high carbohydrate will consist of 6%protein, 16% fat, 75% carbohydrate. The high protein will consist of 55% protein, 15% fat and 28% carbohydrate.    
 
There will be two study mornings. On the first morning they will receive either one of two study breakfasts (high carbohydrate or high protein). They will then be asked to come back on a second morning after a minimum of 1 week washout to cross over and receive the alternate study meal.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postprandial changes in satiety and appetite gut hormones: ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK. 
These will be measured using blood tests. We will collect blood samples, centrifuge the blood to obtain plasma and serum and analyse these using a Multiplex.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline just prior to the test meal and during the postprandial period, i.e. up to 4 hours after the meal has been eaten. 

So in summary, we will take blood before breakfast, and at 15mins, 30 mins, 60mins, 120 mins, 180 mins and 240 mins after breakfast is eaten.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake (kj) at the subsequent meal and energy intake from everything consumed post lunch until lunch the next day. 

We will assess the kj consumed at lunch by weighing out the amount of lunch supplied minus the amount that is left over.
We will assess the amount eaten post lunch until lunch the next day by asking participants to complete a food record. We will analyse the food record using a program called FoodWorks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four hours after the test meal (high carbohydrate or high protein breakfast), and up until lunch the next day.
 
We will assess this by measuring how much is eaten at lunch (as described above), and also by asking the participants to complete a food record of what they eat for the remainder of the day and up to before lunch on the next day. We will analyse the food record using a program called FoodWorks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) to measure hunger and fullness</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline just prior to the test meal and during the postprandial period, i.e. up to 4 hours after the meal has been eaten.

So in summary, the timepoints of the VAS scales will be before breakfast, and at 15mins, 30 mins, 60mins, 120 mins, 180 mins and 240 mins after breakfast is eaten.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in energy expenditure after consuming the two different macronutrient meals in both obese and healthy weight children. Energy expenditure will be measured using indirect calorimetry. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Energy expenditure will be measured using indirect calorimetry at baseline and 30 minutes of every hour for four hours after the breakfast meal.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research project is aiming to understand how the body controls appetite (that is how hungry and how full we feel) after we consume foods that are made up of the main nutrients carbohydrate, protein and fat. We are also aiming to understand if this appetite control process is disrupted in adolescents who are obese compared with adolescents who are of a healthy weight. This information will be beneficial to be able to provide nutritional advice and strategies to help with the treatment and prevention of obesity in childhood.</summary>
