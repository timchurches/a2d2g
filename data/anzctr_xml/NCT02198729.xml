  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigators have recently become proficient in a new, and we believe more effective
      technique for polyp removal. Known as Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). ESD involves
      removing the polyp in one piece. It is preferable to remove the polyp in one piece as it
      minimises the chance of leaving residual polyp tissue behind. There have also been recent
      studies overseas that have shown this new technique to be quite effective. In this study,
      half of the patients will receive the newly developed technique of polyp removal (ESD), while
      the other half will receive conventional Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) treatment. This
      study will allow us to show which technique results in lower recurrence rates and is more
      effective.</summary>
