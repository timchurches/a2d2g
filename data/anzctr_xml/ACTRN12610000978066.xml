Randomization of participants to treatment groups will be determined by random allocation. All participants will be assigned to a treatment using a computerised random number generator. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The treatment number that has been placed next to the participantâ€™s number will be the allocated treatment order for that individual.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this trial is to examine whether 14 week administration of lyprinol(registered trademark) improves a range of cognitive, mood, behavioural and psychophysiological measures in children aged 6-14 years with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity relative to placebo. Children will be enrolled into the study if they have elevated inattention or hyperactivity whether or not they have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and whether or not they are currently medicated for their ADHD. As there is no evidence that Omega 3 intake interferes with current ADHD medications, providing children or adolescents who are currently taking ADHD medication with Lyprinol should be safe and well tolerated (Whitehouse et al, 1997). Their inclusion in the trial will be based on their level of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. If participants are included in the trial and are currently taking stimulant or other medications then this indicates that their current medication is not efficacious, as they are still presenting with high levels of inattention and hyperactivity. We will not include participants who have started stimulant medication for ADHD within the past two weeks as the medication may not have had sufficient time to reach maximum effectiveness. As this is a randomized trial there will be equal probability of the control (placebo) and active (Lyprinol) groups to have the same numbers of participants who are currently on medication. All participants will receive a 14 week supply of Lyprinol(registered trademark) once they finish the study. This is to ensure participants who are allocated to the placebo group also have the opportunity to take the Lyprinol for the same duration as the study.</summary>
