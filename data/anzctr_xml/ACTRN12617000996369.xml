    <interventions>A randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of a 24-week workplace exercise program on physical fitness and injury rates of Australian paramedics.
The workplace exercise program "MedicFit" has been developed by NSW Ambulance as a low-intensity and low-risk program that involves the use of minimal equipment to deliver resistance and flexibility exercises to paramedics who can perform the program while at the workplace. Paramedics assigned to an intervention arm to participate in the MedicFit program will be prescribed a set of exercises to complete 3 x per week, with each session taking approximately 45 minutes. These exercises (i.e. the MedicFit program) will be delivered via Physitrack, a software-based exercise prescription tool that allows participants to view video demonstrations of their exercises and log their participation. In this way, adherence to the program will be tracked across the 24 weeks (i.e. the number of sessions completed each week). Exercises include static stretches, resistance band, body weight and free weight strength exercises. All MedicFit exercise sessions will be completed at the workplace during working hours.  
There are two intervention arms and one control arm, to which participants (target n=150 allowing for 40% attrition) will be randomly allocated. The two intervention arms are:
Arm 1: MedicFit program plus health coach support via email, text messaging and phone. Subjects allocated this group will participate in the MedicFit exercise program in addition to receiving regular (weekly) consult/support from an NSW Ambulance health coach.
Arm 2: MedicFit program: Subjects allocated this group will participate in the MedicFit exercise program without health coach support.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will participate in all testing (i.e. baseline and 6-months) without participating in the MedicFit program during the 24-week intervention. At the conclusion of the intervention, control group participants (and also participants in both intervention groups) will be offered access to the MedicFit exercise program for 6-months with health coach support if they choose.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The MedicFit program is being trialled in two NSW Ambulance zones: Central West Zone 1 and Central West Zone 2, which comprise a total of 36 ambulance stations and 279 paramedics. Stations will be randomly allocated into three groups by station managers (i.e. allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who will be "off-site" or at central administration site), who each manage 3-4 stations within the zone. Therefore there will be an approximately equal number of participants within each group (1, 2 or control) within each zone in the study:
1.	undertaking the MedicFit  program with support from a health coach; 
2.	undertaking the MedicFit  program without health coach support; 
3.	control group not participating in MedicFit.

Participants at a particular station will hence be assigned to one of these three groups. Each group, station and participant will receive a unique identifier.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation:	Power calculations were based on an expected small difference in change in fitness (effect size d=0.25) between the three groups. To achieve 80% power at an alpha level of 0.05 considering the repeated measures design with three groups, and an expected correlation among measures of 0.5, 108 participants are required. To account for potential attrition (up to 40% in workplace exercise studies) a sample size of 150 will be targeted for recruitment. 

Statistical Analysis Plan: The changes in physical activity level, physical fitness, injury rates, motivations and attitudes towards exercise, exercise self-efficacy, self-perceived job performance, and health-related quality of life will be compared between interventions and over time using SPSS (V22) software via repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Bonferroni correction will be applied to account for multiple comparisons. A p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effectiveness of a 24-week workplace exercise program MedicFit) to improve work-related physical fitness and reduce musculoskeletal injury rates of NSW paramedics and assess whether greater effects are achieved with the provision of regular health coach support. In comparison to a control group who do not participate in the exercise training, it is hypothesised that paramedics undertaking the MedicFit program will improve job-related physical fitness and achieve lower injury rates over the intervention period (vs. historical data), and that additional effects will be achieved by those receiving health coach support (i.e. greater increases in physical fitness and lower injury rates). </summary>
