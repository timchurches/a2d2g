  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised double-blind, controlled, parallel-designed study.  Participants will be randomly assigned to either increased flavonoid intake (~450 mg/d) from a flavonoid-rich black tea beverage, or to no increase in flavonoid intake using a tea-flavoured control beverage without flavonoids. The study will be performed over an 18 month period, with each participant being involved in a 6 month intervention.</interventions>

    <concealment>Eligible individuals will be randomly assigned 1:1 using computer generated random numbers to either the high-flavonoids tea group or the control group. Randomisation will be according to a bolck design and according to gender.  Study products will be labelled with 10 different randomly generated numbers of 4 digits (5 linked to placebo and 5 linked to active).  This will prevent participants from finding out what product they are consuming by talking to each other.  This will also help to keep the people doing the measurements blinded. 100 envelopes, numbered 1-100, will each contain one of those 4 digit numbers (50 linking to placebo, 50 linking to active). These envelopes will be used for randomisation by opening an envelope, in consecutive order, as participants are entered into the study.  These envelopes will be held by an independent person within the Univesity of Western Australia.   The study coordinator will contact the independent person to obtain the next available envelope once an individual is deemed eligible.  The envelope will be opened and code will be recorded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether long term consumption of black tea results in increased endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery and a decreased 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure.  Efeects on other cardiovascular disease-related measurements will also be assessed.</summary>
