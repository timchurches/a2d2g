    <interventions>Other interventions - Restrictive fluid management

Experimental: Restrictive fluid management - Restrictive fluid management Targeting a negative or maximum 300ml positive daily fluid balance.

No Intervention: Standard therapy - Randomized allocation of standard care at the clinician's discretion in accordance with current best practice.


Other interventions: Restrictive fluid management
Daily fluid input is restricted to drugs and nutrition. Fluid boluses and blood products can be given if clinically indicated. Matching fluid output to fluid input whenever possible using diuretics if needed, and additionally, if clinically necessary and plausible, commencing renal replacement therapy. If renal replacement therapy is not deemed clinically desirable, acceptance of a less than targeted fluid balance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Observational studies among patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) have shown an association
      with fluid accumulation and increased mortality. Trials among other subgroups of critically
      ill patients have demonstrated that restricting fluid input after the initial resuscitation
      appears safe.

      The objective if this study is to determine whether a fluid restrictive treatment regimen
      will lead to a lower cumulative fluid balance at 72 hours from randomization in critically
      ill patients with AKI and whether this approach is safe and feasible.</summary>
