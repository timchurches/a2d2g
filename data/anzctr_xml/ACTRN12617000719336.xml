  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention in this study consists of the intraduodenal infusion of a quinine or control solution over a 60 minute period during which the measurement of gut motility, blood glucose, gut hormone concentration, insulin concentrations, appetite perceptions and energy intake during a buffet meal will be measured.

Subjects enrolled into the study will receive, in randomized, double-blind fashion 
(i) 0.625mg/min quinine,
(ii) 1.25mg/min quinine, 
(iii) 3.75mg/min quinine.
(iv) saline (control) 
each occurring at separate visits. Each visit will last 3-6hrs in duration, and will be separated by 3-7 days. Visits will be carried out in the clinic room facility of the Discipline of Medicine, University of Adelaide by staff members trained in the required techniques, and will be conducted on an individual basis.

Subjects will be asked to consume a standardised dinner meal the night before each visit by no later than 6pm, After fasting for 14 hrs overnight and refraining from exercise and alcohol for 24 hrs, subjects will arrive at the laboratory at 8am . Upon arrival, subjects will be intubated with a 17-channel manometric catheter that will be inserted through an anaesthetised nostril and allowed to pass through the stomach and into the duodenum by peristalsis. The manometric catheter consists of 16 side holes spaced at 1.5 cm intervals, measuring pressures in the antrum, pylorus, and duodenum (APD pressures). An additional channel (with the side hole positioned approx 14 cm distal to the pylorus when the catheter is in position) is used for intraduodenal infusions. The correct positioning of the catheter will be maintained by continuous measurement of the transmucosal potential difference (TMPD) between the most distal antral channel and the most proximal duodenal channel. All manometric channels will be perfused with degassed, distilled water, except for the two TMPD channels, which will be perfused with degassed 0.9% saline, at 0.15 ml/min. An intravenous cannula will be placed into a right forearm vein for regular blood sampling to measure plasma hormone concentrations. Once the catheter has been positioned correctly, fasting motility will be monitored continuously, and immediately after the end of phase III activity of the fasting migrating motor complex (MMC), during a period of motor quiescence (t=-15 - 0 min), a 10 ml venous blood sample (baseline) will be taken, and the subject will complete a visual analogue scale questionnaire (VAS) to assess appetite-related perceptions (fullness, hunger, etc.) and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and bloating). At t = 0 min (during phase I of the MMC), the 60-min intraduodenal infusion (either (i), (ii), or (iii) as outlined above) will commence . APD pressures will be measured continually over the 60-min period. Blood samples will be collected and VASs completed every 15 min from t = 0 to 60 min. At t = 60 min, the manometric catheter will be removed and subjects will be presented with a cold, buffet-style meal. Subjects will be allowed 30 min to freely consume food until they are comfortably full. At t = 90 min, a final blood sample will be taken, and VAS administered. The intravenous cannula will then be removed and subjects will be allowed to leave the laboratory. A total of 70 ml of blood will be taken on each study day (280 ml over all study visits).

In addition, on one further occasion, oral detection thresholds for bitter taste will be assessed using 3-Alternative Forced Choice procedure, an established technique for the quantification of oral taste detection thresholds. Samples for the assessment of bitter taste will be prepared using quinine dissolved in deionised water. All samples will be presented at room temperature, under a red light to minimise visual cues. Participants will wear nose-clips to ensure detection of differences is not due to smell, and will be asked to rinse their mouths with water after each set of samples. There will be 1 min between presentations of sample sets. A set of samples will be presented as three trays of three samples, each tray containing one sample of the quinine concentration being tested and two samples of deionised water. The subject will taste the samples from left to right on each tray and choose the one sample that tastes odd compared to the other two. If the subject does not choose the three samples containing quinine in that set, they will be presented with the next set of samples at a higher concentration. Once the subject selects the three correct samples containing quinine, this will be recorded as their detection threshold.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake at the buffet meal. The weight of the foods will be recorded before and after being offered to the subjects and energy intake and macronutrient composition calculated subsequently using commercially available software (Foodworks, Xyris Software, Highgate Hill, QLD, Australia).</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Antropyloroduodenal motility (number of antral, duodenal and isolated pyloric pressure waves, and basal pyloric pressure) will be measured using a 17-channel manometric assembly (Dentsleeve, Mui Scientific).</outcome>

This intervention is of an exploratory nature to characterise the effects of varying doses of quinine. As such, it is unknown which plasma hormone concentrations may prove to be of importance. Hence these have been grouped into one composite primary outcome.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite sensations (hunger, fullness, thirst, desire to eat, amount of food the subject thinks they could eat) and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, bloating) will be measured using a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). This VAS has been extensively employed in published studies conducted by the investigator.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate the dose-related effects of small intestinal administration of the bitter agonist, quinine, a non-nutritive (calorie-free) compound, on the motor and hormone functions of the upper gastrointestinal tract, appetite, energy intake and blood glucose. The relationship between outcomes and the ability to detect bitter in the oral cavity will also be investigated.
We have found previously that specific dietary nutrients, when given into the small intestine in small amounts (and so not contributing significantly to overall energy intake) have the unique ability to substantially stimulate gastrointestinal functions leading to marked energy intake suppression and improvements in postprandial blood glucose. There has been a recent interest in the effects of bitter compounds, some of which also occur in the diet, including thio-urea compounds in certain vegetables or fruit, or quinine in tonic water, with reported effects on gut functions and energy intake suppression. 
This study aims to characterise the dose-related effects of quinine, when delivered to the small intestine, in an effort to identify an optimal dose for beneficial effect on the outcomes mentioned herein. This may then guide future research to evaluate hypotheses that observed effects may be further enhanced by combining nutrients with quinine.</summary>
