  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will use a questionnaire that will be sent to all specialist paediatric hospitals in Australia and to a representative sample of public and private hospitals in Australia. The physiotherapists working in these hospitals will be invited to participate in the study.

The aims of the questionnaire are to determine: 1) the extent of the Bottle/Bubble PEP use in Australia; 2) the proposed rationale for its use; 3) for which patients Bottle/Bubble PEP is used and; 4) why it is chosen rather than other PEP devices.

The questionnaire is to be returned 1 month after it is mailed out. If the questionnaire is not returned after a month, respondents will be invited again to participate in the study. Maximum length of this study is 6 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is believed that physiotherapists in Australia use the Bottle/Bubble PEP device to treat patients that have secretion clearance problems. It is unknown though to what extent it is used or the rationale behind its use. This questionnaire will assist in answering these questions at it will be sent to a representative sample of physiotherapists working in hospitals within Australia.</summary>
