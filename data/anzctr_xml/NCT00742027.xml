    <summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of oral panobinostat in patients with
      refractory/relapsed classical HL who have received prior treatment with high dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Safety of panobinostat will also be
      assessed. Other markers that may correlate with efficacy or safety will be explored.</summary>
