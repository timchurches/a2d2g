  <interventions>
    <interventions>Evidence-based exercise prescription.
26-week programme.
Individualised programme and session frequency to match fitness level, disabilities and co-morbidities (likely range: 3 x per week to once per week).
Clinical-gym setting supervised by clinical exercise physiologists.
Some programmes may include a home-based exercise component when deemed safe to conduct.
Clinical exercise physiologists will monitor patient adherence via patient maintained log books and phone calls.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to compare the outcomes of individualised exercise programmes delivered in a mixed environment (a mix of closely supervised exercise in a clinic-gym, and exercise at home) with outcomes reported in controlled trials. No specific exclusion/inclusion criteria will be imposed. ADHB physicians and therapists will use their clinical judgment to identify patients they consider to be safe to exercise and will benefit from a well-designed and supervised 26-week exercise programme. With the participants consent, patient names and contact details will be provided to University of Auckland (UoA) researchers who will formally invite patients to enrol in the study. Researchers will follow American College of Sports Medicine guidelines during patient assessment, exercise prescription design, and exercise training. Standard fitness, strength and flexibility assessments will be made prior to, at 4-week intervals, and following the 26-week exercise programme. Participants will not be charged for the 26-week exercise programme. Qualified UoA clinical exercise physiologists will administer the exercise programmes. Postgraduate students will assist in the planning and delivery of exercise programmes, and data collected will be included in dissertations required to fulfil the academic and practical requirements for an MSc in Clinical Exercise Physiology.  </summary>
