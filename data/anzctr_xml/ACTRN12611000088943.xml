  <interventions>
    <interventions>Low intensity laser acupuncture to temporomandibular disorder treatment. The acupuncture points: S6, SI19, GB20, LI4, L3, SJ3, GB34, Ex-3, low power (50mW) infrared laser, for 90s each, with the objective of sedation.
Laser acupuncture therapy will happen weekly in one-hour sessions. Laser treatment is continuous and punctual, directed at each point for a period of 90 seconds. Twelve weekly sessions will complete three months of treatment.
The laser acupuncture therapy will follow the standards of protection for the use of lasers, including the protection of patients' eyes. Such protection inhibits the visual stimulus during application of therapy.
Neuromuscular relaxing occlusal splint is a dentistry conventional treatment directed to all participants of the research. The splints will be made of acrylic and individually adjusted by surface's sanding . The adjustment is to obtain simultaneous tooth contacts in a physiological mandibular position, where the chewing muscles and temporomandibular joints are protected from excessive occlusal loads. They will wear it for three months, at the night, when usually the involuntary muscle hyperactivity occurs. The adjustments will take place weekly, aiming occlusal changes that result in facial muscleand joint  relaxation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo Laser acupuncture is the intervention directed to the control group.
Acupuncture points given for temporomandibular disorders: S6, SI19, GB20, LI4, L3, SJ3, GB34, Ex-3 will receive the  treatment simulation by same study group's apparatus, by 90 seconds without applying pressure or radiation. There will be no emission of laser for this group, so the power button the device will be turned to the off position. Patients wear dark protection glasses that inhibit any view. No sound is emitted by the device, even when off or on.
The issue of low power laser is painless, no sensation is felt when the true application of laser happens. The use of glasses that inhibit the view of the patient allows individuals do not know the nature of light, active or placebo. 
Placebo laser acupuncture will happen weekly in one-hour sessions. The disconnected device will be directed at each point for a period of 90 seconds. Twelve weekly sessions will complete three months of placebo therapy.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>In order to reduce the likelihood of systematic errors and allow the use of statistical tests, there will be a simple procedure of random allocation of subjects of this research, which will be distributed in two groups of 18 subjects by drawing lots. Each group will receive a specific treatment modality for TMD defined as follows:
1) Group Therapy - neuromuscular relaxing splint and laser acupuncture;
2) Control Group - neuromuscular relaxing relaxing splint and placebo laser.
Within each group, the therapeutic will be maintained until the end of the study, the patients being aware voluntary and consistent with the possibility of receiving one of two proposed therapies (therapeutic or placebo), were not informed during the processing of their nature therapies.
At the end of the study, patients receiving a placebo therapy may undergo therapy for active laser acupuncture if they have persistent symptoms or if they wish.
Simple randomisation by using sealed opaque envelope is assumed. In each subject is assigned a sealed opaque envelope, where information about the group to which belong will be contained. The number of envelopes for the therapeutic group is equal to the control group, the envelopes being identical with each other. The draw will be conducted by a person without any link to the survey, which will be in the custody of groups and their participants, the researcher revealed only when the first therapeutic application.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The application of low-energy laser stimulation on acupuncture points is an alternative therapeutic appeal to the use of needles employed in the pain control of diverse pathologies. The traditional acupuncture as therapy for the Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) has deserved prominence in current research, while studies using laser acupuncture are still scarce. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the laser on acupuncture points together the Occlusal Splint therapy in patients with facial pain. 36 patients will be divided into 2 groups that received OS and true laser acupuncture (study group) or OS and false laser acupuncture (control group). The groups were compared for changes in physical and psychological symptoms.</summary>
