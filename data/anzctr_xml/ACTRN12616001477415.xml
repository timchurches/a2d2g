  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treating team or surgeon will perform initial assessment of patients with grade III or IV haemorrhoids referred from the community by their general practitioner or through the emergency department. They will then indicate the suitability of patients for a formal haemorrhoidectomy. Patients will receive a standard surgical treatment for management of grade III or IV haemorrhoids, after verbal and written informed consent performed by the consultant surgeon of the unit, or the treating surgical registrar after consultation with the on-call surgeon. On the day of surgery, patients will undergo standardised general anaesthesia by Monash Health anaesthetic unit prior to surgical procedure, along with associated standard monitoring. Patients will be placed in the lithotomy position to undergo formal Milligan-Morgan or Ferguson haemorrhoidectomy using diathermy.

Our routine immediate post-operative analgesia includes performing a bilateral pudendal nerve block. We use 20 ml of a 0.75% Ropivacaine solution for the pudendal block. This is infiltrated first superficially under the skin and then deeper along the submucosa and intramuscular spaces into all four quadrants. In the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), VAS (Numerical pain scoring system between 0  10) will be assessed by nursing staff, and recorded. Rescue opioid pro re nata will be provided.

Post-operative analgesic regimen will comprise of oral Paracetamol 1g every 6 hours, and opioid analgesia pro re nata will be provided for patients in the ward. All patients will also receive the conventional oral metronidazole 400mg thrice daily for five days, stool softeners, and smear of glyceryl trinitrate ointment thrice daily. Daily measurement of additional pro re nata opioid required will be recorded. Participants requiring opioid analgesia as inpatient, would also be discharged on oral opioid, and be required to document the number of tablets of oral opioid they require per day, in their pain diary.

A biostatistician will prepare a computer-generated randomisation schedule using random permuted blocks, in order to allocate the 166 study medications (and also study participants) to either Group A or B. The first group (A)  will receive the compound topical Gabapentin, Amitriptyline and Lignocaine ointment, and the second group (B) will receive topical placebo ointment, made up of paraffin. The proposed topical ointment consists of: Gabapentin 6%, Amitriptyline 2%, and Lignocaine 5%. Both ointments will be produced by Department of Pharmacy, Monash Health. Both ointments will be labelled with the study number according to the randomisation allocation and dispensed by the Department of Pharmacy. Provision of labelled ointments by the pharmacy will ensure blinding of the patients and the treating team. Our ward pharmacist or member of the treating team will provide careful instructions on how to apply ointment, and monitoring of any side effects. The application of the ointment involves smearing a small amount of ointment onto patient's index finger and applying this directly onto the anus post-operative wound three times daily from day 1 post-operative for 2 weeks duration. Patients will be discharged from hospital once comfortable ambulating and showing no acute signs of urinary retention or faecal impaction as assessed by the treating team. Each patient will be provided with the Pain Diary post-op. Pain scoring will be performed and recorded by individual patients in the Pain Diary at post-operative day 1, 3, 7 and finally at 2 weeks outpatient follow-up. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be the quality of post-haemorrhoidectomy pain control measured by using Visual Analogue Score (VAS: numerical pain scoring system between 0 to 10; 0: no pain and 10: worst imaginable), recorded in an individualised pain diary. VAS is a simple scoring system, and has been used in various studies to measure pain post-anorectal surgery. The baseline VAS score will be collected before or on the day of surgery and again at post-operative day 1,3, 7, and finally at 2 weeks outpatient follow-up.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oral morphine equivalents - outcome will be assessed by review of medical records. Early and late opioid consumption will be measured as oral morphine equivalents (OME), as OME is recommended by the Faculty of Pain Medicine, Australian New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. Early opioid within first 24 hours measured from time of admission will be used to compare with further daily OME measurement. This information will be retrieved from patient scanned medical records. Opioid consumption will be recorded as on-request IV fentanyl (mcg), oral immediate release oxycodone (mg) or intravenous morphine taken by the patients and the total converted to OME. The opioid conversions are as follows: for fentanyl, the conversion is a multiplication of a factor 0.3; for oxycodone, the conversion is a multiplication of a factor 1.5; for intravenous morphine, the conversion is a multiplication of a factor 3.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation was made using Stata IC 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and using a statistical power of 90% at the 5% level of significance, a clinically significant average value of 4.3 and a standard deviation (SD) of 3.64, we calculate that 70 patients will be required in each group. To further account for possible loss of power due to non-parametric distribution and attrition, 166 patients will be required across the two treatment arms.

Group baseline characteristics will be examined for confounding factors. Continuous data will be presented as median (10th  90th percentiles) or with mean and SD as appropriate. Categorical variables will be presented as frequency (percentage). Normally distributed data will be analysed with the Student t test. Skewed data will be analysed with the Mann-Whitney test for unpaired data. Categorical variables will be analysed using appropriate binomial or chi-square tests. Mixed-effect regression model will be used to test the difference in the rate of improvement in Visual Analogue Score between patients on the trial drug and placebo. This model can remove any possible between-patient variation, and focus on within-patient variation. Confidence intervals (CIs) will be computed throughout. All statistical analyses will be performed using Stata IC 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). For all analyses, a p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: To examine the efficacy of compound topical Gabapentin, Amitriptyline, and Lignocaine ointment for the treatment of acute and intermediate pain post-haemorrhoidectomy surgery, when compared with placebo.

Design, setting, and participants: Prospective, double blinded, randomised, controlled, two-arm superiority trial conducted at a single Victorian site. Patient recruitment will be conducted between November 2016 and December 2017 of patients with grade III or IV haemorrhoids. The study will require 166 adult patients randomly allocated to have formal haemorrhoidectomy followed with either post-operative compound topical Gabapentin, Amitriptyline, and Lignocaine ointment (Group A), or placebo ointment (Group B). Patients, and treating team are blinded to group allocations.

Interventions: Both groups will be receiving formal haemorrhoidectomy under general anaesthesia, with the conventional intra­operative pudendal nerve block, and post­operative oral opioid pro re nata. Post-operatively patients will be randomised to either receive the compound topical Gabapentin, Amitriptyline, and Lignocaine ointment (Group A) or placebo ointment (Group B). 

Main outcome measure: The quality of post-haemorrhoidectomy pain control by measuring Visual Analogue Score (VAS) recorded in an individualised pain diary, and also measuring the amount of additional pro re nata opioid consumption required for analgesia. Monitoring for the presence of urinary retention, or any faecal impaction will also be made, as a secondary measure of pain post-haemorrhoidectomy surgery.

Conclusion: Compound topical Gabapentin, Amitriptyline, and Lignocaine ointment is expected to produce better quality post-haemorrhoidectomy pain control, when compared with placebo ointment.
