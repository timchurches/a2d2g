  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease-free survival (DFS).  DFS is defined as the time from randomisation to local, regional, or distant relapse, contralateral breast cancer, appearance of a second (non-breast) malignancy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two interim and one final analyses are planned. The target number of events for the final analysis is 647, and interim analyses are planned after 40% and 70% information (259 and 453 events observed respectively).</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS).  OS is defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Distant disease-free survival (DDFS).  DDFS is defined as the time from randomisation to any recurrent or metastatic disease in distant sites (i.e., other than the local mastectomy scar/chest wall/skin, the ipsilateral breast in case of breast conservation, or the ipsilateral axilla and internal mammary lymph nodes), second (non-breast) malignancy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.</outcome>

BCFI is defined as the time from randomisation to local (including recurrence restricted to the breast after breast conserving treatment), regional, or distant relapse, or contralateral breast cancer.  Second (non-breast) malignancies are ignored and deaths without cancer event are censored at the time of death as a competing event.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether intermittent treatment with the drug letrozole is more effective than continuous letrozole treatment in preventing the return of cancer in postmenopausal women with endocrine responsive breast cancer who have undergone 4 to 6 years of prior endocrine therapy.

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible join this study if you are a postmenopausal woman who has had operable, non-inflammatory breast cancer but are now clinically disease-free. You must have completed 4 to 6 years of prior endocrine therapy with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM(s)), aromatase inhibitors (AI(s)), or a combination of both.

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will take one 2.5mg letrozole tablet per day for 5 years. Participants in the other group will take letrozole 2.5mg tablets intermittently, i.e. once daily for the first 9 months of years 1 through 4, followed by 12 months in year 5.

Participants will be regularly assessed over the duration of the trial to determine whether continuous or intermittent letrozole treatment is more effective in preventing the return of cancer and prolonging survival.</summary>
