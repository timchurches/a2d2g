  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised to receive a question prompt list to use when discussing clinical trial participation with their treating clinician. The Question Prompt List is a series of example questions that patients might like to ask, to gain a better understanding of the clinical trial and help them make an informed decision about participating.                                                         Those patients who receive the list will be given a few minutes to review its content.                                                                                                                                                                               Both the patient and the clinician will then refer to it during their discussion about participating in a clinical trial. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Provision and use of a question prompt list by patients during a consultation increases question asking, reduces anxiety and improves recall.  Previous work on question prompt sheets has found that when patients ask more questions, they gain a better understanding of the topic and satisfied with their treatment decisions. Medical staff also tend to be more satisfied with the consent process when patients display a better understanding of the discussion.

A Question Prompt List has been developed for patients to facilitate patient participation in clinical trial consent discussions.  This project aims to examine patient attitudes to clinical trials and to investigate the effects of promoting question asking when people with cancer are asked to consider entering a randomised clinical trial.

The question prompt list will be evaluated by comparing results for the control and intervention groups on understanding of clinical trial information, satisfaction with the consent process and decision-making about trial participation and achievement of their information and involvement preference. It is expected that those patients receiving the question prompt list will have a higher mean knowledge score in the informed consent questionnaire, have enhanced achievement of their information and involvement preference and be more satisfied with the informed consent and the decision making process.</summary>
