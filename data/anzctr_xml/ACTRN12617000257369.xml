    <interventions>Material
Study participants will be rectuited from Malopolska Voivodship.  60 patients will be randomized into 4 groups: 1- patients will undergo 4-weeks myofascial therapy twice a week and everyday exercise programme, 2- patients will undergo 4-weeks myofascial therapy twice a week, 3- patients will undergo 4-weeks everyday exercises programme , and  4- control group with no intervention. 

Method
Myofascial therapy will last approximately 20 min and home exercise programme 20min.  Myofascial release techniques use slow, sustained pressure, applied to restricted fascial layers to improve range of motion, decrease pain and restore function. Physiotherapist will use mainly separating of muscles compartments, anchor and stretch strokes and lifting or rolling muscle compartments These techniques will be apply on calf muscles, plantar fascia, peroneal muscles.

Home exercise programme will be based on the exercises which are usually recommended for foot problems e.g. calf stretching, short foot, long flexors of toes strengthening. Before beginning of programme, each participants will be instructed by physiotherapist and accuracy will be checked. Duration of this exercise programme should be approximately 20 min and patients will be asked to perform it twice a day during 4-weeks.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>assessment of intensity of pain  - by using VAS scale  ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst possible)</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and end of treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Range of motion of ankle joint  - active range of motion of plantar and dorsal flexion, inversion and eversion will be measured by goniometer</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and end of treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dynamic plantar pressure  The measurements will be obtained with the use of FreeMed platform. Participants will walk in self-selected speed on the path which consists of passive panels (lengthen the path) and active panel (records data). During this plantar pressure will be collected, proceeded and analyzed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and end of treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the standing tibiocalcaneal angle (STCA)  the angle between the bisection of the lower one third of the leg and the bisection of the calcaneus will be measured by goniometer in single-leg stance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and end of treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>navicular drop test -  result of this test is a difference in navicular tuberosity  height measured during bilateral and unilateral stance </outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and end of treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Foot and Ankle Outcomes Questionnaire FAOQ -  its a tool to measure patient reported treatment outcomes in the ankle and foot. It contains 25 question and result ranges from 0 to 100 points. The less points the greater functional disability of limb.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and end of treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate efficiency of myofascial techniques in patients with painful flat foot/feet.  Study participants will be rectuited from Krak√≥w district.  60 patients will be randomized into 4 groups: 1- patients will undergo 4-weeks myofascial therapy twice a week and everyday exercise programme, 2- patients will undergo 4-weeks myofascial therapy twice a week, 3- patients will undergo 4-weeks everyday exercises programme , and  4- control group with no intervention. Myofascial therapy will last approximately 20 min and home exercise programme 20min. Before and after 4 weeks patients will undergo the following examinations: assessment of intensity of pain (VAS scale) and pain localization (authors scheme), visual alignment of pelvis, hips and knees, range of motion of ankle joint, the standing heel- rise test, the standing tibiocalcaneal angle (STCA), navicular drop test, FAOQ and dynamic plantar pressure.</summary>
