  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this trial International Chinese-speaking Macquarie University students (participants) will receive access to a 6 week internet-delivered education course. Participants will be directed to read 3 online lessons about management of symptoms of stress, anxiety, low mood, and depression. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to read. Participants will also have access to summaries and homework assignment for each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about students with similar symptoms, taking a further 20 minutes per week. All participants will also receive automatic emails and brief weekly (&lt;10minutes week) supportive telephone calls from an intern Psychologist.

Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-education, post-education, and at 3-months post-treatment. These will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. The treatment materials include cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) skills.</interventions>
    <comparator>The delayed waitlist control group (beginning the course 6 weeks after the immediate education group beings). This is a wait-list control group.

The waitlist control group will receive access to the same materials and content as the immediate education group, but without the weekly contact from the researchers.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants apply online, and those who meet inclusion criteria are administered a telephone interview to identify psychiatric diagnoses using the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview Schedule (MINI 5.0.0). Participants are then randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Allocation concealment will occur by providing allocation details for each successive participant in a sealed envelope, which recruitment staff are required to open serially.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomized using a list generated prior to the study via a software program (www.random.org), at another site, in another country. The list will then be transcribed and details transferred to sealed envelopes.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to explore the efficacy of a clinician-guided education course for symptoms of anxiety and depression in International Chinese-speaking tertiary students (aged 18+), administered over the internet in a randomised controlled trial. A secondary purpose is to determine the acceptability of the education protocol and materials to International Chinese-speaking tertiary students with symptoms of anxiety and depression. A tertiary purpose of this project is to explore the efficacy of a self-guided version of the course, with participants from the Waitlist Control Group.</summary>
