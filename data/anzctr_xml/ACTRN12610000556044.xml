  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effects of CPAP compared to oxygen on lung function in subjects as they recover from an episode of worsening heart failure.  Subjects will be recruited on admission and have serial testing of their lung function early in their admission, just prior to discharge and 30 days following discharge.  The effects of posture on lung function will also be evaluated.</summary>
