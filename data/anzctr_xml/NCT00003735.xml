    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - topotecan hydrochloride

Experimental: Stratum 1 - Stage 1 - Topotecan hydrochloride (0.8 mg/m²/day) by mouth for 21 days. Bone marrow will be obtained on approximately Day 28 of Course 1 and 2 and in any course where the CBC suggests that a relapse has occurred. One additional course may be given if the blood is cleared of blasts and the bone marrow is M1, M2 or M3. The patient is off protocol therapy if blasts are still present in the blood and the marrow is M3. Subsequent courses of topotecan may be given only if the bone marrow after Course 2 is M1 or M2. If the bone marrow is M2 on Day 28 of any course, another bone marrow aspirate will be done at the end of the next course. If the patient is in CR, a bone marrow aspirate will be required only every other course unless the peripheral blood suggests that a relapse has occurred. Each subsequent course should begin within six weeks of the start of the previous course.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Progression - For each stratum, this trial will determine topotecan to have insufficient activity for further investigation with probability 0.10 if the true response rate is 20%. For each stratum, this trial will determine topotecan to be of sufficient activity to warrant further investigation with probability 0.12 if the true response rate is 5%. Any patient who receives at least 21 days of therapy will be considered evaluable for response.</outcome>
