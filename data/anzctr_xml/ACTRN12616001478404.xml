Patients aged between 6 month and 60 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with artemether-lumefantrine and monitored for 28 days.

    <statisticalmethods>The treatment failure rate to artemether-lumefantrine in the area is assumed 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients will be required. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28 day follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study per site.

WHO Excel programme and SPSS for windows will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 4 Tribal dominating states in India: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.  

The objective of the study is assess the efficacy and safety artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections. The study will be conducted in 4 sentinel sites (Balaghat district, Madhya Pradesh; Gondia district, Maharashtra; Bastar district, Chhattisgarh; and Koraput district, Odisha). The study will be started in Sept 2016 and will be completed in  August 2017. It is a one arm prospective study.

The study population is febrile patients aged between 6 months and 60 years, inclusive, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Female minors aged 12-17 years and unmarried females aged 18 years and above will be excluded as subjecting them to pregnancy testing is unacceptable according to the local customs and cultures. A target sample of 88 patients will be enrolled in each site.

Artemether-lumefantrine (twice daily dose for 3 days) will be given under direct supervision. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.

As primary outcomes, the proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined. The secondary endpoints include the frequency of adverse events and frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13).
