  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sexual dysfunction is an important adverse drug reactions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor(SSRIs) drugs. In some limited animal studies sexual dysfunction has been related to changes in oxytocin and prolactin levels due to usage of SSRIs. Flouxetine  can cause more suppression in oxytocin than citalopram and less suppression in prolactin than citalopram. It  has been postulated that decrease in oxytocin  and increase in  prolactin is responsible for more sexual abnormality adverse effects by fluoxetine versus citalopram. In this study we have selected some depressed women who need to starting an SSRIs. We randomized depressed women to give either fluoxetine 20 mg/day or citalopram 20 mg/day. After 4 weeks we have determined sexual dysfunction and oxytocin and prolactin levels in both groups.  Finally severity of sexual dysfunction and oxytocin and prolactin will be compare in two groups.     </summary>
