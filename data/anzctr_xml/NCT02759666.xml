    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - SHR3162

Experimental: SHR3162 - The 6 dose levels in this study are 20 mg once daily (QD), 40 mg QD, 40 mg twice daily (BID), 60 mg BID, 80 mg BID, and 100 mg BID. In each dose cohort, 3 to 6 participants (traditional "3+3" design) will be enrolled. SHR3162 was administered once daily in dose levels 1 and 2 and will be administered twice daily in dose levels 3 to 6.


Treatment: drugs: SHR3162
SHR3162 capsule(s) is administered orally QD.
