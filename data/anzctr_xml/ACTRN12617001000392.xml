  <interventions>
    <interventions>Olaparib will be administered orally twice daily at 300 mgs (2 tablets).  Olaparib will be administered for 28 days before starting durvalumab on day 1 of cycle 2. Patients will receive a fixed dose of 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion every 4 weeks for up to 13 cycles (28 day cycles). Patients will be treated until they are no longer deriving benefit in the opinion of the treating clinician or the patient. Treatment will stop short of the 13 cycles if there is disease progression, intolerable toxicity or patient withdrawal for another reason.

Retreatment with durvalumab is allowed (once only) for patients meeting the retreatment criteria below. The same treatment guidelines followed during the initial 13-cycle treatment period will be followed during the retreatment period, including the same dose and frequency of treatments and the same Schedule of Assessments.

Patients who complete 13 cycles of treatment and achieve disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to the end of this treatment period may restart treatment with durvalumab upon evidence of progression, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1.

Before restarting treatment with durvalumab, the Investigator must ensure that the patient:

a)	Does not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate treatment will not further benefit the patient

b)	Still fulfils the eligibility criteria for treatment, including consenting to restart durvalumab

c)	Has not received an intervening systemic anticancer therapy after their assigned treatment discontinuation.

d)	Has had a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting durvalumab. All further scans will take place 8 weekly from the date of first treatment.

Treatment through progression is at the Investigators discretion, and the Investigator must ensure that patients do not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate that continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient.

Patients who the Investigator determines may not continue treatment will enter follow-up.

Total treatment on this study will be approximately two years with further treatment to be discussed with the treating clinician.

Participating institutions will maintain a record of drug dispensed for each patient and record any unused drug returned to the pharmacy.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary end point is disease control defined as a composite of:
1. Objective tumour response (OTR), based on complete and partial responses using cancer specific response criteria; and/or
2. Time to progressive disease exceeds the documented time to progressive disease on the last treatment prior to substudy entry by at least 1.3 times (TTP2/TTP1 greater than 1.3).
* Or exceeds 6 months if TTP1 is not evaluable.

CT scans for disease evaluation will take place every 8 weeks until progression.
Where disease evaluation is not based on CT scans alternative validated guidelines, such as
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria will be employed.
Where radiological progression cannot be assessed, evidence for clinical progression will be documented. These data will be collected from patient questionnaires, such as quality of life per the QLQ-C30 version 3 or Brief Pain Inventory, if applicable or clinical reports to  supplement the primary
outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour progression will be monitored by CT scans (or other imaging as appropriate) and GCIG and PCWG2 criteria every 8 weeks until disease progression.
Quality of life or pain scores, if applicable will be collected every 4 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS) (death from any cause)

      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of treatment (rates of adverse events) assessed according to CTC AE version 4.03.

Some, but not all, common expected adverse events for the combination with olaparib and durvalumab single treatment include: diarrhoea, tiredness, decreased kidney function, dizziness

    <statisticalmethods>A group of 48 patients will be treated with olaparib in combination with durvalumab. Patients will be allocated to 3 sub-groups of 16 patients each, based on the type of HR repair defect. HR pathway defects are classified into three different categories, as follows:
Group 1: Germline or somatic deleterious mutations/deletions in BRCA1 or BRCA2; OR
Group 2 and 3: Germline or somatic mutations/deletions in non-BRCA1/2 HR pathway genes (including ATM, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, CHEK1, CHEK2, ATR, CDK12, BAP1, BARD1, BRIP1 and FANC genes).

For group 2 and 3, HRD scores determined post-hoc will be used to divide non-BRCA1/2 HR defects into the 2 groups below at the end of the study. The median score will be used as an arbitrary cut-off to divide patients into two equal groups of 16 patients:
Group 2: HRD high Group 3: HRD low
Each group will be considered a substudy for the purpose of the MoST program.

As described in the framework protocol (ACTRN12616000908437), substudies with greater than or equal to 3 out of 16 responding patients, will in general be sufficiently interesting to investigate further. As a general rule, substudies with less than 3 out of 16 responses will be considered to not support the molecular hypothesis behind the substudy.

If some activity is recognised in a 16 patient substudy cohort but further information is needed to inform development of phase II testing, iterative substudies may be opened to enrich for patients that harbour a specific common biomarker or histologic cancer subtype. 

Each such iteration would constitute a new substudy for the purposes of this framework.

The sample size and guiding definitions of what constitutes an interesting signal are determined empirically as the investigators considered these numbers of patients as sufficient for signal-seeking purpose.

The PD-L1 and TIL expression levels will be determined post hoc and will not guide treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a substudy of the Cancer Molecular Screening and Therapeutics (MoST) Program, which is registered on ANZCTR with ID ACTRN12616000908437. This substudy will evaluate the activity of olaparib treatment in combination with durvalumab  in patients with advanced cancers and tumours.
Who is it for? All participants in this study must have completed screening as part of the Cancer Molecular Screening and Therapeutics (MoST) Program (ACTRN12616000908437), and been identified as having one of the following molecular targets: Germline or somatic deleterious mutations/deletions in BRCA1 or BRCA2; OR germline or somatic mutations/deletions in non-BRCA1/2 HR pathway genes (including ATM, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, CHEK1, CHEK2, ATR, CDK12, BAP1, BARD1, BRIP1 and FANC genes).

Study details: All participants in this study will take the oral drug olaparib for 28 days alone and then add the intravenous drug durvalumab once every 28 days. Treatment with durvalumab will be administered once every 28 days until 13 cycles are complete. Olaparib treatment will continue until progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Retreatment with durvalumab after 13 cycles will be discussed with you by your doctor.

All participants will undergo assessments at 8 weekly intervals or as clinically indicated in order to evaluate tumour response, safety and tolerability of treatment, health related quality of life during treatment, and overall survival.

We cannot guarantee that patients will receive any benefits from this study. This study is being carried out to improve the way we treat cancer patients who may have limited treatment options available to them. It is hoped that treatment will be well tolerated and will improve outcomes for future patients, however, there may be no clear benefit from participation in this study.</summary>
