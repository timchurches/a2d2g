  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will assess older clients newly registered to a community home nursing organisation that have been referred for diabetes management, and will identify each persons current management, including medications and community supports, and whether these are aligned with best practice (The McKellar Guidelines for Managing Older People with Diabetes in Residential and Other Care Settings; IDF Global Guideline for Managing Older People with Type 2 Diabetes; RACGP Guideline - General Practice Management of Type 2 Diabetes). We will ascertain the capacity of older participants for self-management and risk management, and a person-centred, individualised management plan will be developed by a Diabetes Team, consisting of a credentialled diabetes educator (CDE) and endocrinologist, working together with the older community member. The individualised management plan will take into account factors such as an individuals glycaemic control, the functional status of the person, presence of comorbidities, and associated medical treatments. Participants will be reviewed by the endocrinologist via video-conferencing in the participants home with the participant and the CDE at baseline (week 2) and at 20 weeks after recruitment. It is anticipated the duration of each video-conference will be 30 minutes. Blood glucose management will be ascertained through the use of flash glucose monitoring, where data will be gathered for two weeks after recruitment into the study (week 0-2), and then two weeks after the 16-week intervention period (week 18-20). At 20 weeks the Diabetes Team will undertake the final review and we will review the impact of the intervention on measures important to community members, that is, quality of life, wellbeing, psychological distress and treatment satisfaction as well as biomedical markers, such as time spent outside optimum blood glucose target levels, hypoglycaemia episodes, HbA1c and safety, such as hospitalisations, recurrent infections and falls.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Simons two stage design will be used (Simon, 1989). The null hypothesis that the true proportion of patients without safety event is 0.6 (i.e. 60%) will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the first stage, 11 patients will be accrued. If 7 or fewer patients in these 11 patients do not have a safety event (i.e. 4 or more patients do have a safety event), the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 32 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 43. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 31 or more patients do not have a safety event (i.e. 12 or less patients do have a safety event) in the total of 43 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 0.8 when the true proportion of patients without a safety event is 0.8 (i.e. true proportion of patients with safety event is 0.2).
Baseline data will be descriptive, outlining the current status of older people seen by the community nursing organization, and their diabetes management.  Quantitative data will be presented as proportions, means (standard deviations) or, for variables that did not conform to a normal or log-normal distribution, medians (interquartile range). Comparison of paired data will be by paired t-tests, McNemars test, or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test as appropriate. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS (version 21, IBM Armonk, New York, USA). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, 43 people with diabetes referred to a community nursing organisation which visits patients in their home will be recruited in a prospective study.  The current diabetes management of this group will be described.  Participants individual needs will be assessed by a Diabetes Team, consisting of an endocrinologist linked to an in-home credentialled diabetes educator (CDE) through video-conferencing.  The impact of individualised management on outcomes important to older people, that is, quality of life, wellbeing, treatment satisfaction, as well as biomedical markers will then determine the resources needed to undertake the assessments and management.</summary>
