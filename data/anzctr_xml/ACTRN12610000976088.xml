    <interventions>Individuals will be required to train twice weekly for up to 30  minutes at a prescibed intensity of 70% VO2 max using an arm ergometer for 12 weeks. The prescribed intensity will be monitored via a heart rate monitor and will be increased as necessary to facilitate training adaptations.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can lead to a reduction in mobility, co-ordination, muscular strength and impact an individuals ability to maintain regular exercise. As a result, the risk of developing diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease are high. Upper body exercise may provide important health benefits. This study aims to investigate whether 12 weeks of upper body exercise is effective in improving or maintaining cardiovascular fitness, increased mobility, strength and quality of life.
Participants will complete a series of tests (incremental upper body exercise, timed up and go, standing balance, functional reach, timed walk test and an SF36 quality of life questionnaire).  Participants will then be randomly assigned to training or no training. The training group will be required to complete 30 minutes of upper body ergometry exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. Individuals in the no exercise group will be asked to refrain from exercise for the 12 week period.
The results obtained from these experiments will be used to develop a greater understanding of exercise training in this group.  Improved understanding will be of value to the field of human physiology and will be useful to clinicians in the assessment of the progression of cardiovascular disease in this patient group.</summary>
