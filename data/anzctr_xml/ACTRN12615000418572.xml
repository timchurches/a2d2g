  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will evaluate the nature of cerebral blood flow using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) as well as detect any abnormalities in the larger cerebral arteries in patients with previous surgical relief of aortic coarctation compared with healthy controls. 

The procedure will take up to 60 minutes and will be performed by Dr Rachel Wong, the study coordinator, in week one. There is only one visit in this study.

TCD will be used to record mean blood flow velocities during quiet seated rest and during 180 sec of hypercapnia. The cerebrovascular responsiveness to hypercapnia will be calculated as a percentage difference between the resting blood flow velocity and the peak velocity obtained during the hypercapnia. We will then compare the differences in responsiveness between patients and controls. </interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment, observation only.
Control subjects will be age and gender matched to the participants with previous coarctation repair. They will be healthy, with no history of heart disease.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to hypercapnia at the level of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).

Increases in blood flow velocity in the MCA. Basal cerebral blood flow velocities for 10 cardiac cycles will first be recorded to determine the blood flow velocity (peak systolic, end diastolic and mean) at rest. The measures of cerebral pulsatility and resistive indexes will also be recorded simultaneously. During CVR to hypercapnia, participants breathe carbogen (5% CO2, 95% O2) for 150 seconds and the peak increase of blood flow velocity is recorded. This procedure is done in triplicates with a resting interval of at least 2min between each recording. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 1, one visit only.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CVR to hypercapnia at the level of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA)

Increases in blood flow velocity in the PCA. Basal cerebral blood flow velocities for 10 cardiac cycles will first be recorded to determine the blood flow velocity (peak systolic, end diastolic and mean) at rest. The measures of cerebral pulsatility and resistive indexes will also be recorded simultaneously. During CVR to hypercapnia, participants breathe carbogen (5% CO2, 95% O2) for 150 seconds and the peak increase of blood flow velocity is recorded.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CVR to photic stimulation

Cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to photic stimulation will be assessed using transcranial doppler ultrasound. Increase in blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) in response to photic stimulation is a robust activation paradigm that allows for the assessment of the relationship between local neuronal activities and regional blood flow in the cortex (neurovascular coupling capacity) (20). Protocol will take place in a quiet, dark room and a computer monitor will be placed 0.3m in front of the seated participant. The screen will occupy approximately 80% of the participants visual field. Mean blood flow velocities in the PCA will be recorded continuously during stimulation period.

After a baseline recording of 1 min eyes open and 1 min eyes closed, CVR to photic stimulation protocol will consist of alternating between 60s eyes closed and 40s eyes open whilst (a) looking at the monitor with a white lighted and (b) looking at an image of complex scenery. Transition between eyes open and close will be signal by an acoustic tone. Previous literature found that the blood flow velocity in the PCA will peak within 20s of photic stimulation. Discarding the first 5 s during the eyes closed, an averaged velocity of the reminding 30s will be the baseline. The vasomotor reaction time will be recorded as the time taken to reach peak velocity after opening eyes. CVR to photic stimulation will be calculated as the percentage increase of peak velocity over baseline velocity. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 1, one visit only.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cerebral artery pulsatility index (PI)

Resting cerebral blood flow pulsatility index of the MCA (peak systolic flow minus end-diastolic flow/mean blood flow velocity) will be determined during the basal blood flow recordings.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 1, one visit only.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systemic arterial compliance (AC)

Seated BP and AC will be assessed after resting in a seated position for 10 min. Four consecutive BP, HR and AC readings were taken at 5-minute intervals by automated oscillometry using a standard BP cuff over the left brachial artery (to assess BP) and tonometer (for pulse wave analysis) positioned perpendicularly over the right radial artery with a sensitivity of at least 18% (to assess large and small artery elasticity indexes) using a Cardiovascular Profiler (HDI Cardiovascular Profiler CR2000).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Participant characteristics (body mass index, waist circumference, clinic BP, medication use, age at time of surgery, type of aortic coarctation intervention, mean 24 hour blood pressure as assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, if available, history of repeat aortic intervention, history of sleep apnoea, prior stroke or myocardial infarction) will be used as covariates. Age and gender may be added as covariates if they are significantly correlated with the outcome measures. Echocardiography and cross sectional imaging (CT/MRI aorta), where available, will be assessed.

Participant characteristics will be used as covariates if they are significantly correlated with the outcome measures. A two-sample t-test will be used to compare the group differences in outcome measures. Where appropriate, Bonferroni adjustments will be made to allow for multiple comparisons.

As this is a pilot cross-sectional investigation, we will recruit 12 to 15 patients and age and gender match them with healthy controls. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Congenital heart disease in adults is an increasingly important area. Aortic coarctation is a congenital cardiac condition; clinical presentation may vary from a patient with no symptoms to severe, early cardiac failure. Aortic coarctation is typically associated with high blood pressure or hypertension.

Survival into adult life is excellent, however, a number of late complications are increasingly recognized. These include a tendency to difficult to control hypertension and the potential formation of cerebral aneurysm. An aneurysm is a weak area in a blood vessel that usually enlarges. It is often described as a ballooning of the blood vessel. Such cerebral, or brain aneurysms are potentially lethal.

In this study, we are looking to determine whether patients with previous aortic coarctation repair may have disturbances in the blood flow in their brain. We will use transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to measure blood flow in the brain to compare patients who have previous surgical repair of aortic coarctation with healthy control participants.</summary>
