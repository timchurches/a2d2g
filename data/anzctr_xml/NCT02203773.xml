Experimental: ABT-199 + Decitabine - Treatment Naive Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

Experimental: ABT-199 + Azacitidine - Treatment Naive Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

Experimental: ABT-199+Decitabine+Posaconazole - Treatment Naive Acute Myelogenous Leukemia


Treatment: drugs: ABT-199
ABT-199 is taken orally once daily starting on Day 2 of cycle 1 and begin on day 1 of every other cycle thereafter. This is a dose escalation study, therefore the dose of ABT-199 will change.

Treatment: drugs: Decitabine
Decitabine will be administered by IV infusion over 1 hour beginning on Day 1 thru Day 5 of each Cycle for a minimum of 4 Cycles

Treatment: drugs: Azacitidine
Azacitidine will be administered by IV infusion over 10 to 40 minutes or subcutaneously based on the institutional guidelines, beginning on Day 1 through Day 7 of each Cycle, for a minimum of 4 Cycles.

Treatment: drugs: Posaconazole
Posaconazole will be administered twice a day on Cycle 1 Day 21 and once daily from Cycle 1 Day 22 to Cycle 1 Day 28.

    <summary>This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the safety of
      orally administered ABT-199 combined with decitabine or azacitidine and the preliminary
