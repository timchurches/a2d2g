    <interventions>Dignity Therapy

Dignity Therapy is a brief individualized psychological therapy specifically intended for terminally ill patients (Chochinov et al., 2004). It provides patients with an opportunity to create a legacy document that includes aspects of their life that they see as important or meaningful, personal history that they would want others to know, words of wisdom, personal values, hopes and dreams for their loved ones and things that need to be said to their loved ones. Patients are guided through protocol questions, and the legacy document is created when a clinician records, transcribes, edits, and presents back the transcription of the session/s back to the patient who can then choose who they would give the legacy document to. It is a relatively brief intervention in that it typically takes one to three 45-minute sessions face-to-face with patient and additional time to transcribe the sessions, make edits and present the legacy document.</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Waitlist Control
2. Life Review

Participants in the Waitlist Control Group will be offered Dignity Therapy after a waiting period of one week. This waiting period is population-specific in that it will allow for better control of potential inflated benefits of intervention groups that could occur due to patient deterioration. They will complete assessment measures at three times: (1) at beginning of waiting period, (2) prior to Dignity Therapy, and (3) after Dignity Therapy. 

Life Review also involves face-to-face discussion about past life experiences, important achievements, personal values and hopes and dreams for loved ones. This process is expected to take one to three 45-minute sessions. Key difference between Life Review and Dignity Therapy is that Life Review does not involve creation of a legacy document.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sense of Dignity. This is measured by the Patient Dignity Inventory, which is a reliable and valid 25-item measure of dignity-related distress that is based on the Dignity Model (Chochinov et al., 2008)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test 
Pre-test 2 (Waitlist Control group - seven days after pre-test)
Post-test (three days after Dignity Therapy or Life Review)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sense of Generativity and Ego Integrity. This is measured by the Generativity and Ego-Integrity Questionnaire that was purpose-developed and piloted specifically for this study. This measure has 11 items. 

Based on Erikson's theory of psychosocial development, Generativity refers to a person's concern for the next generation, for passing skills and knowledge to others, for being productive, and for leaving a lasting legacy. Ego Integrity refers to looking back on one's life with a sense of meaning, acceptance of past life events, and the absence of death anxiety.</outcome>

Pre-test 2 (Waitlist Control group - seven days after pre-test)
Post-test (three days after Dignity Therapy or Life Review)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived Quality of Life. This is measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, version 4 (FACT-G) 

The FACT-G is a core questionnaire in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System. FACIT is a collection of quality of life questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness and it also includes supplemental measures targeted towards specific diseases, conditions or treatments. The FACT-G contains 27 items divided into four primary quality of life domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. The FACT-G has established psychometric properties with good reliability and validity and it is appropriate for use with patients with all forms of cancer and other chronic illness conditions (Overcash et al., 2001; Webster, Cella &amp; Yost, 2003; Webster et al., 1999).</outcome>

Pre-test 2 (Waitlist Control group - seven days after pre-test)
Post-test (three days after Dignity Therapy or Life Review)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinician-rated functional ability and phase of illness as measured by the Palliative Care Phase Instrument (PCPI).

PCPI categorises a patient into one of five phases of illness (1 = stable, 2 = unstable, 3 = deteriorating, 4 = terminal, 5 = bereaved).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinician-rated functional ability and phase of illness as measured Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS).

KPS is a measure of patients' overall function or ability to perform activities of daily living on a scale from 0 to 100 (100 = Normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease, 0 = Dead).</outcome>

      <outcome>Clinician-rated functional ability and phase of illness as measured by Resource Utilization Groups - Activities of Daily Living (RUG-ADL).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a new intervention called Dignity Therapy in patients with advanced cancer and patients receiving palliative care. Effects on sense of dignity, distress and quality of life will be investigated. 

Who is it for?
You can join this study if: (a) you have a diagnosis of advanced cancer with life expectancy of 12 months or less, (b) you have no significant cognitive impairment, (c) you are at least 18 years of age, and (d) have at least basic fluency in English language. 

Trial Details:
Dignity Therapy aims to strengthen a persons sense of worth, meaning and purpose by allowing people to create a lasting legacy document for their loved ones. A legacy document can include information about a persons life that they see as important or meaningful, personal history that they would want others to know about, words of wisdom and life lessons, personal values, hopes and dreams for their loved ones, words of advice and things that need to be said or repeated to their loved ones. A legacy document is created when an audio recording of this discussion is transcribed and given back to participants to make any necessary changes. Additions to legacy documents can also be made at this time. A final legacy document is given back to participants in paper form and a digital copy is also included on an archival CD. Although initial evaluations of Dignity Therapy in Western Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have yielded positive results for both participants and their families, further research is required before conclusions can be made about effectiveness of Dignity Therapy. 

This study also aims to evaluate a similar intervention called Life Review. This intervention also involves discussion about past life experiences, important achievements, personal values and hopes and dreams for loved ones. However, Life Review is different to Dignity Therapy in that it does not involve creation of a legacy document. This discussion also needs to be recorded in order to make sure that the two interventions were delivered in an identical way. Direct comparison of these two interventions has never been done before. This will allow for specific conclusions to be made about their effectiveness in helping patients with advanced illnesses and their families.  

Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of three groups. One group will receive Dignity Therapy, second group will undergo Life Review and third group will receive standard care for 1 week and then undergo Dignity Therapy. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires before and after treatment to assess their sense of dignity, distress and quality of life.</summary>
