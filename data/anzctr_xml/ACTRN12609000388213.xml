  <interventions>
    <interventions>The proposed study will be delivered in 4 phases to coincide with the 3 levels of the intervention with a fourth phase to explore the stages of change:
Phase I- This phase includes the delivery of educational presentations on nutrition, exercise and other health life style habits. These educational sessions will be presented in the workplace to encourage participation.  The 3 sessions will each take approximatly 30 minutes and will be hld one per month, therefore taking approximately 3 months.
Phase II- The second phase includes monthly monitoring Body Mass Index (BMI) competitions. Once a month participants will be weighed and measured. These measurements will be recorded and used as the outcome measure. A competition will be established between organisations to compare the proportion of the team decreasing in body mass index (BMI) and will last about 12 months.
Phase III- The third phase involves a lifestyle coaching program. This will consist of a weight loss program tailored to the needs of participants and will be monitored at regular intervals through routine follow-up with a lifestyle coach (four session over approximately 6 months). 
Phase IV-The fourth phase includes individual interviews with participants to evaluate the intervention and to explore in depth the stages of change experienced during the program. The interviews will be held participants post program completion (one interview per participant) and will last approximately 30 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>A comparison group is included in the third phase of the project, the lifestyle coaching. Participants in the lifestyle coaching program will be compared to non-participants who remain only in phase two: the Body Mass Index competition. The comparion group will go through all phases EXCEPT phase three. As phase four is only an evaluation phase the comparion group are not exposed to any further intervention following phase two. This study is not suitable as a cross over trial.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in body mass index measured in kg/m2. This will be measured by height (measured with a standard height measuring device) and weight (measured with electronic scales) measurements. These measurements will be taken at baseline then monthly for the duration of the intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, then monthly for duration of the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adopting healthy diet and excercise patterns, measured by self report well validated tools. Diet: Wright and Scott's (2000) Fat and Fibre Barometer.
Activity: Active Australia Survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Survey will be completed at four timepoints.
(T1), post- education/pre-body mass index competition (T2), mid- body mass index competition/pre-lifestyle coaching (T3) and post project implementation (T4).</timepoint>
