  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention that is being trialled is a gel complex consisting of Chitosan-Dextran gel plus Budesonide plus Ropivacaine. 10mLs of this complex will be applied to the sinonasal cavity immediately following endoscopic sinus surgery by the surgeon. The complex will include the Chitosan-Dextran gel (5% Succinyl-Chitosan &amp; 300mg Dextran-aldehyde), 1mL of 1% Ropivacaine (10mg/mL), 2mL of Budesonide (1mg). This complex will be applied twice to each patient (Once for each sinus side).  </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparative treatment is the same gel complex including dosages without the addition of ropivacaine. Therefore Chitosan-Dextran gel plus Budesonide will be applied to each sinus side, without the addition of Ropivacaine. It will be applied to the sinonasal cavity immediately following endoscopic sinus surgery by the surgeon. </comparator>

      <timepoint>Pain scores will be collected at pre-determined time points for a week following the surgery. 

The time-points are as follows:
- 2 hours after the procedure
- 12 hours after the procedure
- 24 hours after the procedure
- 2 days after the procedure
- 3 days after the procedure
- 4 days after the procedure
- 5 days after the procedure
- 6 days after the procedure
- 7 days after the procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence and magnitude of adhesions using an ordinal scale following endoscopic sinus surgery, as determined by endoscopic video recordings of the sinuses by the treating surgeon. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Endoscopic video recording will occur at 2 weeks, 8 weeks and 3 months following endoscopic sinus surgery. </timepoint>

Allocation concealment will only apply to the treating surgeon responsible for administering the gel complex to the sinuses.

The associate investigator cannot be blinded to the treatment as they are responsible for mixing of the gel with the active medications. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to further develop a nasal dressing for use after endoscopic sinus surgery. The gel being use is called Chitodex (Chitosan-Dextran gel) and has already been shown to be effective in controlling blood loss and reducing adhesions after endoscopic sinus surgery. The effectiveness and safety of the gel has been demonstrated in numerous human and animal trials. 

We are trying to incorporate additional medications into the gel to further accentuate it's uses after endoscopic sinus surgery. The addition of budesonide has shown to reduce adhesions and inflammation after sinus surgery, thus reducing the failure rate of the operation and the chance a patient needs another procedure. This has been demonstrated in a clinical trial.

We hypothesise that the addition of a local anaesthetic to the gel, known as ropivacaine, will reduce the pain and discomfort that patients typically experience after endoscopic sinus surgery. </summary>
