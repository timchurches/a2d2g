    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the general population by way of flyers, posters, information sessions and Curtin University radio and email communication systems. Flyers will be distributed around the university as well as in public places such as shopping centres. Access to the email adresses of both staff and students from the Faculty of Health Sciences will be requested in order to directly invite them to participate in the study.Individuals that express interest will complete a questionnaire to determine whether they meet the selection criteria. If they do, further details of the study will be explained to them and they can decide whether they are willing to participate. Those that agree will be required to attend an information session at Curtin University during which informed consent will be obtained and the study objectives and participant requirements will be further explained. Allocation is concealed in sealed silver foil sachets labelled with a six digit code. Allocation file is held  by a single administrator /code keeper at central administration. Participants will be randomised to either the test treatment, PGX (n = 60) or the rice flour placebo (n = 60).</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation was generated using computer generated  three digit codes. So the participants are coded  with 3 digits.
Each foil sachet (single dose) is stamped with a 6 digit code which incorporated the participant code and production code. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Mean within-group changes in frequency of eating occasions will be assessed using repeated-measures analysis, while time-by-treatment analysis of covariance will be used to determine between-group differences over time. Within-group changes, paired sample t test will be used as there are only two time points. Weight, height, waist circumference:Treatment effect can be examined by analysis of time-by-treatment variables.Using general linear models, regression analysis will be used to determine the extent to which body weight changed between baseline and the final week of the study. For occasion of eating
The maximum times of eating occasions is set at 10 with a expected drop of 2 occasions and allowing for a drop of 5 or 3 meals in a day, plus allowing for an increase (though not expected).So mu0 10, mu1 8 and sigma 5 to give a power of 0.8 requires 50 participants.
For weight loss
The lowest weight expected is 80Kg with a 4 kg loss and possible 12 kg loss -SO mu0 80kg, mu1 76kg and sigma 12 requires 71 participants . The upper weight limit of 95kg and maximum 5-18 kg loss so  mu0 95kg, mu1 90 and sigma of 18 , 108 participants are required. The 120 subjects are to allow for drop outs.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect that a viscous fibre supplement, PGX, has on frequency of eating occasions in overweight adults, over a 12-week period. In addition to this, body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and fasting venous blood samples will be measured both at baseline and post-intervention. The blood samples will be used to measure glucose, insulin, changes in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides, cholestrol (total, HDL and LDL) and apoB48. Eating occasions will be recorded using a mobile device food record and automatically uploaded to a server for analysis. It is hypothesised that the fibre supplement will reduce the frequency of eating occasions, leading to a subsequent reduction in body weight.
OBJECTIVES 
1.	To investigate the effect of a viscous fibre supplement on frequency of eating occasions in overweight adults, over a 12-week period.
2.	To measure body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and fasting venous blood samples differences between baseline and at the end of the 12-week intervention. 

Aim 
1.	To investigate the effect of a viscous fibre supplement has on frequency of eating occasions in overweight adults
Hypothesis
Overweight adults receiving the viscous soluble fibre (PGX) will significantly reduce their intake of energy-dense nutrient poor foods and number of eating occasions compared with controls
