    <interventions>Intervention Arm:  Students in schools in the intervention arm will receive standard treatment (see control) in addition to an intervention.

The intervention to be evaluated will take place over a 2 year time period, and is made up of three main components: an adolescent intervention, a parent/adolescent decision aid, and logistical strategies. Prior to the first dose of the HPV vaccination, education is delivered by school personnel through the school in an interactive session of approximately 45-50 minutes. The education intervention will take place before the first dose of the HPV vaccine is administered and ideally, before the vaccination consent forms have gone home to parents/guardians. As each school chooses when to undertake the education intervention as it fits in with their time-tabling, the time between the education intervention and the first dose of the vaccine will vary, but is most likely to take place within a few weeks of the administration of the first dose. An educational magazine is given to students as take-home information designed by and for adolescents; a website and app providing information for students to access in and outside of school; and distraction/relaxation app for students to be used on vaccination day.  

A parent/adolescent HPV Decision Aid or a brief HPV information resource for parents and adolescents to use together is delivered to parents and adolescents at the time of the vaccination consent form. 
 
Logistical strategies include 1) guidelines for nurses and teachers regarding set-up of the vaccination room; 2) strategies to promote improved consent form return (reminders, direct mail-out to parents, incentives e.g. classroom consent form return); 3) additional vaccination days to mop-up absent students.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is the standard national school-based HPV vaccination program that takes place across all jurisdictions. This includes government funded HPV vaccination  (three doses) for adolescents after parental/guardian consent has been granted. As part of this process parents/guardians receive a standard government brochure that provides information about HPV and HPV vaccination. </comparator>

The trial statistician, who has no involvement in recruitment, will allocate schools using the randomization list after the school has agreed to take part. Schools will be allocated according to the list in the order in which they are recruited. After the school has been allocated recruiters and schools will no longer be blind to intervention/control status. Where possible the schools will not be allocated until the target number in the strata has been reached.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A total of 36 schools will allow the detection of a change in the percentage of students vaccinated from 70% to 80% at a significance level of 0.05 and with a power of 80% and assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05 (Donner, 2000). We estimated the ICC from a pilot study in NSW to be 0.04, and other cluster trials in adolescents health behaviours have reported ICCs of less than 0.05 (Murray, 2003) To allow for the possibility of schools dropping out we will increase the number of schools by 10% and recruit a total of 40 schools. On average each school of the 36 schools will have 150 students giving a total sample size of 5400 students.
With a total of 36 schools we would be able to detect the following differences between the intervention and control groups for the four secondary outcomes 1) Knowledge: minimum detectable difference "equals" = 0.7; 2) Self-efficacy: minimum detectable difference "equals" = 18; 3) Fear/anxiety: minimum detectable difference "equals"= 0.7; 4). Decision making: minimum detectable difference "equals"= 0.5, all assuming an ICC of 0.05, power of 80%, significance of 0.05 and standard deviations derived from a pilot study evaluating each of these measures and allowing for a 40% non-completion of these outcomes.
Outcome measures and analysis:  
Primary outcome measurement: Vaccination uptake for all participating schools will be sought from WA Health and SA Health for the previous year of school vaccination and in the two years of the study implementation. The three-dose HPV immunisation completion rates will be compared between the intervention and control schools.
Primary outcome analysis:  The primary analysis will compare vaccination rates using the Mantel-Haenszel method taking into account the stratification by year, state and school sector and adjusted for clustering. (Donner, 2000) In addition, logistic regression models will be used to adjust for baseline vaccination rates (average of the previous 2 years), school type (single sex, or mixed), school size and SEIFA index using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with robust standard errors. The level of implementation of the intervention will also be included in the regression model to determine its impact on vaccination rates.
Secondary outcome measurement: The questionnaire will be administered in schools in control and intervention groups pre dose 1 (all domains of the questionnaire: 'Skills Inventory', 'Feelings toward vaccination', 'Knowledge'), pre dose 2 ('Skills inventory', and 'feelings towards vaccination'), and post dose 3 ('Knowledge' and self-reported vaccination status). Pre-dose 1 control school data will provide a baseline mean knowledge score- this approach allows for evaluation of the intervention without the possibility of questionnaire impact confounding the outcome. In both groups, consent form return, proportion of students vaccinated and time to vaccinate 50 students will be measured at dose 1, 2 and 3.

Secondary outcome analysis: Mean change in scores of knowledge, self-efficacy, fear/anxiety, and decision making will be compared between groups using two-sample t-tests with appropriate adjustment for clustering. Baseline scores for knowledge will be taken from the control group. Also, the mean scores of fear/anxiety and self-efficacy before the first vaccination and before the second vaccination for the intervention group will be compared.  Proportion of consent form returns will be compared between groups pre dose 1 using Chi square test with appropriate adjustment for clustering. Time taken to vaccinate will be measured by nurses during each immunisation day in both intervention and control schools. It will be calculated as the mean time to vaccinate 50 girls in intervention schools compared with control schools.  Mean time to vaccinate will be compared between groups in both years of the study to determine effect of the intervention on time. 

We will investigate whether the intervention improves vaccination rates through its effect on fear reduction, and self-efficacy increase, by comparing estimates of the effect of the intervention both with, and without, adjustment for the possible intermediary variables of fear/anxiety, and self-efficacy. These logistic regression models will use GEE and robust standard errors to account for the clustering.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the effect of a complex intervention including education and logistical strategies, to promote uptake of school-based Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among adolescents in the Australian national School-Based Vaccination Program.

Who is it for?
We will recruit a random sample of Australian secondary schools to be part of this study; adolescents in these schools who are offered HPV vaccine as part of the national school vaccination program have the option to participate in our study.

Trial details
Schools participating in this trial will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of two groups. Schools who are in one group will deliver a complex intervention for promoting the uptake of the HPV vaccination among adolescents in a school-based program which consists of an adolescent intervention, a parent/adolescent decision aid, and logistical strategies. Prior to the first dose of the HPV vaccination, education is delivered by school personnel through the school in an interactive session. An educational magazine is given to students as take-home information designed by and for adolescents; a website and app providing information for students to access in and outside of school; and distraction/relaxation app for students to be used on vaccination day. A parent/adolescent HPV Decision Aid or a brief HPV information resource for parents and adolescents to use together is delivered to parents and adolescents at the time of the vaccination consent form. Logistical strategies include 1) guidelines for nurses and teachers regarding set-up of the vaccination room; 2) strategies to promote improved consent form return (reminders, direct mail-out to parents, incentives e.g. Classroom consent form return); 3) up to one additional vaccination visit to deliver mop-up vaccination to students incompletely vaccinated. Participants in the second group will receive the standard national school-based HPV vaccination program that takes place across all jurisdictions. This includes government funded HPV vaccination (three doses) for adolescents after parental/guardian consent has been granted. As part of this process parents/guardians receive a standard government brochure that provides information about HPV and HPV vaccination, and nurses follow standard state health department policy for delivery of vaccine in schools.</summary>
