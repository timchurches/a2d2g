  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this pilot randomised controlled trial is to establish the fundamental elements (feasibility, adequacy of blinding, pharmacodynamic effect and separation of endpoints) required to proceed with a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial of beta-lactam antibiotics delivered by continuous infusion compared to standard bolus dosing in critically ill patients. We hypothesise that continuous infusion will more consistently achieve pharmacodynamic endpoints than standard bolus dosing, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.</summary>
