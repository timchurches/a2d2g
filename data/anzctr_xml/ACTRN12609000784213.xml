  <interventions>
    <interventions>Emotion recognition training (ERT) plus 4 doses of nasal spray oxytocin. The ERT program for children is designed to be used together with the Mindreading (MR) program which was developed by Simon Baron-Cohen from Cambridge University.  The program, delivered by a trained therapist, aims to train children about emotions.   The ERT program will be delivered over four consecutive days.  Each session will require approximately 90mins and involves workbook activities, computer tasks and role play.  The participants will receive 1 dose of Oxytocin prior to commencing ERT (one dose per day).</interventions>
    <comparator>Active emotion recognition training plus placebo.  The emotion recognition training (ERT) is exactly the same as administered to the treatment group.  The placebo with be administered, via a nasal spray, on 4 occasions, once daily prior to the ERT.  The placebo contains Glycerine, Methyl Parraben, Propyl Paraben and Purified Water.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Eye gaze to human eyes of computer faces, and participant's primary caregiver.  We will be measuring the duration of time spend looking at the eyes of faces on computer screen during an emotion recognition task.  This will be measured using eye tracking equipment.  We will also measure the amount of time the participant spends looking at the eyes of his primary caregiver during a family observation task.  Thsi will be measured through a coding system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four; pre, 2 x during, and post.  The first time point refers to data gathered 3 months prior to treatment commencing.  Data will then be gathered the day prior to treatment and each day of treatment.  The final time point will be 3 months following treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome is positive social interaction with primary caregiver.  This will be measured via a coding system during the family observation tasks and also through parent/guardian questionnaires</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four; pre, 2 x during, and post.  The first time point refers to data gathered 3 months prior to treatment commencing.  Data will then be gathered the day prior to treatment and each day of treatment.  The final time point will be 3 months following treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this proposed
research is to test precisely whether Oxytocin (OT) potentiates learning of emotion recognition training, improving
processing of emotion information, thus leading to an increase in the quality and quantity of participants' social
interactions with a parent or guardian. 

Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups, (1) combined Oxytocin (OT) and emotion recognition training (ERT),(2) combined placebo and Emotion Recognition Training. Effects will be examined at three levels; 1) immediate, 2) intermediate and 3) distal. Immediate effects refer to the direct impact of combined Oxytocin and Emotion Recognition Training on the basic components of social interaction.  The intermediate effects of interest refer to the social interactions recorded by parents/guardians in the extended period (24 hours) following combined Oxytocin administration and Emotion Recognition Training. Distal effects will also be determined to gauge the potential for cumulative effects of combined Oxytocin and Emotion Recognition Training over a number of consecutive administrations.</summary>
