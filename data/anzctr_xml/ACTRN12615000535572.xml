  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be put on a upward titrating dose of prazosin for 16 consecutive days, followed by a downward titrating dose for 6 consecutive days. The dosing schedule is:  2 days of 0mg (placebo), 2 days of 1mg, 3 days of 2mg, 3 days of 4mg and 6 days of 8mg. Then, 2 days of 4mg, 2 days of 2 mg, and 2 days of 1mg . Medication is taken as 2 capsules at bedtime. Medication containers will be return to the study team as a check for adherence.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>- REM minutes (the total amount of minutes spent in REM sleep over the course of the night), assessed with overnight sleep study using polysomnography.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcomes will be measured on nights 2, 9, and 16 of the prazosin protocol; doses 0mg (placebo), 4mg and 8mg respectively. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>- REM efficiency (the percentage of epoch's during a REM episode measured as REM - a measurement of REM fragmentation),  assessed with overnight sleep study using  polysomnography.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcomes will be measured on nights 2, 9, and 16 of the prazosin protocol; doses 0mg (placebo), 4mg and 8mg respectively. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> REM onset latency (the time it takes between sleep onset and the appearance of REM sleep), assessed with overnight sleep study using polysomnography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcomes will be measured on nights 2, 9, and 16 of the prazosin protocol; doses 0mg (placebo), 4mg and 8mg respectively. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Emotional memory: Positive, negative and neutral picture recall. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The International Affective Picture System (IAPS) is a database of pictures used to elicit a range of emotions. Three parallel sets of IAPS pictures will be used to test emotional memory. The sets will be learned on nights 2, 9 and 16 (at 0mg, 4mg and 8mg doses of prazosin), then tested on the morning of the 3rd, 10th and 17th days.

All participants will partake in three conditions: low, medium and high REM, corresponding to prazosin doses (0mg, 4mg and 8mg, respectively). The outcome variable for the memory test will be d, a discriminability index measuring the extent to which a participant can discriminate between targets and foils. It provides an overall measure of recognition memory. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Melatonin secretion magnitude</outcome>
      <timepoint>Melatonin secretion magnitude will be measured as the last urine sample before bed and the first sample upon waking. This magnitude will be averaged over nights 1-2, 8-9 and 15-16) for 3 secretion magnitude measures corresponding to each prazosin dose taken (0mg, 4mg and 8mg).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>A Polysomnography (PSG) will be used to record overnight brain-wave activity in participants. This will provide a measure of REM minutes, REM onset latency and REM efficiency. Changes in these measures with increasing doses of prazosin (placebo, 4mg, 8mg) will be analysed using three separate 3-level repeated-measures ANOVAs. 

The outcome variable for the memory test will be d, a discriminability index measuring the extent to which a participant can discriminate between targets and foils. It provides an overall measure of recognition memory. A 3 (REM conditions) x 3 (valence) repeated-measures ANOVA will be conducted. If the interaction is significant, the main effect of REM condition within each valence will be examined.


Melatonin secretion magnitudes will be calculated as the average between the last sample before bed and first sample upon awakening on each lab visit. These values will also be compared with a 3-level, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to look for differences between the 3 dosages of Prazosin. 

Posthoc tests will be used to determine where any significant differences lie. 

As this is the first study to examine the effects of prazosin on REM sleep in healthy controls, we designed it as a pilot study to estimate an effect size for a larger study. The sample size was chosen based  those used in the smaller published clinical studies demonstrating an effect of prazosin on nightmares.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the medication prazosin on: 1) the quantity and quality of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep; and 2) emotional memory. This is so we can learn more about the basic effects of the medication in healthy adults as a step towards better understanding how the medication might help those with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

The hypotheses are:
1. Increasing doses of prazosin will lead to greater quantity of REM sleep and fewer disruptions of REM sleep (e.g., fewer awakenings during REM sleep)
2. Increasing quality of REM sleep, resulting from increasing doses of prazosin, will lead to improved overnight memory for emotional pictures.</summary>
