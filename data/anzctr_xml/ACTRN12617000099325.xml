  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fractionated CO2 surgical laser using the Lumenis Acupulse CO2 laser system and the AcuScan 120 microscanner to provide fractional treatment, delivered by a consultant urogynaecologist
Mode of delivery will be face to face and will be provided individually. Through the use of the scanner, the laser energy is delivered in a fractional manner, from 7.5-12.5 millijoule with a 5-25% density, a penetration depth of 600 micro millimeter from the 10oclock to 2 oclock position, starting at the top of the vagina up to 5mm from the introitus. (Lumenis protocol). This will be delivered over 3x 5minute sessions, once every 4 weeks over 3 months and be performed in an urban urogynaecological clinic.</interventions>
    <comparator>sham treatment - participants will attend the urban urogynaecological clinic and be seen face to face. They will have the Lumenis Acupulse CO2 microscanner inserted into the vagina but no laser energy will be delivered. They will attend for 3x5 minutes sessions, once every 4 weeks over 3 months for sham treatment. They will cross over to active treatment at the 4 month if there is no improvement in subjective symptoms of SUI.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined as urinary leakage with activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure (e.g. cough, sneeze, laugh and exercise). SUI is a prevalent condition with high burden of suffering. Management of stress urinary incontinence includes both conservative therapy and more invasive surgical intervention.

The current main conservative approach to treatment of stress urinary incontinence is pelvic floor muscle therapy (PMFT). PFMT improves stress incontinence symptoms by 56 %. However, pelvic floor muscle therapy has poor long term compliance and women then choose more invasive surgical treatment. 

Fractionated CO2 laser has been established for use in dermatological and dental applications to stimulate collagen neogenesis and skin and tissue remodeling. Recently, use of fractionated CO2 laser has been introduced and has been successfully used for vulvovaginal atrophy. The rationale for the use of CO2 laser for treatment of SUI is to trigger tissue remodeling and regeneration to improve urethral support. Women may prefer to vaginal CO2 laser treatment as a conservative option to treat SUI over surgical intervention due to the morbidity of surgical intervention.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of fractionated CO2 laser treatment in combination with physiotherapy as a potential treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence over physiotherapy alone.
