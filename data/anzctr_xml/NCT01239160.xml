  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The treatment of lymphedema has been a major focus of attention for physicians and scientists
      for several decades. At this time, no successful techniques have been developed to prevent
      lymphedema, and therefore, a great deal of emphasis is placed on treatment modalities that
      can lessen the severity and impede the progression of this debilitating condition.

      The treatment on offer usually consists of a maintenance phase using compression garments and
      an intensive treatment phase, which includes the use of skin care, compression bandaging,
      exercise and manual lymphatic drainage (MLD). The intensive phase is usually described as
      complex decongestive therapy (CDT). This is time consuming and requires high resource usage.
      Pneumatic compression devices (PCD) offer and alternative to MLD and can be used by the
      patient. There are a number of devices on the market that are categorized into 1. without
      calibrated gradient compression 2. With calibrated gradient compression.

      This trial will compare two PCDs, a simple device without calibrated compression, and an
      advanced device with calibrated compression, in the reduction of swelling and maintenance of
      reduced limb volume in 262 patients with lower limb lymphoedema. The primary end point will
      be limb volume reduction over 12 weeks of treatment, with secondary outcome after 24 weeks.</summary>
