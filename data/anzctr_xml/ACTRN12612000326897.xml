    <interventions>This is a prospective study involving the collection of blood samples for the purposes of measuring circulating tumour DNA from two distinct cohorts of patients:
COHORT A: Patients with curatively resected stage II colon cancer- subgroups will be enrolled according to whether adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended by patients treating oncologist.

Cohort B (metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy) is a small exploratory pilot study that aims to identify how best to apply the ctDNA test and whether or not it has potential promise for use in practice. As such, a formal sample size calculation has not been performed for this subgroup. Forty patients with metastatic disease will be enrolled as a pilot study, to confirm the value of
ctDNA as a marker of disease response in this setting and to demonstrate our capability in this area.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to measure cancer specific gene changes in the blood as a biomarker in monitoring
disease status in stage II and IV colorectal cancer. Biomarkers are substances that can be found in blood and/or tumour tissue and may be used to measure the effects or progress of a disease or condition.
Genes are substances in the body which contain information about characteristics us as individuals. Previous
studies have found that the majority of colorectal cancers contain mutations in several genes (the gene is changed
or different from the common form) and that these cancerrelated
mutations can be detected in the blood.
Identifying biomarkers are important because:
they may be linked with disease progression, they may help to identify people who are most likely to benefit from a certain treatment such as chemotherapy, or they may be used to track the status of cancer without the need for invasive procedures, such as biopsies.</summary>
