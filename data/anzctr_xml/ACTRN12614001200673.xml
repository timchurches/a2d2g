  <interventions>
    <interventions>Negative-pressure wound therapy system called PICO.
PICO is a small portable device that is used to treat wounds. The PICO is carried by the patient in a back pants pocket or wherever it is the most confortable for them.
The device is left switched on for 7 consecutive days. There are no dressing changes during that period.
The PICO devive can be disconnected from the dressing for showering. 
The PICO pump maintains negative pressure wound therapy at 80 mmHg (nominal) +/- 20 mmHg to the wound
surface.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment will the use of the following for wound dressing : Jelonet or Adaptic, gauze or foam, velband, crepe bandage and tubigrip. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin graft take rate will be measure using the Visitrak Digital tablet.
The convenient and portable digital tablet is easy to handle, providing a quick, convenient and accurate area measurement. When the clinician has completed the tracing, the device emits an audible beep. The immediate default result is wound area, but functions are also provided to allow calculation of percentage wound area that is necrotic, and width and length measurements.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> The research project is studying a new type of dressing for wound to the lower leg, that requires a skin graft. The new dressing is called a PICO dressing. We aim to show that PICO dressing is as efficient as the standard dressing in terms of graft take rate, while giving participants a better quallity of life during healing and a reduced lenght of hospital stay.</summary>
