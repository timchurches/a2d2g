  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion Criteria

        Have histologically confirmed HER2+ breast carcinoma, with HER2+ defined by fluorescence in
        situ hybridization (FISH) and/or 3+ staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC)

        Have received previous treatment with a taxane, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1

        Have progression of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after last
        systemic therapy (as confirmed by investigator), or be intolerant of last systemic therapy

        Have measurable or non-measurable disease assessable by RECIST 1.1

        Be at least 18 years of age at time of consent

        Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1

        Have adequate hepatic and renal function

        Have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) = 50%

        CNS Inclusion - Based on screening brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients must
        have one of the following:

        No evidence of brain metastases

        Untreated brain metastases not needing immediate local therapy

        Previously treated brain metastases

          1. Brain metastases previously treated with local therapy may either be stable since
             treatment or may have progressed since prior local CNS therapy

          2. Patients treated with CNS local therapy for newly identified lesions found on initial
             MRI performed during screening for this study may be eligible to enroll if all of the
             following criteria are met:

        i. Time since whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is &gt; 21 days prior to first dose of
        study treatment, time since stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is &gt; 7 days prior to first dose
        of study treatment, or time since surgical resection is &gt; 28 days

        ii. Other sites of evaluable disease are present

        c. Relevant records of any CNS treatment must be available to allow for classification of
        target and non-target lesions</inclusivecriteria>

          1. lapatinib within 12 months of starting study treatment or

          2. neratinib, afatinib, or other investigational HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor
             (EGFR) or HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) at any time previously

        Have previously been treated with capecitabine for metastatic disease. Note: Patients who
        have received capecitabine for adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment at least 12 months prior
        to starting study treatment are eligible.

        Have clinically significant cardiac disease

        Are known carriers of Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C or have other known chronic liver disease

        Are known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

        Unable for any reason to undergo MRI of the brain

        Any untreated brain metastases &gt; 2.0 cm in size, unless discussed with medical monitor

        Ongoing use of systemic corticosteroids for control of symptoms of brain metastases at a
        total daily dose of &gt; 2 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent)

        Any lesion thought to require immediate local therapy. Patients who undergo local treatment
        for such lesions identified by screening MRI may still be eligible for the study based on
        criteria described under CNS inclusion criteria

        Known or concurrent leptomeningeal disease (LMD)</exclusivecriteria>
