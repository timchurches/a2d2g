  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ability to predict post-operative outcomes after implantation is important for a number
      of reasons, including being able to advise candidates of appropriate expectations using
      evidence based guidance. The approved study involves investigation of the ability to predict
      outcomes in the implanted ear alone and in the best-aided binaural listening conditions,
      examining a number of measured factors both pre-, peri- and post-operatively. The study
      incorporates a range of functional outcome measures through questionnaires to ascertain
      social, functional and demographic factors that may be predictive of outcomes. Questionnaires
      are also administered to determine the degree of benefit obtained after implantation for each
      individual, since this forms a key component of providing pre-operative counselling to
      candidates.</summary>
