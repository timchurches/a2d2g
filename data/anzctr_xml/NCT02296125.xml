Treatment: drugs - Placebo Erlotinib 150/100mg
Treatment: drugs - Placebo Gefitinib 250 mg
Treatment: drugs - Erlotinib 150/100 mg
Treatment: drugs - Gefitinib 250 mg
Treatment: drugs - Placebo AZD9291 80 mg/ 40 mg

Experimental: AZD9291 + placebo Standard of Care - AZD9291 (80 mg or 40 mg orally, once daily) plus placebo Erlotinib (150 mg or 100 mg orally, once daily) or placebo Gefitinib (250 mg orally, once daily), in accordance with the randomisation schedule.

Active Comparator: Standard of Care + placebo AZD9291 - Erlotinib (150 mg or 100 mg orally, once daily) or placebo Gefitinib (250 mg orally, once daily) plus placebo AZD9291 (80 mg or 40 mg orally, once daily), in accordance with the randomisation schedule.
