  <interventions>
    <interventions>No aspect of usual care will be changed as a result of the current study. In particular, social work assessment and interventions will be provided as per usual practice. Participation in this study will involve completing two 'questionnaires'. One will take approximately 30 seconds to complete and the other 5 to 10 minutes. The questionnaires will be completed three times: once as soon as possible post-admission to hospital, then on transfer to a general ward and then just prior to hospital discharge. The duration of the observation period will be variable depending on the length of hospital stay.</interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>All patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Royal Adelaide Hospital following trauma under the auspices of the Acute Surgical Unit or Neurosurgery Department who are referred for social work assessment and intervention, and their next-of-kin who is visiting the patient (i.e. not involved in the traumatic injury). </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of distress and anxiety of patients (and their next-of-kin) who are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Adelaide Hospital following trauma, under the auspices of the Acute Surgical Unit and/or Neurosurgery Department over the duration of their hospital stay. The aim is to ascertain the levels of distress and anxiety of patients and next-of-kins, whether these levels change over time and, if so, what they attribute this to. It is anticipated that the results will impact on the clinical practice of social workers at the Royal Adelaide Hospital by helping us to provide better and more focused services to this client group.</summary>
