  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observations of cardiac function using transthoracic echocardiography at the time of treatment interventions. Transthoracic echocardiography will be performed prior to and after treatment interventions and also after the intervention of passive leg raising to assess stroke volume changes. Transthoracic echocardiography will also be performed in healthy pregnant women at rest and during passive leg raising. Transthoracic echocardiography examination will take approximately 15 minutes. The post-intervention measurements will occur within 60 minutes of the drug being administered.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine heart function in pregnant women after they are treated for the disease of preeclampsia. The reason to do this is that the drug treatments that are used to control the high blood pressure in this disease have not been examined with respect to how they alter heart function in these sick pregnant women.</summary>
