  <interventions>
    <interventions>comparison two doses of suxamethonium in ECT. suxamethonium is a muscle relaxant administered intravenously at the time of ECT to reduce muscle spasms. It will be administered in this way on two consecutive occasions within a week of each other at the time of ECT. On one occassion, the dosage amount of Suxamethonium administered to participants will be 1.0mg/kg</interventions>
    <comparator>0.5mg/kg  suxamethonium, will be adminsitered intravenously at the time of ECT to act as a muscle relaxant to reduce the amount of muscle spasms. Each dosage amount, 1.0mg/kg and 0.5mg/kg, of Suxamethonium will be administered on only one occassion each</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>post procedure myalgia will be assessed by postprocedure questionaire completed by the patient at one hour post procedure</outcome>
      <timepoint>at one hour from procedure and at 24hrs via a phone call for the 24hr assessment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>degree of fit modification: this is assessed by an observor who will classify how well the fit was modified. A well modified fit with minimal observed spasm is desirable and a less well modified fit with more muscle spasm is undesirable</outcome>
      <timepoint>this assessment will take place at the time of the fit and the classification will take place immediately.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the status of myalgia in patients after the procedure. This will be achieved by asking the patient to nominate the degree of myalgia on a four point scale.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>quality of electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. The fit is monitored on the EEG, brain activity, and this is used to assess the adequacy of the fit. A poorly modified fit with significant muscle activity should result in artefact and poor quality recording whereas a well modified fit should result in a higher quality recording with less interference. This will be assessed off line by a blinded psychiatrist who will grade th equality of the recording on a four point scale. recordings will be presented to the assessor in a randomised fashion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>this will occur at the completion of the study period and will be blinded.</timepoint>

Thereafter this information is contained in sequentially numbered envelopes and the drug will be made up and given to the treating anaesthetist to administer by a second anaesthetist who is not involved in treating the patient</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing ECT often experience postprocedure myalgia. There is also a published range of muscle relaxant doses to minimise this occurrence. It is the purpose of this study to compare the higher and lower recommended doses to see if there is a difference in postprocedure myalgia between the two doses.</summary>
