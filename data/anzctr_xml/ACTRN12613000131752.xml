  <interventions>
    <interventions>2mg/kg sugammadex intravenously will be given only once when T2 point (two contractions) on TOF device is observed in group I patients.
TOF device is used for evaluating the level of neuromuscular block after neuromuscular blocker medications. Entubation and extubation  time of the patient decided correctly and easily by using this device. Different kinds of electrical stimulations are used like;Train-Of-Four Ratio,Single twitch,Double-burst stimulation, Post-tetanic count. We used TOF device during the surgery started after anesthesia induction (before neuromuscular blocker agent was given) to extubation time .  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1- T 0.9 reaching time of groups and significant difference between them were  tested after reversing agent administration by using  TOF accelomyelography device</outcome>
      <timepoint> 1- At 15., 30., 60., 90. seconds and 2., 5., 10.,15.,20., 25.,  30.minutes after reversing of blockade    period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1- Extubation time: At the moment of T 0.9 on TOF device inhalation gases were ceased and patients were extubated properly after spontaneous breathing. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1-At 15., 30., 60., 90. seconds and 2., 5., 10.,15.,20., 25.,  30.minutes after reversing of blockade    period.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2- Respiration status was assessed as;able to breath and coughing: 2, dyspnea or limited respiration: 1
Respiration status is one of the criteria of Modified Aldrete scoring system which is is commonly used for determining when a patient can safely be discharged from the postanesthesia care unit  The Aldrete scoring system takes into account the patient's ability to move, respiration, circulation, consciousness, and oxygen saturation. A maximum of two points are awarded in each category and a score of 9 or 10 is required for discharge. </outcome>
      <timepoint>2- At 5., 10.,15.,20., 25.,  30. minutes after extubation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3- Muscle strength were assessed as; 
  a)total paralyze: 0, no loss of muscle strength:10
  b)head elevation more than 5 seconds yes:1 , no:2
  c)exhibiting tongue yes: 1 ,no:2
 These are the signs of clinical recovery of neuromuscular function. All of them are subjective, bedside tests used in post anesthesia care unit for determining that a patient can be discharged from the unit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3- At 5., 10.,15.,20., 25.,  30. minutes after extubation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4-Hemodynamic alterations(changes on hearth rate and mean arterial blood pressure)</outcome>
      <timepoint>4-At 0., 2., 5., 10., 30. minutes after entubation and  (as well as) 15., 30., 60., 90. seconds and 2., 5., 10.,15.,20., 25.,  30.minutes after reversing of blockade    period</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Shapiro Wilk test was performed in order to reveal constant variants distributions. For constant variants descriptive analysis involved mean Â± standard deviation or median (minimum-maximum) values and for the categorical variants involved values of number of cases and percentages (%). Significance of differences of mean values tested by Students t test while significance of differences of median values tested by Mann Whitney U test. Categorical variants analysed by Pearsons Chi square or Fischers Chi-square test. Repeated measurements, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure, saturation and TOF data were evaluated by variant analysis of repeated measurements. Greenhouse-Geisser method was performed in order to detect differences among groups, in terms of follow-up durations and characteristics. Since P&lt;0.05 was accepted as error value, Bonferroni correction was performed to avoid type 1 mistakes in all multiple comparisons.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sixty children age between 2-12 in ASA I-II scheduled for elective surgery in supine position were enrolled to this randomized, prospective, double-blinded study after the permission of local ethics committee and parents written informed consent. Patients were randomized to two groups as Group I (sugammadex) and Group II (neostigmine). Propofol (2mg/kg) and fentanyl (1?g/kg) were administered for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance of anaesthesia. Neuromuscular function was monitored by acceleromyography (TOF Watch SX) and train-of-four (TOF) mode of stimulation. Rocuronium (0.6mg/kg) was used for NMB and 0.1-0.2 mg/kg additional doses were given if necessary. At reappearance of T2, sugammadex 2mg/kg in group I and neostigmine 0.06mg/kg+atropine 0.02 mg/kg in group II were administered. Patients were extubated after TOF 0.9 was achieved. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups according to age, gender, weight, duration of operation, mean arterial pressure, SpO2, fentanyl and rocuronium usages (p&gt;0.05).Heart rate decreased significantly after reversal agent in group I at 15th,30th and 60th seconds of evaluation whereas it increased significantly in group II (p&lt;0.0004).Time from administration of reversal agent to TOF 0.9 was faster with sugammadex (68 second) than with neostigmine (392 second) (p&lt;0.001). Muscle strength was significantly higher in group I than in group II. The result of this study shows sugammadex is a safe and effective agent for reversing rokuroniuminduced NMB in paediatric patients with a faster recovery of neuromuscular function than neostigmine. </summary>
