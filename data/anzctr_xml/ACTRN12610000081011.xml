  <interventions>
    <interventions>In adjuvant iodine-125 brachytherapy group, based on curative resection of liver tumor, the wound was stanched carefully; the wound surface area was measured and the data were entered into the computer to determine the quantity and dose of seed implantation. The 0.8 mm in diameter and 4.5mm in length iodine-125 seeds were enclosed in a NiTinol capsule (China Institute of Atomic Energy, Beijing). These seeds could produce 27.4-31.5 keV x-ray and 35.5 Kev r-ray, with a half life of 59.6 days. The radioactivity per seed ranged 0.5-0.6 mCi. The seeds that had undergone megatemperature sterilizing were implanted into the normal liver tissue near the cut surface at 1-cm intervals. Biological fibrin glue was applied onto the wound surface, which was then covered with gelatin sponge or hemostatic gauze after saturation and fixation to prevent displacement of the iodine-125 seeds. A median of 25 iodine-125 seeds per patient (range, 1834seeds) were implanted, with a median total implanted activity of 12.5 mCi (range, 9.020.4 mCi).The duration range of the seed implantation process were 5-10 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The surgical procedures for the control group patients were the same as those of iodine-125 adjuvant brachytherapy group except that no iodine-125 seed implantation was applied.</comparator>

      <outcome>Time to recurrence (TTR). Recurrence was confirmed by dynamic contrast-enhanced Computerised Tomography scanning or selective hepatic arteriography in subjects with an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level or with a newly identified mass.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from curative hepatectomy to the first diagnosis of tumor recurrence.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Disease-free survival (DFS). Disease-free survival:Time from randomization to either recurrence or death. Patients alive and free of recurrence at the end of follow-up are surveyed via patient census.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recurrence is a critical issue for curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, adjuvant chemotherapy or other adjuvant modalities have not been proven effective for HCC. This study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of adjuvant iodine-125 brachytherapy on postoperative recurrence of HCC.</summary>
