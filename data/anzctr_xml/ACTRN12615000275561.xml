  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project builds on a previously trialled feasibility study, Family@play. That project was a six-week, group-based trial which delivered the program to 20 families with 2-3 year old children. Family@play was effective at decreasing childrens overall electronic media use. Active minds, happy kids will deliver similar content to 80 families with 3-5 year old children. Active minds, happy kids will employ online technologies to deliver content and promote interaction between study participants.

This is an eight week intervention with pre- and post-intervention assessments. Participants will be families with a child aged 3-5 years who has not yet started school. Group sessions will take place at the preschools through which families were recruited. 

The intervention consists of one 90 minute group-based session, 3 x 10-15 min modules online each week for 7 weeks and associated online activities. An intervention using groups with a common affiliation (i.e. their children attend the same preschool) is effective for behavioural intervention delivery. This program is theoretically informed and draws on constructs from the Social Cognitive (SCT) and Family Systems (FST) theories. 

Content will focus on three primary components: a) non-selectively decreasing electronic media use (budgeting, removing electronic media); b) selectively reducing use (rules, limiting participation); and c) displacing use with other activities (reading, imaginary games). Content for group sessions will include: changing and influencing childrens behaviours; health and developmental implications of electronic media; building motivation and skills to change behaviours (self-monitoring, goal setting); self-efficacy (identify barriers, goal setting); and relapse prevention. Strategies will focus on activities aimed to support childrens social skills and cognitive functioning while encouraging lower levels of electronic media use. Group sessions will also discuss the online activities and will use an anticipatory guidance perspective to facilitate group-based problem solving of possible challenges. Online activities will provide opportunity for within-group peer interaction to facilitate sharing of ideas, experiences and strategies. 

Strategies to monitor adherence include; attendance at group session, website generated reports of access to web-based materials, monitoring and recording of interactions on Facebook group.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study is a pilot group randomised trial with a wait-list control group, involving an eight week intervention and pre- and post-intervention assessments. Those in the control group will have the opportunity to participate in the intervention once follow-up data is collected. Control group participants will receive all content online immediately after the post-intervention assessments</comparator>

      <outcome>Changes in child cognitive functioning pre- to post-intervention. Childrens cognitive functioning, such as language skills and executive functioning, will be assessed using the NEPSY-II. The test is suitable for children aged 3-years and older. The assessment will also involve using an eye-tracker to measure childrens eye-movements as they look at different pictures.  The eye-tracker sits in front of the children.  A headrest is not required for this instrument</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants in this intervention will be 80, three- through five-year-old children and their parents. Participants will be recruited through 16 preschools and kindergarten groups. Once baseline measures are complete, families at 8 of the 16 preschools will be randomly selected to receive the treatment from May through June/July 2015. A computer generated program will be used to randomly assign the groups to either intervention or control conditions. The control group will receive the program once all measures (post-intervention, follow-up) are completed. 

The allocation will be concealed as it will be done by central randomization by computer. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be completed following baseline measurements to minimise withdrawal. Participant groups will be randomised using a computer-based random number-producing algorithm to either the intervention group (40 participant families; 8 centres) or the wait list control group (40 participant families; 8 centres). To prevent allocation bias, staff taking measurements, will be kept blind to the allocation sequence. </sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Wait list control - both control and intervention groups will receive the intervention; controls will receive the intervention once all data has been collected (post-intervention, follow-up) and no further data will be collected once they have participated in the program. </designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Qualitative and quantitative process analyses

Potential efficacy will be assessed using linear mixed models for each of the primary and secondary outcomes.

Eighty families across 16 groups will be recruited and randomised to either a wait-list control (n=40) or intervention (n=40) group. Previous experience of the research team suggests that this recruitment target is feasible within the two month period allocated.  The study has 80% power to detect a standardised mean difference of 0.64 on a single comparison of means. This corresponds to a medium effect size according to Cohens taxonomy. Families with a child aged 3-5 years attending one of the selected preschools, and a parent who speaks, reads and writes fluent English and is able to attend the group face-to-face sessions are eligible to participate. Families will be screened prior to participation to assess their childs electronic media use. Those families with a child who exceeds the Australian recommendation of one hour per day will be eligible for participation in this study. Our previous research suggests this will be about 80% of families. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the Active minds, happy kids program is to trial a program to support young childrens social skills and cognitive functioning by decreasing their electronic media use. Social skill is an important aspect of childrens psychological and social health. For instance, how well the child is able to manage emotions such as anger and frustration, their confidence in being able to ask for what they need, and the way they interact with other people. Cognitive functioning includes language development and memory functioning. Supporting social skills and cognitive functioning during the preschool years is essential to enhance educational, psychological, work and mental health outcomes in later years. 

This research is being conducted by Dr Trina Hinkley, Dr Jarrad Lum, Dr Dylan Cliff and Dr Kylie Hesketh.  

We hope to learn more about the sorts of behaviours which might help to support healthy social skills and positive cognitive functioning in young children. We plan to trial a number of strategies in this program to allow us to assess which might be most appropriate to use in the future. This information is important as it will help us understand how best to support parents so that they in turn may support healthy growth and development in their young children.
