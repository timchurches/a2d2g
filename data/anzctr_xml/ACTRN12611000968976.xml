  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three months after the initial diagnosis, the clinic will send an SMS reminder to encourage the patient to collect a sample/s using a collection kit and mail it to the lab with the request slip. The dates will be set by clinic staff at the time of treatment. 

The research team will mail a collection kit in an unmarked envelope to the patient 3 months after initial diagnosis. Patients will be instructed in a covering letter to collect their specimen/s and package them according to the instructions provided and mail them to the laboratory in the supplied pre-paid envelope. The collection kit will contain the collection device, collection instructions, laboratory request form and pre-paid envelope. 

The collection devices will vary according to the patients risk group: heterosexual men will receive a Copan swab for first-pass urine collection; women will receive a swab for lower vaginal self-collection; and men who have sex with men (MSM) will receive two collection devices: (i) a swab for rectal self-collection and (ii) a swab for first-pass urine collection.</interventions>
    <comparator>Three months after the initial diagnosis, the clinic will send an SMS reminder to encourage the patient to return to the clinic for re-testing. This is standard of care at the two participating clinics. The dates will be set by clinic staff at the time of treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Chlamydia re-testing at 1-4 months after a chlamydia infection.
Patients will be asked if they have had a repeat test on an online questionnaire  at 4-5 months after initial diagnosis. Data linkage to patient medical records will also be undertaken.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1-4 months after the initial diagnosis.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Persistent positivity at re-rest.
Chlamydia infection will be diagnosed by Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of re-test.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Chlamydia re-infection rate at re-test - discriminated using sexual behaviour data and chlamydia sequencing.

For patients who have a repeat positive test, the baseline and re-testing specimens for these patients will be transported to the Royal Women's Hospital for genotyping using OmpA typing and Mutliple locus sequence typing (MLST). 

Researchers will also send an SMS to the patients at 4 and 5 months to remind them to complete a quantitative survey online. The SMS will contain the name of the website and the participant's code which will be linked to their patient details captured at consent.  The survey will investigate whether the patient and his or her partner/s were treated for chlamydia and sexual behaviour since the initial diagnosis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 4 to 5 months following initial diagnosis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability.
Participants will be reminded by SMS at 4 and 5 months to undertake a survey online to assess the acceptability of the self-collected samples and barriers to and preferences for re-testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 4 to 5 months following initial diagnosis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PID incidence in women. 
At 4-5 months the percentage of women diagnosed with PID will be calculated among those re-tested and those not re-tested. 

Women reporting pelvic or lower abdominal pain of less than 1 month duration on the online questionnaire will be contacted by the research team to explore in more detail the nature and duration of these and other relevant symptoms, in order to determine if the symptoms may indicate PID. 

Study nurses at the clinics will be asked to provide evidence of a diagnosis of PID for: 
1.	All women attending who indicate PID related symptoms on the questionnaire; and
2.	Any other women who consented to the study who presented with PID symptoms or were given a PID diagnosis throughout the study period.  

If the woman attended another health care provider, her consent will be sought to request release of relevant medical records and a consent form will be sent to those who agree. 

Survey responses and medical records will be reviewed independently by two sexual health physicians (with review by a third where they disagree) and cases will be classified as probable, possible or not PID according to the following criteria:
1. Probable case:
A clinical diagnosis of PID based on modified Hager's criteria- pelvic pain plus cervical motion tenderness and/or uterine and/or adnexal tenderness
OR
Laparoscopic abnormalities consistent with PID
2. Possible case:
Abdominal/ pelvic pain with features of PID, but no record of cervical motion tenderness or uterine or adnexal tenderness
3. Cases will be classified as not PID when any subsequent diagnoses invalidate the diagnosis of PID</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 4 to 5 months following initial diagnosis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Organism load and serovar distribution of chlamydia infections. In addition to OmpA typing and mutliple locus sequence typing (MLST), organism load and betaglobin testing will be conducted on all baseline and positive retest samples. Samples will be coded with no identifying details. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Following ITT analysis, using all samples collected between baseline and 5 months following initial diagnosis.</timepoint>

    <concealment>1.	All positive chlamydia results will be reviewed by the follow-up nurses at each of the clinics.
2.	Among potentially eligible participants, the nurse will call the patient and let them know of the chlamydia diagnosis and for those not already treated, recommend they come to the clinic for treatment. During the call the nurse will give a brief overview of the trial and ask their permission to pass on their contact details to a member of the research team. 
3.	If the patient agrees, a member of the research team, will then contact the patient to go over the trial requirements and undertake a verbal consent process. 
4.	Once they have consent, the member of the research team will select an opaque randomisation envelope and inform the patient which group they are inâ€” the home or clinic group and: 
a.	Obtain detailed contact information and confirm mobile phone number 
b.	Inform the clinic if the patient consented or not, and if randomised to the home or clinic group. This information will be recorded in the clinic database.</concealment>
    <sequence>Eligible patients will be randomised to the intervention or control strategies using a minimisation approach. This will maximise the balance across risk groups (MSM, heterosexual men and women). Patients will be randomised at the Kirby Institute. Randomisation codes will be performed by the statistician at the Kirby Institute and will be conducted using sealed opaque envelopes containing computer generated randomisation numbers in blocks, stratified for risk group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial (RCT) will assess the effectiveness of an SMS reminder and home-based self-collected samples (home group) to increase the proportion of patients re-tested after a chlamydia infection, compared to an SMS reminder and clinic testing (clinic group). 

Approximately 600 patients diagnosed with chlamydia across two sexual health clinics will be randomised to the home group or the clinic group.  In the home group, patients will receive a collection kit containing the collection device, instructions, request form and pre-paid envelope. Three months after the intial diagnosis the clinic will send an SMS reminder to encourage the patient to collect a sample using the collection kit and mail it to the lab or return to the clinic for re-testing if they prefer.  Patients randomised to the clinic group will receive an SMS reminder at three months following diagnosis to encourage the patient to return to the clinic for re-testing.

At 4 and 5 months after the initial diagnosis, patients will be requested by SMS to complete an online questionnaire to assess the acceptability of home testing, re-testing elsewhere, re-testing barriers and sexual behaviour. Women will also be asked about symptoms of PID.  

If participants record in the questionnaire that they had a chlamydia test at another clinic since their positive test, or if women report attending another clinic with symptoms of PID, then the researchers will seek their permission for the researchers to contact this clinic to obtain the results of this test/ relevant medical records. 

The study will require 12 months to complete: 6 months for recruitment and 6 months to allow time for patients to re-test and complete the online questionnaire. The primary outcome is re-testing rate within three months of chlamydia treatment.</summary>
