  <interventions>
    <interventions>TOBY Playpad is a unique, therapist-and-parent designed Early Intervention application for children with Autism. TOBYs iPad tasks co-ordinate with off-iPad tasks to help your child learn skills in the real world. TOBY stands for Therapy Outcomes By You, because it aims to empower parents to commence early intervention to maximize your childs development.

Children  will be provided with an i-Pad with the TOBY Playpad App installed. Parents will be required to attend an interactive parent information session providing training on the effective use of the TOBY App. 

For the length of the trial, the parent and child will be asked to complete at least 20 minutes of therapy from the TOBY App each day for 6-months. This will be in addition to any other therapy the child is already undergoing outside of this study.


The Playpad software will monitor adherence to the intervention.

At the conclusion of the trial (at 6 months), the parent will be asked to return the iPad to the research team at Curtin University.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Living with a child who has Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is challenging for all families. Despite growing evidence on the effectiveness of educational and behavioural treatment strategies in addressing the core features of ASD, access to and availability of therapy services in rural communities is sparse. 
 
The overall aim of this research project is to test the effectiveness of the Therapy Outcomes By You (TOBY) playpad application as an early intervention complementary therapy, for 2-6 year olds living in rural WA, who have received an ASD diagnosis within the past 12 months

The outcomes of the research will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the TOBY playpad application as a complement to existing therapy for recently diagnosed 2-6 year old children with ASD, living in rural communities.
