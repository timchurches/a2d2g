  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional phase (Control B) delivers a projection of recorded exterior natural environments (3 total) in an interior context to create an immersive (sight and sound) experience of nature. Participants will view all three variations of the natural environments throughout each Arm of the intervention phase, which will be completed over a 12 week period. An incremental approach has been applied to the length of intervention exposure with each Arm of the intervention phase (Control B). The environments will be taken from 3 contexts - Australian bush, Ocean/Beach, Animals in nature.

Arm 1 (Week 12-15)
Each participant (individually) will watch 5 minutes of any of the 3 potential natural environment projections with a care worker (2x per week) for a period of three weeks.

Arm 2 (Week 15-18)
Each participant (individually) will watch 10 minutes of any of the 3 potential natural environment projections with a care worker (2x per week) for a period of three weeks.

Arm 3 (Week 18-21)
Each participant (individually) will watch 15 minutes of any of the 3 potential natural environment projections with a care worker (2x per week) for a period of three weeks.

Arm 4 (Week 21-24)
Each participant (individually) will watch 20 minutes of any of the 3 potential natural environment projections with a care worker (2x per week) for a period of three weeks.

The researcher will unobtrusively collect timing and observational information relating to participant responses to each intervention throughout the study. This information will identify the preferred natural environment for each participant and the group collectively.</interventions>
    <comparator>The pre-intervention (no treatment) phase provides baseline data of specific dementia behaviours and symptoms, over a period of 12 weeks. This pre-intervention phase (Control A) creates a comparator for analysis whereby the intervention (active control) participants become their own control condition. During the 12 weeks post-intervention (no treatment) phase (Control C) participants remain monitored and data collection activities continue.

Control A monitors participant agitation for a 12 week period using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Long Form) with assessments undertaken by suitably trained care staff at (baseline) week 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12.

Control C monitors participant agitation for a 12 week period using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Long Form) with assessments undertaken by suitably trained care staff at (baseline) week 36, 39, 42, 45 and 48.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We are planning a study of a continuous response variable (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory) scale from matched pairs of study subjects (Pre-Post study).  Prior data indicate that the difference in the response of matched pairs is normally distributed with standard deviation 20.  If the true difference in the mean response of matched pairs is 8 (delta), we will need to study 51 pairs (sample size) of subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power) 80%.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is alpha=0.05.

Clinical significance is arguably most pertinent when considering the most disruptive of dementia behaviours. Therefore a change in rated frequency from several times a day to several times a week, for the sub-scales of Aggressive behaviour and Verbally Agitated behaviour of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Long Form with expanded definitions), would be indisputably clinically significant. Therefore a reduction in scores from baseline to post-intervention of at least 8 points would be regarded clinically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Institutionalised individuals with dementia often suffer from symptoms or behaviours that significantly impact their well-being and quality of life. Depression, poor sleep quality and agitated behaviours are common elements that contribute to a reduction in life quality. Research continues to show that exposure to natural environments intrinsically creates a positive biological and psychological response. Using these same principles, the study aims to identify the influence a pseudo-natural environment has on dementia symptoms and behaviours that negatively affect quality of life.</summary>
