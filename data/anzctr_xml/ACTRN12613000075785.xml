  <interventions>
    <interventions>We have attempted to analyze the blood samples for measurement of pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress before liver tranaplantation in the operation room. The approximate duration that measurements take in each patient is 5 minutes only. In addition, single blood sample is taken from vein.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to determine the pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress in liver tranaplantation recepients compared to healthy controls. Participants will provide a single fasting blood sample from which plasma pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress levels will be determined. Results will be compared between the study populations using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if a difference exists.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary objective of this study is to determine the rate and extent of superoxide production and elastase activity from neutrophils in liver tranaplantation recepients compared to healthy controls. The assay of the generation of superoxide is based on the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c. Changes in absorbance with the reduction of ferricytochrome c at 550 nm are continuously monitored with a double-beam, six-cell positioner spectrophotometer with constant stirring (Hitachi U-3010, Tokyo, Japan). Degranulation of azurophilic granules is determined by elastase activity. Changes in absorbance at 405 nm are continually monitored for 15 min to determine elastase activity with a double-beam, six-cell positioner spectrophotometer with constant stirring (Hitachi U-3010, Tokyo, Japan). Results will be compared between the study populations using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if a difference exists.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Single fasting blood samples will be collected from each study participant for analysis of pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress. At the time of blood sample collection, isolated neutrophils will be for measurement of superoxide production and elastase activity. 
Results of pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress obtained from liver tranaplantation recepients will be statistically compared to those obtained from healthy controls using analysis of variance (ANOVA).</summary>
