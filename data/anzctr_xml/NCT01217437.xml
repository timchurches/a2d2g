  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving temozolomide and irinotecan
      hydrochloride together with or without bevacizumab works in treating young patients with
      recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma or central nervous system (CNS) primitive
      neuroectodermal tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide and irinotecan
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and
      irinotecan hydrochloride are more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating
      medulloblastoma or CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumors.</summary>
