  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: 12 week programme of three sets of heel raises every alternate day in addition to compression therapy. The maximum number of heel raises will be assessed at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 9 weeks, with the number of heel raises per set to be set at 80% of the maximum (up to a maximum of 10) raises per set.  Each set of heel raises will take approximately 1-2 minutes and the participant will complete 3 sets. 

Both intervention and control participants will receive compression therapy, either compression bandages or compression stockings. The choice of compression will be determined by participant and/or clinical preference.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>As a pilot study testing the feasibility of procedures for a larger trial, we did not determine the sample size using a power calculation. We proposed to seek 50 participants to test our procedures in order to provide data for a sample size calculation for a main trial. All data analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Continuous data was assessed for normality and will be analysed using either parametric or nonparametric statistics, as appropriate. All tests were two-tailed with significance set at 5%.  The difference between treatment group means in calf muscle function (ejection fraction and residual volume fractions) from baseline to 12 weeks were analysed using linear regression. Simple incidence rates, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were obtained for binary variables, such as proportion healed and incidence of adverse events.  Time to healing was analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression modelling. Prior to undertaking any Cox regression modelling, the effectiveness of the interventions on time to healing were analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves to compare the differences between the two groups using the log rank test. The Statistical Analysis Plan is available on request.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Leg ulcers are costly, debilitating condition with few effective treatments. Compression bandaging helps healing, but about 4 out of every 10 people with a leg ulcer remain unhealed after 3 months. Recurrence occurs in up to 70% of people. Calf muscle function is poorer in people with venous leg ulcers than in people without such ulcers. Simple, easy and quickly completed home-based exercises can improve calf muscle function in people with venous ulcers, but it is not known what effect they have on ulcer healing. Current treatment for venous ulcers is compression bandaging. Participants in this pilot study will be randomised to receive the exercises + compression, or compression alone. The exercises are heel raises, and progress will be assessed every 3 weeks for the 12 week treatment period. This pilot study aims to test the acceptability, tolerability and efficacy of the home-based exercises on calf muscle function and provide information for the feasibility of a larger trial.</summary>
