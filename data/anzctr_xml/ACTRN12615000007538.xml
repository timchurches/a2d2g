  <interventions>
    <interventions>Boxing 
Participants in the boxing group were prescribed four, 50-min sessions of supervised boxing training per week for 12 weeks.  A boxing instructor assisted in designing the program.   All sessions were fully supervised by qualified personnel and participants were trained individually.  The interval-based exercises were preceded by a 5 min warm-up of continuous skipping at a self-selected intensity.  Intervals were prescribed at 2:1 (i.e. 2 min of high-intensity activity followed by 1 min of rest (standing or pacing) between intervals and exercises).  Three intervals of each of the following five exercises were performed for a total of 30 min of high-intensity effort:  (1) heavy bag, (2) focus mitts, (3) circular body bag, (4) footwork drills, and (4) skipping.  The total amount of physical activity (excluding warm up and rest periods) was computed as 30 min x 6 metabolic equivalents (MET) per minute = 180 MET min.  During the high-intensity bouts, participants were instructed to exercise at a rating of perceived exertion of 15-17/20 (hard to very hard) with the goal of achieving &gt;75% of age-predicted maximal heart rate (i.e. 220-age; HRmax).  
Training intensity:  Heart rate was monitored using a Polar Heart Rate monitor (Polar 'Registered Trademark' RS800sd Kempele, Finland) and was recorded at the completion of each high-intensity interval; these values were averaged across each week, and reported as percentage of age-predicted HRmax.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Walking 
Participants in the walking group were prescribed four, 50-min sessions of brisk walking per week for 12 weeks.  These sessions were unsupervised and completed in any location convenient to the participant (e.g. within their own neighbourhood, etc.).  Participants were instructed to begin each session with a 5-min gradual warm-up and walk as quickly as possible for the remainder of the session (45 min).  The total amount of physical activity (excluding warm up) was computed as 45 min x 4 metabolic equivalents (MET) per minute = 180 MET-min. 
Training intensity:  Participants were taught how to manually monitor their heart rate and record the measure pre-, mid- and post-exercise.  These data were recorded in a training journal.   The mid-exercise readings were averaged across each week, and reported as percentage of age-predicted HRmax.

      <outcome>Arterial stiffness (augmentation index):  was assessed using the SphygmoCor System (AtCor Medical Pty, Sydney, Australia).  This system derives the central aortic pressure waveform noninvasively from the pulse pressure recorded at a peripheral site.  Participants were seated for a 10-min period, then radial pulse pressure waveform recording were obtained using a hand-held, high fidelity tonometer (Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas).  The aortic pressure waveforms are comprised of a forward wave caused by left ventricular contraction and a reflected wave due to backflow arising from regions of increased impedance in the peripheral vessels. The resultant of these two pressures is known as the augmentation index (AIx) which was recorded. The SphygmoCor algorithm normalises AIx to a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. This method is highly reproducible and has been used extensively to evaluate arterial stiffness in healthy and chronically diseased cohorts. Population norms for AIx range from -23.27% to 63.07% in adults (aged 18-86 years) with larger values indicating greater arterial stiffness.  </outcome>

      <outcome>Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max): was assessed via indirect calorimetry (Jaeger Metabolic Gas Analysers, Viasys Healthcare, Germany) using a standard ramp protocol on a laboratory treadmill (LE 200 CE, Viasys Health Care, USA).  O2 and CO2 sensors were calibrated prior to each test using high-grade calibration gas with certified gas concentrations (O2=16%, CO2=5%, N2=balance).  The protocol began at a pre-determined, comfortable walking speed for 3 minutes; the grade was increased by 2% each minute thereafter until volitional fatigue.  </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM 'Copyright', SPSS Version 19.0).  All data were inspected visually and statistically for normality (skewness and kurtosis between -1 and +1).  Analyses were completed according to intention-to-treat strategy, using the last-observation-carry-forward imputation method for any missing data. Within group changes over time were evaluated by paired t-tests.  Group x time effects were determined by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the post-treatment score controlling for the baseline score and potential confounding variables identified by comparing groups at baseline.  Cohens d effect sizes were calculated to explore the effectiveness of the intervention and provide data to inform sample size calculations in future studies. Effect sizes were interpreted according to the conventions of small (0.20), moderate (0.50), or large (0.80).  A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered indicative of statistical significance.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background:  High-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed on exercise cycle or treadmill is considered safe and often more beneficial for fat loss and cardiometabolic health than moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT).  The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a 12-week boxing training (HIIT) intervention compared with an equivalent dose of brisk walking (MICT) in obese adults.  
Methods:  Men and women with abdominal obesity and body mass index &gt;25kg/m2 were randomized to either a boxing group or a brisk walking (control) group for 12 weeks.   Each group engaged in 4 training sessions per week, equated for total physical activity.  Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rates, assessment of training intensities, adherence and adverse events.  Effectiveness was assessed pre and post intervention via pertinent obesity-, cardiovascular-, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes.
Results:  Nineteen individuals expressed an interest and 63% (n=12) consented.  Recruitment was slower than anticipated (1.3 participants/week).  The boxing group trained at a significantly higher intensity each week versus the brisk walking group (p&lt;0.05).  Two participants in the boxing group experienced an adverse event; both continued to exercise with modifications to the exercise program.  No other adverse events were noted.  The boxing group attended more exercise sessions (79% vs. 55%) and had a lower attrition rate (n=0 vs. n=2) than the walking group.  Analysis of covariance revealed that the boxing group significantly improved body fat percentage (p=0.047), systolic blood pressure (p=0.026), augmentation index (AIx; p&lt;0.001), absolute VO2max (p=0.015), and Physical Functioning (p=0.042) and Vitality (p=0.024) domains of HRQoL over time.  The walking group did not improve any clinical outcomes, and experienced a worsening of Vitality (p=0.043). 
Conclusions:  Boxing training (HIIT) in adults with abdominal obesity is feasible and may elicit a better therapeutic effect on obesity, cardiovascular, and HRQoL outcomes than an equivalent dose of brisk walking (MICT).  Robustly designed randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these findings and inform clinical guidelines and practice for obesity treatment.
