  <interventions>
    <interventions>Any patient enrolled in the "Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE)" study and has or is going to have an arterial line inserted as part of their care, for monitoring blood pressure and to assist with blood taking, will be eligible for this study. Patient will be enrolled into BLISS study within 2 hours of enrollment into ARISE study.

Bliss study will require only few sets of blood.
In the great majority of cases, these additional blood samples will be drawn at the same time as that drawn for routine tests, which is normally very frequent in the early stages of serious illness. We will perform test to see the levels of bacteria in the blood in various time point, e.g. at enrolment, 3 hrs, 6 hrs, 12 hrs, day 1, day 2 and day 3. 

Blood collection will continure up to first 72 hours of hospital admission. Clincial assessment will be performed  for 10 days if they are in hospital.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When a person has severe sepsis or septic shock, a severe infection, their body reacts to the infection by a process known as inflammation.  This inflammation impairs the working of and can damage important organs in the body such as the heart, kidney and lungs.

The purpose of the study is to find out the best way to detect and monitor infection and inflammation in the body. We know from previous studies that severe sepsis and septic shock  is usually caused by bacteria. We would like to investigate the concentration of bacteria in the blood of persons  with severe sepsis  when they first present to hospital and also to monitor changes in the concentration of bacteria in the blood over time to determine what the effects of these factors are  on organ failure and survival of patients.</summary>
