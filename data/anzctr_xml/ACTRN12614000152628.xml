    <statisticalmethods>34 participants (in each group) are sufficient to detect a paired difference in periostin of 0.5 of a standard deviation with 80% power.  The conventional interpretation of an effect size of 0.5 of a standard deviation is of a medium effect size.  For a comparison between large and small dental procedures a sample size of 68 has a 90% power to detect a 0.8 standard deviation difference, a large effect size difference. 
The periostin levels will be plotted against time and a non-parametric scatter plot smoother will be used to determine if there is a pattern of variation with time that might be usefully explored with parametric regression (e.g. linear, quadratic, cubic time terms).  Paired t-test and mixed linear models will be used to compare the 12 week periostin level with measurements at the other times to formally compare the change with time.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Levels of POSTN (a protein-coding gene, also known as osteoblast specific factor) gene expression and periostin have been measured in a number of tissues and disease states. Periostin is associated with type I collagen in the periodontal ligament where it regulates the biomechanical properties of connective tissue around the tooth. Increased expression of the POSTN gene has been measured in the periodontal ligament on occlusal loading, investigators concluding that periostin is therefore essential for the integrity and function of the ligament. The serum levels of periostin following dental surgery have not yet been investigated.  
This study of the magnitude and longitudinal changes in serum periostin levels in participants undergoing dental surgery endeavours to determine the clinical significance of periostin following dental surgery. Results from this study will provide a clearer picture of periostin production and further the development of periostin as a serum biomarker for asthma, as part of a programme of research being conducted at the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand.   </summary>
