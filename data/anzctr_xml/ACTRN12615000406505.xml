  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Triheptanoin (triglyceride of heptanoate), a stable, edible tasteless oil that has been used in patients with metabolic disorders.
Dose:initial dose (e.g. 15ml oil/day)the dose is escalated every week.
Treated with up to 35% of caloric input triheptanoin (max 100 ml oil/day). The oil will be added to a normal diet, titrated up over 3 weeks and full dose given for a period of 48 weeks.
Route: Orally three times daily (with meals) for 48 weeks
During the full time of the study seizures, adverse events,
side effects, weight and quality of life will be recorded. To improve adherence the participants will have regular contact with a dietitian face to face and via phone. Participants/carers will fill in a food diary and treatment diary to monitor compliance and return the used and unused bottles of oil.

    <concealment>Up to 60 male and female participants (equal to or greater than 16 years old) with drug-resistant epilepsy will be invited to participate in the TRIP-Ex study upon completion of the TRIP-E study.  Enrolment into the TRIP-Ex study (Visit 1) may coincide with Visit 7 of the TRIP-E study.  Participants need not repeat the screening assessments that are conducted during TRIP-E Visit 7 at Visit 1 of this study (TRIP Ex).  A calculated dose of treatment will be dispensed to the participant.  There is an uptitration and downtitration period.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be largely descriptive in endpoints noted above for the co-primary endpoints retention and safety, as well as the secondary endpoint responder rate and dietary changes.  Averages and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the secondary endpoints; and median and ranges of scores will be reported for the questionnaires for the different visits. Scores will be compared in individual participants over time.  The number and percentage of participants showing improvements in scores will be reported.
Sample size of 60 participants were chosen as previous TRIP study had the same population group.</statisticalmethods>
