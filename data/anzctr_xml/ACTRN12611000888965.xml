      <outcome>Rate and severity of adverse reactions, for example, intraocular pressure will be monitored and compared between groups.  An IOP elevation will be consdiered mild if it is between 22-29mmHg, moderate if it is 30mmHg or above and severe if it requires surgical intervention.  Rates of endophthalmitis (if any) will be compared between groups.
Details on all adverse events which the patients experience during the study will be recorded including its duration, the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe), its relationship to the study drug (suspected / not suspected) and the action(s) taken.</outcome>

    <summary>This study will compare two medications (Avastin (bevacizumab) and Triesence (Triamcinolone) given at the time of cataract surgery for patients with, or at high risk of developing, diabetic macular oedema.  Patients will be seen monthly and outcomes include visual acuity, centra macular thickenss, time to retreatment and assesment of adverse events.</summary>
