Based on the obtained schedule, the number of sealed envelopes, which are equal to the required blocks, will be prepared and labeled. Each envelope contains the corresponding sealed allocation cards that will allocate treatments to patients. The people, who prepare the randomized scheme, will not involve in the trial. The allocation schedule will be concealed until the end of trial.</concealment>
    <sequence>After signing on the consent form, all eligible patients will be enrolled in the trial and then randomized by computer-generated randomization into two groups to receive intravenous  oxytocin and intramuscular oxytocin in the management of the third stage of labor.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality throughout the world especially in developing countries. Uterine atony is the most common etiology. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was 3.9% in women delivered vaginally. Active management in third stage of labor is accepted protocol  to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Active management in third stage of labour involves giving a prophylactic uterotonic drug, controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta and uterine massage. Routine oxytocin has been well established. Synthetic oxytocin, acts on the smooth muscle of the uterus to stimulate contractions; especially after term, when adequate oxytocin receptors. When oxytocin binds to oxytocin receptors induces increase  intracellular Ca2+ releasing and the increased prostaglandin secretion all contribute to the contractile effects and inhibition of Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)  receptors  (this would depolarize if GABA acts as a tonic inhibitory modulator) also causes responses contractions of the uterus. Oxytocin use is advocated either intramuscularly (10 IU) or as a dilute infusion, intravenous  bolus has also been used by other authors and  they  showed  an  IV bolus of  oxytocin  5 to 10 IU, can be  used  for postpartum hemorrhage prevention after vaginal birth  but is not recommended in case of elective cesarean section. At Khon Kaen Hospital guideline recommended  10 units  intramuscular oxytocin for routine prophylaxis postpartum hemorrhage. The data of all deliveries  in 2010 were collected .We  found that  postpartum hemorrhage rate 3 % follow vaginal delivery. No maternal death caused from postpartum hemorrhage . We therefore would like to conduct randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous versus intramuscular oxytocin in the management of  third stage of labor.</summary>
