  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to country line dancing or stretching. Participants will not be informed of the investigators hypotheses regarding which of the 2 forms of interventions will be more effective. A blinded assessor will conduct all outcome assessments.The literature indicates to have an effect size of 0.67-1.08, with alpha set at 0.05 and power of 0.8, the sample size should be between 30-72. We will require 80 subjects in anticipation of a dropout rate of 10% over 6 months of intervention. Volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomised to stretching and country line dancing groups. 40 in the stretching group will attend stretching for 6 months, twice per week, and 40 in line dancing group will be doing line dancing for 2 times per week each session 1 hour for 6 months.</interventions>
