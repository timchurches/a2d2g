  <interventions>
    <interventions>Application of a constant 150g orthodontic force will be applied to the first premolar teeth for a period of 4 weeks (using orthodontic fixed braces) which are, and are not also exposed to daily Light Emitting Diode light of 850nm wavelength using an FDA approved device for this purpose (OrthoPulse - Biolux Research [Vancouver Canada]). 
This force will be applied to the first premolar on BOTH sides of the mouth, the only difference between the sides will be that one is exposed to daily 10minute exposures of light from the device in a single 10 minute application, which is self administered by the patient each day using the easy-to-use device (OrthoPulse). These devices are modified by the manufacturer to "sham" or "deactivate" one side of the light emitting diodes so as to only expose a single side to light. The patient and investigator will be unaware of which side is deactivated. An instructional video and personal 1 to 1 instruction on how to do use the device will be given to the patient at the commencement of the trial by the investigator who is a second year specialist orthodontic resident. Adherence will be monitored using a smartphone app which tracks device usage by downloading usage data from each participant's individual device.

After 4 weeks of constant 150g of orthodontic force and daily usage of the device throughout, the first premolar teeth will be extracted simultaneously by the same investigator, under Local Anaesthesia (these extractions are a necessary part of the patients treatment) and examined under a Micro-CT (computer tomography) scanner to investigate root resorption changes on the root surfaces and determine whether there are any differences between the left side extracted tooth, and the right side tooth.

After the above extractions are carried out, the space left behind will be closed orthodontically (using braces) by moving the adjacent teeth (canine and second premolar) toward each other until completely closed (approximately 8 weeks). During this orthodontic space closure phase, the patient will again use the device once per day, every day, for the entire 8 weeks. This is to investigate whether the application of light has any positive or negative effect on the rate of tooth movement. The rate of movement will be measured both clinically with digital calipers, and also by taking periodic impressions/moulds of the patients teeth (every 2 weeks - 5 impressions in total) and measuring the distance each tooth has moved throughout time. This data will be recorded for both the left and right sides, and compared.</interventions>
    <comparator>Split mouth study.
Patients undergoing intervention will be their own control. For example, Left side of mouth exposed to LED light, Right side not exposed. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Amount of root resorption present on roots of extracted first premolar teeth as measured by Micro-CT (Micro- Computed tomography) analysis of quantity and volume of resorption craters present on the root surfaces of the extracted teeth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Teeth are extracted 4 weeks after the initiation of Force application with and without Light Emitting Diode light application</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of orthodontic space closure, as assessed by clinical observation using digital calipers to measure the size of the gap as it closes every 2 weeks, in addition to dental impressions taken at 2 weekly intervals for a period of 8 weeks in total. The dental impressions will be poured up in dental stone and measurements can be made off these models, and the rate of space closure can be calculated mathematically.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After extraction of first premolar teeth:
- Space closure achieved after 2 weeks of active space closure
- Space closure achieved after 4 weeks of active space closure
- Space closure achieved after 6 weeks of active space closure
- Space closure achieved after 8 weeks of active space closure (total space closure over 8 weeks)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis of this research project is that LED (Light emitting diode) light (photobiomodulation) will minimise orthodontic root resorption while allowing an accelerated rate of orthodontic tooth movement (acceleration of tooth movement is claimed by the manufacturer).</summary>
