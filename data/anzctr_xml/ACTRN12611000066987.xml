  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants eligible are those that have undergone neck dissection surgery for cancer within eight weeks, that present with clinical signs of accessory nerve injury; dropped scapula, winged scapula, and reduced active abduction on the operated side. Participation in the intervention group will involve attending the physiotherapy department at the study sites for a supervised exercise program. This involves progressive strengthening exercises using hand weights, active-assisted range of movement exercises of the shoulder, active range of movement exercises of the neck, and stretches of the shoulder and neck. The supervising physiotherapist ensures no worsening of pain or fatigue occurs during sessions. This will take half an hour, once a week for 12 weeks. The same exercises will be
performed at home twice a week. Exercise diaries are utilised to ensure compliance and no self upgrading of exercises.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive current usual care, which is referral to physiotherapy only if they report
pain or problems in their shoulder after surgery. If  they report shoulder pain and problems with movement, they are given a handout of generalised shoulder and neck exercises and advice about scar care. Participants may receive physiotherapy elsewhere, and what they receive will be up to the treating physiotherapist.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effect of a progressive exercise program on shoulder pain and function following nerve injury after neck dissection surgery for cancer. 

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have undergone neck dissection surgery for head and neck cancer within eight weeks and you have clinical signs of injury to the accessory nerve which includes weakness of shoulder movements.

Trial details 
Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group (control) will receive standard care (physiotherapy or a handout of generalised exercises and advice about scar care). The other group will attend the physiotherapy department for a supervised exercise program. This involves progressive strengthening exercises for half an hour, once a week for 12 weeks, with the same exercises performed at home twice a week. Assessments will be carried out at the start of the study and at 3, 6 and 12 months. 

The study aims to compare levels of pain, disability and shoulder movement in the different groups.</summary>
