  <interventions>
    <interventions>Using a split-mouth design each patients mouth will be divided into test and control quadrants.
The test quadrants will be debrided using an Er:YAG laser (KEY3Â®, Kavo, Biberach, Germany).The laser parameters are set at an energy level of 160mJ/pulse and a repetition rate of 10Hz. The Kavo periodontal P2061 handpiece will be used with water irrigation. The operator chooses the Kavo fibre tips as the situation dictates. 

All treatments will be terminated when the operator is satisfied that the root surfaces are smooth and thoroughly debrided. An independent examiner will verify the clinical end point. There will be no time limit for instrumentation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control quadrants will receive sub-gingival SRP using an ultrasonic scaler and Gracey hand instruments.
All treatments will be terminated when the operator is satisfied that the root surfaces are smooth and thoroughly debrided. An independent examiner will verify the clinical end point. There will be no time limit for instrumentation.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients often find having their teeth scaled an unpleasant experience. 
The purpose of this research is to determine whether a laser is as effective as conventional instruments (powered and hand scalers) for the treatment of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). The effectiveness of each treatment method will be assessed using patient-centred outcomes such as clinical periodontal measurements and patients overall experience. The study design is such that it is as close to normal daily practice as possible.</summary>
