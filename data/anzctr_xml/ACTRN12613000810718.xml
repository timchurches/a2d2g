    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study in an un-researched field, so we used recent adult ICU literature which used a cohort of 44 patients. We have selected 100 patients, which is approx 6 months worth of admissions.
We will then use the Dept of Biostatistics at James Cook University to assist with analysis. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims:

We would like to describe what the normal bowel function is in severely unwell children who are managed in our intensive care unit. Our current management protocol is based on that from the Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, and we want to investigate the effectiveness, or not, of this protocol in our population. We hypothesise that it is normal for the gut to behave differently when unwell compared to in good health, and that management strategies may lead to over-treatment and potential longer hospital stay. This is previously unpublished in children's intensive care literature.

Research design:

This is a prospective, observational study involving no deviation from current treatment received in our unit. This is a pilot study, which may lead on to a larger multi-centre trial to be run by a larger research group, such as ANZICS CTG, which would investigate the effect of non-intervention in those with slower bowel function, rather than escalating intervention.

Methods:

We will approach all admissions to our unit to be enrolled in this study. Participation will involve no change to management, only completion of the study questionnaire by the researcher every day until hospital discharge. Results will then be analysed prior to publication.</summary>
