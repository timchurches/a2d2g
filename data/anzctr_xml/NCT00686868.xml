    <summary>This study will examine the safety and tolerability, PK and PD of subcutaneously administered
      GSK1841157 in patients with RA on stable dose Methotrexate. The study comprises a single dose
      escalation/de-escalation phase to investigate the minimal efficacious dose based on PD
      markers with an acceptable safety profile.</summary>
