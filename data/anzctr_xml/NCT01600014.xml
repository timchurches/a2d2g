  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Complete Clearance of AKs 8 Weeks After Randomisation - The complete clearance rates 8 weeks after randomisation was compared between ingenol mebutate gel, 0.015% and vehicle gel. Complete clearance was defined as no clinically visible AKs in the Selected Treatment Area (STA)</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks after randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Complete Clearance Through to Month 12, Defined as no Clinically Visible AKs and no Lesions Treated in the Selected Treatment Area at Any Time From Last Treatment Cycle Through to Month 12 - The analysis was done separately for the field recalcitrant subgroup, the field recurrent subgroup, and overall for all treated subject (Analysis 1, 2, and 3, respectively)</outcome>
      <timepoint>From last treatment cycle through to Month 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Change in AK Count From Randomisation to 8 Weeks After Randomisation - The change in AK count from randomisation to 8 weeks after randomisation was determined for the field recalcitrant and the field recurrent subgroups</outcome>
