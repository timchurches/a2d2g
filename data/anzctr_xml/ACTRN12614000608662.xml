    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by the PhD student and Research Fellow at kidney transplant outpatient clinics with the assistance of the renal transplant coordinators and nephrologists at the five sites. People who express interest in participating in the study will be visited in their homes for informed consent and enrolment by the Research Fellow. Each patient will be given a code number which will be given to the off-site statistician for treatment allocation</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Intention-to-treat. Descriptive statistics will be used to compare baseline characteristics. Categorical data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. Normally distributed data will be presented as means and standard deviations and non-symmetrical data as medians and inter-quartile ranges. The primary analysis will be based on the follow-up data by assessing the difference in adherence based on the MEMS score using a linear mixed-effects model. This model will accommodate for the unequal variances in repeated measurements while adjusting for random effects of participant. Secondary analyses, including medication adherence measured using surrogate and self-reported measures of medication adherence will be analysed using linear mixed-effects model for continuous variables and generalized estimated equation for binomial outcomes.

To estimate the sample size we wish to detect an increase of 7% in the MEMS score in the intervention group, allowing for a standard deviation of 9% in each group. Assuming a two-tailed hypothesis test with significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, we estimate at least 27 patients are required in each group. Taking into consideration an attrition rate of 20%, the number required is 32 per group, making a total sample of 64 participants. Our preliminary work with our partner investigators have suggested that attrition is likely to be higher based on their experience with this group of patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>More people require kidney transplants which are in short supply. It is imperative that people who have kidney transplants take their medicines as prescribed. Poor adherence to prescribed medicines can cause a 60% increased risk of kidney transplant failure. Rejection requires costly hospitalisations, laboratory tests and anti-rejection therapies with associated poor outcomes. This project will develop and test an intervention to help adults requiring a kidney transplant to take their medicines as prescribed. Better medicine adherence results in improved graft life, general well-being, and reduced health care expenditure. Our industry partners share this vision of improved health for people requiring kidney transplantation.</summary>
