  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects presenting to the primary care practitioner (PCP) in metropolitan and regional areas with suspected OSA will undergo a clinical evaluation, answer questionnaires, and have a photograph taken of their face and profile. After this visit they also be tested for 3 nights at home on a portable nasal flow monitor (Flow Wizard, DiagnoseIt, Sydney, Australia) and undergo a single night in-hospital polysomnogram (the reference standard test used to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea).

Information collected during the 15-20 minute primary care practitioner visit are:
demographic and anthropometric characteristics (weight, height, neck circumference, waist circumference, hip circumference), 
questionnaires of sleep apnea symptoms and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale; Multivariate Apnea Prediction Index; Berlin Questionnaire), and digital photography of face and neck (technique analgous to cephalometric x-rays to characterise anatomical variations that may be associated with OSA). 

All testing will be performed within a 6-week period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and treatable condition with significant consequences in terms of morbidity as well as mortality. Currently diagnosed with an in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG) in the context of specialist consultation, this pathway is both labour- and resource-intensive. The burden of undiagnosed and untreated disease imposes a great economic cost to the community in terms of injuries, lost productivity and associated medical conditions. We propose to test the utility of a nasal-flow based diagnostic device, anatomical features from analysis of photographic images of the head and neck, as well as clinical information from questionnaires and biometrics, in General Practice. Subjects presenting to the primary care practitioner (PCP) in metropolitan and regional areas with suspected OSA will undergo a clinical evaluation, answer questionnaires, have a photograph taken of their face and profile and be tested for 3 nights at home on a portable nasal flow monitor. The reference standard will be an in-laboratory polysomnogram. A diagnostic algorithm will be developed and validated, combining the factors giving the best prediction of OSA.</summary>
