  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a randomised controlled trial participants who stutter will be randomly assigned to receive a single administration (24 international units) of intranasal Oxytocin (Syntocinon) or a placebo nasal spray before presenting a 3 minute speech. This speech will be made to a pre-recorded audience of strangers who were trained to display positive, neutral or negative expressions.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of this study is to examine the effect of Oxytocin (OT) in facilitating eye gaze during a speaking task in adults who stutter. Participants who stutter will be randomized to receive 24UI intranasal OT or placebo before giving a speech to a pre-recorded audience. The aim of the procedure is to assess whether participants who receive OT before delivering the speech show a difference in eye gaze than the placebo group. It is predicted that the experimental participants who receive OT will demonstrate increased gaze towards audience members compared with the participants in the placebo group and thus increase access to important social information from the interaction. Secondly the experimental group is hypothesized to report less fear and anxiety following the procedure than the placebo group.</summary>
