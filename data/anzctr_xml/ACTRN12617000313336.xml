  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sports Stars is a fundamental movement skills therapy using variable practice to prepare children with CP for participation in sports. 

Therapists will be provided with an online package of intervention documents which detail the intervention. These will be accessed through CPLs intranet. The session plans detail the intervention provided each week with 3 levels of difficulty. Equipment utilised in these groups included basic sporting equipment such as balls, bats and goals. 

Sports Stars includes 8 x 1 hour weekly group sessions held after school. Each session includes 50 minutes of active participation in the group and 10 minutes for welcome/subjective review/discussion. 

Therapy sessions: Each session included the following sections: 
1.	Warm up (5 minutes)
2.	Activity- Locomotor Skills (15 minutes)
-	Running
-	Agility
-	Coordination
3.	Activity- Object Control Skills (15 minutes)
-	Sending (kicking, batting, throwing, heading)
-	Receiving (stopping, catching)
4.	Participation- Modified Sports Game (10 minutes)
5.	Cool Down (5 minutes)

Each activity includes 3 levels of difficulty that children can progress up when they are achieving the previous level  as demonstrated within the group. Activities in Sports Stars should be challenging but achievable. 

Sports Stars is a face to face group intervention held with 3-6 participants. The group runs for 8 weeks and includes variable practice of the above categories using four sports: Soccer, Netball, T-ball and Cricket. Two weeks are allocated to each sport to provide variation in activity whist still developing the same key movement skills described. Reminder calls will be made the day before the group and attendance will be monitored by the physiotherapist running the group with an attendance register to be completed each session. 

Physiotherapists with at least one years experience working with children with Cerebral Palsy in a community setting will provide the Sports Stars intervention. Physiotherapists will undergo a training course on the Sports Stars program in addition to having access to video resources throughout the program. </interventions>
    <comparator>A wait-list control will receive standard care throughout the intervention period. Following all assessment, participants in the waitlist group will then receive the Sports Stars intervention group. This will occur after all participants have completed the third assessment, 5 months after the commencement of the immediate intervention group. 

Standard care describes the typical intervention that a 6-12 year old child with a diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy would receive. This may include neurodevelopmental therapy, context-focussed therapy, strength or fitness training or functional training etc. All intervention that the control group receives will be recorded. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations are based on adequate power for comparison between effects of the Sports Stars program compared to standard care using the COPM immediately post intervention (T2). Data from a previous study investigating the effects of an exercise group aiming to improve physical activity, balance and strength in ambulant children (6-14 years) with CP showed a standard deviation of 1.87/2.88 (intervention/control) (Atasavun Uysal &amp; Baltaci, 2016). This standard deviation and a mean change of 2 points for performance on the COPM (clinically meaningful difference) were used to calculate sample size. Based on significance (alpha) of 0.05 and 80% power, a minimum sample of 25 participants in each group (50 participants total) will be required. 60 participants (30 in each group) will be recruited to allow for 20% drop out.

Statistical methods for analysing primary and secondary outcomes. Reference to where other details of the statistical analysis plan can be found, if not in the protocol.
Statistical analysis will be performed by the chief investigator using SPSS statistical software. Primary analysis will use the intention to treat principle, using the last observation recorded for participants who withdraw from the program. Baseline data will be reported using descriptive statistics for each variable (individual sports goals measured with COPM, GM capacity, aerobic fitness, anaerobic fitness and agility, functional LL &amp; UL strength, participation and QOL) to establish any difference between randomised groups. If characteristics are not comparable at baseline, they will be modeled as covariates in subsequent analyses in order to adjust their possible confounding effects. Linear mixed models will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sports Stars intervention compared to the waitlist control on the primary outcome (COPM). Linear mixed models take into account variation in individuals over time, are able to manage missing data without excluding participants for further analysis and examine changes in the outcomes over time as well as across the two groups. Significance will be set at p&lt;0.05. Residuals of the fitted models will be examined to ensure that all required assumptions are met.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sports Stars is a group physiotherapy program for school-aged children with Cerebral Palsy. It aims to introduce children to a range of sports specific drills, training activities and modified game scenarios to improve fundamental movement skills and provide an avenue to go on to participate in mainstream junior entry level sports programs. This study aims to investigate the feasibility, effectiveness and efficiency of group-based, sports-oriented, movement therapy for school-aged, ambulant children with CP with outcomes anticipated and measured in body structure and function, activity and participation dimensions of the ICF.</summary>
