  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is examining the effect of serial measurements of waist-to-hip ratios combined with motivational text messages to improve weight reduction in workers in Australia. 

Participants will require a mobile phone in order to receive weekly reminder text messages for serial measurements over 8 weeks. Participants will be asked to text back their hip/waist ratios on a weekly basis. Messaging software will only track if people respond. 

Participants will also receive text messages every 2 days over 8 weeks with informative messages regarding healthy eating, regular exercise and goal setting. We aim to study the effect of regular encouragement on health.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control will receive fortnightly text messages for 8 weeks with informative but not motivational messages regarding healthy lifestyle guidelines. They will not receive reminder messages for serial measurements and are not asked to take weekly measurements.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to measure the effect of regular reminders and motivational text messages on waist-to-hip measurements. We hope to show text messages can be used as effective medium to motivate people for healthy lifestyle changes.

This will be done by comparing the intervention group to a control. The intervention group will receive motivational messages every second day and weekly reminders to measure their waist-to-hip measurements. The control group will receive informative fortnightly messages. Changes in waist-to-hip measurements and lifestyle choices will be assessed via a pre and post study survey.</summary>
