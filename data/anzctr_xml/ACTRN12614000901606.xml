    <concealment>Potentially eligible patients are provided with a Participant Information and Consent Form, and given pathology request forms for blood tests during routine visit to oncologist. 
Once blood test results are available, trial coordinator contacts patient by telephone. If willing to proceed, patients are screened, and appointment made for another visit with oncologist, followed by trial coordinator.
Oncologist completes Karnofsky assessment, consents men and gives prescription for trial “herbs/placebo”.
Patient is assigned the next available study identification number, and given the questionnaires/instructions how to access questionnaires online. Patient is then taken to pharmacist, who dispenses tablets according to the randomisation code sent to her by statistician.

    <statisticalmethods>The data obtained in this phase II study will be used to inform the selection of definitive power calculations and secondary endpoints for a future phase III trial. No statistical difference between groups on clinical outcomes is expected in this pilot study. 
Standard descriptive statistics will be prepared for categorical and continuous variables. Appropriate measures of effect will be calculated with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Generalised linear modelling methods will be used to evaluate treatment effects adjusted for baseline values (where applicable) and will also be used to investigate the sensitivity of estimates to adjustment for other relevant covariates. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> This research study is looking at a combination of four herbs, which are common components of a healthy diet, in men who have been treated for prostate cancer, and have rising prostate specific antigen (PSA). 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 18 years or above whose PSA is rising at a slow or moderate rate after surgery or radiotherapy for prostate cancer (referred to as 'biochemically recurrent prostate cancer'). 
Study details 
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will take a combination of tablets and capsules containing green tea (Camellia sinensis), turmeric (Curcuma longa), resveratrol (which commonly occurs in grapes and wine) from giant knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum) and broccoli sprout extract (Brassica oleracea). All of these are readily available over-the-counter in herbal combination products, and have all been tested in humans before. Participants in the other group will instead receive a placebo (inactive treatment). All participants will be asked to take two tablets and two capsules twice daily for 12 weeks.
Participants will not know to which group they have been allocated until after the study is completed. Participants will have their PSA doubling time assessed at 3 months to determine any effect of treatment. It is thought that the natural herbal treatments may slow the rate at which PSA rises, and may also help to reduce any lingering side-effects following treatment, and improve quality of life. This is an initial small (pilot) study that may form the basis of a larger trial in the future. </summary>
