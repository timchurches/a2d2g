  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale score - The WOMAC 3.1 is a multi-dimensional, osteoarthritis (OA) specific self-administered questionnaire using 24 questions with a 48-hour recall that are grouped into 3 subscales (pain, stiffness, and physical function) associated with hip or knee OA. Pain, stiffness, and physical function is rated on a scale of 0-10 (0 = less severe up to 10 = more severe).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function subscale score - See WOMAC 3.1 described above.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) score - The PGA is part of a comprehensive assessment of the impact of treatment for osteoarthritis that also includes pain and physical function. The PGA included in the present study indicates the perception of osteoarthritis in the study joint at the current time. Ratings are provided on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 ("Very Good") to 10 ("Very Bad").</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in daily numerical rating scale (NRS) score - The numerical rating scale (NRS) uses an 11-point scale to assess OA pain ranging from 0 to 10 with high scores representing greater symptom severity (0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep subscale scores - The MOS Sleep Scale (acute version) contains 12 items that address aspects of sleep. Six subscale scores may be calculated including: daytime somnolence, sleep disturbances, snoring, shortness of breath or headache upon awaking, adequacy of sleep and amount of sleep plus a summary index of sleep disturbances. A higher score indicates worse sleep in most domains, but the amount of sleep and adequacy of sleep are scored in the opposite direction. The primary subscale of interest in this study is daytime somnolence.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in Short-Form-36 (SF-36) subscale scores - The SF-36 is a self-administered, generic, 36-item questionnaire designed to cover 8 domains of functional health status and well-being, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Scoring yields 8 subscales based on the 8 domains covered in the questionnaire. These scales are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in EuroQol, 5 dimensions, 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) scale score - The EQ-5D is a self-administered, standardized measure of health status designed to provide a generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal that includes the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D 5 level (5L) version will be used in this study. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and unable or extreme problems. A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in the percentage of participants who are responders based on WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores and PGA scale scores - Responders are defined as participants with percent improvement equal to and above the threshold values for WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores and PGA scale scores, reported separately.</outcome>
