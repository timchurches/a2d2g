  <interventions>
    <interventions>Electrial stimulation:
The device has two channels, with each channel has two electrodes, resulting in four electrodes. a channel with two parallel electrodes were placed in the thoracic spine and another channel with two parallel electrodes were placed in the lumbar spine.  Electrial stimulation was applied to the motor point of the paravertebral muscles. The parameters used 220 ms for duration, frequency of 40 Hz, cycle on (connected) 06 seconds and cycle off (off) 12 seconds; rise and fall 05 05
Kinesiotherapy:
1 - The patient standing on the ball with both feet on the ground. The hips, knees and feet are flexed at 90 degrees. Knees and feet are hip-width apart, and the patient was instructed to get up and sit on the ball with the contraction produced by FES 2 sets of 10 times with 2 minutes rest between exercise and other 
2 - The patient standing on the ball with both feet on the ground. The hips, knees and feet are flexed at 90 degrees. Knees and feet are hip-width apart, and the patient was bending over the shoulder trunk extension along with the contraction produced by FES in two sets of 10 times. 
3 - Exercise for spinal extension against gravity with forward flexion of the arms, to stand facing the wall holding a Swiss ball, the length of the column is practiced against gravity for 2 sets of 10 times. 
4 - Exercise for the mobility of hip flexion and shoulder flexion involving the stretching of paraspinal: without assistance from the FES, sitting on a chair, pushes the ball forward and backward in a series of 10 times, with 30 seconds. 
Cooling exercise: patient sitting on the ball, doing breathing pattern quiet for 2 minutes. 
The subject performed 2 consecutive weeks of treatment (excluding weekends) Totaling 10 sessions of 50 minutes each. The sessions were conducted individually by trained physical therapist</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine postural held digital photograph of the individual
(Sony - Cyber-shot - 7.2 mega pixels), positioned on a tripod (Vanguard VT-131) at a height of 90 cm above ground, distance of 3 meters from the sample . The pictures were taken with the sample without a shirt, dress shorts, standing orthos tactical plans: the anterior, posterior and lateral left and right. Specific anatomical points were marked with polystyrene spheres of 1 cm in diameter and attached with double sided tape. As standard protocol SAPO (http://sapo.incubadora.fapesp.br).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The photographs were analyzed by SAPO is a free software user friendly tutorials for postural assessment with scientific and creating a database and is available at http://sapo.incubadora.fapesp.br. 
Printing plantigrade was recorded to preserve the position and dimensions based on different planes photographed. The vertical reference was obtained from a plumb line marked with 2 points and 1 meter attached to the ceiling. The horizontal alignment of the floor, the tripod and the machine was measured with a level of timber. 
Two other variables were analyzed asymmetry in the sagittal and frontal planes, corresponding to the projection of center of gravity (CG) on the basis of support.
Was assessed at pre-treatment and two weeks after treatment</timepoint>

      <outcome>Scale Range estimate unified Parkinson (UPDRS)
The scale Range estimate unified Parkinson (UPDRS) assesses the signs, symptoms and activities of certain patients by self report and clinical observation. It comprises 42 items, totaling 147 points, divided into four parts: mental activity, behavior and mood 16 points, activities of daily living (ADLs) 52 points, 56 points and holding motor complications of drug therapy 23 points. The score for each item ranges from 0 to 4, with the maximum value indicates greater disease involvement and the minimum normal.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a progressive, degenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized primarily by motor abnormalities. The objective was to analyze the effect of functional electrical stimulation associated with the Suica ball exercises in postural control by analyzing the pressure center of the base support in a patient with Parkinson's disease. The sample constituting an male patient, diagnosed with Parkinson's disease clinc. For the evaluation scale was used to estimate unified software and parkinsonian postural assessment (SAPO). For treatment to functional electrical stimulation of paraspinal muscles in the exercises associated with the Suica Ball. Results: The UPDRS found that the individual meets with a score of 41 points and staging of Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 Modified. On the scale of activities of daily living Schwab and England: 60% had some dependency. The center of gravity (CG) obtained in the frontal plane before the intervention was -93.2% (-11.8 cm) and after intervention -14.5% (-2.8 cm) and position of the projection of the COG plan sagittal before intervention was 34.6% (8 cm) and after intervention was 26.5% (5.8 cm). We conclude that FES associated with the Suica ball exercises fostered improvement in postural control.</summary>
