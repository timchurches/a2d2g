  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgical resection of prostate by one of the following surgical techniques (three different interventions)
1. TURP (transurethral resection of prostate, one hour duration)
2. Freyer's prostatectomy (open transvesical prostatectomy, one and a half hour duration) 
3. Millin prostatectomy (open retropubic transcapsular resection of prostate, one and a half hour duration)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimate the percent of resected tissue and collerate this with the improvement on urinary symptoms</outcome>
      <timepoint>The percent of resected tissue is going to be calculated as the resected tissue weight divided by the preoperative prostate weight x 100. The preoperative prostate weight is going to be estimated as the preoperative prostate volume x specific gravity of prostate. The prostate tissue collected at resection is going to be weighed and multiplied by 1.2 to compensate for 'shrinkage' (resected tissue weight).
The improvement on symptoms is going to be assessed with the questionnaire of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the extra question for quality of life (QoL), the post-void residual (PVR) urine volume and the Qmax in uroflowmetry. All these are going to be estimated preoperatively and three (3) months after the procedure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>If the increased amount of removed tissue influence the spontaneous detection of prostate cancer during surgical treatment of BPH(Benign Prostate Hyperplasia).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Postoperatively with the histopathologic examination. As it is known, prostate cancer more frequently is developed in the peripheral zone of prostate. So by increasing the amount of tissue resected, theoritically get closed to the peripheral zone of the prostate. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Changes in prostate volume before and after
surgical treatment for BPH have been reported, but only few
studies have assessed the correlation between the percent of resected tissue and the clinical outcome. To evaluate this colleration in men treated either with TURP or open prostatectomy.</summary>
