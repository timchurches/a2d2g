  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two intervention groups of new women blood donors who have been tested at the first blood donation and found to have a ferritin level of 12-25 micrograms/L and are age 18-60 years (inclusive), will be monitored for iron status, donor return rate and interdonation interval between the second and third whole blood donations.
  
At the second whole blood donation:
Group 1: will be offered a 30 day course of a nutritional iron supplement (18mg carbonyl iron tablets) at a dose of one tablet daily over a 30 day period, or one tablet daily until finished if some days are omitted for any reason. (The 18mg dose size of carbonly iron is registered as a nutritional supplement in New Zealand; it is not registered as a medicine.)
Group 2: will receive verbal and written dietary advice to enhance iron intake by increasing awareness of food choices that may increase their intake of available food iron. The intervention will occur on one occasion at the donor confidential interview before giving the second blood donation.

All participating donors will be tested for ferritin status at the first, second and third whole blood donations.  At the second donation. the donors in the two intervention groups will be informed of their iron status test result at their first donation and the significance of the result.  As part of each intervention the donors will be informed that their iron status was borderline or low normal and that intervention to boost iron intake is recommended.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will have no intervention.  Standard procedures for collecting a whole blood donation will occur at the second and third whole blood donations.  Donors will not be informed of the result of iron status test results at the first donation.</comparator>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Informed consent to participate will be obtained at the confidential routine donor interview before the first whole blood donation is collected.

Allocation to one of the two intervention arms, or the control arm of the study will be determined by the week on which each donor presents to give the second whole blood donation.  

A randomised allocation that lists the weeks on which each intervention or control procedure is to be applied will be provided to each participating Donor Collection Site.  All donors who attend on that day will have the same intervention or control procedure.  It is expected that donor accrual will require 12 months to achieve the donor numbers required.

Details of which intervention or control arm will apply in each week will be provided to the Donor Centres late in the previous week.

Note 1.: Blood Service Staff who manage and arrange donor appointments will not have access to information about which female donors are included or excluded from the Study.  They will also not have access to information qbout which intervention or control treatment is to be applied on particular weeks.  
Note 2: Only a small minority of donors attending on any one day to donate blood will be included in the Study.</concealment>
    <sequence>In each week of the study all eligible donors (ie those donors returning to give their second donation) will enter the same intervention or control arm.  Allocation of each week of the study to one of the three study arms will occur using a stratified randomisation procedure:
1. The period during which donors will give their second donations has been divided into 3 week periods.  
2. The three interventions, ie Control, Iron supplementation and Diet advice, can be arranged in six different sequences.  The six possible sequences were identified and coded numerically.  
3. Randomisation was undertaken by generating a sequence of 34 random numbers from 0 to &lt;1 using Microsoft Excel.  The sequence of numbers was then divided into six equal parts based on numerical value. 
4. The six sequence codes for the three interventions were allocated to the random number sequence, depending on the value of the random number.
5. The procedure was repeated seven times and the allocation sequence that provided the lowest variance (var=1.2) for utilising all of the six intervention sequences was selected.

This randomisation approach was adopted to minimise bias that might arise from incorrect application of randomisation within Blood Donor Centres if donor staff had scope to apply all of the three interventions on any one day.  It was also designed to avoid bias from the known substantial variation in numbers of donors who attend on different days of the week.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will provide information needed for the New Zealand Blood Service to develop a strategy that will deal effectively with issue of impaired iron status and iron deficiency in some female blood donors.  This is an important problem because of the potential for adverse effects on donor health and secondly because of loss of donors from the active donor panel.  No commonly agreed strategies exist in international practice for Blood Services to deal with these problems which involve a complex set of interrelated issues. These include: dietary patterns and overall iron status in females in the community, the amount of iron in each whole blood donation, the frequency of donor call-up to donate, the use of tests to assess donor iron status and the scope for low risk iron intervention strategies that are acceptable to the blood donor community and are demonstrably effective.

The study will evaluate the effect of two interventions: firstly, iron replacement using a product that is available as a registered nutritional supplement.  This product will provide partial replacement of the iron in each blood donation.  The second approach will assess the impact of written and verbal dietary advice.  

The study will evaluate the effect on iron status from the interventions in a cohort of female new donors together with the effect of the interventions on return rates to give further donations by the donors.  

NZ Blood Service expects to develop strategies for donor iron status testing and for donor iron support from information obtained in this study and in other recent research on iron status in NZ blood donors.</summary>
