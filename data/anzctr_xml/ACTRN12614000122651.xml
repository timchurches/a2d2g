    <statisticalmethods>For the non-asthmatic cohort, estimates of the mean and median periostin levels and 90% confidence intervals for prediction will be determined for both Chinese and Caucasian ethnic groups by a general linear model. As periostin has a highly skewed distribution, we will perform the analysis on the logarithm transformed scale with a back-transformation to establish the 90% confidence interval for prediction. An estimate of the difference between the Chinese and Caucasian ethnic groups will also be calculated by the general linear model. An exploratory analysis will be done to examine the effects of country of birth (New Zealand and Australia vs Asia).
The sample size of 120 adults is based on the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute that 120 participants should be studied to allow 90% confidence intervals to be computed by non-parametric methods if normal distribution assumptions are not met. No stratification by age or sex will be undertaken, as there is no association between these variables and serum periostin levels. Based on the SD of the logarithm periostin of 0.22, a sample size of 120 in the Chinese group and 420 in the Caucasian group has 90% power with alpha 5% to detect a difference in mean logarithm periostin of 0.074 equivalent to a ratio of mean periostin of 1.08.
With regards to investigating if an association exists between asthma severity and serum periostin levels in a Chinese population, 68 participants are sufficient to detect a paired difference in periostin of 0.5 of a standard deviation with 80% power. The conventional interpretation of an effect size of 0.5 of a standard deviation is of a medium effect size. For a comparison between mild and moderate/severe asthma, a sample size of 68 has 90% power to detect a 0.8 standard deviation difference, a large effect size difference.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Levels of POSTN (a protein-coding gene, also known as osteoblast specific factor) expression and periostin have been measured in a number of tissues and disease states, and results from studies measuring serum periostin levels have indicated that there may be a difference in serum periostin levels in people of Chinese descent. This study endeavours to provide serum periostin levels in a healthy Chinese population which will then be compared to levels found in healthy Caucasians.  Results from this study will be used to determine whether a serum periostin reference range is required for the Chinese population. The study will also look at the periostin levels in Chinese asthmatic patients, in order to determine if there is a difference in periostin levels between Chinese patients with and without asthma. </summary>
