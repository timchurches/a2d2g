  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) - Change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 26</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean of 9-point Self Measured Plasma Glucose Profile (SMPG) - Mean of SMPG after 26 weeks of treatment. Plasma glucose measured: before breakfast, 90 minutes after start of breakfast, before lunch, 90 minutes after start of lunch, before dinner, 90 minutes after start of dinner, bedtime, at 4 am and before breakfast.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 26</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes - Rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Nocturnal Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes - Rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as occurring between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m.</outcome>
