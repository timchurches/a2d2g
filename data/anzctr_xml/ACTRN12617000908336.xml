  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group participants will undergo an individual, unsupervised  12-week strength and conditioning program, whilst the control group will complete 30 minutes of moderate intensity walking 3 days per week.
After the 12-week period, all participants will undergo the same assessments completed at the baseline.  Participants adherence will be monitored via an exercise diary.
The intervention program is to be performed 3 days per week, at a time convenient to the participant.  Exercises will be performed as 3 sets of 15 repetitions, with 1minute rest periods between sets.  Intensity will be 13/20 RPE.  Exercises include: internal/external shoulder rotation, scapulothoracic wall slide, push-ups, latissimus dorsi pull downs, shoulder press, seated rows, wrist flexion, wrist extension, radial deviation, ulnar deviation, weighted wrist rotations, stress ball squeezes, lunges, crab walks, and deadlifts. 
Exercises are provided to the participants in the form of online videos on a dedicated YouTube channel.  This was chosen for ease of access.  These videos have detailed descriptions and demonstrations of each exercise, as well as describing the intended intensity.  </interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Injury Rate - measured via a brief questionnaire designed specifically for this study, which asks about shoulder, wrist or low back pain in the past 4 weeks.  It will ask for information in terms of how long the pain lasted for, how severe it was, and did it stop them from practicing their manual therapy skills.  This will be issued at the beginning and every 4 weeks during the trial.
This is a composite primary outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of a larger scale study and the potential for its subsequent success. Particularly, implementing a strength and conditioning program into various curricula to attempt to prevent future injuries in the manual therapy professions. 
All participants will undergo a series of baseline measures over seven days.  This will include demographic information, history of musculoskeletal injury, and maximal strength of muscle groups, which will be estimated using the multiple repetition test procedure (5-10 submaximal strength test) instead of traditional one repetition maximum test (1RM).  1RM will be calculated for each of: strict shoulder press (SP), bench press, seated row, Latissimus Dorsi pull down, deadlift, and back racked lunge.  Participants will be instructed on correct usage of equipment prior to the testing session and given time to familiarize themselves with the equipment.  A warm up will be completed prior to testing.  Thereafter, 3-5 separate single attempts will be performed.  Subjects will lift a weight initially 40%-60% of the perceived 1-RM. The increments of weight are dependent upon the effort required for the lift. The weight added will become smaller as the effort to lift the weight increases. If subjects are able to perform more lifts than designated by the testing protocol, subjects are allowed a minimum of four min rest and then reassessed. Participants will be instructed to perform each exercise to acute muscular exhaustion or form fatigue. Any repetitions that are not performed with a full range of motion will be discarded. When the subject can only lift the weight five to ten times, that weight and the number of repetitions are considered to estimate the 1-RM.
Grip strength dynamometry will be performed during the strength testing procedure. 

After completion of all baseline measures, each participant will be randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=5) or comparison (n=5) group using a random number generator.
Intervention group participants will undergo a 12-week strength and conditioning program, whilst the control group will perform 30 minutes of moderate intensity walking 3 days per week.

After the 12-week period all participants will undergo the same assessments completed at the baseline.
