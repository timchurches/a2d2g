  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Nursing home staff, GPs and pharmacists will undergo education and academic detailing on best practice in prescribing antipsycyhotic medications in older people and non-pharmacological approaches to managing challenging behaviours.
GPs will undergo approximately 6 hours of academic detailing which will be accredited by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners as a Clinical Audit attracting 40 CPD points. This will include a predisposing activity, approximately 3-4 hours total face to face time and evaluation activities at 6 months post detailing. In the instance that a GP does not require the CPD points and declines to undertake the RACGP activity, they will instead be offered a reimbursement of $25 for the time invested in attending to study tasks involving their patient.
Pharmacists will undertake similar activities including a Group 2 continuing education module (8 points) accredited through the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia and the supply pharmacists will also be given the opportunity to undertake a Drug Use Evaluation activity (Group 3).
1 or 2 Registered Nurses at each participating nursing home will be given the role of "HALT Champion". These Champions will be the leaders of education and change within their workplaces. Their role will commence with a 3-day face to face workshop on person centred care, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and how to manage these symptoms using non-pharmacological approaches. This workshop is interactive and provides practical strategies for implementation in the workplace. This education takes a "train the trainer" approach and following this workshop Champions will train the other care staff within their facility. They will do this using mini-tutorials at shift changeover (10 minutes), memo-cards, sharing of educational resources and at team meetings. The whole training process will take approximately 2 months and the aim of HALT is to have these new approaches to managing BPSD integrated into the culture of each nursing home resulting in sustained implementation of these strategies.
Training of nursing home staff will be completed prior to the commencement of deprescribing.

2. Nursing home residents taking antipsychotic medications such as Risperidone, Haloperidol, Quetiapine and Olanzapine to manage Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia will be identified and with agreement from their GP these medications will be deprescribed over a period of up to 3 months. Deprescribing protocols will be established for each resident participating in the trial by their GP and research pharmacist. Each dose reduction will take place at least 2 weeks apart until the drug is completely withdrawn.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Pre-baseline data is collected up to 3 months prior to deprescribing. Most commonly this will occur 1-2 months prior to deprescribing and then baseline data will be collected 1 week prior to deprescribing. Assessments of cognition, quality of life and behaviour will be conducted on each participant prior to initiation of deprescribing. This data will serve as a historical control. Data on falls, hospitalisations and other adverse events will be collected from participants facility files. This audit will take in the 12 months prior to commencement of the intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is reduction of regular antipsychotic medication (operationalised as number of days per month any antipsychotics used and olanzapine equivalent standardized milligrams per day). This will be measured by comparing historical medication data with medication audits (facility/pharmacy) conducted during the course of the study. This will be looked at on an individual, facility and overall basis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 6 and 12 month follow up following deprescribing</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rates of hospitalisation. This data will be collected by reviewing facility records, adverse events data and comparing the 12 months preceding the study with the data collected during the study period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected for the 12 months preceding the commencement of the study and at 3-monthly intervals during the study timeframe (approximately 15 months of data collection).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>cognition as measured by the Psychogeriatric Assessment Scales - Cognitive impairment subscale (PAS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected at Pre-baseline (approximately 3 months before deprescribing starts), Baseline (approximately 1 week before deprescribing starts) and at 3-monthly intervals during the study timeframe (approximately 12 months of follow up data collection).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>rates of antipsychotic prescribing in residential aged care facilities. This will be assessed by reviewing pharmacy records for each participating facility and looking at rates of antipsychotic prescriptions in the 12 months preceding the study and the study period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected for the 12 months preceding the study and also collected every 3 months during the study timeframe (12 months data collection following commencement of deprescribing).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of falls. This data will be collected during an audit of nursing home records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected for the 12 months preceding the study and also collected every 3 months during the study timeframe(12 months data collection following commencement of deprescribing).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>presence of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory. This tool collects information on 12 BPSD - delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviour, sleep and nighttime behaviour disorders, appetite and eating changes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected at Pre-baseline (approximately 3 months before deprescribing starts), Baseline (approximately 1 week before deprescribing starts) and at 3-monthly intervals during the study timeframe (approximately 12 months of follow up data collection).</timepoint>

Data collection will take place before deprescribing (up to 3 months and 1 week prior) and during a 12 month follow-up (3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the start of deprescribing). Multiple linear regression will be used estimate the effect of deprescribing over time on regular use of antipsychotic medication. The primary outcome is reduction of regular antipsychotic medication (operationalised as number of days per month any antipsychotics used and chlorpromazine equivalent standardized milligrams per day). The main predictor variable is time. Baseline measures of: age, cognition, function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, agitation, quality of life, comorbidities and non-antipsychotic medications will be entered as covariates.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is strong evidence of adverse effects of polypharmacy in older people and of the benefits of deprescribing generally and antipsychotics particularly. Halting Antipsychotic use in Long Term Care (HALT) is a collaboration between consumers, residential aged care providers, staff, general practitioners, pharmacists, the Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service (DBMAS), Dementia Training Study Centre (DTSC), and specialists to reduce inappropriate antipsychotic medication use in long-term resident users and correspondingly to reduce complications, rates of decline and mortality without consequently increasing behavioural and psychological symptoms. We aim to demonstrate that HALT is a nationally applicable and sustainable model.</summary>
