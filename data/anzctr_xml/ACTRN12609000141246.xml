    <interventions>Addition of Thalidomide 6 weeks after the end of first line chemotherapy, involving antifolate (pemetrexed) with or with out platinum combination (4-6 Cycles). Thalidomide will be administered daily until disease progression or a maximim of 1 year. Patients randomised to receive thalidomide will be treated with thalidomide 100 mg (Starting dose) nightly for the first two weeks. If there are no severe side effects the dose will be increased to 200mg nightly. The mode of administration is oral.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>MAintenance Thalidomide in mEsothelioma patientS (MATES) alone: Quality of life using the Quality of life questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life module LC13 (QLM-LC13), the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS)- patient scale and the Pt DATA form completed by patients. The Spitzer Quality of Life Index (QLI) and the LCSS-observer scale completed by physicians.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Statistical analysis of MATES study will be completed after recruitment and follow-up of 100 patients. During treatment and after treatment quality of life will be assessed every 4 weeks until disease progression.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pooled NVALT5/ MATES (The main objective of NVALT 5 study is to evaluate the effect of maintenance by thalidomide in the time to progression (TTP) in patients who did not progress after &gt; or = 4 courses of treatment and pemetrexed +/- platinum. All time dependent end-points will be taken from the date of randomisation. The main objective of MATES is QOL, and TTP is a secondary endpoint. The data from MATES on TTP, progression free survival and toxicity will be pooled with the NVALT-5 study in a prospective meta-analysis of these endpoints): Time to progression will be assessed with CT scans, chest X-rays and other disease evaluation tools.</outcome>

      <outcome>Progression free survival will also be assessed with CT scans, chest X-rays and other disease evaluation tools.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomisation until first observation of disease progression, every 8 weeks or death from any cause.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity will be assessed by clinical and laboratory adverse events using Common Toxicity Criteria version 3</outcome>
      <timepoint>Toxicity is assessed weekly for first four weeks during treatment and then at the end of cycle every 4 weeks until the end of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prognostic value of biomarkers will be assessed by using survival and volumetric tumour burden.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at the end of cycle every 4 weeks until week 16.
Statistical analysis of pooled NVALT5/MATES study will be completed after recruitment and follow-up of 216 patients. All patients during treatment will have a clinical exam, clinical symptoms/toxicity evaluation and blood analysis every 4 weeks and radiology tests every 8 weeks, after treatment all patients will have 8 weekly radiological tests (CT scans, X-rays) until disease progression.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a tumour in the lining outside of the lung. This type of tumour is closely linked to exposure to asbestos fibres. The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with thalidomide for people with malignant pleural mesothelioma will delay the time until the disease gets worse and also if it will keep people feeling better.
Thalidomide was originally used as a sedative during pregnancy in the late 1950s, with detrimental effects on the embryo. However since then, it has been found that thalidomide may delay tumour growth in people with mesothelioma. The formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), plays an important role in tumour growth and spread. Thalidomide stops or delays the formation of new blood vessels (anti-angiogenic effect), which may prevent or slow down the return of cancer.
The research is being done because it is not clear if treatment with thalidomide after treatment with pemetrexed can offer better results than the usual care, which is to have no further chemotherapy treatment after treatment with pemetrexed.</summary>
