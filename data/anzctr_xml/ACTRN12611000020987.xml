  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three linked interventions: (i) the introduction and use of a nutritional screening tool - MUST - Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, (ii) the provision of food supplements at ward level, and (iii) the introduction of a red tray system to identify those patients requiring help with eating and drinking) will be introduced.
The interventions will be introduced over a two month period using a stepped wedge trial that ensures that all wards in the hospital will ultimately be included in the intervention. Varying amounts of historical control data will be recorded at all wards in the hospital prior to the introduction of the intervention.
The intervention itself will be implemented by pairs of facilitators across four steps (or groups) of six hospital wards each; there will be eight facilitators. One of the facilitatory pair will be a senior nurse from one of the six wards, the other will be a dietician from the hospital. 
The two facilitators will be educated on the intervention using a 'train-the-trainer' approach and supplied with educational materials for subsequent transmission to nurses (enrolled and registered) working across the six wards in their group.
With respect to the intervention:
(i) The MUST tool is a standard tool for assessing patients at risk of malnutrition. It comprises four steps including measurement of current weight, height, weight 3-6 months ago and nutritional intaks. Staff will be trained in the use of the tool, and compliance with tool use will be recorded by reviewing patient records.
(ii) Patients identified by the MUST as being at medium or high risk of malnutrition will be offered nutritional supplements and nourishing fluids using supplies available at ward level, instituting a menu suitable for people with poor appetites to include nourishing mid-meals and ensuring access to mid meal snacks for at risk patients. 
(iii) a red tray, jug and glass will be provided to patients requiring assistance and encouragement with meals due to inability to feed themselves to a satisfactory level, as identified by the MUST.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of change in body mass (kg) from admission to discharge. Body mass will be measured using the same weighing machine for individual patients. Depending on patient mobility this may require a standing, sitting, bed, or sling weighing machine. 
There is no expectation that this will result in an adverse event, as weighing patients should be standard practice. For frail, or heavy or immobile patients, appropriate care will be taken to ensure that patients are not harmed as a result of being weighed. This may require several staff to conduct the weighing following appropriate hospital guidelines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Limited to duration of hospital visit, typically 3-7 days, can be longer</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of change in body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated as the mass divided by height squared (kg/m2). While changes in BMI give a more precise estimate about nutritional status than changes in body mass, it is envisaged that measurement of height will have a lower compliance rate than measurement of mass, and therefore we have made BMI the second primary outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Limited to duration of hospital visit, typically 3-7 days, can be longer</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Length of stay (days), measured by reviewing patient records on hospital records system. There are no adverse events expected through measuring this outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Limited to duration of hospital visit, typically 3-7 days, can be longer.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of patient falls, as measured by the hospital's critical incident reporting system. While this outcome is in itself an adverse event, there are no adverse events expected through measuring this outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Limited to duration of hospital visit, typically 3-7 days, can be longer.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of infections, as measured by a positive pathology test (blood, urine, wound, sputum) in the patient's medical record. While this outcome could represent an adverse event, there are no adverse events expected through measuring this outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Limited to duration of hospital visit, typically 3-7 days, can be longer.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All cause mortality as recorded on the hospital records system</outcome>
      <timepoint>Limited to duration of hospital visit, typically 3-7 days, can be longer.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anti-biotic use, measured as the number of prescriptions filled by the hospital pharmacy for antibiotics. Data to be provided by the hospital pharmacy. There are no adverse events expected through measuring this outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Limited to duration of hospital visit, typically 3-7 days, can be longer.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Readmission rate, measured as the number of unplanned hospital readmissions to the same hospital within 28 days of discharge. Data measured using the hospital records system; no adverse effects anticipated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 28 days of patient discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Context of nursing care, as measured using the Alberta Context Tool (ACT). The ACT will be administered to nursing staff working in the wards pre- and post-implementation of the nutrition intervention. The ACT provides insight into the culture, leadership, feedback processes, structural and electronic processes and "slack" within the organisation to promote a positive context for successfully implementing evidence into practice. There are no adverse events expected through measuring this outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month prior to implementing the intervention.
4 months post implementing the intervetnion.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The design is a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial.
The unit of randomisation is the ward of the hospital.
There are 24 wards in the hospital that will be randomised to four groups (or steps); therefore there will be 6 wards per group.
The wards will be randomised to each of the four groups. However, there are four nursing staff that will facilitate the implementation of the intervention across each of the four groups. The wards at which each of these facilitators works at will be assigned to a different group to ensure that each of the facilitator's ward is included in the group that they are facilitating. Therefore the facilitators' wards will be stratified to each of the four groups. The stratification will be randomised.
Allocation will be conducted using central randomisation (computer software) by an off-site third party (Data Management &amp; Analysis Centre (DMAC)).</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation process will be undertaken by an independent statistician at the Data Management &amp; Analysis Centre (DMAC), Discipline of Public Health, University of Adelaide, using Stata software.
DMAC will be provided with a list of 24 wards, identifying the four wards that are to be stratified to each group. 
It is not possible to conceal the allocation of wards to the four groups.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The stepped wedge design is a form of crossover trial; insetad of each arm crossing from one treatment to another, each arm crosses from being a control site to being a treatment site, however, the timing varies for the four different groups.
For example, prior to the implementation (Time 0), data is collected from each ward in each group. At this stage all this data is control data. At the next time period (Time 1), the intervention is implemented at all wards in group 1, and data is, again, collected from all wards in all groups. At the next time period (Time 2), the intervention is implemented at all wards in group 2, and data is collected from all wards in all groups. This pattern continues until the intervention is implemented across all four groups. At the conclusion of the trial, all wards have received the intervention and have a varying amount of historical data with which comparisons are possible. Comparison is also possible against control sites which have not yet had the intervention.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to evaluate the impact of three linked nutritional interventions on the nutritional care of patients at risk of malnutrition in an acute tertiary hospital setting. This will be achieved by improving the quality of assessment, screening and feeding of patients. Specifically, three linked interventions (the introduction and use of a nutritional screening tool, the provision of food supplements at ward level, and, the introduction of a red tray system to identify those patients requiring help with eating and drinking) will be introduced in a staged way into four groups of randomly allocated wards in the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH). Staff will receive facilitated support from members of the research team to assist in implementing the intervention on their wards. By the end of the intervention, all wards of the hospital will have introduced the composite intervention. A stepped wedge design will be utilised to compare outcomes (including: changes in body mass during their hospital visit, length of stay, number of infections, readmission rates) pre-, during and post-intervention.</summary>
