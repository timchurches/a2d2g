    <interventions>Flinders Program for Chronic Care Management

The Flinders Program provides a generic set of tools and processes that enables health workers and patients to undertake a structured process that provides assessment of self-management behaviours, collaborative identification of problems and goal-setting, leading to the development of individualised longitudinal (12 month) care plans. 

For the trial, the Flinders Program will be delivered as an initial care planning session between the client and a health professional who has been trained in using the Program. The health professional will provide follow up 2-4 weekly for up to 6 months to monitor progress, provide feedback and motivation, and problem solving training to assist the client to achieve their goals and enhance their self-management.

Participants in this group also receive usual care for the duration of the Flinders Program and until the end of the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care

Those who are allocated to usual care will receive the usual set of services provided to people with chronic conditions. These include a range of nursing and allied health services, e.g., diabetes education, asthma education, podiatry, nutrition advice, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy. 

Participants in this arm will be followed while receiving these services for the duration of the trial, ie up to 18 months.</comparator>
