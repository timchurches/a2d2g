  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study exploring the safety and efficacy of the combination of ABT-199 and tamoxifen in patients with metastatic ER-positive breast cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to take part in this study if you are aged over 18 and have metastatic breast cancer that is oestrogen receptor positive.

Study Details
Participants are recruited into either the dose escalation phase or dose expansion phase of the study depending upon when they decide to enrol. Before the study starts, they are asked to sign a consent form. Each participant then goes through a series of tests to see whether the study is suitable for them. These tests include reviewing the participants medical and medication history, a physical examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG), CT and bone scans (to locate and measure tumours), taking urine and blood samples for testing and asking about how able they are to do their usual daily activities. If a participant's test results are satisfactory, they are enrolled into the study. They are asked to visit the study hospital once a week for the first 4 weeks, and then at least once a month after that. Both the study medications (ABT-199 and tamoxifen) are tablets to be taken once a day by mouth with breakfast and a glass of water. Participants are given their first dose of both study medications in the hospital clinic. Subsequently, both tablets are provided for the participants to take at home every day with clear instructions on how to take the tablets. During the visits to the hospital, each participant has blood tests, CT scans and bone scans (if applicable) to determine if they are responding to treatment and to ensure that they are not having major side-effects as a result of the treatment. They are also asked if they are happy to have tissue biopsies of their cancer about a month after treatment. This is optional but strongly encouraged as it provides valuable information about how the drug affects the cancer. Each participant continues to take the study tablets as long as they are able to tolerate them, and if their cancer continues to respond. Each participant is monitored for side-effects after they have completed the study. Participants can, of course, choose to withdraw their participation from the study at any time.</summary>
