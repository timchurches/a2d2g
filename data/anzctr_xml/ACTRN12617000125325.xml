  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this pilot trial is to evaluate whether a full-scale clinical trial for gastrografin is feasible, and to provide an initial estimate of the efficacy of gastrografin for the resolution of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with MBO.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this pilot trial will receive the same treatment. This involves a single oral dose of gastrografin administered as a 100ml solution. Participants will then be followed up for 5 days to assess whether the treatment has reached the bowel, whether it has been effective in clearing the obstruction and any side effects which may have occurred. 

It is hoped that the findings from this trial can be used to inform future clinical trials on the use of gastrografin in palliative care. </summary>
