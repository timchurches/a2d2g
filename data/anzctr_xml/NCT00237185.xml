  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Imatinib mesylate

Experimental: imatinib mesylate 400 mg - 400 mg once daily

Experimental: imatinib mesylate 600 mg - 600 mg once daily


Treatment: drugs: Imatinib mesylate
Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive imatinib mesylate 400 mg/day or 600 mg/day. Upon unsatisfactory treatment effect on the starting dose of 400 mg/day or 600 mg/day imatinib mesylate, in the opinion of the treating physician, a dose increase up to 600 mg/day or 800 mg/day, was allowed provided that the participant continued to benefit from the treatment and in the absence of safety concerns.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Tumor Response (Core) - Best tumor response was based on the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria. Objective tumor response assessments were categorized according to the following criteria: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), no change or stable disease (SD), progression of disease (PD), unknown where the progression has not been documented and one or more measurable or evaluable sites have not been assessed (UNK), status after resection for progression (RP), status after resection for safety (RS), status after preventive resection (RPR), progressive after first resection (PDR) and not evaluable. Any tumor assessment after surgical resection for preventative reasons was treated like tumor assessments of UNK for calculation of best response. Tumor assessments with current objective status = RP, RS or PDR were treated like assessments with objective tumor status = PD n the calculation of best response.</outcome>

      <outcome>Best Tumor Response (Core + Extension) - Best tumor response was based on the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria.

      <outcome>Overall Survival (Core) - Overall survival was analyzed as time to event for all participants. Participants who did not die were censored at the last date known alive, which is the last date of any study medication, laboratory sample, tumor assessment, adverse event end date or date of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of first imatinib dose to the date of death during the core period, up to 36 months.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) (Core + Extension) - Progression free survival was analyzed as a time to event for each participant. If a participant had no event, then the PFS was censored at the last tumor assessment.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the core study, participants with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal
      tumors expressing c-kit were treated with either 400 mg or 600 mg imatinib mesylate for 3
      years. The 10 year extension study allowed participants, who successfully completed the core
      study, to continue study treatment with imatinib mesylate provided they still benefited from
      treatment and did not demonstrate safety concerns as per the investigator's opinion.</summary>
