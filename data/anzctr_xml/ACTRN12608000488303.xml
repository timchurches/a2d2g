  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anaesthesia and intraoperative management
General anaesthesia will be induced with 1-8% sevoflurane via a facemask. Anaesthesia will be maintained with 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) sevoflurane.  Intraoperative monitoring will include pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), end tidal carbon dioxide concentration and heart rate. An intraoperative increase in respiratory rate, heart rate or mean arterial pressure of &gt;20% following skin incision or during surgery will be defined as insufficient analgesia and treated with 0.25 ug/kg fentanyl intravenously.


Local wound infiltration
Once general anaesthesia has been established the surgeon will perform all subcutaneous periumbilical local anaesthetic infiltrations. Following aseptic preparation of the site a total of 0.3ml/kg (to a maximum of 5ml) of combined 1% lignocaine and 1% ropivacaine will be infiltrated 5 minutes prior to skin incision.

Ultrasound guided Rectus sheath blocks
Once general anaesthesia has been established the primary investigator, or consultant anaesthetist experienced in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia in children, will perform the bilateral rectus sheath block. A Micromaxx ultrasound machine with either a hockey stick or high frequency linear (HFL) probe will be used to identify the relevant structures within the rectus sheath. Following aseptic preparation of the puncture site and the ultrasound probe, the rectus sheath block will be performed under cross-sectional continuous ultrasound imaging.  A 22g spinal needle will be used to facilitate placement on both sides of the umbilicus. The injection site will be defined where the optimal ultrasonic visualisation of the posterior sheath is achieved. Once the needle is correctly positioned within the rectus sheath a predetermined volume of 1% lignocaine and 1% Ropivacaine will be injected following a negative aspiration test. A total of 0.3ml/kg (to a maximum of 5ml) of combined 1% lignocaine and 1% ropivacaine will infiltrated bilaterally 5 minutes prior to skin incision.</interventions>

Once general anaesthesia has been established the surgeon will perform all subcutaneous periumbilical local anaesthetic infiltrations. Following aseptic preparation of the site a total of 0.3ml/kg (to a maximum of 5ml) of combined 1% lignocaine and 1.0% ropivacaine will be infiltrated 5 minutes prior to skin incision.</comparator>

    <concealment>If the patient is suitable, a patient information booklet will be sent via mail prior to the planned operation date. The participants will be seen as part of the routine preoperative assessment and at this contact, consent for participation will be obtained. 
Before induction of anaesthesia children will be randomised to 1 of 2 groups. Randomisation will occur by a random number generator and delivered in a sealed opaque envelope. According to the randomisation the patient will receive either subcutaneous local wound infiltration or ultrasound guided bilateral rectus sheath block.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will occur by a random number generator computer program and will be delivered in a sealed opaque envelope. According to the randomisation the patient will receive either subcutaneous local wound infiltration or ultrasound guided bilateral rectus sheath block.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>If the primary hypothesis is confirmed, this study will provide evidence supporting ultrasound placement of bilateral rectus sheath nerve blocks. At present subcutaneous periumbilical local infiltration is the community standard.  No study has compared the two techniques to assess which method is more effective for providing analgesia for umbilical hernia repair in paediatric patients. The results of this study may show that ultrasound guided rectus sheath block provides more effective analgesia resulting in patients having decreased analgesic requirements following the periumbilical hernia repair.</summary>
