  <interventions>
    <interventions>SolaThin is an extract of pure potato protein consisting of several low molecular weight proteins, including protease inhibitor PI-2. It has been suggested that certain protease inhibitor fractions may lead to a reduction in food intake via modulation of Cholecystokinin (CCK) levels.

On the testing days participants will have weight, height and body measurements recorded and complete baseline mood and appetite questionnaires. Participants will then consume one beverage pre-prepared by the investigator containing SolaThin Supplement or matching placebo. 20 minutes after the consumption of the treatment participants will complete the mood and appetite questionnaires again and have a series of blood tests taken.
At the end of testing day one, participants will be given their 21 day allotment of beverages containing the same treatment as the testing day and counselled on the appropriate way to consume the beverages. Participants will be required to consume the beverage 20 minutes before all main meals (three times a day) for the 21 days.      

Testing day two will be the same as testing day one however participants will also have energy intake measured (assessed by analysis of buffet food intake) 

The 3 treatments are:
-	500mg SolaThin (see details below)
-	1g SolaThin (see details below)
-	Placebo (matched for taste and appearance)
Beverages will consist of 200 ml water mixed with one sachet of treatment.

      <outcome>Weight, height and body measurements.

Weight, height,  waist, hip, upper arm, thigh and chest circumference and percent body fat will be measured during a clinical assessment by a trained technician/Research Assistant using a sensitive scientific scale and tape measure. Body Mass Index (BMI) will also be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>To capture any weight loss effects participant height, weight, body fat, and body measurements will be measured at baseline on day 1 and at visit two following the 21 day intervention.</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite as measured by self-ratings of hunger, thirst, fullness, desire to eat, prospective eating and nausea</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to complete appetite scales prior to one meal (i.e. 20 min following either SolaThin or placebo) twice per week. The meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) will be varied so that there will be 2 measures for each meal for each participant.  At the end of the 21 day period they will return to the lab and complete the same assessments as day 1.</timepoint>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>To minimize bias this study will employ both randomization and blinding.

Randomization of participants will be achieved using a random number generator. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The randomisation that has been placed next to the participant’s number will be the allocated treatment for that individual. 

Blinding will be achieved by enlisting a person not involved with data collation or analysis to code the treatments, and maintain the key to this code until data collection is completed. The codes will only be broken in an emergency, such as an SAE that requires knowledge of the treatment being taken in order to manage a participant’s condition. The principle investigator, sponsor and ethics committee will be informed within 24 hours of the code-break envelope being opened.</concealment>
    <sequence>A disinterested third party will generate the randomisation sequence using a computerised sequence generator</sequence>
