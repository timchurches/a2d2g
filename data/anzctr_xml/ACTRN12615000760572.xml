  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1) Method Dance Activity [Ronnie Gardiner Method (RGM)], incorporates: music, rhythm, colour, language training, symbol recognition, coordination, endurance, attention, memory, and social interaction. The session involves symbols and words that represent up to 18 body movements, E.g., clapping hands with or without stamping feet, which are displayed on a screen.  Participants will move in various sequences performed to music. Group sessions will be led by a RGM trained therapist and will take place for an hour weekly over 12 continuous weeks. Adherence will be monitored using a register of attendance at each session. 

Arm 2) Movement dance activity focuses on moving to music, creative problem solving, improvisation, and play. Sessions will involve learning short dance sequences, making and performing short dance sequences and having fun. The emphasis is on process not product. Group sessions will be led by a trained dance instructor and will take place for an hour weekly over 12 continuous weeks. Adherence will be monitored using a register of attendance at each session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Music appreciation activity is a weekly social interaction group who will listen to the same music as the interventions and discuss it without movement. Group sessions will be led by a trained music and dance instructor and will take place for an hour weekly over 12 continuous weeks. Adherence will be monitored using a register of attendance at each session.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be invited to participate in the trial through  advertisements in retirement village newsletters, posters in the community, and through referral from general practitioners.
 
Interested participants will be asked to complete a reply card and return via reply-paid envelope. Once a reply is received that indicates problems with memory and the potential participant requests more information about the study, a researcher will then contact them to fully discuss the trial, ascertain eligibility. Qualified potential participants will receive the participant information sheet by post. They will be invited to a 30-minute meeting to fully discuss the trial and establish written informed consent. 
During the meeting consenting participants will be asked to nominate an informant who can be anyone who knows them well and the appointment time and date for the thinking and memory screening assessment will be booked. 


Consenting and eligible participants will be invited to participate in the study activities and proceed with baseline questionnaire.

The researchers will liaise with an off site colleague from the University of Auckland who is not involved in this trial, who will use a computer generated randomisation schedule. </concealment>
    <sequence>A computer generated randomisation schedule will be used to allocate participants to one of three groups using stratified randomization to uphold balance of: sex, age, cognitive screen scores, and primary and secondary outcomes between groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dementia is becoming a major medical and public health issue, as cognitive decline is one of the most prominent disabilities in old age. Older people undertaking more cognitive and physical activities have a lower risk of developing dementia. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether music and movement activities maintain or improve health and thinking abilities and if they are acceptable and suitable for older people who have some problems with their memory. 
Participants will be randomly assigned to participate in one of the following three activities for an hour over 12 continuous weeks: 1) method dance activity; 2) movement dance activity; 3) music appreciation (control). 
We hypothesize that method dance with a larger cognitive component will maintain or improve health and thinking abilities among older people with some memory problems more so than those in the music appreciation (control group) and movement dance activity. If such music and movement activities are successful and acceptable they could easily be widely disseminated to benefit the greater target population. </summary>
