  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants recruited and screened by cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment in primary care settings will be randomised either to a family-based intensive intervention to increase physical activity and healthy eating. This will be delivered at home and will involve five one hour sessions aimed at educating and informing the family on ways to improve physical activity levels and encourage healthy eating.They will occur at a time which suits the family involved.Sessions will be conducted by a health professional/nurse who has been trained specifically for this programme. Alternatively they will receive just a brief motivational interview (approximately 15 minutes) with their General Practitioner (GP) at their primary care clinic  on healthy lifestyle and the benefits of healthy eating and including physical activity in daily life to improve health outcomes .

In the workplace randomisation will be by workplace.  Either a CVD risk assessment followed by a health promotion programme or a CVD risk assessment followed by a one off motivational interview. Workplace intervention involves educational sessions on physical activity and nutrition,suggestions on changes which can be made to diet or excersise to  improve health,and workplace challenges to encourage healthy lifestyles. One off motivational/counselling session(approximately 15 minutes) will be conducted by a work place health professional and will provide advice on how to improve lifestyle by becoming physically active and eating a healthy diet. CVD Risk Assessment involves blood pressure testing, blood testing for sugar levels and lipids,height and weight measurement, and assessment of family demographic and historical information.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical activity. Phyical activity will be assessed by the New Zealand (NZ) Physical Activity questionnaire short-form (NZPAC-SF).This measures moderate and vigorous physical activity across a variety of domains which are accumulated to give weekly total minutes of vigorous and moderate physical activity.Minutes of toal weighted physical activity (vigorous minutes count for double) over one (the previous) week, will be the main outcome measure for physical activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 3 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight. For weight the main outcome measure will be the change in Body mass index (BMI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 3 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Healthy eating behaviours. Healthy eating outcomes will be a change in frequency of 
1.Breakfast eating
2.Sugary drinks consumed
3.Fast fod or takeaway meals eaten
4.Number of fruit and vegetables eaten
Each measure will be self report from the previous week</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 3 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (Blood pressure (BP), blood lipids). Cardiovascular risk score is a secondary outcome measure. This is defined as the change in the 5 year risk of a cardiovascular event as defined by the Framingham equation.</outcome>

    <concealment>Randomisation at primary cares settings is patient by patient and primary care clinics will receive advice on randomisation after participant reaches inclusion criteria. Eligible consenting patients in the primary care setting will receive notification of programme they have been randomly selected into, by a sealed envelope.

Randomisation by treatment in workplaces   is by workplace to overcome contamination concerns.Following CVD risk assessment,  one work place will receive an intervention  as mentioned in Description of Intervention, while the second workplace will receive motivational interview as in Description of Intervention</concealment>
    <sequence>Random number sequence is computer generated - this sequence is translated into allocation in primary care setting.  This is delivered to the primary care clnic in sealed envelop.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to determine whether, and to what extent, brief interventions in primary care and workplace settings are effective in the promotion of physical activity, healthy eating, and weight management. We propose two models of intervention in primary care and two in the workplace. The simple models for both settings involve a cardiovascular risk assessment followed by one-off lifestyle advice. The more complex models involve family/whanau support over five sessions (primary care) and education and/or team activities to increase physical activity and healthy eating (workplace). We will compare the effects of each model on key health indicators with associated costs to understand the most appropriate approach. The delivery partners in this project  Waiora Healthcare, HealthWEST, Harbour Health, and Vitality Works  provide access to high needs, Pacific, Maori, and South Asian populations and have broad experience in primary health and workplace health delivery.</summary>
