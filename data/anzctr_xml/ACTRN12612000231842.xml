  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fasting of solids and fluids before general anaesthesia is essential to patient safety in order to reduce the risk of the pulmonary aspiration. The high acidity of stomach contents upon aspiration can cause significant damage to lung tissue. The estimated incidence of pulmonary aspiration is low, ranging between 1/2000 to 1/14000 with morbidity relating to aspiration even lower ranging between 1/4000 to 1/99000.

Current fasting guidelines according to American Society of Anesthesiologists recommend a 2-hour fast for clear fluids before general anaesthesia. However, clear scientific evidence supporting this recommendation is lacking and the ideal fasting time and maximal permissible volume for water have yet to be determined. 

New evidence suggests that water up to 450mls can be safely consumed up to 90 minutes before induction of anaesthesia and that stomach volumes are lower in those who had consumed preoperative water than those who had a fast of 6 hours. Others have demonstrated that preoperative water consumption can also decrease patient thirst and anxiety without adverse effects. 

The proposed project aims to investigate the effect on stomach contents as measured by level of acidity and volume, following consumption of 200 ml of water up to 45 minutes before general anaesthesia. 

For this pilot study, approximately 90 elective adult patients scheduled for gastroscopy will be recruited. Patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups. Both groups will be fasted for solids and clear fluids as per standard guidelines (6 hours for solids and 2 hours for clear fluid) but they will then be randomized to drink 200 ml (standard drinking cup) at 90-150 minutes or 45-60 minutes prior to their procedure respectively. 

Immediately post induction, gastric content is suctioned and emptied under direct vision via the gastroscope to assess for its volume and pH.

This will strengthen the body of evidence that water consumption before general anesthesia up to 45 minutes before anaesthesia has minimal effect on gastric contents and may be potentially beneficial to patients.</summary>
