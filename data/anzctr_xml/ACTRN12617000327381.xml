  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1 (intervention group)- Tai Chi ; Group 2 control group
Participants in group 1 will undergo 12 weeks of Tai Chi training at the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences (RS), Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPolyU), three times a week and each session lasting for 60 minutes. A Tai Chi Master will be employed to conduct the Tai Chi sessions. The 8-form Tai Chi routine will be delivered to the participants by the Tai Chi master. This 8-form Tai Chi has been derived from Yangs style of the traditional long-form Tai-Chi routine. The 8-form Tai Chi is specifically designed for people having difficulty in standing while practicing Tai-Chi. The participants will be encouraged to continue Tai Chi practice following the 12 weeks of training. 
The participants of the usual care control group will receive one session of advice on falls prevention lasting for 30 minutes. No other intervention will be offered. The participants of the usual care control group are free to continue their routine activities over the study period. Participants of both the groups will be instructed not to register for any new exercise programs over the study period.

      <outcome>EuroQol 5 dimension 5 level (EQ5D 5L)
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain or loss will be estimated using EuroQol 5 dimension 5 level (EQ5D 5L) questionnaire. The EQ 5D 5L questionnaire includes 5 questions addressing 5 domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety), each domain  scored based on a five level index. Level 1 implies no problem and 5 extreme problem. This measure also has a visual analogue scale to rate the overall health status ranging between 0 and100, where 0 implies to the worst health one can imagine and 100 being the best health status. Permission to use the HK version of the EQ 5D 5L has been obtained and it will be used. </outcome>

      <outcome>Falls history
Assessing number of falls: Number of falls encountered following intervention will be used to report the frequency of falls. We operationally define fall as an event when the person ends up on the ground or other surfaces due to a trip or any other unintentional activity and a near fall as an unexpected loss of balance that did not result in complete loss of upright standing. The participants will be instructed to record the number of falls and near falls over the follow-up period using the cost and falls dairy.</outcome>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis will be performed using SPSS, version 22.0. Analysis will be conducted blinded for group allocation. Demographic data will be reported as mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and number and percentage for categorical variables. Mean baseline scores between the groups will be compared using independent t-tests. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the clinical outcome measures at 95% confidence interval. ANCOVA has the advantage of comparing clinical outcome measures having significant difference in the baseline values and in addition it improves the statistical power and accuracy even when the baseline differences are small and insignificant.
Cost effectiveness analysis will be performed according to intention-to-treat principle. The EQ 5D 5L (HK version) will be used to estimate the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain or loss over the follow-up period. The mean QALY gain or loss will be calculated for each group at 6 and 12 months. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tai Chi is a form of martial art that is practiced for defense and health benefits.  The health benefits of Tai Chi are well documented, which includes improved fitness, muscle strength and reduced falls risk. Convincing evidence also supports the use of Tai Chi in improving balance control. However, most of these studies are restricted to elderly people. Among neurological disorders, Tai Chi has been found to improve balance and reduce falls in Parkinsons disease and stroke and improve balance in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. To our knowledge, no research has examined the benefits of Tai Chi in health conditions resulting in cerebellar ataxia. 
This study will be conducted in 2 phases. In phase 1, the short-term and long-term treatment effectiveness of Tai Chi will be tested using a RCT. Phase 2 will be conducted alongside the RCT as an economic evaluation that will explore the cost effectiveness of Tai Chi, relative to  usual care..  This economic evaluation will be conducted in a societal perspective having follow-ups at 6 and 12 months.</summary>
