Experimental: Cohort A - Mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CYP-001) at a dose of 1 million cells/kg (up to a maximum of 100 million cells) by IV infusion on two occasions (Day 0 and Day 7)

Experimental: Cohort B - Mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CYP-001) at a dose of 2 million cells/kg (up to a maximum of 200 million cells) by IV infusion on two occasions (Day 0 and Day 7)


Other interventions: Mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells
The active agent in CYP-001 is allogeneic mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MCA-derived MSCs), which are produced using the proprietary Cymerus platform technology. Cymerus refers to the process of generating cell-based products from intermediate cells, MCAs, which in turn are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. The iPSCs used in the Cymerus process were derived from blood donated by a fully-consented healthy adult donor, and were reprogrammed using a transgene-free, viral-free and feeder-free technique.
