  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - paclitaxel
Treatment: drugs - carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - ifosfamide
Other interventions - filgrastim
Other interventions - laboratory biomarker analysis

Experimental: Treatment (chemotherapy, biological therapy) - Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Beginning on day 6, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV once daily until blood count returns to normal. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.


Treatment: drugs: paclitaxel
Given IV dosage 135 mg/m2/dose

Treatment: drugs: carboplatin
Given IV dosage in mg/m2 = Target AUC (mgmin/mL) x [(0.93 x GFR mL/min/m2) + 15]= 6.5 x [(0.93 x GFR mL/min/m2) + 15]. (BSA = body surface area in square meters). GFR is reported in institutions as "uncorrected" or "raw" (not normalized to BSA) or "corrected." This number needs to be converted to GFR in mL/min/m2.

Treatment: drugs: ifosfamide
Given IV dosage 1800 mg/m2/dose

Other interventions: filgrastim
Given IV or subcutaneously dosage 1,080mg/m2/day divided to three equal doses of 360mg/m2

Other interventions: laboratory biomarker analysis
Optional correlative studies

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Response Rate as Measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria - Patients who demonstrate a PR or CR, as defined below, will be considered as responders. RECIST criteria: CR (complete response) = disappearance of all target lesions, PR (partial response) = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, PD (progressive disease) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and SD (stable disease) = small changes that do not meet above criteria.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline (day 1) and after completion of protocol therapy (2 cycles or 42 days)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity as Measured by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) Version 4.0 - All patients who experience any grade 2 or higher toxicity at any time during the two treatment cycles or who receive at least all required Ifosfamide therapy after enrollment will be considered evaluable for toxicity. The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE version 4 will be used.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy works in treating
      young patients with recurrent or resistant malignant germ cell tumors. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.</summary>
