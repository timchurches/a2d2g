Whole blood levels of Chromium and plasma levels of Cobalt were measured. The primary endpoint was metal ion concentration at one year after surgery. 
Blood samples were analysed for Cobalt and Chromium levels by Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology, Queensland. Samples were collected from patients into EDTA trace element vacutainers (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using a stainless steel needle at a collection center and transported to the laboratory at ambient temperature for analysis.
Whole blood Chromium was analysed initially, followed by plasma Cobalt levels. Samples were diluted 1 in 20 with diluent and distilled water using a Starlet Robot (Hamilton Robotics, Reno, NV) by directly sampling from the barcoded EDTA trace element tube after thorough mixing. The diluted samples were vortexed and transferred to an Agilent 7500CE inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) equipped with Octopole reaction cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for analysis. Helium gas was used in the reaction cell for both Chromium and Cobalt analysis to reduce interference from polyatomic species formed in the plasma. The ICPMS counts for each analyte were processed using the Agilent 7500CE software. A calibration graph was constructed using the counts obtained from the ICPMS expressed as a ratio to the internal standard counts for each analytical run and specimen type. Quality control samples were run every 20 samples and their acceptability was checked.
The results were calculated from the calibration graphs, and downloaded to the laboratory computer for authorization. Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology defined levels of &lt;20 nmol/L for Cobalt and 10-100 nmol/L for Chromium as normal for an Australian population using the method of testing mentioned above</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>BACKGROUND: Metal ion release from metal implants through the processes of mechanical wear and corrosion has been one of the main concerns post total joint arthroplasty. However, there have been very few studies to show metal ion exposure post total knee implants. 
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether blood metal ion levels are raised in patients with well-functioning unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty one year after surgery. 
METHODS: Whole blood Chromium and serum Cobalt levels were measured in 22 patients following primary total knee arthroplasty. Eleven patients had the cemented triathlon knee system and 11 patients had uncemented ACS knee system with multilayer coatings.
RESULTS: Whole bloods Chromium and serum Cobalt levels were within the normal range.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, there does not appear to be any significant rise in blood metal ion levels following well-functioning total knee arthroplasty in one-year post surgery.
