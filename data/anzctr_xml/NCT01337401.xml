  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a two-arm, randomised, double-blind, international, multi-centre phase II trial
      of cediranib in Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS).

      The study aims to confirm the ability of cediranib to halt disease progression in patients
      with metastatic ASPS, as measured by the change in tumour size at 24 weeks after
      randomisation, and to produce objective response according to RECIST criteria.</summary>
