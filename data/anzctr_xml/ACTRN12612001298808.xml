  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a randomized, open label, 2-way cross-over design, 16 healthy Vietnamese volunteers will be administered a single oral dose of either 2 tablets of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ Winthrop-Registered Trademark) from Sanofi-Aventis; 100 mg AS and 270 mg AQ per tablet) or 2 tablets of ASAQ Winthrop plus 5 tablets of methylene blue (MB Urolene Blue-Registered Trademark)  from Star Pharmaceuticals; 65 mg per tablet).  The wash-out period between treatments will be 8 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of ASAQ in healthy volunteers will be compared following the administration of ASAQ alone and with MB. Also, the ex vivo antimalarial activity of plasma samples collected from the volunteers after the administration of ASAQ alone and with MB will be determined against the chloroquine-sensitive D6 and chloroquine-resistant W2 P. falciparum lines to assess whether MB enhances the blood stage activity of ASAQ, in vitro.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The pharmacokinetics (absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion) of ASAQ will be drived from plasma concentrations versus time curves generated from the analysis of plasma samples collected from healthy volunteers after dosing with ASAQ alone and with MB.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For each treatment venous blood samples will be collected using an indwelling catheter, with blood samples collected immediately before drug administration and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after dosing.  Subsequent blood samples will be collected by venipuncture at days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after drug administration. Plasma concentrations of AS and its major active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, AQ and its major active metabolite desethylamodiaquine and MB will be measured by LC/MS/MS. Non-compartmental analysis will be used to determine the pharmacokinetics of the drugs and metabolites.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ex vivo antimalarial activity (pharmacodynamics) will be carried out on plasma ASAQ concentrations and plasma ASAQ plus MB concentrations collected from the volunteers against two P. falciparum lines (D6 and W2).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Plasma samples for ex vivo antimalarial activity will be collected at 0 (pre-dose), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after dosing.  Plasma samples will also be collected at days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after drug administration. A comparison will be made of the maximum inhibitory dilution (MID) profiles generated from plasma samples collected from the volunteers after the two treatments. The MID will be determined using the in vitro tritiated-hypoxanthine assay.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The tolerability and safety of the two treatments will be compared. Possible adverse events can be gastrointestinal disturbances such as vomiting, nausea and abdominal discomfort.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any adverse events will be recorded before drug administration and daily for 3 to 4 days after dosing. Blood samples for biochemical and haematological analysis will be collected before dosing and on day 7 after drug administration. Electrocardiograms will be performed immediately before and 6 h after dosing.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) such as artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) are currently recommended worldwide for first-line treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.  However, recent reports of reduced susceptibility of artemisinins and ACTs in western Cambodia, western Thailand and south Vietnam is very worrisome and highlights the urgent need to identify alternative drug combination options for effective and affordable treatment.  To extend the efficacy life of ACTs, a triple drug combination strategy may be worthy of consideration. We propose to determine whether methylene blue (MB), an old and affordable antimalarial drug, can be combined with ASAQ to extend the efficacy life of the ACT by studying the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and ex vivo antimalarial activity of ASAQ alone and with MB in healthy Vietnamese volunteers. If MB combined with ASAQ is well tolerated and does not adversely alter the pharmacokinetics of ASAQ in healthy volunteers, and enhanced blood stage ex vivo antimalarial activity can be demonstrated in volunteers' plasma containing ASAQ plus MB, then further studies a warranted to appraise the clinical value of the triple drug combination of AS+AQ+MB.</summary>
