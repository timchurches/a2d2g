  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With Improvement in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of 15 or More Letters at Month 3 - Percentage of patients with improvement in BCVA of 15 or more letters at Month 3. BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 3</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lesion Size as Assessed by Fluorescein Angiography (FA) and Photography at Month 3 - Lesion size as assessed by FA and photography at month 3. FA is a technique for examining the circulation of the retina (and detecting any leakage) using a dye-tracing method. Photographs are taken with a specialized low-power microscope with an attached camera designed to photograph the interior of the eye, including the retina and optic disc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 3</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Foveal Thickness as Assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) at Month 3 - Foveal thickness as assessed by OCT at month 3. The fovea is a part of the eye, located in the center of the macula region of the retina. OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system providing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina. The fovea is responsible for sharp central vision, which is necessary for reading or any activity where visual detail is of primary importance. Normal foveal thickness ranges from 175 to 250 microns. A foveal thickness greater than 250 microns represents worsening vision.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 3</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ) at Month 3 - Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ) at Month 3. The VFQ includes 25 questions which assess visual impairment on functioning and specific aspects of health-related quality of life. Study terminated; data for this outcome measure were not analyzed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 3</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Treatment With Standard of Care at Month 6 - Time to treatment with standard-of-care at month 6, defined as the number of days before the use of rescue therapy occurred.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 6</timepoint>
