  <interventions>
    <interventions>Our observational study will video record Childbirth educators as they present their classes to 10 expectant couples.  The visual recording will be of the Childbirth educators only.  The audio will be of the childbirth educators and any incidental questions made by the expectant parents will also be recorded.  The observations will occur in the education rooms, on site at the hospital. Antenatal classes are 2 hour sessions over a six week period (12hours total), or they can also run as two day sessions on the weekend - 6 hours duration each.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>There are three Childbirth educators at the Hospital..  Though statistically small, this pilot study will provide information that could be utilised for a future comparative investigation.
The video recordings of the Antenatal classes will be transcribed and analysed by two researchers.  Descriptive statistics will be used for baseline data.  The types of communications used when providing information will be based on previous studies of communication analysis in a clinical setting.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overview / Synopsis: Antenatal classes are a pivotal point of contact between expectant parents and health care providers.  Information is provided on topics such as: care of the newborn; labour and active birth; birth intervention (medical and pain relief); and practical skills for labour such as managing contractions or learning how to be a support person for the mother. Effective communication can optimise the birth experience and the parents ability to be flexible in their choices should medical intervention be required.  Recently, there has been increasing interest in the choice of words used in the clinical setting, particularly in the form of suggestions.  Hypnotic phrasing, commonly known as suggestions, are communications that can lead to subconscious, non-volitional changes in perceptions, mood and behaviour (Perry, Samuelsson, Cyna 2015).
Our hypothesis is to identify the way information is described and presented by antenatal educators to see if hypnotic phrasing and metaphor are utilised, as this may have implications for birth expectations and experiences of women and their support people.
