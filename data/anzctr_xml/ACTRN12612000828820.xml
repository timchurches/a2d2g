  <interventions>
    <interventions>BIT225 200mg or 400mg, or placebo, once daily on days 0 and 28, and twice daily on days 1 to 27. BIT225 is supplied as a powder to be suspended immediately before use in 25mL of Orasweet Sugar Free, a taste masking agent.  All participants will also receive standard of care therapy for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) of pegylated interferon (alfa-2a or alfa-2b) (PEG-IFN) 180mg/week by subcutaneous injection and oral ribavirin (RBV) 1000-1200mg/day (weight based) for 48 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the safety and tolerability of 200 and 400 mg of BIT225 twice daily compared with placebo in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV in patients with chronic HCV infection that are treatment-naive to antiviral treatment with ribavirin and/or interferon. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by comparison to placebo of treatment emergent untoward medical changes, e.g. nausea, vomitting or loss of weight, and changes in clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs and ECG.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical changes will be evaluated daily, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs and ECG weekly, over the 28 days of dosing.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 200 and 400 mg of BIT225 administered daily on Day 0 and Day 28 and twice daily on Days 2 - 27 for 28 consecutive days in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV in patients with chronic HCV infection.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on Day 0 and Day 28 at 0 hour (pre-dose), 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 minutes post-dose, then at 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 24 hours post-dose.  Blood samples will also be collected pre-dose on Days 7, 14, and 21. The concentration of BIT225 in plasma will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectometry method.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the antiviral activity of BIT225 administered for 28 consecutive days in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV in patients with chronic HCV infection that are treatment-naive to antiviral treatment with ribavirin and/or interferon.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for HCV RNA assays will be collected at Screening, Day -14 and Day -1, Day 0 pre-dose (0 hour), 4 and 12 hours post-dose, Days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and in follow up at Months 2, 3, 12 and 18. 
Qualitative HCV RNA assessment (Roche COBAS Amplicor HCV Test, version 2.0) will be performed at the Screening visit. A quantitative test will be performed on all positive qualitative tests at this visit. HCV RNA will be detected by qualitative RT-PCR with Cobas AMPLICOR HCV Test, version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Branchberg, NJ, USA). HCV viral load will be determined by COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test (Roche). HCV RNA measurements performed at subsequent study visits will use the quantitative test only.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Biotron is developing a novel inhibitor of viral ion channel proteins in HCV and HIV-1, called BIT225.  This early phase trial will assess the safety of BIT225, in combination with standard of care therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients with HCV, who have not received any prior anti-viral therapy with ribavirin and/or interferon.  It will also assess how well BIT225 is tolerated, the level of BIT225 in the blood following oral administration and how well BIT225 performs at reducing the HCV levels in the blood.</summary>
