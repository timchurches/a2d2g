  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the study will perform whole body vibration therapy (WBVT) four times a week for 20 weeks. Each training session consists of five 3 minute WBVT with three minute rest breaks between each WBVT. Participants will weight bear (stand with or without aid) on a vibration plate that moves rapidly ( 12-22Hz) up and down over a small
distance ( up to 10 mm) generating vibration stimulus. The vibration causes the muscle in the leg and trunk to contract. Sessions will be perform at home or local school and will be supervised by an experienced physiotherapist. Each participant will have a training diary to log all sessions performed and the time/ intensity used. The diary will help to monitor the participants adherence to the training programme.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common disability in childhood. CP is characterized by reduced muscle mass, impaired mobility and low bone density. Therefore, one of the major focuses of therapy in CP children is to increase muscle mass and power, thereby increasing mobility, weight bearing and bone health. Unfortunetely, there is a void in therapeutic interventions aimed at increasing muscle mass, muscle function as well as bone mass in CP children. Whole body vibration training (WBVT) has the potential to fill this therapeutic void. WBVT studies in healthy adults and postmenopausal females have been shown to enhance muscle function and bone health. However, it is unclear whether children with CP would benefit from WBVT. Most studies have used  9 minutes of therapy per session. We aim to look at the impact of prolonged use (15 minutes) of vibration  on muscle and bones. By maintaining muscle mass and bone mineral accrual during growth; WBVT can maximize mobility and bone strenght into adult life improving both mobility and quality of life. The proposed study aims to determine the effect of 20 weeks of WBVT on muscle and bone in children with CP by doing it for 15 minutes four times a week instead of the 9 minutes used in previous studies. This should lead to improved health and well-being of adolescents with CP. </summary>
