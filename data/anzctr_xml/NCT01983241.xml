  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical study to assess
      the efficacy and safety of two separate dose regimens of Alpha-1 MP versus placebo for 156
      weeks (i.e., 3 years) using computed tomography (CT) of the lungs as the main measure of
      efficacy. The two Alpha-1 MP doses to be tested are 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg administered
      weekly by IV infusion for 156 weeks. The study consists of a Screening Phase, a 156-week
      Treatment Phase, and an End of Study Visit at Week 160.</summary>
