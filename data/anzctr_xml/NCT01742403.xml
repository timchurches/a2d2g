    <interventions>Treatment: other - R/T gating kV intrafraction monitoring

Experimental: R/T gating kV intrafraction monitoring - Intervention: Recruitment will be performed in 2 phases:
Phase I will include the first 10 patients. All patients will be treated on a standard fractionation protocol with 40 fractions. This will allow 400 potential fractions to be auto-segmented in real time. Once Phase I is successfully completed we will aim to continue recruitment of a further 20 patients as Phase II. For this phase we will open recruitment to patients with lymph node positivity, hypofractionation (as per Department protocols) and intermittent imaging (imaging less frequently than every fraction).


Treatment: other: R/T gating kV intrafraction monitoring
This is a Phase I Pilot study to assess the feasibility of implementing prostate radiotherapy gating using kV intrafraction monitoring.
