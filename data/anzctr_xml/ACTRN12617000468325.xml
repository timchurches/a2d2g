  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the efficacy of 2 different doses of BEZ235 alone or in combination with RAD001 on the incidence of respiratory tract infection in elderly subjects. The outcome will be assessed by physicians using chest x-ray, blood tests, etc.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the safety and tolerability of 2 different doses of BEZ235 alone or in combination with RAD001. This outcome will be assessed by following adverse event reports, safety labs (hematology and chemistry) and physical exams.</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days post-dose (16 weeks treatment plus 7 days)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the effect of BEZ235 alone or in combination with RAD001 compared to placebo on the incidence of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) for 24 weeks. The outcome will be assessed by physicians using using chest x-ray, blood tests, etc.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 2 different doses of BEZ235 given alone or in combination with RAD001. PK parameters such as AUC, Tmax, T1/2 will be assessed. RAD concentrations will be measured in blood. BEZ concentrations will be measured in serum. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data from two previous clinical trials conducted by Novartis (CRAD002X2202 and CBEZ235Y2201) suggests that 6 weeks of treatment of elderly participants 65 years of age and above with low doses of BEZ235 and/or RAD001 was safe and decreased the incidence of RTIs. The risk/benefit of BEZ235 alone or in combination with RAD001 may be most favorable in elderly subjects who are at increased risk of RTI-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore in the current study, elderly participants who are considered at increased risk of RTI-related morbidity and mortality will be enrolled.

The null hypothesis is that TRUE underlying proportion of patients with at least one RTI ocurrence is equal in all treatment arms. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the active treatment arms has TRUE underlying proportion of patients with at least one RTI ocurrence greater than that of placebo. The hypotheses will be assessed as described in the protocol.
