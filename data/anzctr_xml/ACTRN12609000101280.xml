  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients submitted to radiotherapy (RT) with curative intend for head and neck cancer, receiving at least 5000 cGy irradiation total dose delivered to the bilateral area involving the major salivary glands. Patients will receive preventive acupuncture treatment (PAT), performed by the same clinician, twice a week, in a 2 - 3 weeks period before RT (4 - 6 sessions) and, in a 6 - 7 weeks period concomitantly with RT (12  14 sessions), totalizing 16  20 acupuncture sessions. The duration of each acupuncture session is 20 minutes. The acupoints used at our protocol were selected according to traditional Chinese and occidental orthodox medicines principles, and it included local, distal and auricular points, named in accordance with the WHO Standard Acupuncture Nomenclature.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control cohort. Patients submitted to RT with curative intend for head and neck cancer, receiving =5000 cGy irradiation total dose delivered to bilateral head and neck fields involving major salivary glands, given in fractional daily doses of 180 to 200 cGy, five days a week, during a period of 33 and 35 days. Patients did not receive concomitant acupuncture or any other therapy with preventive intend to minimize irradiation side effects. The latency post-RT xerostomia period up to ten years. Following the baseline collected data of saliva collection and questionnaires, patients enrolled in the CT group were ask to receive acupuncture treatment (post-RT acupuncture treatment protocol).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite benefits of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, oral sequelae occur, especially xerostomia, considered the most frequently, and potential debilitating side effect. Although extensively studied, treatment approaches including acupuncture therapy are considered primarily palliative, administered only after hyposalivation and xerostomia related symptoms is already present. The aim of this study was to investigate if the preventive acupuncture treatment (PAT), an innovative method using acupuncture before and during RT is effective in minimizing the severe radiation-induced xerostomia for patients with head and neck cancer.</summary>
