  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The specific aim of this project is to improve walking ability in persons following stroke
      using 'treadmill training plus power training'. This modality addresses the two major
      impairments followings stroke: weakness and incoordination, as well as loss of fitness.
      Importantly, this training will be presented at higher intensity and greater volume than is
      currently received. Furthermore, to ensure that persons continue to maintain the level of
      improvement from an intensive exercise program, we will also implement a behavioral change
      for long-term maintenance of exercise behavior in a less supervised environment. A randomized
      controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 102 sub-acute stroke patients to ascertain the
      efficacy of this approach to improving walking ability.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Walking endurance will be increased to a greater degree in a patient group receiving
           treadmill plus muscle power training compared with a treadmill training only group, or
           'usual care' group.

        2. Gait stability, muscle function, aerobic fitness and balance will improve more in a
           group receiving treadmill plus muscle power training, than either those in treadmill
           training or usual care patient groups.

        3. Habitual activity levels will be higher in the group receiving treadmill plus muscle
           power training compared with a treadmill training only group or 'usual care' group.

        4. The change in 6-minute walk distance will be positively related to changes in muscle
           power, strength and endurance, aerobic fitness, gait mechanics, and balance.

        5. Baseline depression and low self-efficacy will be associated with less robust
           adaptations to all types of training and lower rates of long-term compliance to the
           exercise prescription in the experimental groups.</summary>
