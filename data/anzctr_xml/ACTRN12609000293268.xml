  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten sessions of physiotherapy functional restoration (30 minute sessions at variable frequency) over a 10-week period.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers who respond to advertising, or who are referred by a healthcare professional, will undergo a phone screening and baseline physical assessment to determine eligibility. Eligible volunteers who consent to participate will complete baseline outcome measures prior to being randomised to either the control or treatment group. The randomisation process involves the assessor contacting an off-site trial administrator who will control the randomisation schedule, and will not be involved in enrolling, assessing or treating participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher at La Trobe University who will have no contact with participants will generate a randomisation schedule prior to trial commencement. A web-based randomisation program utilising permuted block randomisation with random block sizes will be used. There will be a separate schedule for each of the 14 treatment clinics.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>All participants who are allocated to the treatment group will be invited to attend a one-on-one semi-structured interview at the completion of the 10-week intervention period, to assist in gaining their perspectives on the treatment program.</designfeatures>
