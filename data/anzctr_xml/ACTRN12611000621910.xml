  <interventions>
    <interventions>Novate Medical Ltd. (Galway, Ireland) has developed an IVC filter intended to be used for protection against pulmonary embolism (PE). The Novate IVC Filter (The Device) is designed for percutaneous placement in the IVC (via either femoral vein or the right jugular vein) and is designed to trap emboli and reduce the risk of PE while maintaining caval patency.
The filtering cone of The Device is similar in design to existing permanent and retrievable devices, but it has a bioabsorbable filament which holds the filter arms in a filtering configuration.  The bioabsorbable filament is designed to maintain the filtering configuration for a minimum of 60 days, after which time it is hydrolysed (decomposed by reaction with water) by the bodys natural processes. This allows the filter arms to open and retract to the IVC wall, where, over time, they become endothelialised and permit unobstructed blood flow in the IVC. This design allows for temporary IVC filtration which is intended to reduce the incidence of PE during the early high risk period, but removes the requirement for a second interventional procedure to remove The Device thereby avoiding the risks associated with the currently available devices.

Physicians determine access routes depending on preference and the patient's medical condition, and standard procedures apply.  The time taken by physicians to perform the insertion of the Novate IVC Filter is comparable to existing permanent and retrievable devices, and can take as little as 1/2 hour.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary study endpoint is the technical success of The Device which is defined as deployment of The Device at the desired site, with the absence of device tilting, migration, fracture, thrombosis, stenosis, IVC damage, or significant complications at the access vein site.
At the time of deployment, subjective assessments will be made on the ease of delivery and deployment of The Device. The absence of tilting or migration will be documented by venacavagram and will be independently assessed. Any complications related to Device use will also be reported.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research project will test whether a new device, the Novate IVC Filter, can be placed safely in a vein called the inferior vena cava, and then stay in place filtering blood for any clots that may occur. This filter is intended to prevent a clot from moving through the body to lungs. 
This research project will be the first time that the Novate IVC Filter will have been used in humans, however, the device has undergone all of the testing required by law to ensure that it is safe to use in humans and is very similar to other filter devices routinely used in this hospital. The device being tested in this research project differs from the normal device offered in this hospital because of its design and the way in which it works. Most hospitals would usually use a retrievable (removable) filter in this type of operation.  This type of filter may be removed after a period of time and this means that the patient would have to undergo a second operation to remove the filter. 
The Novate IVC Filter doesnt require the patient to undergo this second, removal operation. This is because after 60 days when the patient no longer needs it, the filter is designed to open up, the patient's blood will no longer be filtered and the remaining parts of the device will then be incorporated into the walls of the patient's vein over time. The vein wall will grow tissue over the remaining parts of the filter and cover them up, leaving the inside of the vein clear.</summary>
