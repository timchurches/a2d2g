  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite advances in medical technology, heart failure remains a major cause of illness on a
      global scale. Medical research, over recent years, has shown that adult stem cells (as
      opposed to embryonic stem cells) are present in most organs of adult humans. Their exact
      function is however poorly understood. An improved understanding of what these stem cells do
      and how they work is essential if effective stem cell treatments are to be developed in
      future.

      The project seeks to examine the levels of a number of different types of stem cells in
      patients with heart failure, compared to healthy volunteers. The project also aims to measure
      stem cell levels in patients with heart failure at the time of a sudden worsening in their
      condition and then later in the same patients following recovery.

      The project entails the taking of blood samples in order to measure the stem cell levels in
      the blood. The study does NOT involve any form of treatment with stem cells. Two groups of
      patients will be studied; patients with heart failure and healthy volunteers.</summary>
