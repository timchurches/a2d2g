  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention to improve oral health related quality of life via enhancing sense of coherence which is a psychological or individual factor. The intervention consists of seven 40-60 minute sessions over two months, focusing on child participation and empowerment. The first four sessions are classroom activities and include a mixture of didactic teaching, discussion, activities and games. The last three involve working on healthy school projects Children were encouraged and empowered to do the projects by brainstorming, discussing, planning, implementation and evaluation. The activities in the projects included suggesting to other students to choose healthy food, teaching others to brush their teeth effectively, cooperating with teachers to run a tuck shop to provide healthy food. These projects involved the whole school.

The intervention was delivered by trained teachers who received an intensive one day course run by the researcher</interventions>

      <outcome>sense of coherence (SOC) was measured using 13-item SOC questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 timepoints; baseline, 2 weeks after the intervention and 3 months after the intervention</timepoint>

      <timepoint>2 timepoints; baseline and at 3 month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>General health perceptions were measured using 1 single item questionnaire. The question was worded as 'Would you say that the health of your teeth, lips, jaws and mouth is...?' with five-point response format ranging from
'Excellent' = 0 to 'Poor' = 4. This question is validated, presented in CPQ11-14 and has acceptable construct validity in relation to CPQ11-14 (Jokovic et al., 2002)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 timepoints; baseline, 2 weeks after the intervention and  3 months after the intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall quality of life was measured using 1 single item questionnaire. The question was worded as 'How much does the condition of your teeth, lips, jaws or mouth affect your life overall?' with five point response format ranging from 'Not at all'= 0 to 'Very much' = 4. This question is validated, presented in CPQ11-14 and has acceptable construct validity in relation to CPQ11-14 (Jokovic et al., 2002)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 timepoints;  baseline, 2 weeks after the intervention and  3 months after the intervention</timepoint>

    <sequence>Randomisation used block permutation to balance the number of schools/participants in each group. The schools were listed. Then a random sequence of blocks of 4 was created and the first point in the sequence was selected by a person not involved in the project. Schools were allocated to the two groups according to the sequence. Six schools were randomly assigned to the intervention and the comparison groups respectively.</sequence>
