  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 2 arms to this study. Each arm will enrol up to 15 patients. Patients will be assigned to be administered 14mg twice daily of CRD-102, or 18mg of CRD-102 twice daily. 
Patients will be administered CRD-102 for 30 days prior to a PK study that will be done on day 30. 
CRD-102 will be administered as a capsule. Patients will be dispensed adequate supply of medication when the study commences. Any unused tablets will need to be returned - thus ensuring compliance. Laboratory tests to measure levels on day 30 will give an indication of plasma levels at baseline. There will also be an outpatient visit during the trial, where patient will be reminded to be compliant to study treatment regime. 

An additional 3rd arm of up to 15 patients may be enrolled if required following an interim analysis. The 3rd arm will receive oral CRD-102 twice daily for 30 days at a dose to be determined based on interim analysis.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>The first 15 patients enrolled into the trial will be assigned the 14mg twice daily oral dosing arm. The subsequent 15 patients enrolled into the trial will be assigned the 18mg twice daily oral dosing arm. Following interim analysis, a 3rd arm may be recruited, where up to 15 patients will be enrolled to be administered a dose of CRD-102 twice daily, at a dose to be guided by the interim analysis of PK results. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Pharmacokinetics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Given that this is primarily a PK trial, up to 15 patients per arm is required to obtain enough data to study the PK profile of CRD-102. No statistical analysis was required. to determine sample size. 

Detailed PK analysis will be done to yield standard PK parameters including Cmax, tmax, AUC, t 1/2 , Vd and Cl.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The intention of the trial is to study the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CRD-102 in patients with heart failure following 30 days of administration. 

It is hypothesized that CRD-102 is able to improve heart function and quality of life. Prior to conducting a phase 2 trial, Cardiora needs to better understand the PK profile of CRD-102, how it is absorbed and cleared from the body. 

This trial intends to study the PK effects of different doses of CRD-102. A dose of 14 mg twice daily will be administered to up to 15 patients, and following this 18mg twice daily will be trialled. </summary>
