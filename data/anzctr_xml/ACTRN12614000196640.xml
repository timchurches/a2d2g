  <interventions>
    <interventions>Selected patient will have bilateral accordion (cheek) wrinkles and will be randomized to receive 20 units of intradermal onabotulinumtoxin A injection on one side of the face and placebo (equal volume of intradermal normal saline injection) on the contralateral face. Patient will be monitored at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks post injection for improvement of accordion wrinkles based on serial photographs assessed by the investigator who is blinded and also changes to the skin elasticity measured by a skin cutometer.

    <comparator>The contralateral side of the face will serve as control with a placebo where equal volume of normal saline is injected intradermally.  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement of accordion wrinkles graded on a 0 to 4 scale based on serial photographs taken at week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16. This is assessed by the investigator who is blinded. </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. All male and female patients between ages of 40 - 75 complaining of accordion wrinkles and keen for intervention only for the accordion wrinkles.
2. Accordion wrinkles of at least grade 1 at rest and/or on extreme smile. 
3. Of sound mind and able to give consent.
4. Able to be followed up for duration of study.
5. Patients can have been their crows feet or squint lines treated anytime prior to start of trial. (Different sets of muscles involved and the location of our injections is of adequate distance from squint lines hence will not affect the outcome)
6. Patients that are on ASA 81mg must be off for 2 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of intradermal onabotulinumtoxin A injection for the treatment of accordion (cheek) wrinkles as compared to placebo in a split face randomized and double blinded trial, in terms of improvement of wrinkles based on serial photographs, improvement in skin elasticity and patient's satisfaction. The hypothesis is that intradermal onabotulinumtoxinA is effective in treating accordion wrinkles and improving the skin elasticity, and with good patient's satisfaction. </summary>
