    <interventions>Twenty morbidly obese subjects will be studied on 3 occasions, which are separated by at least 4 weeks. The subjects will be randomised into 3 pre-load groups, in which they will consume either a control of 30ml of water, or one of two preloads, either 30ml olive oil, or 55g Whey protein (in 100ml soup), 30min before a 50g beef patty meal. the preload is administered at t= -30min and the beef patty at t=0</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of gastric emptying and small intestinal transit as measured by a Gamma camera that will measure the rate at which the stomach empties a 50 or 200ml glucose drink containing 3g of glucose (3-ortho-methyl-D-gluco-pyranose) and a small amount of radiation (which can be detected by the camera)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Gastric emptying curves (expressed as % of the maximum content of the total stomach) will be derived and the content of the total stomach at t = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 mins calculated. The 50% emptying time (T50) will also be obtained.</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastrointestinal symptoms before and during procedure, as measured by a validated visual analogue scales (VAS) and also by a validated 19-point GI symptom questionnaire </outcome>
      <timepoint>VAS is completed at Baseline and then at and then at t = 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 240 mins 
The validated 19-point GI symptom questionnaire is completed by patient before the procedure on each visit.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study aims to examine the effects of protein and fat preloads of RYGB on GE or SI transit, appetite-related and incretin hormones, GI symptoms and haemodynamics.  We hypothesized that when given before a mixed meal, (A) a fat preload has no effect on GE but slows SI transit, increases the GLP-1 and PYY responses, reduces glycaemic and insulin responses and attenuates the fall in BP and rises in HR/SMA blood flow, as well as symptoms; and (B) a protein preload has no effect on GE but slows SI transit, increases GLP-1 and PYY responses, reduces the glycaemic but increases the insulin response and attenuates the fall in BP and rises in HR/SMA flow and symptoms. </summary>
