Prior Asthma Medications:  Documented use for at least 30 days prior to  screening of inhaled short-acting beta 2-agonists.  At the time of screening patients must be on at least 800 ucg budesonide (or &gt;500 ucg fluticasone/day) for at least 3 months prior to screening or inhaled corticosteroids with a long acting beta-agonist (ICS + LABA) combination with a dose of at least 500 ucg fluticasone or at least 800 ucg of budesonide/day      In-clinic FEV1 values must be greater than or equal to 60% of predicted normal following a 6 hour salbutamol withhold or a 12 hour long acting beta-agonist withhold       Patients must be non-smokers for at least the past year and have less than a 10 pack-year smoking history.
