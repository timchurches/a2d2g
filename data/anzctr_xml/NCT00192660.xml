          -  Be naive to antiretroviral medication.

        Specific to HAMA part B only:

          -  Have had a minimum total exposure to antiretroviral medications (to include drugs from
             more than one drug class) of 48 weeks at time of recruitment.

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Any history of, or ongoing, mental or physical condition (including suspected or known
             diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease), which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would impede the subject's ability to participate in the trial.

          -  Prior use of growth hormone or glucocorticoid or anabolic steroid products within the
             previous six months.

          -  Prior use of supraphysiological doses of testosterone or oestrogen replacement therapy
             within the previous year.

          -  Alcohol or substance abuse which in the opinion of the investigator would affect the
             patients ability to participate in the trial.

          -  Prior use of any retinoid-containing compound within the previous six months.

          -  Abnormal coagulation.

          -  Previous allergic reaction or known allergy to local anaesthetic.

          -  Previous or concomitant use of medications, which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would affect the subject's ability to participate in all activities involved in the
             trial.

          -  Any grade-three laboratory abnormality recorded from screening bloods, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would impede the subject's ability to safely complete all
             study requirements.

          -  Any finding on screening clinical examination, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would impede the subject's ability to participate in the rest of the
             trial.

          -  Pregnancy

        Specific to HAMA part A only:

          -  Prior use of anti-retroviral agents (including protease inhibitors, nucleoside or
             non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, investigational antiretroviral agents
             or fusion inhibitors). Entry of individuals who have had previous antiretroviral
             therapy as part of post exposure prophylaxis will be at the discretion of the study
             investigators.</exclusivecriteria>
