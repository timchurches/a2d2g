Treatment: drugs - Ribavirin

Experimental: Peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy or combined with ribavirin - The treating investigator decided the most appropriate treatment. It was recommended that participants receive combination therapy.


Treatment: drugs: Peginterferon alfa-2a
Both combination and monotherapy for both genotype 2/3 and genotype non-2/3: 180 µg subcutaneously once weekly.

Treatment: drugs: Ribavirin
For genotype 2/3, 800 mg orally daily, in 2 split doses for 24 weeks. For genotype non-2/3, 1000 mg orally daily for participants weighing &lt; 75 kg or 1200 mg orally daily for participants weighing = 75 kg, in 2 split doses, for 48 weeks.

    <summary>This open-label, non-randomized, single arm study will provide treatment or re-treatment with
      Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) as monotherapy or in combination with Copegus (ribavirin) to
      patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Patients who have received prior Pegasys
      monotherapy or combination therapy or who were considered eligible for treatment with Pegasys
      in previous donor protocols will be eligible to participate in this study. Treatment will be
      on investigator's decision according to the approved label for up to 48 weeks, with a 24-week
      safety follow-up.</summary>
