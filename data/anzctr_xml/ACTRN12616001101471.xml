  <interventions>
    <interventions>The degree and location of intestinal permeability will be measured within 72 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit and repeated on day 5-6. Baseline urine and blood samples will be collected immediately prior to each test. Intestinal permeability will be measured by administering a sugar solution (1g sucrose, 0.5g rhamnose, 1g mannitol, 1g lactulose, 1g erythritol and 1g sucralose dissolved in 50ml of water) via an enteral feeding tube. A 24 hour urine collection will be conducted following the administration of the sugar solution. The concentration and ratios of select sugars will be analysed in urine samples using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry. Inflammation will be analysed using blood samples. Findings will be compared to results from healthy subjects in a separate study being conducted at La Trobe University (Request ID: 371028).</interventions>
    <comparator>Healthy subjects will have intestinal permeability levels measured at one-time point using the method described above in a separate study being conducted at La Trobe University (Request ID: 371028) between July 2014  December 2017.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the correlation between intestinal permeability (measured by urinary sugar analysis) and nutritional adequacy. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Nutritional adequacy will be measured for the first seven days of Intensive Care Unit admission by comparing the amount of nutrition prescribed by the treating team versus the amount of nutrition delivered. Intestinal permeability will be measured within 72 hours of Intensive Care Unit admission and on day 5-6 of admission. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Increased intestinal permeability, often referred to as leaky gut, is a measure of integrity and functioning of the mucosal (innermost) lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Increased levels have been found to correlate with the development of sepsis in the Intensive Care Unit. The location of increased intestinal permeability (gastroduodenal, small bowel and whole gut permeability) has not been adequately explored in the Intensive Care Unit. The aim of the study is to determine the location and degree of changes in intestinal permeability in mechanically ventilated critically ill adult patients. Additionally, this study aims to investigate the association between intestinal permeability, inflammation and clinical outcomes. Findings will be compared to data from healthy subjects being recruited in a separate study at La Trobe University (Request ID: 371028). </summary>
