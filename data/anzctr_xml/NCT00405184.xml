  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - IntragamP
Treatment: drugs - Ig NextGen 10%

Treatment: drugs: IntragamP
IntragamP - dosage based on previous dose of IntragamP prior to study entry. One cycle (Cycle 0)only administered, with dosage calculation based on body weight on Day 1 of the study and must be between 0.2-0.8 g/kg body weight. IntragamP to be administered intravenously.

Treatment: drugs: Ig NextGen 10%
Ig NextGen 10% - dosage based on previous dose of IntragamP in Cycle 0. Dosage calculation to use body weight on Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the study and must be between 0.2-0.8 g/kg body weight. 7 cycles administered, and patients to be dosed at 3 to 4 week intervals (in accordance with previous dosage schedule with IntragamP). Ig NextGen 10% to be administered intravenously.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Ig NextGen 10% in
      patients with primary immune deficiency currently being treated with Intragam P. Eligible
      patients will switch from 3 to 4 weekly intravenous Intragam P therapy to receive seven
      cycles of Ig NextGen 10% treatment administered intravenously at three- to four-weekly
      intervals. Patients will be monitored on the study for up to 36 weeks.</summary>
