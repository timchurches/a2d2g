  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. All study participants (3 groups) underwent the similar single session experimental protocol which was of 60 minutes duration. 
2. Experimental session involved nine equal duration phases ( 4 active and 5 resting) each of 5 minutes with one minute pause, to instruct the participants for next phase.  
3. The active phases involved mental arithmetic stress test, alternate nostril yoga breathing, Kapalbhati Yoga breathing and yogic meditation and these phases were interspersed with the phases of quiet rest. 
4. During the intervention period continuous oxygen consumption and Heart rate variability along with respiratory rate were continuously measured (for 60 minutes) using indirect calorimetery,  electrocardiogram and respiratory belt.
5. As all the yoga interventions were the basic practices, hence the participants had the study explained on attending the laboratory. Each time a single participant was invited to attend the laboratory session.
6. All the experiential sessions were administered as well as explained and demonstrated to the participants prior to experimental session  by the experimenter who was a yoga teacher also.
7.  As the yoga practitioners were well versed with yoga interventions, hence the non-yoga practitioners and people with metabolic syndrome were  given time to practice and get acquainted with the interventions  till they performed them accurately.
8. All the experimental data were collected after participants provided their consent and signed the consent form.</interventions>

    <ethicsreview>Approved</ethicsreview>
    <publicnotes>According to the policy and procedures of the Patanjali Research Foundation, the ethics approval from RMIT was sufficient to use the laboratory and collect data in India. Thus no separate approval was sought from Indian ethics committee. However the journal (BIOMED) in which this study has already been peer reviewed and now waiting for publication notified that the Indian Ethics approval is mandatory. Hence the ethic approval from Patanjlai Research Foundation was taken retrospectively. </publicnotes>
