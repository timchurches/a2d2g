  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Female pelvic organ prolapse, which is a protrusion of vaginal walls beyond the hymen, is both common and have a high burden of suffering.  The traditional operation to treat post hysterectomy vaginal apical prolapse has been either abdominal sacrocolpopexy or vaginal sacrospinous fixation. Although the abdominal approach comes with a greater cure rate, it has a longer operating time, longer return to Activities of Daily Living and costs more than the vaginal approach. Modern advances involve the development of minimally invasive procedures which included a laparoscopic approach to abdominal sacrocolpopexy and also the introduction of vaginal mesh kits which provides better success rates when compared to the traditional vaginal operation, although not without its own sets of operative morbidity. These procedures involve inserting synthetic material anchored to the sacrospinous ligament to provide reinforcement and support to the vagina following its repair. Anterior Elevate is a new mesh kit which utilises a standard synthetic mesh using a surgical approach (anterior sacrospinous) that has been well established since 2001. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the success of Anterior Elevate vaginal mesh support or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy in the treatment of women with vaginal apical prolapse.</summary>
