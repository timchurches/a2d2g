  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be an audit of our surgical practices. A short questionnaire will be mailed out to patients who meet the inclusion criteria, that they can choose to fill out in their own time. Males who are under 25 are considered a high risk subgroup for post-operative recurrence of their shoulder instability, and so there is some suggestion that this high risk group of patients should undergo open surgical repair due to its association with lower rates of recurrence. This audit aims to look at our own recurrence rates in patients 20 years or younger who have had open surgical repair., and their functional outcomes, assessed via the WOSI score.</summary>
