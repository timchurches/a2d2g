Experimental: Palovarotene dose level 4 - All subjects will receive 5 mg palovarotene once daily for up to 36 months; and 20 mg palovarotene for 28 days, followed by 10 mg for 56 days for eligible flare-ups (Part C). Doses are adjusted for weight in skeletally immature subjects


Treatment: drugs: Palovarotene dose level 1

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by heterotopic ossification (HO) often associated with painful, recurrent
      episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that lead to ankyloses of major joints with
      cumulative and irreversible loss of movement and disability. In this study, the ability of
      palovarotene to prevent HO formation will be evaluated.</summary>
