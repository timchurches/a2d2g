  <interventions>
    <interventions>A healthy lifestyle clinician will be embedded in one community-based mental health service in a regional area in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, with the specific role of providing assessment, advice and referral to evidence based behaviour change services to modify the chronic disease risk behaviours of clients (smoking, poor nutrition, inadequate physical activity and harmful alcohol consumption). The clinician will be a mental health clinician with experience in delivering mental health care in a community setting.

Clients allocated to the intervention condition will receive a 40-minute face-to-face consultation and follow-up call with the healthy lifestyle clinician, in addition to care they might receive in the context of their routine mental health consultations. 

The intervention will be implemented according to a manualised protocol based on motivational interviewing principles, with the aims of fostering client motivation for modification of risk behaviours and uptake of telephone coaching services (NSW Quitline (smoking) and NSW Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service (poor nutrition, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption and weight management)). The manual will guide the healthy lifestyle clinician to: 
1)	Assess risk. 
The healthy lifestyle clinician will assess the clients chronic disease risk behaviours through a structured questionnaire evaluating the clients risk status in accordance with national guidelines. The clinician will assess abdominal adiposity as a sequelae of physical inactivity and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. The clinician will also ask the client if they have any concerns in relation to their weight or nutrition more broadly than fruit and vegetable consumption.
2)	Advise.
The clinician will provide brief feedback to the client in a non-judgemental manner as to how their behaviours compare against national guidelines. Clients identified as meeting the national guidelines for one or more of the behaviours will be provided positive feedback on the health benefits of their behaviour. If the client is identified as being at-risk according to the national guidelines for any one or more of the behaviours, the healthy lifestyle clinician will provide brief advice to modify the behaviour. Further intervention based on motivational interviewing techniques will be provided for the risk behaviours, which is designed to address any ambivalence regarding the current behaviour and motivate for change. Specific strategies utilised and content discussed will be tailored to each client and may include: education about current levels of behaviour and associated health impacts; further information about guidelines and recommendations reinforcing positive intentions to change behaviour; consideration of the barriers to change; and building self-efficacy. 
3)	Refer.
Clients who are at-risk for smoking will be offered a referral to the NSW Quitline and in line with care offered by the NSW Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service, clients who are at-risk and/or express concern about their physical activity, weight, nutrition or alcohol consumption will be offered a referral to the Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service. If appropriate, clients will be offered a referral to both telephone services. The NSW Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service offers ten free individual coaching sessions over a six-month period to support individuals in setting and achieving weight-related behaviour change goals. The NSW Quitline offers six free individual telephone coaching sessions to support individuals to stop smoking. In line with clinical practice guidelines, all clients will be referred to their general practitioner for assessment of metabolic risks.

Approximately one week following the consultation with the healthy lifestyle clinician, the clinician will call the client to follow-up on any referrals made and briefly discuss their progress. The call will take approximately 20 minutes. Positive feedback will be provided to clients who have had contact with the telephone services and/or attended the appointment with their GP, to further encourage behaviour change. Where clients have not yet taken up referrals made, the clinician will provide encouragement to do so and seek to identify and address any barriers the client may have. 

To monitor adherence, a checklist will be used by the healthy lifestyle clinician to record the aspects of the intervention that were delivered. In addition, the clinician will have regular supervision and feedback from a senior clinician with expertise in motivational interviewing.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control condition will receive care for chronic disease risk behaviours as is normally provided in routine consultations. In line with the current policy of the health district, this care should include: assessment of chronic disease risk behaviours (including smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity and alcohol use), brief advice relating to the health behaviour, and offer of referral as appropriate. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with a mental illness have significantly poorer physical health and shorter life expectancy than the general population, primarily due to chronic diseases. A higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviours such as poor nutrition, inadequate physical activity, harmful alcohol consumption and smoking contribute substantially to this disparity. Evidence based guidelines recommend that mental health services routinely provide care to address these risk behaviours, however, the provision of such care is consistently reported to be low in Australia and internationally. 

A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to determine the effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of allocating a designated clinician within a community mental health service to the specific role of providing assessment, advice and referral for clients' chronic disease risk behaviours. Clients of one community mental health service in NSW, Australia will be randomly allocated to receive either usual care for chronic disease risk behaviours, or usual care plus an additional face-to-face consultation and follow-up telephone call with a healthy lifestyle clinician. The role of the clinician will be to assess clients chronic disease risk behaviours, provide advice to change behaviours, and refer at-risk clients with free government telephone coaching services (NSW Quitline and NSW Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service) for ongoing care. 

The primary outcomes, referral to and uptake of the NSW Quitline and NSW Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service, will be obtained from the respective services. Telephone interviews of clients will be conducted at baseline and one and six month post baseline follow-up to assess secondary outcomes: self-reported chronic disease risk behaviour status, self-reported receipt of any assessment, advice and referral from the mental health service, satisfaction with the receipt of such care, and interest, confidence and perceived importance of changing risk behaviours.</summary>
