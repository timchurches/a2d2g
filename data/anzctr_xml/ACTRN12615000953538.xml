  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mental rotation test before and then after a single intervention of chiropractic adjustment (manipulation) to consenting children aged 5-12 years, who are current patients of participating chiropractic practices in Auckland, New Zealand.
a) chiropractic adjustment includes both High Velocity Low Amplitude thrust (HVLA) modified for the age of each presenting patient. So lower thrust and speed for younger children which gradually increases for those children aged 10-12 years; and low force low speed adjustments including cranial therapy, mobilisation, touch and hold. 
b) Specific locations will be determined by the chiropractor according to the location of fixated joints at the time of the intervention. A record will be kept of the location of the spinal segment treated (upper of lower cervicals, thoracics, lumbars) and the type of thrust (HVLA or Low force/low speed). 
c) There will be one session of intervention, which will include as many areas of treatment application as deemed necessary by the chiropractor providing treatment. This will be based on the number of fixated joints found in each child at the time of the assessment. (Most commonly 3-4 areas each requiring one application in one intervention of chiropractic treatment.
d) Approximate duration of chiropractic session 10 minutes.
e) Adherence will be monitored by the Research Assistant who will collect notes of each intervention provided by the chiropractor at the time of completion of both mental rotation test of each participant. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control group of children aged 5-12 years who have consented to participate in the study and are current chiropractic patients. 
Randomly selected control group of equal numbers of children in treatment group to perform mental rotation test, undergo Sham treatment with the chiropractor (spine palpation) and then perform the mental rotation test a second time. 
The research assistant performing mental rotation test will be blinded to whether participants are in the control or treatment group. </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participating practitioners: Chiropractors who practice in the Auckland Region of NZ and treat more than 50 children per month aged 5-12 years. 
Participating children: Healthy current patients of participating chiropractic practices in the Auckland Region, aged 5-12 years, who have do not have colour blindness, known dyslexia.  </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded from the study if they have known colour blindness, dyslexia, autism, a previous or current neurological disease, or a pathology that would exclude treatment or that would be an absolute or relative contraindication to spinal manipulative therapy. 
Non completed tests will be tabulated in the results section. Drop out rate as well as reasons for drop out will be recorded and discussed.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A short description of study will be provided to reception staff at participating practices. Parents invited to have their child participate in the study by the practice receptionist at the time of booking their appointment with the practitioner.
Consenting children will be randomised on presentation to the participating chiropractic practice, into control and treatment groups by the receptionist at the practice</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation: Consenting child participants will be randomly allocated to the control or treatment group. Equal numbers of control and intervention labels will be individually placed into sealed opaque envelopes by the research assistant. Equal numbers of each group will be brought to each location and shuffled by the research assistant, who will give an envelope to each child after the first test. The child will hand the envelope to the chiropractor who will be the only person who reads what group the child is in. This will enable the chiropractor to know whether to conduct a sham or real treatment with the child.  The research assistant will be blind to which group participants are in. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>Blinding: Participants will be blinded to which group they are in. The Research Assistant will also be blinded to whether participants are in the control or treatment group as a result of the randomisation process. Only the chiropractor will be aware of group type. 
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Power analysis performed based on previous adult studies using 40 treatment and 40 control participants where a statistically significant difference in treatment and control groups was determined. 
A sample size of 50 in each group was determined, and an extra 10 in each group at the beginning of the study to allow for dropout. 
Power analysis included statistical significance of P&lt;0.05 with an effect of greater than 2 standard deviations in a group of 40 adults in previous studies using one technique in one region of the spine. 
This study will involve either HVLA or low force techniques and so additional subjects were added to be able to see this effect.
Analysis to be used includes a multiple regression analysis to compare the entire cohort of control vs treatment group responses. 
One-tailed, paired t test for each group to determine if the 2 groups differed in the magnitude of the decrease in time to undertake the test. 
One-tailed, 2 group equal variance t-test, for the difference scores for each group. 
Reaction time: timed automatically on the iPad with each user for both tests and data variations of one participant with themselves.
