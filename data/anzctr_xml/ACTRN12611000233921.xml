  <interventions>
    <interventions>Infants randomised to the intervention (High FlowNasal Cannula) group will be managed as follows:
*Receive HFNC via the Fisher &amp; Paykel Optiflow system, using heated and humidified gases. 
*A prong size will be chosen that fits comfortably in the infants nares without occluding them.
*HFNC will be commenced at 6L/min for infants weighing &lt;2000 g and 7L/min for infants weighing greater than or equal to 2000 g, and will not be increased. These flow rates were decided upon using the current best evidence, known practice, and expert opinion, balancing the need for safety against efficacy.
*Inspired oxygen concentration will be adjusted in order to maintain SpO2 at 90-95%.
Flow rate will be weaned (in decrements of 1 L/min) to a minimum of 4 L/min. A detailed Clinical Guide will provide guidance on weaning and timing of cessation; the Guide will ensure treatment is tailored to the infants clinical condition and anticipated course of illness. 
*If the infant is weaned off HFNC, but then redevelops an oxygen requirement and/or increased work of breathing, HFNC will be recommenced at the original (maximal) flow rate. 
*No other form of respiratory support (eg. CPAP) will be used unless a decision to transfer the infant has been made, and NETS contacted for retrieval.

    <comparator>Ambient oxygen. Infants randomised to the control group (AO) will be managed as follows:
1.  Infants will receive inspired oxygen into the crib/cot or via a 'head-box'. Inspired oxygen concentration will be adjusted in order to maintain Sp02 90-95%.
2.  Receive standard supportive (intravenous fluids and dextrose, intragastric tube, and antibiotics as required) as decided by their paediatrician.
3.  No other form of respiratory support (e.g. CPAP) will be permitted unless a decision to transfer the infant has been made and the Newborn Emergency Transport Service (NETS) have been contacted for retrieval.
4.  Treatment will cease once the infant no longer requires oxygen therapy in order to maintain SpO2 90-95%.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>1.  Gestational age at birth less than 32 completed weeks. The trial will continue to support and encourage the NHMRC recommendations for in utero transfer of infants expected to be born at less than 33weeks gestation. Furthermore, no change in practice will be made for those centres that routinely transfer in utero at gestational ages higher than 33 weeks. It is not uncommon, however, for babies of this gestation to be unavoidably born at a non-tertiary nursery.
2.  Birth weight lower than that which the SCN would normally care for. 
3.  Apgar score less than or equal to 3 at 5 minutes of age (used as an arbitrary and de-facto indicator of possible perinatal asphyxia).
4.  Any infant who is perceived by their paediatrician to need NICU care, or who has a known major congenital abnormality requiring care in a tertiary centre, or which may impact upon the infants condition after birth (eg. congenital cardiac disease, upper airway obstruction, gastrointestinal malformations).</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All newborn infants who are brought to the SCN with signs of respiratory distress will have their SpO2 measured. If required, supplemental oxygen will be commenced/continued and titrated with the aim to ensure the SpO2 is kept between 90-95%, inclusive. 
Oxygen will be delivered into the cot/crib or via a head-box. Consent will be sought for those infants who require any oxygen on the understanding that the infant will only be randomised if they continue to require supplemental oxygen for one hour. Central randomisation by computer will be used.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be computer generated. Randomisation will be blocked by gestational age-group (less than 37 weeks completed gestation at birth; greater than or equal to 37 weeks completed gestation at birth), and centre.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Each year about 15,000 newborn Australian infants are admitted to hospital with respiratory distress and 2,500-3,000 are transferred to a larger tertiary hospital. The use and popularity of high-flow nasal cannulae to treat newborn infants is increasing. Anecdotally, HFNC is an easy to use therapy that has been used in a variety of clinical setting with success. Due to its simplicity and potential benefits, HFNC may be an ideal therapy for non-tertiary special care nurseries, and may reduce the need to transfer babies to tertiary centres. It is imperative to undertake a high-quality trial to assess the safety and efficacy of HFNC in the non-tertiary setting. This trial will be undertaken in 6-8 non-tertiary SCNs in NSW and Victoria.</summary>
