  <interventions>
    <interventions>Behaviour - Supervised home-based exercise

Experimental: Exercise group - Each participant randomised to the exercise group will receive routine, regular antenatal care. In addition, these women will be required to participate in three 60-minute exercise sessions each week, starting at 14 weeks gestation, for a total of 14 weeks (i.e. to be completed by 28 weeks of gestation). All exercise sessions will be home-based and fully supervised by an experienced exercise physiologist.

No Intervention: Control group - Women allocated to the control group will not participate in the home-based exercise program, and will continue their normal physical activity throughout pregnancy. This group will receive routine, regular antenatal care, together with the additional outcome assessments at baseline (14 weeks gestation) and cessation of the study (28 weeks gestation).


Behaviour: Supervised home-based exercise
Each participant randomised to the exercise group will be required to participate in three 60-minute exercise sessions each week, starting at 14 weeks gestation, for a total of 14 weeks (i.e. to be completed by 28 weeks of gestation). All exercise sessions will be home-based and fully supervised by an experienced exercise physiologist. The exercise program will be implemented in accordance with the American College of Sports Medicine and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines. All sessions will be conducted on a stationary cycle ergometer.
Heart rate will be measured continuously during exercise to ensure that the exercise intensity is maintained as prescribed. In addition, blood pressure and rate of perceived exertion will be monitored at 10-min intervals. Perceived exertion will not be allowed to exceed a rating of 14 (i.e. "somewhat hard").

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications of
      pregnancy and has serious health implications for both the pregnant woman and her child. In
      particular, offspring of mothers with GDM have an increased prevalence of obesity, diabetes
      and metabolic syndrome, perpetuating serious health consequences in subsequent generations.

      Although regular exercise offers numerous benefits for both the mother and her child, its
      effectiveness in preventing GDM remains to be established. It has been recently shown that
      regular supervised home-based exercise may attenuate the decline in glucose tolerance in
      obese pregnant women. This study aims to conduct a single-centred, multi-sited,
      single-blinded randomised controlled trial examining the effect of 14 weeks of supervised
      home-based exercise (commenced at 14 weeks gestation) on the recurrence and severity of GDM,
      along with other aspects of maternal and fetal wellbeing.

      Eligible participants (n = 200) will be randomly allocated to an exercise intervention (n =
      100) or a control group (n = 100). The exercise intervention will involve three 60-minute
      home-based, supervised exercise sessions each week. This type of program overcomes many of
      the barriers to exercise in this population including transportation, child care issues and
      embarrassment associated with exercising in a public venue. The investigators have already
      shown this program to be both feasible and warmly accepted by obese pregnant women.</summary>
