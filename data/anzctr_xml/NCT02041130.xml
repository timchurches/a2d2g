    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Renal Denervation

Experimental: Renal Denervation and standard medical management - Renal Denervation (RDN) is a simple catheter procedure removing excess nerve signals to and from the kidneys. The renal denervation system consists of a small steerable treatment catheter and an automatically-controlled treatment delivery generator.
A guiding catheter is inserted through a tiny incision in the groin into the femoral artery to direct the treatment catheter to the renal arteries. The treatment catheter delivers high -frequency radio waves, called radiofrequency wavees, to 4-6 locations within each of the two renal arteries. the energy delivered is about 8 watts and aims to disrupt the nerves and lower blood pressure over a period of months. The procedure takes 40-60 minutes.

No Intervention: Contorl and Standard Medical Management - Continued medical management will comprise management of all cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia) in accord with international guidelines. Lifestyle and dietary counselling will also be part of the patient management. As there is no established evidence-based pharmacotherapy for HFPEF per se, therapy aimed at HF specifically will adopt treatments recommended for HFREF with prescription of diuretic, ACE inhibitor/ARB, beta blocker and mineralocorticoid antagonist accordingly.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Investigators will test a new approach to a form of heart failure (HF) with no current
      treatment proven to reduce death rates or hospitalisations. Over a third of HF cases have
      preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) often on a background of high blood pressure (BP). These
      "stiff" hearts pump strongly but fill inefficiently resulting in poor exercise capacity and
      high death rates. Treatments that help when heart pumping action is poor are of no benefit in
      HFPEF. Recently a simple catheter procedure removing excess nerve signals to and from the
      kidneys ("renal denervation"; RDN) has been able to reduce BP in patients with high BP
      resistant to multi-drug treatment. Through removing excess nervous drive to the kidneys,
      heart and circulation this treatment has promise in HF. The investigators will compare
      effects of RDN and standard medical treatment on heart function, exercise capacity and
      quality of life in 144 patients with HFPEF</summary>
