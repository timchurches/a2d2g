    <interventions>In critically ill patients with severe sepsis, how does continuous beta-lactam infusion compared with intermittent beta-lactam bolus dosing affect ICU-free days up to Day 28?Beta-lactam antibiotics are the class of antibiotics most commonly used to treat infection in patients with severe sepsis. In a recent point prevalence study of antibiotic usage in Australia and New Zealand conducted in conjunction with the Extended Study on Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC II), among ICU patients being treated for infection, 4 of the 5 most commonly used antibiotics were beta-lactams. The three most commonly prescribed beta-lactams were ticarcillin-clavulanate (23% of all antibiotics), meropenem (20% of all antibiotics), and piperacillin-tazobactam (13% of all antibiotics). Routine use of continuous infusions for beta-lactam administration was extremely low; with a point prevalence estimate of 1.8% for all beta-lactam antibiotics used in Australian and New Zealand ICUs. The theoretical rationale for administration of beta-lactams via continuous infusion is well recognised. Bacterial killing is related to the duration of time that bacteria are exposed to a concentration of antibiotic that exceeds the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). It is well established that administration of beta-lactam antibiotics by infusion produces higher blood and tissue serum levels. While continuous infusion is superior to bolus administration in animal and in vitro models of infection in the absence of an effective immune response, two meta-analyses of the human trials conducted to date have not demonstrated that continuous infusion is superior to intermittent administration in terms of clinical cure and survival. These human trials, however, have been underpowered, even when pooled, and primarily conducted in non-critically ill patients. In addition, 13 of the 14 studies included in the meta-analysis by Roberts et al. used higher doses in the intermittent arm.
 The beta-lactam antibiotic chosen by the treating physician will be randomised to continuous infusion or intermittent bolus administration. The dose and dosing interval of the antibiotic will be chosen by the treating physician so as to reflect body size and estimated drug clearance. The dose of antibiotic will be the same regardless of treatment group allocation and antibiotic dosing can be modified during the study based on predicted or actual changes to renal clearance.  Dosing will continue as per clinician's discretion, ICU discharge or to a maximum of 14 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study is a multi-centre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial of continuous beta-lactam infusion versus intermittent beta-lactam bolus dosing for patients who are commenced on the following antibiotics, with administered dose determined by the treating clinician: ticarcillin-clavulanate, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. For patients where the study drug is subsequently switched to flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin (e.g. for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia) or escalated to meropenem within 14 days of randomisation, the new beta-lactam will continue as the blinded study drug via the randomised administration method.The beta-lactam antibiotic chosen by the treating physician will be randomised to continuous infusion or intermittent bolus administration.
 The dose and dosing interval of the antibiotic will be chosen by the treating physician so as to reflect body size and estimated drug clearance.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome for this study is ICU-free days up to Day 28. Data collection will be confined to the following key variables:
Baseline variables:
	Patient characteristics (age, sex)
	ICU admission diagnosis
	Admission APACHE II (severity of illness) score components
	Site or sites of presumed or known infection
	Study drug
	Date of randomisation
	Planned 24 hour dose and dosing interval of the study drug at randomisation
	Subsequent beta lactam antibiotic and prescribed 24 hour dose (if applicable)
	Concurrent antimicrobial use
	Microbiological confirmation of infection
	Daily blood cultures until negative growth at 48 hours post collection 
	Daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score up to Day 15 of study drug administration or ICU discharge (whichever is sooner)
	Date of cessation of study drug blinding
	Reason for cessation of study drug blinding
	Date of cessation of study drug
	Adverse events
	Clinical response on cessation of the study drug 	Vital status at ICU discharge</outcome>
      <timepoint>This primary endpoint was chosen as it is correlated with 28-day mortality.
	Vital status at hospital discharge
	ICU-free days up to Day 28 
	90-day survival (including date of death if deceased)
The primary outcome for this study is ICU-free days up to Day 28. This primary endpoint was chosen as it is correlated with 28-day mortality (censored at hospital discharge) with a receiver operating character curve of 0.94 and a Nagelkerke R2 of 0.70 in a severe sepsis cohort from Australia and New Zealand (Dulhunty, unpublished results). ICU-free days is determined from the date of randomisation (Day 1). The number of non-ICU days post ICU discharge, and excluding days of ICU readmission, will be counted for each day a patient is alive up to Day 28; a patient who is deceased prior to ICU discharge receives a score of 0. Where a patient is discharged alive from hospital before Day 28, a follow call will be made to the patient or patient?s next of kin to determine survival status up to Day 28.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measures are as follows:
1.90-day survival reviewed utilising a follow up call to the patient/next of kin to identify the patient status at day 90.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A 90-day survival surrogate endpoint was chosen over 28-day survival as short-term mortality is insufficient to fully capture the mortality effect associated with sepsis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2.Clinical cure at test of cure date</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical cure will be determined from the clinical response variable which will be rated by a blinded treating physician at a test of cure date. Clinical response will be defined as follows:
1.	Resolution - disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the infection 
2.	Improvement - a marked or moderate reduction in the severity and/or number of signs and symptoms of infection
3.	Failure - insufficient lessening of the signs and symptoms of infection to qualify as improvement, including death or indeterminate (no evaluation possible, for any reason)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Number of days free of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal organ failure at Day 14</outcome>
      <timepoint>The number of days for resolution of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal organ failure is evaluated to Day 15 (scored as 14 if organ failure resolves on Day 15) and subtracted from 14 to obtain organ failure free days at Day 14. Organ failure resolution is defined as the next calendar day from when a patient last required (i) vasopressors, (ii) had a PaO2/FiO2 less than 300 or required invasive mechanical ventilation, or (iii) had a creatinine greater than 170 micro mol/l or required renal replacement therapy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4.Time to culture negative growth at 48 hours post collection</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily blood cultures:
All patients will have a blood culture performed on the day of randomisation and each subsequent calendar day until there is no growth in a blood culture 48 hours after collection.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to compare the effects of two approaches to the administration of beta-lactam antibiotics (continuous infusion and intermittent bolus dosing) on ICU-free days up to Day 28, with dosing at clinician discretion and independent of randomisation group. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in ICU-free days up to Day 28 between patients assigned to continuous infusion and those assigned to standard bolus dosing.</summary>
