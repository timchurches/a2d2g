    <interventions>Communication Skills Training.

This consists of a scripted group training called "It's All About Communication" that uses video examples of clinical situations together with a workbook and trainer's guide. 

The aim is for participants to reflect on their communication style and to teach them how to analyze, reflect, and modify their communication depending on the patient or client's circumstances. 

The training programme consists of four weekly, face to face group sessions, administered by a facilitator using the training materials, lasting between 50 and 75 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Mentalization.

The control group will be offered four sessions of mentalization practice, using a an acceptance and compassion model.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Within two regions of New Zealand, all healthcare providers will be contacted and permission requested to recruit from the organization. 

Once this is obtained, potential participants will be met in their workplace and invited to participate. They will be given a consent form and information sheet, and time to consider and consult with family or others as to if they will participate. 

Once groups  of seven to nine participants in each workplace are indentified, the group will be assigned to an intervention randomly. 

We cannot conceal the intervention from the group, and all outcomes are self-reported. </concealment>
    <sequence>We will use computer generated random numbers held by a person outside the study, at a central site,  to allocate intervention</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In order to provide 80% power to detect differences of 0.5 SD between arms of the study at follow-up (i.e., moderate effect sizes) for the primary continuous outcomes, using two-sided tests at the 0.05 level and assuming a correlation between baseline and follow-up values of r=0.5 or higher, we would need the equivalent of 48 participants in each arm with full data.  As this would involve participants nested within groups (mean of 8.5 participants/group) and nested within organisations (mean of 20 participants/organisation), assuming ICCs of 0.05 and 0.01 for these respectively, producing design effects of 1.375 and 1.19, this resulted in a final sample size of 79/group.  To allow for approximately 20% loss to follow-up, 100 participants will be recruited to each arm of the study (total n=200).
Appropriate summary statistics will be presented for all outcomes of interest.  Differences in changes between the two arms of the study will be examined using appropriate regression models (linear for continuous, binary logistic for dichotomised, and Poisson or negative binomial for count outcomes) adjusting for baseline values.  Standard regression diagnostics will be used in each case.  As missing data will potentially be informative, differences between participants with and without follow-up data will be conducted along with sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of any findings.  All statistical tests will be conducted at the two-sided 0.05 level.  Stata 13.1 and R 3.1.0 (or later versions) will be used for all analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patient initiated violence is a workplace hazard in all healthcare settings, for trained and untrained staff. A previous pilot study showed that training in communication skills decreased the rate of such aggression. In this group-randomized trial we will compare communication skills training with mindfulness, to see which decreases the risk of patient violence over six months.</summary>
