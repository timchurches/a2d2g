  <interventions>
    <interventions>Free use of the full version of the Healthy.me website to manage their asthma for 12 months.

    <concealment>Internet-based recruitment methods will be used to invite patients with asthma to participate in the study: * advertisement on online noticeboards (e.g. Gumtree).  * Promotion of the study on Facebook and Twitter * Asthma Foundation NSW will send an email to its members via its regular newsletters and/or other email mechanisms to inform them about the study. In addition, a call for participation will be advertised on their website. Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be invited to visit the study website and/or contact the researcher for participation and further information.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation to the intervention or control group according to a sequence generated by a computerized random-number generator. The randomisation will be stratified by gender and asthma severity (intermittent vs. persistent asthma). The randomisation sequence generation, participant enrolment and group allocation processes in this study are computerised online and do not involve interference from the investigators. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to assess the efficacy of an online system designed for patients and health care consumers, called Healthy.me, to support health management. Healthy.me provides patients and consumer condition specific information, as well as online tools to manage their care including a personal health record. Our primary hypothesis is that use of Healthy.me for patients with asthma will increase possession and uptake of a written asthma action plan. This randomized controlled trial will also specifically test whether system use is associated with the following secondary outcome measures: i) significant improvement in asthma control, ii) increased compliance according to written asthma action plan, iii) reduced unplanned utilization of health services, iv) reduced frequency of exacerbations, and iv) improved quality of life over 12 months. Patients and consumers are increasingly using online systems to make health decisions and manage their health but we still know little about their patterns of use and impact. This study will make a specific and significant contribution to our understanding of the effectiveness of online systems for patients and healthcare consumers.</summary>
