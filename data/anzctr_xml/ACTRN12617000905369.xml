  <interventions>
    <interventions>This proposal is for a trial aimed at exploring the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of the use of electronic nicotine devices (ENDs) as smoking cessation aids when used in conjunction with one of two commonly used quit smoking strategies: 'abrupt cessation' and 'gradual cessation'. Abrupt cessation involves smoking tobacco as normal until a designated quit day, followed by total abstinence. Gradual reduction strategies also
involve the designation of a quit day, however smokers utilizing this method aim to reduce or scale their intake of tobacco cigarettes prior to the quit day, usually according to a predefined schedule (i.e. a 25% reduction in tobacco cigarette consumption by week 1).
Treatment arms
The two intervention conditions: Group 1: Electronic Nicotine Devices abrupt cessation  group (ENDs + abrupt) ; Group 2: Electronic Nicotine Devices gradual (ENDs + gradual).

Group 1 - Participants in Group 1 (Abrupt Cessation) will be asked to treat that day as their quit day and to start vaping (using their ENDs + liquid nicotine). For the following 12 weeks (treatment period) Group 1 participants will be asked to try and quit smoking cigarettes and replace their cigarettes with use of either, or both of their ENDs products.
The devices (Innokin Endura T22 and T18 starter kit) and refill liquid (Nicophar) were selected based on quality assurance and compliance with relevant standards (GMP for liquid). Participants will be provided with the END and an initial 4-week supply of liquid nicotine, with further supplies of the refill liquid mailed or couriered to them in 4 weekly intervals.
All participants will receive two different models of devices and a 12-week supply of one investigational medicine to be used within the trial period. The device is to be used in conjunction with the medicine.
Device: Innokin Endura T22
The Innokin Endura T22 is a simple to use device. Participants are required to turn the device on when they wish to use it, and inhale from the mouthpiece. To activate the heating coil to generate aerosol, the user presses and holds down a button while inhaling from the mouthpiece. This process causes the liquid nicotine (stored in the 4mL tank) to be heated by the coil and turned into an aerosol. The tank can be refilled with additional liquid nicotine as required and the 2000mAh battery recharged using a USB cable as needed. Given the large tank size and long battery life, the device does not require to be refilled and recharged as often as other devices, but is larger in size to accommodate these features. A device such as this may therefore be more appealing to heavier smokers.
Device: Innokin Endura T18
The Innokin Endura T18 is a slimline, pen style vaporiser. Similar to the Innokin Endura T22, the T18 device requires participants to turn the device on when they wish to use it, and inhale from the end. The liquid nicotine in this device is stored in a smaller 2.5mL tank located directly under the drip tip and can be refilled with additional liquid nicotine as required. The device is powered by a 1000mAh battery which can be recharged using the provided micro USB cable as needed. This devices slimline design, smaller tank size and shorter battery life may be more appealing to light to moderate smokers interested in a more discrete vaporiser.

Liquid nicotine:
The liquid nicotine will be manufactured to GMP standards for the trial (Nicophar brand). It will be provided to participants in 10ml dropper bottles. The contents of each 10ml bottle will depend on the nicotine strength: 18mg or 12mg strength. Each 12mg strength 10mL bottle will contain nicotine (1.2%), Glycerol (84%) and water (14.8%). Each 18mg strength 10mL bottle will contain nicotine (1.8%), Glycerol (84%) and water (14.2%).
Liquid nicotine is designed to be used with an Electronic Nicotine Device (END) to
reduce/avoid symptoms of withdrawal from tobacco smoking, in a similar way that
other fast acting NRT products are used. The frequency with which the device (containing the liquid nicotine) is used will depend on the user, and their level of previous tobacco use. One strength of the liquid nicotine will be used (12mg nicotine/ml) which is a concentration that is in common use. The trial will supply in 10 mL pack size (total nicotine per pack =120mg for 1.2%). The strength of the eliquid is similar to a liquid nicotine product currently listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, which is approved for over the counter sale in general retail outlets: Nicorette QuickMist Mouthspray, which contains 13.6mg/mL nicotine and each pack contains 13.2mL (i.e total nicotine per pack = 179.5mg nicotine). The trial will supply liquid nicotine for a 12 week period.

Adherence will be monitored via safety assessment calls and follow up up surveys in weeks 1, 3, 6 (survey), 7, 10, 12 (survey). We will also track unused liquid nicotine return at the conclusion of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>For the gradual reduction condition, participants will be asked to use the provided ENDs device/s and the liquid nicotine as a way of tapering or reducing the number/amount of tobacco cigarettes smoked during the treatment period, leading up to their designated quit date. Each week for the first 4 weeks of the treatment period they should reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke by 25% by replacing them with use of either, or both of their ENDs products. Cigarette smoking and use of ENDs will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks post enrollment. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We expect to recruit 50 clients over a 3 month period which is achievable in across two AOD clinic sites. Approximately 80% of AOD clients are smokers. We will be assuming 50% eligibility and consent into the trial, and 40% attrition at 12 weeks based on our current AOD research and thus approaching 130 service clients over the 3-month recruitment period. A total sample of 30 participants at 12 week follow-up will provide 15 smokers per experimental group. This pilot trial has been designed to provide essential information for the development of an adequately powered larger superiority trial, including smoking prevalence, response and attrition rates.

Statistical Analysis Plan 
Data will be collected on recruitment and retention rates which will aid the design of future large trials. Primary cessation outcome analyses will be carried out on an intention to treat basis. Chi squared tests, relative risks and 95% CIs and 2-sided p-values for all binary variables, followed by adjusted multiple logistic regression analyses. Continuous outcomes (with 95% CIs) will be analysed using generalised linear mixed methods regression for the main aims, with adjustments for covariates where necessary.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Smoking prevalence amongst people with alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems is extremely high. In Australia, up to 95% of people entering AOD treatment smoke tobacco, which is five times greater than for the general adult population. Although number of quit attempts are high, sustaining cessation is challenging for people with AOD dependence: many factors related to addiction, lack of cessation support and the high levels of smoking in their social network contribute to high relapse rates in this population. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) can reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings and aid cessation, however our research with AOD users indicate they are hesitant to use traditional forms of NRT. Electronic Nicotine Devices (ENDs) hold significant potential as both cessation aids and harm reduction support. Unlike combustible tobacco cigarettes, ENDs deliver nicotine in an
inhalable form without the tobacco, hence removing many of the health harms associated with smoking.

This proposal is for a trial aimed at exploring the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of the use of electronic nicotine devices (ENDs) as smoking cessation aids when used in conjunction with one of two commonly used quit smoking strategies: 'abrupt cessation' and 'gradual cessation'. Abrupt cessation involves smoking tobacco as normal until a designated quit day, followed by total abstinence. Gradual reduction strategies also
involve the designation of a quit day, however smokers utilizing this method aim to reduce or scale their intake of tobacco cigarettes prior to the quit day, usually according to a predefined schedule (i.e. a 25% reduction in tobacco cigarette consumption by week 1).

Specifically, this study will aim to determine how the use of ENDs and liquid nicotine in conjunction with a 'gradual reduction' or 'abrupt cessation' quit strategy impacts smoking cessation or smoking reduction outcomes. It will determine whether the provision of ENDs assists smokers with AOD addiction to quit or reduce their tobacco consumption and whether using these devices reduces cigarette cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Finally, this study will evaluate whether AOD clients find ENDs devices acceptable as a quit smoking aid.</summary>
