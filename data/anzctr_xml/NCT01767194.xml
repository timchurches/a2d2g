             of initial diagnosis

          -  For the purposes of this study, aggressive multidrug chemotherapy is defined as
             chemotherapy including 2 or more agents that must include an alkylating agent and a

          -  Patients must have at least ONE of the following:

               -  Measurable tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT)
                  scan obtained within 3 weeks prior to study entry; measurable is defined as &gt;= 10
                  mm in at least one dimension on spiral/helical CT that is metaiodobenzylguanidine
                  (MIBG) avid or demonstrates increased fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron
                  emission tomography (PET) scan

               -  MIBG scan obtained within 3 weeks prior to study entry with positive uptake at a
                  minimum of one site; this site must represent disease recurrence after completion
                  of therapy, progressive disease on therapy, or refractory disease during
                  induction

               -  Patients with resistant/refractory soft tissue disease that is not MIBG avid or
                  does not demonstrate increased FDG uptake on PET scan must undergo biopsy to

             resistant/refractory, relapsed disease or progressive disease

          -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since completion of myelosuppressive therapy

             (RT) for non-target lesions; however, patients must not have received radiation for a
             minimum of 4 weeks prior to study entry at the site of any lesion that will be
             identified as a target lesion to measure tumor response; lesions that have been
             previously radiated cannot be used as target lesions unless there is radiographic
             evidence of progression at the site following radiation or a biopsy done following
             radiation shows viable neuroblastoma; palliative radiation is allowed to sites that

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide
      with temsirolimus or dinutuximab work in treating younger patients with neuroblastoma that
      has returned or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan
      hydrochloride and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving
      irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide together with temsirolimus or dinutuximab is more
      effective in treating neuroblastoma.</summary>
