  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children consumed on a daily basis during 4 months one of the following treatments:
1.- A standard ferrous sulfate supplement made in liquid solution. The daily dosage was 1mL containing ferrous sulfate (20mg).
2.- A daily iron and folic acid recommendation of UNICEF to treat anemia in a liquid solution. The daily dosage was 1mL containing iron (12.5mg) and folic acid (50ug). 
3.- A multiple micronutrients supplement following a formula designed to treat anemia in indigenous population in Mexico. The daily dosage was 1mL containing iron (10mg), zinc (10mg), thiamine (0.6mg), Riboflavin (0.55mg), pyridoxin (0.75mg), vitamin B12 (0.55 ug), folic acid (37.5ug) and vitamin C (30mg).
4.- A powdered complementary food designed for a national program in Mexico (Oportunidades program formerly called Progresa program). The powder was prepared with a small amount of water to form a porridge which was eaten with the help of a spoon. The daily dosage was 44g containing iron (2.5mg), zinc (2mg), thiamine (0.18mg), riboflavin (0.32mg), vitamin B12 (0.42ug), folic Acid (10.1ug), vitamin C (2.4mg), vitamin A (330UI), vitamin E (2.5mg), vitamin D (100UI), vitamin B6 (0.2mg), vitamin K (6ug), niacin (2.3mg), pantothenic acid (0.6mg), biotin (4ug), calcium (200mg), phosphorus (160mg), magnesium (20mg), iodine (38ug), manganese (0.26mg), cupper (0.18mg), potassium (300mg) ahd chloride (220mg).
5.- A drink water product fortified with iron, zinc and ascorbic acid developed by Procter and Gamble (Cincinnati, OH). Water should be consumed when giving drinking water and when cooking for the child, there was no specified dose. 1L of watter contained iron (7.5mg), zinc (6.25mg) and vitamin C (50mg).</interventions>
    <comparator>All treatments. Since all children were anemic, a placebo treatment was not included for ethical reasons.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hemoglobin concentration. Hemoglobin was measured in a drop of capillar blood with a photometer (HemoCue Blood-Hemoglobin System, Angelholm, Sweden)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and after 4 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anthropometry. Children were weighted with an electronic scale with no shoes or sweaters to the nearest 100g. Height was measured with a stadiometer with no shoes. Younger children who could not stand still by themselves were weighted with a pediatric scale  and their supine length was measured within 1mm using a rigid measuring mat for infants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and after 4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Morbidity. A questionnaire was developed to record daily symptoms of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Twice a week daily symptoms were recorded during 4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment acceptance. Weekly compliance was recorded weekly by fieldworkers by gathering empty bottles or pouches, and the non-empty were weighted. In additon a weekly questionnaire was administered to mothers with questions about children's behaviour during and after administering the treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once a week during 4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total iron and ferritin concentrations. Total iron was determined by triplicate using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer . Ferritin was determined by triplicate by immunoradiometric assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and after 4 months</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>An initial screening was carried out in 574 children. A sample of capillary blood was taken from every child after an overnight fast for hemoglobin analysis. Children were divided into two groups regarding their hemoglobin status: Anemic if Hb &lt; 11.7g/dL or non-anemic if it was equal or above this value. Of the 574 children 46% were anemic and were randomized into 1 of 5 treatments. Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was "off-site".</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization procedures were carried out for 10 blocks of children that entered the study one at a time, ensuring homogeneous groups concerning hemoglobin status, age and gender. Also siblings were allocated to the same treatments to facilitate treatment administration by the mother. This randomization process was achieved with a program in SAS version 8.1 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC) specifically developed for the purpose of this study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anemia continues to be a major public health problem in many regions of the world and it is still not clear which strategy is more effective in children population in terms of adherence and efficacy. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and acceptance of several strategies that have been recently recommended to treat anemia.</summary>
