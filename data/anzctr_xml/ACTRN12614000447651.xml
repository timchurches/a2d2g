  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will look at the transfer of gabapentin and pregabalin in to the breast milk of women who will not be breastfeeding in the immediate post-partum period (days 1-4 following childbirth).

Arm 1: participants assigned to receive an oral dose of gabapentin 300mg will have drug levels measured from one venous blood sample and four breast milk samples over the subsequent 24 hours. 

Arm 2: participants assigned to receive an oral dose of pregabalin 150mg will have drug levels measured from one venous blood sample and four breast milk samples over the subsequent 24 hours.

The assigned drug will be administered at 07.00am with venous and breast milk samples taken over the subsequent 24 hours. The assigned drug may be administered on any one of the days 1-4 following childbirth). </interventions>
    <comparator>There are two separate groups being evaluated (gabapentin and pregabalin) but there will be no comparison made between these two groups (ie. there is no "active control") 
There is no inactive control group.
The study is an uncontrolled single group trial for gabapentin and an uncontrolled single group trial for pregabalin being done in parallel.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quantitative analysis of gabapentin and pregabalin levels in breast milk and maternal plasma for pharmacokinetic modelling.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Analysis will occur on four breast milk samples over the 24 hours following drug administration (the four samples will be randomly selected from eight possible time periods: 0.5-1 hour, 1-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, 6-9 hours, 9-12 hours, 12-18 hours, 18-24 hours). One maternal plasma sample will be randomly allocated to coincide with a breast milk sample to provide a milk:plasma ratio.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Women delivering at the King Edward Memorial Hospital, but who will not be breast feeding in the immediate post-partum period, will be invited to participate in the study.
Those that meet the relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent to particpation in the study will be assigned to receive a single dose of either gabapentin or pregabalin. Allocation to the gabapentin or pregabalin group will be unblinded as there is no control group.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Simulations within NONMEM (non-linear mixed effects modelling) were used to determine the study sample size of 80 particpants (40 participants assigned to each arm). Pharmacokinetic data on gabapentin and pregabalin were used in these simulations with an expected milk to plasma ratio = 1. 

Measured data will be analysed using population pharmacokinetic methods within NONMEN - this will allow estimates to be made of the absolute and relative infant dose.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gabapentin and pregabalin are anticonvulsants used in the management of both acute and chronic pain. They offer a potentially useful analgesic adjunct to women in the
post-partum period. However, there is limited information about the transfer of these drugs in to breast milk which has lead to safety concerns over their use in breastfeeding mothers.

By assigning post-partum mothers not intending to breastfeed to receive a dose of either gabapentin or pregabalin, measurements of plasma and breast milk concentrations can be made without risk of drug transfer to the newborn. 

This data will then be used to create pharmacokinetic models to estimate absolute and relative infant doses if used in breastfeeding mothers. </summary>
