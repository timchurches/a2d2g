  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women scheduled for gynaecologic surgery where cystoscopy is planned as a routine component of the surgical procedure will be randomized to receive either four capsules of riboflavin (Vitamin B2) totaling 400 mg orally the night prior to surgery (Solgar Inc., Leonia, NJ, USA), or placebo. We will ask subjects if they have taken the vitamin tablets and request that they return the empty packet to ensure compliance.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects in the control arm will receive four capsules of placebo (vitamin D3, cholecalciferol, 1000 IU Integria Healthcare, Auckland) for a total of 4000 IU orally the night prior to surgery.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the study is to determine the strength of yellow colouration of the urine when viewing the ureteric jet during cystoscopy. This will be assessed using a three point scale of colouration and will be assessed by the surgeon at the time of the procedure and again by an independent blinded observer reviewing video of the cystoscopy at a later time. Inter-observer variation will be assessed. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of cystoscopy and again by independent blinded observer who will review a digital video recording of the cystoscopy procedure within 1-2 weeks of the procedure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the ease of visualising the ureteric jets on cystoscopy, assessed using a 5 point Likert scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of cystoscopy and again by independent blinded observer who will review a digital video recording of the cystoscopy procedure within 1-2 weeks of the procedure.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the proportion of participants who have the ureteric jets visualised on cystoscopy, assessed by a dichotomous "Yes/No" score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of cystoscopy and again by independent blinded observer who will review a digital video recording of the cystoscopy procedure within 1-2 weeks of the procedure.

    <statisticalmethods>As these measures have not been used previously, the sample size estimate was determined using a clinically reasonable sample of 60 (30 per group) that would be suitable to detect a medium to large effect size with 80% power and 0.05 significance level.
The sample size will be appropriate for non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon sign rank test) and to detect the following effect sizes in parametric analyses:
For primary outcome, a sample size of 60 will be sufficient to detect a 0.75 point mean difference between the groups (Assuming SD=1) in the colour scale (1-3) with 80% power and 0.05 significance level.

A sample size of 60 will be sufficient to detect (a) a 1.1 point difference between groups in the mean scale for ease of visualizing the ureteric jets scale (assuming SD=1.5); and (b) a difference in proportion of participants with a strong yellow colour of 70% to 30%; with 80% power and 0.05 level of significance. To account for drop-out, 10% will be added to the sample size so a total of 66 subjects will be recruited, 33 in each arm of the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research objective is to see if riboflavin (Vitamin B2) can be given as a single oral dose prior to gynaecologic surgery to enhance the visualisation of urine flow from the ureter during cystoscopy. Placing a scope inside the bladder during pelvic surgery is commonly performed to detect operative injury during gynaecologic surgery. It is important to be able to see the urine flow out of the opening of the ureter to exclude injury to the ureter. Intravenous medications are commonly given to assess the ureter in such circumstances. These medications have some risk of allergic reactions and the medications commonly used have become unavailable on numerous occasions recently related to manufacturer shortages. Having a safe, effective, inexpensive and readily available alternative to the intravenous agents would be clinically beneficial and cost saving. </summary>
