  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Respirio Flu Test
Treatment: devices - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Treatment: devices - Sofia® Influenza A+B Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA)

Experimental: Respirio Flu Test - Upper respiratory tract samples from participants will be tested with:
Respirio Flu Test
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Sofia® Influenza A+B Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA)


Treatment: devices: Respirio Flu Test
The Respirio Flu Test is a rapid test for the detection of influenza A or influenza B in nasal secretions. The Respirio Flu Test is designed to be simple to use and generates a result within 20 minutes.

Treatment: devices: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a molecular diagnostic technique for the detection and identification of influenza viruses, both for clinical samples and isolates. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows template viral RNA to be reverse transcribed producing complementary DNA (cDNA) which can then be amplified and detected.

Treatment: devices: Sofia® Influenza A+B Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA)
Sofia® Influenza A+B Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) employs immunofluorescence to detect influenza A and influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens in nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash samples taken directly from symptomatic patients.

           Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

        -  assess agreement (positive and negative) between Respirio Flu Test and Sofia® Influenza
           A+B Test in detecting Influenza A;

        -  assess agreement (positive and negative) between Respirio Flu Test and Sofia® Influenza
           A+B Test in detecting Influenza B;

        -  evaluate the correct interpretation of the Respirio Flu Test results by subjects with
           Influenza-like illness symptoms;

        -  evaluate the subjects' satisfaction with the convenience, comfort and ease of use of the
           Respirio Flu Test;

        -  evaluate the subjects' comprehension of the Respirio Flu Test labelling; and
