  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive GYROKINESIS 'Registered Trademark' exercise training twice a week, lasting for 12 weeks in total. The exercise training will be delivered in a group format with a physiotherapist.
 
The duration of each training session will be 60-90 minutes long. Each class begins on a chair with a gentle warm up sequence to awaken the senses, and stimulate the nervous system. This is followed by a series of fluid spinal motions which increase range of motion, and prepare the body to explore more complex movements with agility, and ease. Class continues on the floor with exercises that expand on the spinal motions, gradually adding more complex sequences, incorporating more movements of the hips, shoulders, hands and feet. The floor exercises are followed by a rhythmic standing sequence that incorporates balance, and cardiovascular exercises.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in control group will be given one 1-hour session of verbal instruction regarding some exercise suggestions based on their personal interests by a physiotherapist. They will also maintain their usual daily activities. </comparator>

      <outcome>Thoracic kyphosis angle
Thoracic kyphosis angle was measured with a dual digital inclinometer (MicroFET6, HOGGAN Health Industries, Inc. 8020 South 1300 West, West Jordan, UT 84088) in habitual standing and sitting postures.
As for habitual standing postures, participants were asked to stand in their usual posture with barefoot and with feet hip-width apart. First, the dual digital inclinometers (DDI) were placed on a known horizontal surface to reset to zero prior to measurement. Then the DDI sensors were placed on the spinous processes of T1 and T12 respectively. The degree of thoracic kyphosis was read from the inclinometer screen, and the measurements were performed three times in succession for calculating the average value. 
As for habitual sitting posture, participants sat on a chair with hips flexed and knees flexed in 90 degrees, feet flat on the floor, arms hang comfortably along the body, and trunk in usual posture. DDI was reset to zero prior to measurement, and the sensors were placed on the spinous processes of T1 and T12 respectively. The degree of thoracic kyphosis was recorded, and the measurements were performed three times in succession for calculating the average value.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many breast cancer survivors suffered from restrictions in quality of life and impaired physical and psychological function after finishing radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but current exercise interventions cannot provide all-round effect to treatment sequelae.  GYROKINESIS 'Registered Trademark' is a new method containing flowing movement sequences that works the entire body, yet its clinical effects have not been investigated and have not been applied in the breast cancer population. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of GYROKINESIS 'Registered Trademark' -based training on physical function and quality of life in breast cancer survivors.</summary>
