  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acupuncture will be administered on day 6-8 of  the IVF cycle. The scheduling of this single appointment will be based on their scheduled visit to the IVF Centre.  This treatment will take one hour. In addition, two treatments will be given on the day of the embryo transfer. The duration of these two treatments will be 30 minutes respectively, and will take place immediately before and after the embryo transfer.  

The first treatment will be individualised based on their TCM diagnosis, plus core points Stomach 29, Conception vessel 4, Conception vessel 6, Spleen 6, Spleen 10.These points were selected from a consensus process undertaken with international experts.

The points administered on the day of the embryo transfer include: CV4, ST29, LR3, SP8, SP10 and one of the following (Yintang, PC6, HT7), GV20, KD3, ST36, SP6, PC6.</interventions>
    <comparator>Study group 2: The sham acupuncture group will use the Park Sham device which has a guide tube making it impossible for the subject to see whether the needle has penetrated the skin or not. The sham needle its self is able to slide into the handle, which increases the appearance that the skin has been penetrated. Needle penetration does not occur. The sham needle will be placed away from acupuncture points. The sham acupuncture device is an effective masking device for blinding in randomised controlled trials of acupuncture. Treatment will be administered on day 6-8 and twice on the day of an embryo trasnfer.  Study Group 3: Standard care. Standard care involves use of the usual pharmacological and surgical protocols used during the IVF cycle. This is a non randomised arm and women will contribute data only. The trial co-ordinator will make contact with subjects at the assessment time.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent research has suggested that acupuncture may help to increase pregnancy and live birth rates for women undergoing an embryo transfer during assisted reproductive technology. However, there are still many questions to be answered, and there remains a need for a larger well designed study to see whether acupuncture really does help with increasing pregnancy and live birth rates when used with IVF treatment. Acupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese Medicine, and involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific acupuncture points. This study examines the use acupuncture in improving the proportion of women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Women undergoing IVF treatment who are less than 43 years of age and undergoing a fresh IVF or ICSI cycle will be invited to participate in the study.  Women who agree to be part of this study will receive acupuncture or sham acupuncture (the placement of needles into points that are not true acupuncture points) in addition to their usual IVF care. Those women wishing to be part of the study but not receive the acupuncture or sham acupuncture can also participate though completing questionnaires.</summary>
