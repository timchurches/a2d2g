  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in FCB1-3 are clinic referred parents who report clinically significant levels of behavioural and/or parenting difficulties in their child(ren) aged 1-3. n=30 parents who meet inclusion criteria are invited to participate in 6x90 minute treatment sessions that address parenting difficulties in the context of early child behaviour problems. Each session comprises a 50 minute PARENT-TIME session followed by a 40 minute KID-TIME session.

Behaviorally based programs, also known as Behavioural Family Intervention and Parent Management Training, commonly identify parents as the potential mechanisms of change in child behaviour. The interventions achieve change through the engagement of parents in one of two distinct modes. They either involve 

1. the delivery of parenting information to parent(s) in session in the absence of their children, assessment of which is undertaken session by session via parental self-report 
2. the direct coaching of parents as they interact with their children, the assessment of which is undertaken session by session via self-report in conjunction with observational coding during session  

The current study seeks to trail a combination of both sessional engagement of parents on their own which, in the current research is termed PARENT-TIME and direct coaching of parents and their children which, in the current research is termed KID-TIME. Drawing on clinic referred children aged between one and three years, and undertaken at UTS: Family Child Behaviour, the current study seeks to assess the potential to increase treatment response by combining these two distinct modes of treatment delivery in a clinic referred population. 

 The sessions are presented to individual families, one per week, and are run by provisionally registered psychologists under the supervision of an Board approved and Endorsed Clinical Psychologist. Treatment gains are assessed session by session. The sessions have been informed by reviews of applicable scientific literature and informed by the CI's 15 years research and clinical work in the area. Sessional material is presented in a discussive manner that emphasises the families expertise in their own situation and utilises presentation and case scenario material.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of behaviorally based therapeutic interventions for families where child behavior is of concern. Behaviorally based programs, also known as Behavioural Family Intervention and Parent Management Training commonly identify parents as the potential mechanisms of change in child behaviour. The interventions achieve change through the engagement of parents in one of two distinct modes. They either involve 

1. the delivery of parenting information to parent(s) in session in the absence of their children, assessment of which is undertaken session by session via parental self-report 
2. the direct coaching of parents as they interact with their children, the assessment of which is undertaken session by session via self-report in conjunction with observational coding during session  

The current study seeks to trail a combination of both sessional engagement of parents on their own and direct coaching of parents and their children. Drawing on clinic referred children aged between one and three years, and undertaken at UTS: Family Child Behaviour, the current study seeks to assess the potential to increase treatment response by combining these two distinct modes of treatment delivery in a clinic referred population. 

It is hypothesised that as a result of inclusion in this trrial:
Participants will show a decrease in self-reported levels of parental depression, anxiety and stress from baseline to follow up
Participants will show an increase in self-reported levels of parenting confidence will be evident from baseline to follow up
Participants will show an increase in indices of observed appropriate parental engagement will be evident from baseline to follow up
Participants will show a reduction in parent-report levels of child behavioural difficulties evident from baseline to follow up
Participants will show a reduction in daycare report of child behavioural difficulties evident from baseline to follow up

Methodology: 
This research will be undertaken as a within subjects trial, the participants of which will be parents of children aged 1-3 years from NSW Australia. Parents who are referred into the program will be informed about the program, screened for inclusion into it and, if eligible, provided with the option to participate in the research. Parents will then be provided with information about the research and its requirements prior to seeking their informed consent.
