  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be usage of dexmedetomidine for sedation in assocation with neuraxial block for hip and knee arthroplasty. Dosage will be at the clinicians' discretion using standard dosages. However typical dosages are a loading dose of 0.5micrograms per kilogram (40micrograms for an 80kg patient) and 0.7 mcg/kg/hr, 56micrograms per kilogram per hour (56 micrograms an hour for an 80kg patient). Dosages are typically reduced for elderly patients. This would be given via intravenous infusion, commencing once the patient is positioned and it would not be combined with other sedative agents.</interventions>
    <comparator>Propofol for sedation. This is typically used via a "target-controlled-infusion" pump which calculates the patients' estimated plasma concentration of propofol using computerised models. A typical plasma "target" for sedation in combination with neuraxial block would be 3 micrograms/millilitre. This is titrated to effect. It would also be given via intravenous infusion commencing once the patient is positioned, and also not combined with other sedative agents.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with the sedation experience will be assessed postoperatively on an analogue scale. Mean patient satisfaction scores will be compared between groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within one week.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The outcome will be assessed using clinical assessment. It will be determined by the treating clinician whether one or more of jaw support; laryngeal mask insertion; use of Guedel airway; or endotracheal tube insertion occurs. Lowest pulse and lowest systolic blood pressure will be recorded intraoperatively. This will be recorded on the worksheet.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will compare the sedative medicine propofol with the newer sedative dexmedetomidine. The comparison will take place in a group of patients having replacement of their hips or knees with mechanical joints. The study will look at patients undergoing this surgery under a spinal block, where the body is made numb from the waist downwards. Typically these patients have some sort of sedation to make them more comfortable and less aware of noise or movement in the operating theatre. The most commonly used infusion, propofol has some side effects including reduced breathing efforts, which sometimes requires the anaesthetist to intervene and support the airway or even convert the sedation to a full anaesthetic. A newer sedative medicine, dexmedetomidine appears to have fewer of these effects. It may be that it is a better option for this sort of sedation. Some mild side effects such as changes in pulse rate have been associated with dexmedetomidine but these do not appear to be severe enough to prevent its usefulness in this setting. Patients will be randomized to receive either propofol or dexmedetomidine. They will receive their normal regional (eg spinal ) anaesthetic. The researchers will be measuring:
Patient satisfaction with the sedation experience (within one week of surgery);
Need for airway support; and haemodynamic values intraoperatively.</summary>
