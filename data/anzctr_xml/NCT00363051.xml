  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Everolimus 10 mg
Treatment: drugs - Octreotide Depot

Experimental: Everolimus 10 mg - Stratum 1 patients who were not receiving regular Octreotide Depot therapy. These patients were to receive everolimus monotherapy at 10 mg/day.
Stratum 2 patients who were to receive everolimus 10 mg/day in addition to continuing their entry dose of Octreotide Depot therapy.
Patients were instructed to take two 5 mg tablets of everolimus orally with a glass of water, once daily (preferably in the morning). Dosing was strongly recommended to occur at the same time every day.


Treatment: drugs: Everolimus 10 mg
Participants took two 5 mg tablets of Everolimus orally with a glass of water, once daily (preferably in the morning) in a fasting state or after no more than a light, fat-free meal. Dosing was to occur at the same time each day. If vomiting occurred, the vomited dose was not to be replaced.

Treatment: drugs: Octreotide Depot

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of everolimus in the
      treatment of advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) not responsive to cytotoxic
      chemotherapy. All patients were treated with everolimus until either tumor progression was
      documented using a standard criteria that measures tumor size called Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid tumors (RECIST), or until unacceptable toxicity occurred, or until the
      patient or investigator requested discontinuation of treatment.</summary>
