  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Initial Insulin Sensitivity Measure using Euglycaemic glucose clamp - The clamp will be used to measure insulin sensitivity. The clamp is initiated by an intravenous bolus injection of insulin (9milliUnit/kg). Insulin is then constantly infused at a rate of 40 milliUnit.m-2.min-1 for 120 min into an arm vein, whilst glucose is variably infused to maintain euglycaemia. Plasma glucose values will be monitored every 5 minutes during the clamp and the variable infusion rate of glucose is adjusted to maintain blood glucose at a constant value of 5mmol/L.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in overweight/obese
      individuals with vitamin D deficiency can improve insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance
      by decreasing subclinical inflammation.

      Results of the present study may help to identify new strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes
      in high-risk groups (i.e. overweight and obese individuals, and individuals with a strong
      family history of diabetes).

      Hypothesis: That increasing plasma 25(OH)D concentrations in healthy individuals at risk for
      type 2 diabetes with low vitamin D levels through vitamin D supplementation, will improve
      insulin sensitivity and also insulin secretion by reducing the underlying sub-clinical
      chronic inflammation.

      Aims: To establish whether 16-week vitamin D supplementation given to healthy individuals
      with low vitamin D levels will:

        1. improve insulin sensitivity (in vivo and tissue) and/or insulin secretory function

        2. determine whether this relationship is mediated by a reduced chronic inflammation</summary>
