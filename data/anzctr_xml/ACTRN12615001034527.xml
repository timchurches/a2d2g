    <comparator>Levobupivacaine 0.5 % dose for spinal anesthesia was determined in reference to patient height.

    <statisticalmethods>One Way Anova and Independent Sample T test were used for intergroup comparisons. Chi square and Fishers exact chi square tests were used to evaluate the nonnumerical data. The results were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation  and statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.
There was also a significantly decreased risk of hypotension with increasing ephedrine dose in a cohort study (X^2 = 9.67; P = 0.002). The final power achieved in detecting a linear dose-response relationship for hypotension varied among studies: 6%, 9%, 27%, 88%, and 99%. There was no association between dose and risk of fetal acidosis in a cohort study (X^2 = 3.06; P = 0.08). There was homogeneity of slopes  (X^2 =1.32; P = 0.52). We were calculated with a 95% confidence, an alpha of 0.06 and 95% power the sample size was calculated as 150 cases and 150 controls.

    <summary>Aim: To compare the effects of different doses of fentanyl added to intrathecal levobupivacaine on ephedrine requirement and to evaluate its impact on the fetus in subjects undergoing elective cesarean section.
Methods: A total of 800 parturients scheduled for elective cesarean section were enrolled in the study. Those fulfilling the enrollment criteria were randomly assigned to three groups as Group I (n=266), Group II (n=274) and Group III (n=260). All patients were administered with an infusion of Ringers lactate solution at 10-12 mL kg-1 in the preoperative period before spinal anesthesia and at 8-10 mL kg h-1 intraoperatively. The dose of levobupivacaine 0.5% was adjusted in reference to patient heights for spinal anesthesia. While Group I was administered with levobupivacaine 0.5%, Group II was administered with levobupivacaine 0.5% + 10 microgram fentanyl and Group III was administered with levobupivacaine 0.5% + 25 microgram fentanyl. In Group II and Group III, levobupivacaine volume was decreased to compensate for the fentanyl volume. Ephedrine infusion was initiated with 5 mg bolus following the puncture for spinal anesthesia. It was then administered at 10 microgram kg-1 min-1. Ephedrine infusion was maintained with respect to baseline systolic blood pressure throughout the operation; and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, nausea-vomiting score as well as the ephedrine doses administered were recorded.
Results: Total preoperative ephedrine requirement of the groups were established to be 26.07 +/- 16.39 mg in Group I, 20.72 +/- 12.95 mg in Group II and 16.80 +/- 9.40 mg in Group III. Total ephedrine used was observed to be significantly lower in Group III than in it was in Group I (p&lt;0.05).  Group I was also established with a lower mean fetal umbilical venous pH value than that observed in Group III (p&lt;0.05).
Conclusion: We conclude that the addition of 25 microgram fentanyl to levobupivacaine, when compared with the administration of levobupivacaine alone, decreases the ephedrine requirement and produces better maternal and newborn hemodynamic stability in elective cesarean section cases administered with spinal anesthesia.</summary>
