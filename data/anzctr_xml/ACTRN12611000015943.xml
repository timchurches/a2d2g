  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As the major immune cell types involved in initiating and sustaining the ITP disease are antigent presenting cells (APC), B cells and T cells (Chong 2009, Kuwana 2009), it is reasonable to expect better long-term response rates by using drugs targeting all three cell types: namely an anti-B cell agent (rituximab), an anti-APC drug (high dose dexamethasone) and an anti-T cell treatment (cyclosporine).

By combining these drugs together over a short period of time (4 weeks), we hope to maximise the efficacy while minimising anticipated toxicities associated with longer-term use of these drugs.</summary>
