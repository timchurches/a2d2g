  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overview of the Two Co-primary Outcomes - First co-primary outcome was defined as the first event among stroke, systemic arterial embolism, Myocardial Infarctions [MI], or cardiovascular death.
Second co-primary outcome was defined as the first event among unscheduled cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause.
Both co-primary outcomes were determined based on the central review and adjudication by a blinded Adjudication Committee of all reported deaths (from any cause), MI, systemic arterial embolisms, strokes, Transient Ischemic Attacks [TIA], Heart Failure hospitalization and unplanned hospitalisations for cardiovascular cause.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Co-primary Outcome (Cumulative Incidence Function) - Time to first co-primary outcome was defined as the time from randomization to the first event among stroke, systemic arterial embolism, MI or cardiovascular death.
Cumulative incidence function in each treatment group was calculated using non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimate.
95% confidence interval was computed at each time-point using Greenwood's variance estimation.</outcome>

    <summary>Primary Objective:

        -  Demonstrate the efficacy of Dronedarone in preventing major cardiovascular events
           (stroke, systemic arterial embolism, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) or
           unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause in patients with
           permanent Atrial Fibrillation [AF] and additional risk factors

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Demonstrate the efficacy of Dronedarone in preventing cardiovascular death

      This was an event-driven study where a common study end date [CSED] was to be determined by
      Steering Committee based on the number of events (stroke, systemic arterial embolism,
      myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death).</summary>
