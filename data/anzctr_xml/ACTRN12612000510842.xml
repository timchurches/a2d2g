  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Singapore Aphasia test (SGAT) is a locally developed diagnostic assessment of language function. It has an English and a Mandarin verson. The English SGAT comprises 45 subtests while the Mandarin SGAT comprises 47 subtests. The number of subtests is higher in the Mandarin SGAT as it includes two further subtests namly the Tone perception and Tone production subtests. Together, the subtests evaluate language performance across the following areas: spontaneous speech, recall/memory, perception skills, auditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading comprehension and written expression.

Participant responses will be administered one-on-one by speech-language therapists who are proficient in English and Mandarin. Test performance will be scored on-line and will be video-recorded for reliability analysis. In cases where the participant is bilingual in English and Mandarin, both language versions of the SGAT will be administered. For such cases, the two tests will be administered with an interval of two weeks between testing. Language testing is expected to last approximately 1-2hours. SGAT will be re-administered after 6 months .</interventions>
    <comparator>Short form of Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination will be administered only for randomly selected English-speaking participants who underwent testing using the SGAT-English. This is an English test of aphasia which has been chosen to further validate the SGAT against an establised and normed aphasia test. BDAE will be administered one-on-one by speech-language therapists who are proficient in English. Testing is not exepected to exceed 2 hours each. BDAE will be adminstered at baseline and again after 6-months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study investigates the degree and pattern of language rcovery in English and Mandarin Singaporeans with aphasia following stroke. It also aims to investigate the factors that influence the degree of language impairment and recovery. In order to assess for aphasia and its severity, we need to validate the locally developed Singapore Aphasia Test with the local population.</summary>
