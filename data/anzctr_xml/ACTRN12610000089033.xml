  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two site Phacotrabeculectomy; one site is the phaco incision the other site is the trabeculectomy inision, and at the end of the surgery, the removed anterior lens capsule was placed under the scleral flap in Group I, and Mitomycin C in Group II is applied under the scleral flap intra operatively in order to reduce the fibrosis and thus enhancing success rate of filteration surgery. the surgical procedure is about one hour duration</interventions>
    <comparator>Group II is the comparator in which they receive Mitomycin C (MMC) (an antimitotic drug). Mitomycin C (MMC) is applied topicaly during surgery under the scleral flap to reduce fibrosis of the filtering bleb. the appliction was done as following 5 sponges soaked with MMC 0.4% were applied, under the conjunctiva nasal, temporal as well as posterior to the intended filtration site, under and above the sclera flap. The sponges were left in place for 3 minutes and removed on a first in, first out order. The site of sponges was then irrigated with 50 ml of Ringers lactate from the irrigating bottle attached to the phaco machine.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: Efficacy of using the anterior lens capsule removed during combined Phacotrabeculectomy.
Methods: Two site Phacotrabeculectomy and at the end of the surgery, the removed anterior lens was placed under the scleral flap in Group I, and Mitomycin C in Group II.
Results: No significant difference between the IOP, anti glaucoma medications or visual acuity. No complications were related to anterior lens capsule. 
Conclusion: Anterior lens capsule is effective in phacotrabeculectomies</summary>
