  <interventions>
    <interventions>A pilot study to investigate the safety and tolerability of a vaginal ointment that does not yet have any active ingredient.  The study is being conducted to make sure it is a comfortable ointment to use in the vagina.  

The ointment will be self-administered into the vagina, once daily for 21 days and a questionnaire will be used about its effects.   Full instructions will be given as to its application.  Participants will also be asked to provide a urine sample and vaginal swabs at various intervals throughout the study.  The ointment will be given to participants to take home in pre-filled applicators along with the study questionnaires.  A diary will be completed by each participant and each participant will sign upon each administration.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with drugs of abuse testing.  The intervention for this study is the ointment formulation of oleic acid.

    <statisticalmethods>This is an interventional study assessing the safety and tolerability involving 12 participants with the aim of having at least 10 participants complete.  No statistical methods have been employed in the  calculation of the sample size.

Demographic parameters will be summarised descriptively, as well as treatment-emergent AEs by treatment in the safety population.  No inferential statistical analysis is planned for safety data. Summary statistics will also be presented from the tabulated answers in the questionnaires.  The summary statistics will be interpreted.  No inferential statistical analysis is planned for tolerability data.</statisticalmethods>
