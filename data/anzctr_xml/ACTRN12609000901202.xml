  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each patient who meets the inclusion criteria for the study will have a blood test taken. The blood will be taken from either an existing intervenous device or from a vein in the patients arm. Blood will be taken pre surgery and then on days 0(post operative), 1, 3 and 5 we are looking at Cystatin C and Procalcitonin levels.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each patient who meets the inclusion criteria for the study will have serum Cystatin C and Procalcitonin levels measured.  Patients will then be observed for post-operative adverse outcomes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the study is to determine the relationship between serum levels of Cystatin C (measured at baseline,day 3 and day 5), and the occurrence of Acute Kidney Injury (as defined by the Risk of renal dysfunction, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function and End-stage kidney disease criteria) following high risk cardiac surgery. Also determine the relationship between serum blood levels of Procalcitonin and occurrence of post-operative infections.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serum measured at baseline, day 0,1, 3 and day 5.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the relationship between serum levels of Cystatin C and incidence of cardiovascular complications .</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 5 days post surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>90 day all cause mortality</outcome>
      <timepoint>from baseline to day 90</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Length of intensive care stay and hospital stay</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to end of intensive care stay and hospital stay</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the relationship between serum blood levels of Procalcitonin and occurrence of post-operative infections.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 5 days post surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the relationship between serial serum levels of Procalcitonin and the severity of inflammatory response from cardiopulmonary bypass.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 5 days post surgery</timepoint>
