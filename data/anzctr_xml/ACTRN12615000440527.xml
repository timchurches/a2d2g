  <interventions>
    <interventions>Therapeutic mammoplasty starts by excision of  the inflammatory mass with all infected tissue.  Technique of closure of the defect will be tailored according to the site of the inflammatory mass according to each quadrant is as follows:
*Inflamatory mass at the upper half of the breast will be subjected to inferior pedicle therapeutic mammoplasty technique or  round block.
*Inflamatory mass at the lower half of the breast  will be subjected to superior pedicle therapeutic mammoplasty  techniques and round block.
*Inflamatory mass at the periareolar region by Round block. 
Regarding the contralateral breast, only patient with bra size C or D (10 patients) were offered contra-lateral reduction mammoplasty for symmetry and better esthetic result. Seven patients accepted while 3patients refused the procedure. 
approximate duration of the procedure is 2 hours</interventions>
    <comparator>simple excision and direct closure. Data was collected from previous researches (Azlina AF, Ariza Z, Arni T, Hisham AN: Chronic granulomatous mastitis: Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. World J Surg 2003; 27:51518. and 	Akcan A, Akyildiz H, Deneme MA, Akgun H, Aristas Y (2006) Granulomatous lobular mastitis: a complex diagnostic and therapeutic problem. World J Surg 30(8):14031409)
Excision and  simple closure has been performed for a along time and still performed in some surgical centers.</comparator>

      <outcome>Recurrence </outcome>
      <timepoint>detected by the surgeon by clinical examination during visits in outpatients clinic at 1, 3, 6, 12,18 and 24 months. Recurrence was considered only after true-cut biopsy and histopathological confirmation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients satisfaction </outcome>
      <timepoint>by asking the patients to fill a premade questionnaire (KNUH breast reconstruction satisfaction questionnaire)  during patients visit at 6 months after surgery.  Each question was graded on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from very satisfied [5] to very dissatisfied [1]  Then, each questionnaire was divided into two groups, with a rating of satisfied for mean scores &gt;4 and dissatisfied for all other.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Early post operative complications (bleeding, early wound infection, seroma or diastasis of surgical wound) </outcome>
      <timepoint>detected by the doctor during the early post operative period and during patients visits at 14 days and one month after surgery. </timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Only patients  with histopathological confirmation of Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis will be included in the study. Patients who have breast mass exceeding 20 % and less than 50% of the breast size with failed medical treatment (non decrease of mass size, severe pain from the mass that interfere with daily activity or intolerance to corticosteroid treatment) will be included in the study and will be offered surgical treatment. We used Bra Size as  standard method  for breast size while the size of the mass will be calculated clinically and radiologicaly.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare disease affecting young females. It is difficult to diagnose as it may mimic cancer clinically and radiologicaly. There is no consensus regarding management strategy of this disease. However, corticosteroids and surgical excision are the most commonly used therapies. Simple surgical excision with direct closure may be satisfactory for small lesions. On the other hand, for big lesions it results in disfigurement of the breast which will lead to psychological effects on those young ladies. So the Aim of the study is to evaluate the use of therapeutic mammoplasty surgical techniques for management of these patients in terms of recurrence and postoperative patients' satisfaction.   </summary>
