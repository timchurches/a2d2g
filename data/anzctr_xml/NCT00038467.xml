    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease-Free Survival (DFS) at Month 36 Post-Randomization: Main Study - DFS defined as time from randomization to earliest documentation of breast cancer relapse or death from any cause. DFS at Month 36 post-randomization was defined as probability of participants alive and disease-free at 36 months after the randomization. Participants withdrawn from the study for any reason in the absence of relapse were censored at the date they were last seen. Relapse was categorized as follows: loco-regional: ipsilateral breast or axillary nodal relapse; distant: distant relapse, including supraclavicular nodes; second primary breast cancer: contralateral breast cancer, excluding ductal carcinoma in situ.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) at Month 36 Post-Randomization: Main Study - OS was defined as the duration from randomization to death (due to any cause). OS at Month 36 post-randomization was defined as probability of participants' survival at 36 months after the randomization. For participants who were alive, OS was censored at the last available assessment. Probability of OS at Month 36 post-randomization was reported using Kaplan-Meier estimates at Month 36 post-randomization based on 120-month follow-up data.</outcome>
