  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - manual or manipulative therapy
Treatment: surgery - Manual / Manipulative Therapy
Treatment: surgery - Supportive Care

Active Comparator: Group A - 1) Group A will receive 9 manipulative therapy treatments (adjustments) to one area: the hip with pre-manipulative static and post active-assisted stretch of tight hip muscles. After the last (or 9th) treatment these patients will receive general advice and recommendations on managing HOA and how to gently and safely increase general exercise.
 Based on a previous trial, Group A treatment appears superior than placebo. There will be a 3, 6 and 9 month follow up.

Active Comparator: Group B - 2) Group B will receive 9 treatments with manipulative therapy treatments (adjustments) to the entire kinetic chain (five areas): the lumbosacral, sacroiliac, hip, knee, ankle and foot joints with pre-manipulative static and post active-assisted stretch of tight hip muscles. There will be a 3, 6 and 9 month follow up.

Other: Supportive Care - Supportive Care 3) Groups A and B will receive supportive care after the 9th visit consisting of (up to a maximum of) 6 visits, PRN or as needed, until the 9 month follow up. This is to see if peak gains may be maintained (as noted in the previous trial) throughout the follow up period.
Enrolled subjects will commonly receive 2 treatments per week (occasionally, less or more than 1 to 2 treatments per week due to (College or University) semester breaks, exams, clinic closures and so forth) until 9 treatments are completed.


Treatment: surgery: manual or manipulative therapy
Active comparator will receive 9 treatments of manual or manipulative therapy to the hip (HVLA hip manipulations per protocol 1) with pre-manipulative static and post manipulative active-assisted stretch of hip muscles after each manipulation.

Treatment: surgery: Manual / Manipulative Therapy
Active comparator will receive 9 treatments of manual or manipulative therapy to the lumbosacral, sacroiliac, hip and knee, ankle and foot joints (HVLA and Grades I-IV mobilization per protocol 2) stretching and exercise.)

Treatment: surgery: Supportive Care
Supportive Care 3) Groups A and B will receive supportive care after the 9th visit consisting of (up to a maximum of) 6 visits, PRN or as needed, until the 9 month follow up. This is to see if peak gains may be maintained (as noted in the previous trial) throughout the follow up period.
Enrolled subjects will commonly receive 2 treatments per week (occasionally, less or more than 1 to 2 treatments per week due to (College or University) semester breaks, exams, clinic closures and so forth) until 9 treatments are completed.

             minutes Note: Hip x-rays will be taken in each case (after a clinical diagnosis of hip
             osteoarthritis has been made and to rule out and exclude severe pathology) to
             determine grades (0-4) Kellgren Lawrence x-ray scale. If medically necessary,
             lumbosacral pelvic x-rays will be obtained-- see exclusions below)
