  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anaesthesia will be induced with target-controlled infusion of propofol 5 Âµg / ml and remifentanil 4 ng / ml, after loss of consciousness, rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg will be injected for paralysis. After confirm of full paralysis using train of four ratio of zero(0/4) at the ulnar verve,  semi-rigid Philadelphia cervical collar (Philadelphia Cervical Collar Co., NJ, USA) will be applied in neutral position. Patients will be randomly allocated into one of two groups, to receive tracheal intubation with an Airway scope preloaded with a tracheal tube (7 mm internal diameter for women and 8 mm for men) or to receive tracheal intubation with a Videolightwand laryngoscope with a preloaded tube in the same manner. Videolight wand laryngoscope preloaded with a tracheal tube is the intervention in this trial. In both groups, after visual confirmation of vocal cords and advancement of tracheal tube into larynx, respiratory circuit will be connected and ventilation will be confirmed with capnogram and stethoscope. If intubation fails with three trials  or with trials lasting longer than 2 minutes, the collar will be detatched and then tracheal intubation with conventional laryngoscope in a sniffing position will be tried.The entire duration of the intervention will be less than 3 minutes.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesized that intubation with Videolight wand laryngoscope in a simulated difficult airway using cervical collar could bring merits compared to Airway Scope due to its slender shape.After induction of anaesthesia and neck stabilisation, intubation with Airway Scope or Videolight wand will be tried in 100 patients. Overall success rate, time and trials for successful intubation, optimisation, intubation difficulty score, vital signs, and complications will be recorded and patients morphologic factors related to the intubation time will be analysed in each group.</summary>
