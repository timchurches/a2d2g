  <interventions>
    <interventions>Low friction based exercise in combination with a home exercise programme: use of BedEx exercise mats which consist of mats which have 2 levels of friction on either side of the mats. Using the mats on the high friction sides creates a high level of stability and using the mats with the low friction sides together gives a lower level of stability. Exercises will be commenced in sitting and progressed to standing, reaching, stepping and walking exercises as the participants become familiar with the exercises and as their level of skill allows. 
The home exercise programme will consist of sitting, standing, stepping, reaching and walking activities. Participants will be asked to complete it 3 times per week. This will be completed concurrently with the 8 week trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Balance strategy training in combination with a home exercise programme. Particpants in this group will undertake balance exercises in the form of balance-strategy training. This consists of balance tasks in a variety of positions (sitting, standing, reaching, stepping, walking) using equipment such as chairs, steps, foam and balance discs. 
The home exercise programme will be the same as the intervention group and will also run concurrently with the 8 week training programme.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether an exercise programme based on low friction principles is more effective at reducing the number of falls in an elderly population compared with an exercise programme based on balance-specific strategy training. This will be measured by the completion of a falls diary on which the participants record whether they have had any falls, trips, slips or near misses on any given day during the trial. The diary will be supplied to the participants with defintions given for the adverse events. This will be compared with the number of falls, slips, trips and near misses experienced by the participants in the eight weeks prior to the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once weekly for 8 weeks prior to and during the 8 week trial</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Does training based on low friction principles reduce the fear of falling in an elderly population more effectively than balance-specific strategy training? This is measured using the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale. This scale will be administered to the participants at the start and end of the trial</outcome>
      <timepoint>Begining and end of trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Does training based on low friction principles improve balance in an elderly population more effectively than balance-specific strategy training? This will be measured by the use of the following balance tests: static standing tests, the Step Test, Lateral and Functional Reach Tests and the Timed Up and Go Test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the begining and end of the trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is an exercise programme based on low friction principles safe for elderly participants? This will be measured by the trial physiotherapists keeping a record of any adverse effects (musculoskeletal, medical) experienced during exercise sessions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weekly during the trial, ending at the 8 week point</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls are a significant cause of injury and death in the population aged over 65 years. Following
a fall, people often report they have become fearful that they will fall again and restrict their
activities in order to try to reduce their perceived risk. As a result, a previously active person
may become housebound or restrict outdoor activities to essential chores, such as General Practitioner visits.
Such behaviour does not necessarily reduce the risk of another serious fall and can lead to the
person becoming depressed, frailer and having a much higher likelihood of being admitted to
residential care.
Recent research has shown that exercise is an effective way to reduce participants risk of falls
and also to keep people on their feet and doing the activities which they enjoy. There is
uncertainty about the exact nature that the exercise component should take. Many
programmes use a combination of balance and strength-based exercises to train for better
balance. However new research has suggested that training on variable surfaces may be a
better way to develop balance skills and reduce the risk of falls.
To test this idea, this study will assign participants to two different exercise groups. Participants
will attend weekly one hour sessions of the exercise group to which they have been randomly
assigned for eight weeks. Measurements of balance, level of falls risk, fear of falling and actual
number of falls experienced will be taken prior to commencing the programme and at the end
of the eight week course. Researchers will then be able to examine whether the novel exercise
regimen is more effective than the traditional form of exercises for reducing falls and fear of
falls, and improving balance capacity. Treatment of falls-related injuries such as a broken hip is
costly not only to the health service but also to the affected person, so any preventative
strategy that enables at-risk individuals to develop higher levels of balance within an eight
week period will be welcomed by clients, clinicians and service providers alike.</summary>
