    <interventions>This trial involves the use of the oral capsules lenalidomide. In the induction phase, patients will be treated with lenalidomide 50 mg/day for 28 days, followed 2 weeks later by another cycle at the same dose. In patients with progressive disease after or during first cycle or patients failing to reduce bone marrow blast count to less than 50% of diagnosis, further two cycles with 65mg (and 75 mg/day, if not responding to 65 mg/day) lenalidomide are planned. In patients with rapidly progressive disease, dexamethasone 20 mg/m2 may be administered weekly for 2 weeks, till the patient has received at least one cycle of 75 mg/day dose. Responding patients will receive 25 mg/day lenalidomide 21 days every month till disease progression as maintenance therapy. Patients experiencing serious toxicity or disease progression will be taken off study. For patients developing a toxicity which in investigators opinion doesnt warrant discontinuation of lenalidomide, may be considered for dose de-escalation if the disease is not progressing. Objective evidence for biological activity of the strategy will be assessed using sensitive flow-based assays on bone marrow samples at baseline, at weeks 4 and 10 then 3 monthly of maintenance therapy. 
Lenalidomide will be supplied by the clinical trials pharmacy.Drug accountability and monitoring treatment adherence will be managed in part by the practise of returning containers and/or unused stock to the pharmacy. Regular hospital visits and blood test are also required.

If a response rate of &gt;20% obtained or no patient receives at least one cycle of 75 mg/day lenalidomide, to verify the safety and efficacy of the higher doses level, further patients will be enrolled to an expansion phase until a total of 14 patients have been recruited to the entire study.

For patients relapsing after allogeneic HSCT, the following schedule will be followed:  Lenalidomide will be dosed at 10mg daily for 21 of 28 days for cycle #1 (28 day cycle) and escalated to 15mg daily for 21 of 28 days for cycle #2 in the absence of treatment emergent aGvHD. Dexamethasone will be given for the first 2 cycles only, at a dose of 40mg weekly in cycle #1 and 20mg weekly in cycle #2.   Dose modification will be allowed for lenalidomide (15mg -&gt; 10mg-&gt; 5mg) and dexamethasone (40mg -&gt; 20mg -&gt; 10mg) as per standard criteria.
 Dexamethasone will be given as an oral tablet.
Study drugs must be ceased and recommencement is not permitted upon development of graft versus host disease.

This safety study may form the basis of a larger phase 2 co-operative study to determine whether maintenance therapy with lenalidomide improves survival in ALL.

    <statisticalmethods>The total patient sample size: 9. This is based on Gehan phase II trial design with minimal expected efficacy of 20% for power 0.85
Analysis plan: The data analysis for efficacy; if &lt; 20% response rate (CR +PR) it will be considered a treatment failure and there will be no further expansion of the cohort. Also haematological and non-haematological toxicity will be analysed after every 3rd patient. Further enrolment if no grade IV non haematological toxicity, except for endocrine dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbance, thrombo-embolic illness and other which in the opinion of the three investigators and Celgene are not life threatening. Further expansion will be based on efficacy (minimal RR 20%); and would recruit 4 more patients 40% RR ( 5 patients for 35% RR, 6 for 30% RR and 7 for 25% RR) in the initial 9 evaluable patients (power 0.85).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess the deliverability and efficacy of high dose lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have been diagnosed with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is unsuitable for further intensive chemotherapy. Study details All participants in this study will receive a drug called lenalidomide (Revlimid), which is administered as oral capsule. Treatment will be delivered in 28 days cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose of lenalidomide administered will potentially be twice or thrice the dose that it is approved in Australia for the treatment of other blood cancers. Lenalidomide works against the cancer via multiple mechanisms. It damages the genetic code (DNA) of cancer cells (there is no evidence to suggest that normal cells are affected the same way), dampens the pro-survival genes in cancer cells and boosts the bodys natural immune response against the cancer cells. Lenalidomide has been found to be effective in cancers such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphatic leukaemia, non Hodgkins lymphoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. However, its effectiveness is not examined exclusively in subjects with ALL. Participants will be regularly assessed throughout the duration of the trial in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of treatment. </summary>
