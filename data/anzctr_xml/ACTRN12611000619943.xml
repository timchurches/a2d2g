  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As we get older, it is difficult to eat the right amount of food and get the right nutrients every day.  When we do not get enough nutrients in our diet, this can sometimes lead to various diseases or conditions.  Fish and seafood provide some valuable nutrients including protein, zinc, iodine and vitamin D.  In particular, fish and seafood also contain fatty acids (called EPA and DHA) which may reduce the amount of inflammation in your body.  Meat products also contain protein, zinc, iron, some B vitamins and fatty acids.  Most people eat more red meat compared to fish and we do not know much about how this affects inflammation.  You cant see inflammation, but higher levels have been associated with arthritis, diabetes, eye diseases, heart disease, depression and even obesity.  We are interested in reducing these levels of inflammation in the body because this may reduce the risk for these diseases.  Many people do not eat a lot of fish, and so we want to find out whether increasing the amount of fish/seafood in our diet (to approximately 4 meals per week) will help levels of inflammation compared to people who eat a usual amount of fish/seafood (0-1 meal of fish/seafood a week) and eat a diet that is higher in red meat.</summary>
