  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women of exercise group performed muscular strengthening exercises of 60 minutes twice a week for three months. The exercise protocol consisted of warm-up, stretching, muscular strengthening of quadriceps, hamstring, calf muscle, paravertebral, and abdominal muscles as well as relaxing.
Muscular strength training started with 60% of one repetition maximum (1 RM) (2 series of 10-15 repetitions), achieving 85% until the end of the 3-month period (4 series of 6 repetitions each). 
The exercise for the pelvic floor muscles consisted of performing 10 maximal contractions of the pelvic floor muscles kept for 6-8 seconds. At the end of a series of 10 contractions were performed three rapid contractions. The interval between a contractions was 6 seconds. The series were held in four positions: lying in the lateral, sitting, all fours and standing.
The exercise protocol was administered in groups up to 10 women by a physiotherapist.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aging process involves several changes in the body, including progressive reduction in strength and muscular function and postural control. Studies have suggested that the decreased muscular strength in women over 50 years old may be related to a lack of the hormone estrogen resulting from the menopause. However, little is known about the effect of hypoestrogenism in the first years of menopause on the balance and also the effect of a strength exercise program on these women.  Therefore the study hypothesis is that the muscular strength training can promote muscle benefits, but also have a positive effect on the balance of these women, acting preventively to reduce the risk of falls.</summary>
