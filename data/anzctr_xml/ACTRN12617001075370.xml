    <interventions>Use of respiratory nursing service (RNS) and extended care paramedics (ECP's) to support home management of patients with a COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) exacerbation to reduce emergency department presentation and hospital admissions
Brief name: COPD at home
Participant education materials: All will be printed and given to the participant as an information package
*Respiratory nursing service information: RNS, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital (TQEH)
*COPD fact sheet: Central Adelaide Local Health Network (CALHN) intranet
*advance care directive, infection control-wash wipe cover, falls- medicines and balance, falls- making your home your haven: http://inside.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/Non-public+content/sa+health+intranet/ SA Health website
*depression streess anxiety, breathing techniques, eating well with lung disease, continence and lung disease: pulmonary rehabilitation education series, Department of Health, Government of South Australia
*Quality of life through patient support: http://lungfoundation.com.au/

Folder for communication between services kept at patient home and includes:
* A4 poster COPD at home phone number
* Name and demographic page
* a written COPD Action Plan (All participants will be provided a written copd action plan and an emergency pack, if they do not already have).The RNS nurse will reinforce the principles of using the physician prescribed COPD Action Plan and Emergency Pack for all participants, as recommended by current therapeutic guidelines. Where the participant does not already have a COPD action plan or emergency pack both will be obtained from the Respiratory Registrar/Physician rostered to TQEH hospital consult service. The COPD Action Plan developed by Lung Foundation Australia will be used for all participants that require one provided. All participants will receive education on the use of their inhalers in exacerbation management. Participants will also be educated on when to commence their emergency pack of prednisolone or antibiotics as per their COPD Action Plan. Having a COPD Action plan and emergency pack is a pre-requisite for participants in this study as this is the tool that is essential in both groups to facilitate exacerbation management.

Hospital switchboard instructions
South Australian Ambulance Service (SAAS), ECP: work instruction sheet-process to review participants and separation summary for RNS and GP describing review and recommendations made with participant

PROCEDURE
RNS: performs baseline assessment, reviews COPD optimisation and education. Can occur at participants residence or as an outpatient with a time period of 2 hours.
Planned contact: phone calls at 1 week and 3 months will be performed by a nurse from the RNS- to monitor healthcare utilisation, perform a respiratory phone assessment, provide phone coaching of symptom management, arrange reviews (rapid response) dependant on severity of respiratory symptoms
Final assessment at 6 months: same as baseline review with addition of semi-structured questionnaire
Unplanned contact: participants identifying change in respiratory symptoms to contact COPD at home as per number provided (TQEH switchboard). During business hours weekdays will be directed to RNS, after hours, weekends and public holidays will be transferred to SAAS ECP's. If no answer within 15mins participant will be instructed to utilise GP, locum GP, emergency department or SAAS emergency '000'

If participant contacts RNS a respiratory phone assessment will occur including use of Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) and COPD assessment test (CAT). RNS triage will occur and follow up actions will be based on the assessment
* early change in symptoms identified: use of action plan, GP, follow up phone review
* moderate to severe symptoms identified: rapid response review by RNS by outpatient or home visit, or may recommend contacting SAAS on '000'. If participant remains home will be supported to do so by RNS and in negotiation with GP.

SAAS: ECPs will follow their work instruction for participants. Phone calls will be triaged by the ECP coordinator who will determine the deployment of ECP or ambulance response (priority 2) based on severity of participant symptoms.
Phone assessment: not an emergency: ECP to review at participant residence for assessment and management of symptoms. If safe to stay home ECp will advise RNS and GP by email and/or facsimile of the visit, if safe to remain home and recommendations provided to participant , for follow up review by RNS and/or GP
If ECP assessment determines need to present to the emergency department SAAS ECP will coordinate. ECP will notify RNS only via email, GP will receive separation summary of presentation on discharge as per standard practice.

Participants will  be enrolled for a 6 month period and may access COPD at home as often as required.

Feasibility outcomes will be collected via documentation from nursing and SAAS records following phone calls made to and from patients during the intervention period.

    <statisticalmethods>As is a feasibility trial we have estimated that 20 subjects in each arm (40 in total) will be acceptable for recruitment, as per other similar published studies conducted in COPD cohorts. 

Data analysis plan: all statistical analysis will be done via IBM SPSS 20 or STATA14 unless otherwise indicated.
1. Hospital utilisation and limited efficacy: The potential influence of the intervention on ED presentation and hospital admission rate will be explored using Poisson Regression. The potential effect of the intervention on continuous outcome data (e.g. MMRC, BAI &amp; BDI scores) will be assessed via independent samples t-tests or their non-parametric counterparts (e.g. Mann-Whitney U) and categorical data by using Chi² or Fishers Exact test. 
2. Cost effectiveness: Costs and outcomes will be discounted at 5% per annum according to current PBAC guidelines (Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing 2002). Analyses will report the discounted cost per life year gained ($/LY) and the discounted cost per quality adjusted life year gained ($/QALY) at trial end and extrapolated over a 15 year time horizon. One-way sensitivity analysis will be performed for key parameters and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted modelling (10,000 simulations) the distribution of individual parameters based on the patient level data leading to cost effectiveness acceptability curves, which report the probability that a particular intervention is cost-effective given a particular willingness to pay.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A large proportion of ED presentations and hospital admissions are preventable as they result from poor self-management skills and subsequently poor judgement of the severity of the manifesting symptoms. Furthermore, some admissions are due to other non-COPD related factors such as loneliness or misattribution of symptoms belonging to other diseases (e.g. anxiety or depression). A pre-triage conducted by trained health professionals who are experienced in detecting the severity of COPD exacerbations has the potential to reduce the number of unnecessary ED presentations. 

Current best practice management of an exacerbation or flare-up of COPD symptoms is with the use of a written COPD Action Plan and Emergency Pack of medications for early recognition and treatment of symptoms, however evidence demonstrates a minimal reduction in healthcare utilisation or health-related quality of life (Walters, Turnock et al. 2010). An action plan with ongoing support by a case-manager may decrease the impact of exacerbations in health status (Trappenburg, Monninkhof et al. 2011). 

Therefore this will be a randomised controlled feasibilty trial with the proposed intervention being the addition of 24-hour exacerbation support using existing specialised RNS during business hours and after-hours with SAAS ECPs. Trained health professionals will assess the patients disease status to determine if the patient could be managed at home or requires presentation to a hospital emergency department. Outcomes will review the feasibilty of the study design, hospital utilisation, cost-effectiveness and outcomes of patient self-assessment questionnaires and a semi-structured interview.
