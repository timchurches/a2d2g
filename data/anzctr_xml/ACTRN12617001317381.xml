  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overview &amp; Rationale: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a serious and highly prevalent (5.9%) psychiatric disorder. BPD sufferers experience severe emotional instability, social and occupational dysfunction, and engage in chronic self-mutilation and suicidal behaviours, with associated high levels of mortality, morbidity, and health service use. BPD patients are a complex group that are challenging to treat. Current psychological treatments are expensive and difficult for BPD patients to access, and there is currently no clearly designated pharmacotherapy. Underpinned by psychosocial causes, the pathogenesis of BPD is only now beginning to be understood. Childhood trauma is reported in most patients (&gt;80%) and is linked to abnormalities in the development of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal stress axis and, consequently, abnormalities in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. Both neuroendocrine axes have been reported as abnormal in BPD, indicating the neuroendocrine system as a potential therapeutic target for BPD symptoms. Significantly, cyclical fluctuations in ovarian hormones affect emotional and cognitive behaviours relevant to BPD. We propose to conduct a 12 week, double blind, placebo controlled three arm trial of i.) 100mcg estradiol patch vs ii) 100mg micronized progesterone vs iii.) placebo (in addition to treatment as usual), in a total of 60 women with BPD (20 per arm). 
Primary Aim: To determine if the addition of estradiol or progesterone will lead to a significant improvement in clinical symptoms of BPD, as defined by The Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI-IV), when compared to placebo. 
Primary Hypothesis: The addition of estradiol and/or progesterone will lead to a significant improvement in clinical symptoms of BPD, defined as a decrease of more than or equal to 11.7 points on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI-IV), compared to placebo.
