Exercise routine during week 11: Monday Friday - Squat, Bench Press and Deadlifts (5 sets, 5 repetition using maximal intended velocity, 180 rest, 40-60% 1RM). Monday - Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, Pull Ups, Dips, Bent Over Row, Dumbbell Shoulder Press, Barbell Curl, Skull Crushers (1 sets per exercise, 3-5RM, &gt;90%1RM, 240sec rest between sets). Exercise routine during week 12: Monday - Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, Pull Ups, Dips, Bent Over Row, Dumbbell Shoulder Press, Barbell Curl, Skull Crushers (1 sets per exercise, 3-5RM, &gt;90%1RM, 240sec rest between sets). Wednesday - Squat, Bench Press and Deadlifts (5 sets, 5 repetition using maximal intended velocity, 180 rest, 40-60% 1RM). Friday exercise routine: Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift 1RM test, 3 Maximal attempts, 1RM load with 5min ret between sets. 

Exercise sessions will be conducted individually, with each subject supervised by a research group member and will last 1-1.5h depending of the routine.  Adherence will be monitored by register of attendance at scheduled sessions. Phone calls and text messages will be made to contact subjects that do not attend exercise sessions at scheduled times. If that is the case, the session will be re-schedule to another time on the same day. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This will be a double-blind randomized trial. The participants will be supplemented with one of two different nutritional supplements and be submitted to resistance exercise training for 12 weeks. Participants will consume Whey Protein (25g) + Leucine (1.5g) or Whey protein (25g) + HMB (1.5g) twice a day.

The primary purpose of this study is to:
1) Accurately evaluate the effect of Whey+HMB relative to Whey+Leucine in regards to muscle strength and size adaptation following resistance exercise training

The secondary purpose of this study is to:
1) Quantitative evaluation the potential effect of HMB supplementation with resistance exercise on muscle power, total body mass, body fat mass, blood biochemistry, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area, as well as qualitative soreness/recovery status

Hypothesis
1) We believe both groups will present the same changes during the training protocol. </summary>
