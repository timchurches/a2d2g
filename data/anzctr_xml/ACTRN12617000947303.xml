  <interventions>
    <interventions>Current standard of care in breast screening is bilateral 2-view (MLO and CC) digital mammography (2D-mammography). In this trial, participants will have an opportunity to have digital breast tomosynthesis ((3D- mammography) acquisition from which 2D-mammography images are also reconstructed (synthetic 2D), in place of standard 2D-mammography.  Tomosynthesis screening will consist of bilateral 2-view (MLO and CC) 3D-mammography acquisitions, performed by a radiographer, The procedure is similar to that for 2D-mammography (except that 3D-acquisitions will replace 2D-acquisitions) and is usually completed in 15-20 minutes. 
All aspects of screening, reading and assessment, and any required monitoring or follow-up, will be based on standard screening protocols and quality assurance processes for BreastScreen Victoria (Australia). Standard BreastScreen program double-reading practice (two independent readings to interpret each screen) will be followed; disagreement between readers will use a third reader as currently practiced at BreastScreen. </interventions>

    <designfeatures>Women routinely invited to have their screening mammogram through standard BreastScreen Victoria process at Maroondah BreastScreen will receive an information flyer advising them of this study. Women will be advised that they will receive tomosynthesis (synthetic 2D/3D-mammography) or standard 2D-mammography, and will be given the option to opt-out of the study (and will receive standard 2D-mammography if they opt out). There are two mammography units that operate at the Maroondah service, both units can perform 2D screens however only one unit can perform 3D acquisitions. If the woman consents to participating, she will then receive either 2D or 3D acquisition, this being by chance of which mammography unit is available when they are taken into the screening procedure.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size (5,000 women) was chosen because it would enable feasibility of implementing the study and allows an estimation of screen-detection measures especially for cancer detection rate given that breast cancer is not a frequent outcome. Using data on screening outcomes from BreastScreen Victoria, and the range of incremental cancer detection attributed to tomosynthesis screening in published studies, we estimate that tomosynthesis would detect approximately 9.0 cancer per 1,000 screens; hence an estimate based on a sample size of 5,000 screens would have a standard error of approximately 1.3 per 1,000 screens. 

Primary analyses will examine the following: 
-Cancer detection measures: the number of detected cancers will be reported, and the cancer detection rate (per 1,000 screens) will be estimated with 95% CI. 
-Recall data: the number of recalls will be calculated as a proportion of the total number of screened women; the number of recalled women shown not to have cancer at assessment (false recalls) will be reported as a proportion of the total screened (minus those shown to have cancer) to estimate the false-positive recall percentage with 95% CI.

Secondary outcome measures will also be reported:
-Participation rates for the trial
-Descriptive data on the characteristics of breast cancers (size, histology, grade, node status, and biomarkers) detected in the study participants
-Data on assessment procedures and outcomes
 -Quantitative measures of average radiation metrics: estimation of the breast mean glandular dose (mGy) </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will assess the feasibility and the outcomes of using digital breast tomosynthesis (3D-mammography) for routine breast screening.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a woman aged 40 years or above and are attending a BreastScreen service at Maroondah BreastScreen.

Study details
Women who attend for routine breast screening will have an opportunity to have tomosynthesis screening (3D-mammography acquisition with synthetic 2D-mammography) in place of standard 2D-mammography, those declining to participate will have standard 2D-mammography. 3D mammography screening involves having x-rays of both breasts (taken as two views of each breast, with the breast transiently compressed similarly to conventional 2D mammograms). There are two mammography units that operate at the Maroondah service, both units can perform 2D screens however only one unit can perform 3D acquisitions. If the woman consents to participating, she will then receive either 2D or 3D acquisition, this being by chance of which mammography unit is available when they are taken into the screening procedure.

All other aspects of screening, reading and assessment, and any required follow-up, will be based on standard BreastScreen protocols and quality assurance processes.

Screening detection measures and feasibility of using 3D mammography will be assessed. It is hoped that this pilot feasibility study will inform planning of future larger studies using 3D mammography or further evaluation in BreastScreen Australia.</summary>
