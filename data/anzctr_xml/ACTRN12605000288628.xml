  <interventions>
    <interventions>The active treatment was 2.4g Red Yeast Rice taken orally.  The placebo was made up of the same excipient base as the active treatment and was indistinguishable  in size, shape and taste to the active treatment and was taken orally.  
Stage 1 (12 weeks)was a three arm study as follows: Arm 1: participants taking 2 active capsules with a meal in the morning and 2 active capsules with a meal at night.
Arm 2: participants taking 2 placebo capsules with a meal in the morning and 2 active capsules with a meal at night
Arm 3:  participants taking 2 placebo capsules with a meal in the morning and 2 placebo capsules with a meal at night.  
Stage 2: Particpants subsequently took 2 active tablets in the morning and two active tablets at night for 40 weeks.  Stage3: Participants took 2 active capsules at night and 2 active capsules in the morning for 48 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This stage is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, three arm parallel study. The study will compare baseline lipid levels with post-treatment levels for the treatment and placebo groups over a 12-week period. Interim analyses of the data will be conducted at the completion of stage 1, and subjects will be issued with the active medication at the end of week 12. The analysis of data will continue for 8 weeks.  Stage 2 continued as an open label trial for 40 weeks and stage 3 continued as an open label trial for a further 48 weeks.</summary>
