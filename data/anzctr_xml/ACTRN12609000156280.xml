  <interventions>
    <interventions>Resilience Training: stress inoculation techniques &amp; serial approximation to fear situations (1 session 120 minutes; 2nd session 30 minutes; 3rd session 30 minutes), drug and alcohol counselling (1 session 30 minutes). Delivered during the recruit basic training over 3 months. Booklet provided during intervention and again 3 months after having left the academy. Content of booklet is a summary of material presented during intervention. This intervention is in addition to the normal training of recruits.</interventions>
    <comparator>Information Giving: Recruits trained in types of critical incidents, preserving evidence and the crime scene, dealing with the victims' family and friends, and expectations of victims of crime (including being taken through victims' charter &amp; victims' rights) (1 session 120 minutes; 2nd session 30 minutes; 3rd session 30 minutes). Recruits also trained on myths regarding sexual offenders and their treatment (1 session 30 minutes). Delivered during the recruit basic training over 3 months. Booklet provided during intervention and again 3 months after having left the academy. Content of booklet is a summary of material presented during control intervention. This control condition presents this information to the recruits to control for therapist effects and time dosage effects. It is in addition to the normal training of recruits. It is billed as a resilience protocol yet has no hypothesised active resilience elements. It is a placebo - although may have beneficial effects on how the recruits treat victims of crime and their approach to sex offenders.</comparator>

    <concealment>Individuals were allocated to police cohorts by police head quarters who were unaware of treatment conditions of the cohorts (were actually unaware of the study).</concealment>
    <sequence>Individual recruits enrolled into next available cohort for entry into Police Academy; Cohorts received treatment of control based upon initial random allocation (coin flip) followed by stratifying (3 in treatment and then 3 in control). Stops cross pollination of interventions by recruits.
Initial random followed by sequencing in groups of three to alternative interventions. This is necessary as cohorts speak to each other and three at a time allows for those cohorts to exit the academy.</sequence>
