  <interventions>
    <interventions>Daily S. salivarius probiotic 10^8 cfu's per lozenge.  One lozenge daily for 3 school terms during term time.  Approx 145 school days.  It is not possible to be precise because schools have flexibility over term length and there are 11 schools involved.  Lozenges will be administered each day by a school staff member and a record of administration will be kept</interventions>
