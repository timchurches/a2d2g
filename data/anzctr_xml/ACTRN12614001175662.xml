  <interventions>
    <interventions>An external ventricular drain (EVD) can be inserted by a neurosurgeon into the fluid-filled ventricles within the brain for the management of hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension, and for intracranial pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury. After the hydrocephalus or intracranial hypertension has resolved (usually within 2 weeks) the EVD can be removed or replaced. Timing of EVD removal is determined by the treating neurosurgical and intensive care teams. 

Currently there are both standard, and antibiotic- (rifampicin and clindamycin) impregnated (Bactiseal) catheters in use, without clear evidence of benefit. This trial will compare antibiotic-impregnated EVDs to standard silicon EVDs.</interventions>

Time and date of EVD removal will be recorded in patient hospital records, from which this outcome will be assessed.

    <concealment>Eligible patients will be enrolled in the operating theatre prior to external ventricular drain (EVD) insertion. Sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque randomization envelopes will be placed in the operating theatre and will be opened by the neurosurgeon while the patient is being prepared for the procedure. The scrub nurses will then provide the EVD as per the randomly allocated treatment arm for the surgeon to insert. In rare cases EVD insertion may occur in the intensive care unit (ICU), in which case the next envelope will be opened and treatment allocation identified prior to transfer of appropriate equipment to the ICU.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The baseline incidence of ventriculitis is estimated to be 9%. Our sample size is based on an absolute decrease of 8%, to 1%. This effect size would be highly clinically relevant (number needed to treat [NNT] to prevent one case of ventriculitis = 13). This relative decrease is equivalent to or less than observed in previous trials. With a type 1 error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.2 (power 80%), the required number is 140 patients per group, or 280 patients in total. 

This study will be analysed on an intention to treat basis. All analyses will be undertaken by the Chief Investigator with the aide of a biostatistician. Baseline comparisons will be performed using chi-square tests for equal proportion, student t-tests for continuous normally distributed variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests otherwise. The primary outcome will be analysed using a chi-square test with results reported as frequencies and percentages per arm. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>External ventricular drain (EVD) catheters are integral to the management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). EVDs are routinely used in the management of severe TBI, and are recommended by international consensus guidelines. These catheters monitor and can help to lower the pressure within the brain that is often raised as a result of the brain injury. 
This process is not without risks. The EVD catheter provides a pathway between the brain and the external environment, which can become colonised by bacteria and lead to infection in the brain, called 'meningitis' or 'ventriculitis'. This infection may worsen brain damage, produce seizures, and increase length of stay in the hospital. 
One potential way of reducing this risk of EVD-associated infection is to use antibiotic-impregnated catheters. These EVDs release antibiotics over time, with the aim of preventing bacteria from contaminating the drains. Despite previous research it is still unclear if there is benefit to using these drains, which are considerably more expensive than the standard EVDs. The aim of this project is to determine if antibiotic-impregnated EVDs reduce the rates of infection in patients with TBI. 
In this study, patients with TBI who are planned for EVD insertion will have a 50:50 chance (like flipping a coin) to receive either a standard or antibiotic-impregnated EVD. After insertion, patients will be monitored until the EVD is removed (generally within 10 days following injury) to see if they develop catheter-associated infection. Results will then be compared to see if there is a difference between each group. </summary>
