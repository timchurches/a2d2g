  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a crossover study with 2 treatment:
A. placebo taken orally 3 times a day.
B. 30 escalating to 60mg IPX159 taken orally 3 times a day.
Patients will be randomised and will have each treatment for 3 weeks. Patients will be exposed to treatment for 3 weeks over a 7-week period. The wash-out period between the 2 treatment arms is 1 week. During the treatment period, Patients will take 1 tablet 3 times a day for the first 2 days, then at day 3, the dose is increased to 2 tablets 3 times a day. If patients can not tolerate the dose increase, they can decrease the dose back down to 1 tablet 3 times a day.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Polysomnography will be performed to determine the reduction in periodic limb movements and the improvement in sleep quality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed at baseline, and study days 21 and 49, being the end of each treatment period.</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy will be assessed using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Questionnaire (IRLSSG)</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed at Study days 21 and 49, being the end of each 3 week treatment period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be performed to measure pain in limbs due to immobility.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Actigraphy will be performed to look at limb movements. This is measured by the use of a 'actimeter' which patients will wear on each ankle at night.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this Study is to find out if a new medication can help people that suffer from Restless Leg Syndrome. Over the course of 7 weeks, several assessments will be made to see how a person with restless leg syndrome sleeps and whether or not this medication can reduce their discomfort and therefore improve their quality of life.</summary>
