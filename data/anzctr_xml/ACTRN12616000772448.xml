  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised, multi-centre, open label phase 3 trial, with the primary objective to determine whether the addition of ixazomib to thalidomide and low dose dexamethasone maintenance therapy post-ASCT for MM patients improves progression free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS). 

Patients with symptomatic MM who are transplant eligibile will be registered prior to undergoing ASCT. Patients who have achieved clinical and haematologic recovery following ASCT will initiate screening for study eligibility no earlier than 75 days following ASCT, complete screening within 15 days, and be randomised no later than 115 days after ASCT. 

Patients are randomised 1:1 to receive either: 
Arm 1 (Control)- 12 cycles of thalidomide (100mg/day- oral tablet), dexamethasone (40mg/week- oral tablet); or 
Arm 2 (Experimental): 12 cycles of thalidomide (100mg/day- oral tablet), dexamethasone (40mg/week-oral tablet), plus ixazomib therapy (4mg, on day 1, day 8, and day15 of each cycle- oral capsule);
for a maximum of 12 months.

A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days. Cycle 13 is the time-point at the end of consolidation treatment (cycles 1-12)

The study drugs will be administered or dispensed only to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or identified sub-investigator(s). The appropriate study personnel will maintain records of study drug receipt and dispensing.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether the addition of ixazomib to thalidomide and low dose dexamethasone consolidation therapy post-ASCT for MM patients, improves progression free survival (PFS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Progression free survival (PFS) is measured from the date of randomisation until the earliest date of relapse, progression, or death from any cause.  Patients who have not relapsed, progressed or died by the study close-out date will have their PFS censored at the study close-out date for PFS, unless they are deemed lost to follow up before that date, in which case their PFS will be censored at the date that they were last known to be alive and progression-free.  The study close-out date for PFS is the earliest of the last dates of disease assessment for patients who are alive, progression-free and on-study.  Missing disease assessments will be handled as follows: if disease progression or death is documented after one single missing assessment, the actual event date of the progression or death will be used for the PFS date.  If disease progression is documented after two or more missing assessments, the PFS time of these patients will be censored at the date of the last assessment as per the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria for MM. 

Disease outcome measures are based on high vs standard risk disease (as defined by Revised International Staging System R-ISS for Multiple Myeloma) and as per the IMWG response criteria for MM.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether the addition of ixazomib to thalidomide and low dose dexamethasone improves overall survival (OS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed for OS (vital status) monthly during consolidation treatment, then cycle 13 onwards.  OS is measured from the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause.  Patients who are not known to have died by the study close-out date will have their OS censored at the study close-out date for OS unless they are deemed lost to follow-up before that date, in which case their OS will be censored at the date they were last known to be alive.  The study close-out date for OS is the earliest of the last dates of assessment of vital status for patients remaining on the study.

    <summary>PURPOSE
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of the addition of ixazomib and low dose dexamethasone maintenance therapy for transplant-eligible multiple myeloma (MM) patients who are undergoing single autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as part of front-line therapy.

WHO IS IT FOR? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years, have been diagnosed with symptomatic MM as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, are eligible for front-line melphalan conditioned autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), and do not have central nervous system involvement with the disease (MM).

STUDY DETAILS
Enrolled participants who have achieved clinical and haematological recovery following ASCT will undergo screening for study eligibility no earlier than 75 days following ASCT, complete screening within 15 days, and be randomised into treatment arms no later than 115 days after ASCT.

Participants will then be randomised 1:1 to the control arm (thalidomide + dexamethasone), or the experimental arm (thalidomide + dexamethasone + ixazomib), for a maximum of 12 months or until the disease progresses, whichever occurs first.

Outcomes
It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide information on:
1.	Whether the addition of ixazomib to standard maintenance therapy will improve progression free survival in multiple myeloma patients who have undergone ASCT as part of front-line therapy; and
2.	Provide information on the safety and efficacy of ixazomib addition to standard maintenance therapy.
