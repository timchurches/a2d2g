    <interventions>Odontocide (calcium hydroxide and ibuprofen) paste.
Dose of approximately 0.5mL (20% calcium hydroxide and 7% ibuprofen) will be placed once, by the treating clinician inside the root canal(s) of the treated tooth at the end of the first treatment appointment. Overall duration will be between 4 and 14 days, when it will be removed from the root canal to finish the treatment.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Interappointment pain.
A visual analogue scale (VAS) will be used for the patient to report the level of pain (if any) they are experiencing at the respective time point. The patient will make one mark along the 10cm line indicating the level of pain they feel.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised controlled trial will be conducted on patients undergoing endodontic treatment in the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne. Two medicaments, placed inside the root canals of teeth, will be compared: Calcipulpe (calcium hydroxide paste) and Odontocide (calcium hydroxide and ibuprofen paste). Following treatment, patients will be required to record pain scores on a Visual Analogue Scale corresponding to specified times prior to and following treatment. If the amount of pain following treatment is severe enough, requiring the patient to take oral analgesics (rescue analgesia), then details regarding further drug administration will be recorded by the patient.</summary>
