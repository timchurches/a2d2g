  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist of a web-based sustainability support system for maintaining best-practice alcohol management practices.

The web-based intervention will include the following evidence-based strategies:
1. Club champion  Telephone contacts at the start of each season will be conducted between research staff and club representatives to identify an individual in the club with positional or personal authority (preferably a member of the club executive committee) who has the appropriate skills and experience and is motivated to act as the project champion. Club champions will primarily engage with the web-based program on behalf of the club and co-ordinate activity within the club to ensure the sustainability of the clubs alcohol management practices. The program will guide the champion to complete key project sustainability activities each year.
2. Executive support  the web-based program will encourage the club representative to re-affirm the clubs
commitment to sustaining the clubs alcohol management practices via endorsement of an alcohol management policy and communicating club expectations regarding alcohol management to members.
3. Training  The web-based program will provide a series of on-line training modules. The number and length of training modules will be determined following pilot testing. 
4. Tools and resources  The web-based intervention will provide printable instructional materials, sample policies, planning templates, and self- assessment forms to allow self-monitoring of maintenance of alcohol management practices.
5. Systems and prompts  The web-based program will utilise electronic reminders (e.g. text messaging and emails) to prompt key sustainability task completion each year.
6. Communication and marketing- The project champion will be encouraged via the web-based system to send electronic newsletters to club members incorporating information regarding responsible alcohol practices at the club.

The intervention will be implemented for two years between baseline data collection (and randomisation) and post-intervention data collection. 

Intervention adherence will be monitored through reports generated through the web-based software, which will monitor training completion, etc. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control group clubs will not receive access to the web-based program or any additional or alternative support during the trial period. These clubs will receive the usual  support provided to clubs accredited as Level 3 clubs with the Australian Drug Foundation's Good Sports program. This support typically consists of one occasion of either phone of face-to-face contact from a Project Officer per year. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A list of football clubs that are within the study area (Victoria or Hunter New England region of New South Wales) and are accredited at Level 3 with the Australian Drug Foundation's Good Sports Program will be provided to the study team. A representative (eg club president) from these clubs will be sent a study information sheet and one week later contacted and asked to undertake a telephone interview. During the interview the study will be explained and the club will be screened for eligibility and invited to participate in the trial. 

The alcohol management practices of consenting clubs will be observed during a match day in order to finalise eligibility assessment and collect baseline data.

Following this assessment, eligible clubs will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control condition by an independent statistician who does not have access to baseline data, and is not involved in intervention delivery, data collection or analysis.</concealment>
    <sequence>Clubs will be allocated (using a Microsoft Excel random-number generator) to intervention or control conditions using simple randomisation in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by the state of Australia in which they are located, football code and club size.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A total of 120 sports clubs will be recruited. The primary trial outcome will be assessed by examining group differences at follow-up in the prevalence of clubs meeting 80% of alcohol management practices using Chi-square tests under an intention to treat approach. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to test a range of assumptions for missing data at follow-up.

Assuming at follow-up that 70% of clubs in the control group have maintained the required alcohol management practices (that is, the prevalence in the control group falls from 100% at baseline to 70% at follow-up), a sample size of 60 clubs per group will be sufficient to detect an absolute difference of 20% between groups at followup (which assumes that the prevalence in the intervention group falls from 100% at baseline to 90% at follow-up) with 80% power and alpha of 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Research Team recently conducted a randomised controlled trial demonstrating that a capacity building intervention (Good Sports) was effective in increasing compliance of licensed community football clubs with liquor licensing laws, and reducing excessive alcohol consumption by club members. If the benefits of such interventions are to be ongoing, the changes adopted by sporting clubs need to be sustained over time. Research that describes the sustainability of health promoting policies and practices in community settings generally, and in sports clubs specifically, is limited. The proposed research will be the first randomised trial investigating the effectiveness of web-based intervention in sustaining best-practice alcohol management practices by community sport clubs.</summary>
