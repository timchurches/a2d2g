  <interventions>
    <interventions>In addition to normal training participants will receive following balance exercises:

1. Star exercise - 
First  Tapes are placed on the ground creating the star figure. 
Second - Place your right foot in the middle of the tape and the left foot is the "tapper"
Third - While maintaining your weight on the right foot, reach as far as possible with the left in all directions
Forth - Do the same with the left foot
The goal of the exercise is to reach as far as you can without losing form or balance.  

2. Sitting on the Swiss ball
Lifting left upper limb with right lower limb and right upper limb with left lower limb sitting on the swiss ball in alternate manner.

3. Rolling the ball around the sensory disk:
Starting position: the subject stands with one lower limb on the disk, the second leg is set in abduction (20-30 degrees),  the ball is under the foot, the hands resting on the thighs, gaze directed ahead, back straight. 
Performing the exercise: the subject slowly rolls the ball around the disk with the lower limb the foot of which is on the ball. 

4. Tilting the "Domyos" balance board with the lower limbs
Starting position: the subject is in lying on his back, knees bent to 90 degrees, feet stacked on the "DOMYOS" balance board, back adhering to the ground.
Performing the exercise: the subject lifts the hips up and tilts the board with his feet forward and backward, trying to keep every position for 3 seconds, then the same exercise is performed sideways - right - left and maintaining the postion for 3 seconds.

5. OrtoStabil board - squats with the ball on the board
Starting position: the subject stands on the OrtoStabil board with his feet slightly apart, his hands holding a ball (designed for football). He holds the ball in his hands in with flexed shoulder joints to a 90 degree angle and straightened elbows.
Performing the exercise: the subject performs a series of "squats" maintaining the balance of his body, keeping the angle of 90 degrees in the joints of shoulders and elbows straight.

The participants perform all of the balance exercises listed above.
The exercises will be supervised by physiotherapist in small group session. The sessions will be twice a week for 10 weeks. Each of the exercises will be performed in 4 series of 8 repeats (interval between the series - 10 seconds). The approximate duration in total of each session is 15-20 minutes. 
The physiotherapist will monitors attendance at sessions by collecting information about participation in exercises.  </interventions>

      <outcome>The Functional Movement Screen.
The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a collection of motor tests, wherein the proper execution of each of the individual tests requires the ability to perform a movement in three dimensions. The FMS evaluates the quality of the basic locomotor pattern, and any possible limitations or asymmetries in the movement patterns performed.
