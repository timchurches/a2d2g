  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Patients implanted with a medial pivot prosthesis design, an cruciate sacrificing design characterised by high-conformity in the medial compartment (socket on the insert, as well as anterior and posterior lips to prevent femoral translation) and a flatter tibial surface on the lateral side to facilitate tibiofemoral rotation with an axis located on the medial side. Alternative designs such as cruciate-retaining (CR) do not feature medial-lateral differences in geometry and retain the posterior-cruciate ligament. Posterior stabilized knees (PS) also sacrifice the cruciate ligaments, but maintain stability through a post and cam system.

2. Each participant will be followed up for a one-hour session at a minimum follow-up of 12months post knee replacement surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Patients implanted with a cruciate-retaining (control group 1) or posterior-stabilizing (control group 2) prosthesis design. A cruciate-retaining design retains the posterior cruciate ligament, while the posterior-stabilized design sacrifices both cruciate ligaments and maintains stability with a post and cam arrangement.

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis conducted with GPower (v3.1.9) (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009) suggests that a total sample size of 66 (22 in each group; CR; PS; Evolution) is required to detect a large difference in tibial rotation between prosthesis types using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with power of 80% and alpha set at 5%. To account for any technical issues with data collection an additional 2 patients per group (10%) will be recruited for a total sample of 72.

Aim 1
The first aim of the study will be addressed by the use of two alternative techniques. The first assumes that each patient has been appropriately matched for age, gender, BMI and surgery to followup delay across each of the implant design groups. Therefore, each of the 25 patients recruited into the medial-pivot group will be compared to a matched control in the PS and CR groups. A one-way ANOVA will be performed comparing tibiofemoral rotation and muscle activation amplitude on each trio of patients (N = 25) and the proportion of significant differences calculated for each dependent variable. The alternative will be to aggregate the data within each group and compare the three groups with a one-way ANOVA. In both techniques, significant confounders identified will be included as a covariate.
Aim 2
A significant relationship between tibiofemoral motion and muscle activity will be assessed using a form of multivariate multilinear regression with self-reported questionnaires (VR-12, OKS) as dependent variables and the kinematic and electromyography measures as independent variables. The average knee biomechanics data from each partipant will be included in the model (N = 66  75) and a partial least squares regression model will be used to examine the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
