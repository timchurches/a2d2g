  <interventions>
    <interventions>The self-help workbook was entitled "Finding Your Way". This intervention consisted of several components, including: education about common psychosocial issues, relaxation and meditation (relaxation/meditation CD included), suggestions, cognitive behaviour therapy worksheets,  survivor quotes and stories, and therapeutic writing. The level of utilisation was up to participants, but was monitred via structured feedback phone calls at 1 and 2 months, and via self-report at follow-up assessments. The total duration of the study was 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Information-control: this was also entitled "Finding Your Way" and contained identical information to the workbook, but provided no suggestions, worksheets or relaxation/meditation CD. Usage of the control condition was monitored via self-report at the 3 and 6-month follow-up assessments. The overall duration of the study was 6 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the impact of breast cancer on distress and quality of life (QOL), most Australian women refuse to participate in group psychological treatments. Therefore innovative interventions are required. The current study aimed to evaluate whether an interactive self-help workbook (WB) has greater improvements than an information booklet in depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, QOL and coping for women recently diagnosed with breast cancer.</summary>
