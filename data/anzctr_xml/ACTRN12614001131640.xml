  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are undertaking a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of a twice daily protein preload (20 g whey preload mixed with 5 g guar), taken before breakfast and dinner, to test the hypothesis that glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) will be reduced by at least 0.5% compared to baseline at 12 weeks, in patients with type 2 diabetes who have relatively good glycaemic control (HbA1c less than or equal to 7.9%) on diet or metformin therapy alone. 

We will also test the secondary hypothesis that the whey preload (i) will induce slowing of gastric emptying, stimulation of incretin hormones and insulin, and reduce appetite and glycaemia after a standardised meal, and that these effects are sustained over 12 weeks; (ii) will induce greater reduction in HbA1c in subjects with more rapid gastric emptying at baseline; (iii) is not associated with weight gain, due to compensation for the increased protein load; and (iv) will reduce HbA1c independently of changes in insulin resistance, weight, or body composition.
