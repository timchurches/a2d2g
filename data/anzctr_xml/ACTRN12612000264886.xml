  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in excretion of a challenge dose of vaccine poliovirus administered 28 days after a single dose of bOPV or IPV following a challenge dose with bOPV, compared to an unvaccinated control arm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will provide the first data on mucosal immunity in children living in a community setting of Pakistan and will assess which polio vaccines are more efficient in boosting mucosal immunity, which would provide an effective barrier to subsequent excretion and community spread of poliovirus. The data from this trial will likely have programmatic implications, especially in determining whether the current age range for polio campaigns (children aged &lt;5 years) should be re-evaluated.  Additionally, the trial will compare different markers of mucosal immunity such as measurement of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels in gingival fluid or stools and ELISPOT test, with the gold standard test, which is the measurement of vaccine virus shedding after a challenge with a known dose of OPV.  Identifying new surrogate markers of mucosal immunity is important because the challenge test requires high workload and resources, and its use in the post-eradication era may not be possible.</summary>
