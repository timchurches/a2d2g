          -  Prior Therapy

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

          -  Patients must have had 2 or more prior therapeutic attempts defined as:

          -  Relapse after going into remission from re-induction for the first or subsequent
             relapse (ie: 2nd , 3rd, 4threlapse), OR

          -  Refractory disease after first or greater relapse and a re-induction attempt, OR

             attempts.
