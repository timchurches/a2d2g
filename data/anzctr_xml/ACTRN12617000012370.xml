  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients intoxicated with a stimulant, hallucinogenic or cannabinoid substance. Observed for duration of hospital stay. Blood sample at time of enrolment tested for classic and novel psychoactive substances, and their concentration, using specialised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical techniques. This is related to the clinical findings and observations, and also with what the patient believed they had taken. Patients' vital signs, symptoms, hospital interventions and length of stay parameters will be observed.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recreational drug use is becoming an increasing public health issue in our society. Methamphetamine usage in Australia has been described as an epidemic that is tearing our country apart, and has recently been the subject of a Prime Ministerial National Ice Task Force. The average purity of methamphetamine seized by police in Western Australia has increased from 10% to 75% in just six years. In addition to this, there are a huge new range of synthetic drugs entering circulation, which are collectively termed novel psychoactive substances. These include many novel stimulants and hallucinogens, such as cathinones, NBOMe type drugs, and synthetic cannabinoid receptor antagonists. There were seven unrelated deaths in Australia over the 2015-2016 summer festival season related to synthetic drug use, as publicised in the ABC Four Corners investigation Dying to Dance (February 2016).

This project is a novel study, based in the emergency department (ED), where patients suspected of being under the influence of recreational drugs have a single blood sample taken to identify the causative agent. The analysis will be undertaken by ChemCentre WA, with whom we have an established collaboration, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical techniques. Prior to analysis, the sample is permanently de-identified. We aim to identify the agent (or agents), determine its concentration, and relate it to the clinical picture and complications. We will also compare the analytic result with what the patient believed they had taken.

Where novel drugs are identified, repeat analytical work can be undertaken to aim to develop new assays and reference standards for future analysis. Samples will be stored frozen for five years to enable this work. We will be able to identify trends in recreational drug use in patients presenting to the ED, which is vitally important from a public health perspective. Should information of early interest to clinicians or the general public be identified, this would be released in the interest of public safety.</summary>

    <publicnotes>A note regarding the age of study participants - the ethics approval for the study includes enrolment of children under 18 although they are not the primary target of the study. There is not a specified minimum age. The age of 12 is nominated for ANZCTR to cover for high-school aged children enrolled, but is not an absolute cut-off. At the primary recruiting site, children over about 14 years old are sometimes seen in the adult emergency department intoxicated with drugs. The second recruiting site is a mixed adult and paediatric emergency department.</publicnotes>
