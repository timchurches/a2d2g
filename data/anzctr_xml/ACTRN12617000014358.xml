  <interventions>
    <interventions>The research will be conducted in a primary care physiotherapy clinic in the Herne Bay suburb of Auckland. Patients of the clinic who volunteer to participate in the research will be asked to attend twice within a short period of time. The patient will be enrolled at the first session and will be tested within seven days at a second session. The anticipated date of last data collection will therefore be on the 23 November 2017, to collect enrolment data and on 30 November, to collect test data. 

The first session is expected to take approximately 30 minutes. The informed choice and consent form and those forms related to exclusion criteria will be completed in this first session. In addition, the patient will be familiarised with the isometric mid-thigh pull test procedure, a test that provides an accurate measure of peak force in semi-upright standing. There will be a period of no more than seven days between this and the second session when testing will be conducted. During this interim period the patient will be asked to abstain from vigorous exercise and to maintain normal daily activity, dietary habits and medication. 

The second session will involve a warm up prior to testing. This will include wall-support repeated knee bends for several minutes and then warm up trials of the isometric mid-thigh pull test, one at 50% maximal effort and one at 70% maximal effort. The test will be performed with one foot on the force plate, either affected or unaffected leg in randomised order. The test instruction will be to pull on the bar Gradually build up to a maximum. A further instruction to maintain effort for three to five seconds will be used. Maximum isometric ankle dorsiflexion strength, will be measured using a hand-held dynamometer with belt fixation, tested in three repeat measures of affected and unaffected lower limbs. 

An intervention specific to each patient will occur immediately following pre-test measurements. The intention of the intervention is to correct the lumbo-sacral list. The direction of list is described according to the position of the superior component, the trunk, relative to the pelvis. To correct the list the pelvis will be translocated in the frontal plane. Therefore, to correct left list the patient will lie in right side-lying. The opposite applies to correction of right list, the patient will lie in left side-lying. The plinth will remain flat with head pillows adjusted to the comfort of the patient and a pillow will be placed between the legs. The corrective position will be maintained for five minutes. The isometric mid-thigh test procedure and the dynamometric measurement of ankle dorsiflexion strength will be repeated, pre-test and post-test. Measurements of pain and scoliotic list will be taken immediately prior to the pre-test and prior to the post-test isometric mid-thigh pull and dynamometric tests. The second session is expected to take approximately 60 minutes. 

The physiotherapist who will conduct the research has postgraduate qualifications in musculoskeletal physiotherapy and has co-authored radiculopathy-related publications in international journals during the last decade.

    <designfeatures>The study locality, an accredited private physiotherapy practice, has formalised approved emergency procedures, reporting procedures for adverse events affecting patients and a privacy policy related to confidentiality of patient records. There will be a monitoring plan for the study. Safety of the experimental test area, the equipment and room conditions for hazards will be closely monitored. Test equipment will be checked for damage including its wiring and plugs for any signs of disrepair including frayed components. Lighting will be sufficient and the temperature of the room adjusted for participants. The researcher who will conduct testing, holds a current First Aid certificate, as do all physiotherapists in the practice. Testing will only proceed if there are other physiotherapists present.  Protection of the rights and wellbeing of participants will be monitored as will the security of study data. The conduct of the study in relation to the approved study protocol and the availability of health services to any participants who suffer injury as a consequence of study intervention will be monitored. The test position for the isometric mid-thigh pull test is to be in a semi-upright standing position that the patient finds most comfortable. The semi-upright position is safer than the more common lift from ankle level used in functional assessment of low back pain. Patients with minor muscle weakness and non-severe pain will be included. The intervention in side-lying to achieve pelvic translocation to correct scoliotic list is less aggressive than the commonly used intervention of pelvic translocation in standing. The duration of side-lying will be short, five minutes, to minimise long-term effects if deleterious and as stated above only patients with minor loss of muscle strength and minor symptoms will be recruited.  </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Determination of sample size is referred to as power analysis or as determining the power of the study. Power is the probability of avoiding a Type 1 error, the erroneous rejection of a null hypothesis, or the erroneous acceptance of a false null hypothesis, a Type 2 error. An 80% level i.e. 80% probability that a real effect in the population will be detected, is generally considered adequate. Power is a function of several variables, including the sample size and the statistical test to be employed. An adequate sample size N for the coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficient statistic to be employed, power = .80 and p = .05 is calculated N = 23. 

A paired t test will be used to analyse the pre-test versus post-test data. Regression analysis will be performed on the data to analyse the mean difference pre-test, post-test in relation to the pre-test percentage loss of ankle dorsiflexion strength (N), the size of list (mm), pain (VNS score), age (y), weight (kg) and height (m). Stepwise regression analysis may be indicated to identify the appropriate model to predict post-test strength difference. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Disability due to low back pain is a major health issue worldwide. Lumbo-sacral radiculopathy due to nerve root compression caused by disc herniation can result in unilateral loss of lower limb muscle strength. Muscle strength loss and lumbar scoliotic list, a spinal deformity, are the two physical signs of radiculopathy associated with very high compressive pressure on the affected lower lumbo-sacral nerve(s). The societal impact of radiculopathy is considerable as it affects people of working age whose mobility impairment due to muscle weakness can mean reduced participation including unemployment.  A previous case study reported that correction of scoliotic list in side-lying resulted in improved muscle strength outcomes when measured by manual muscle tests. The objective is to demonstrate improved muscle strength with correction of scoliotic list in a one group prospective pre- post-intervention study design. In the proposed project, the isometric mid-thigh pull test, if found to be a feasible, reliable and valid measure of muscle strength loss due to radiculopathy, will be used to assess muscle strength outcomes of the side-lying intervention to correct scoliotic list. Patients included in the project will have a clinical diagnosis of lumbo-sacral radiculopathy, non-severe radicular pain, minor ankle dorsiflexion weakness, a lumbar scoliotic list in standing, and will be aged between 20 and 60 years. The project will commence January 2017 and will be completed December 2018. The project will be written up in a thesis in accordance with Auckland University of Technology regulations including introduction and conclusion chapters. The thesis may contribute to a better understanding of primary care intervention for the disabling condition, lumbo-sacral radiculopathy due to nerve compression caused by disc herniation. </summary>
