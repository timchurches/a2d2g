    <interventions>CBM Intervention: Many substance abusers have impaired ability to regulate and monitor their behaviour. According to the "dual process" model, addiction arises from an imbalance between overactive bottom-up automatic (impulsive) processes that drive behaviours and impaired "top-down" controlling processes that stop behaviours associated with negative consequences. As a result, the individuals addictive behaviour becomes more easily triggered by alcohol related cues in their environment, but less able to be inhibited once triggered. The exaggerated tendency to attend and react to alcohol related cues is called cognitive bias. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a computer based training paradigm that trains the brain to inhibit the tendency to approach negative/harmful cues. This approach both minimizes the overactive "bottom-up" processes and improves the "top-down" control processes.

In the intervention CBM task, participants will be exposed to 240 computerised images of 40 different alcoholic and 40 different non-alcoholic drinks and instructed to respond with an approach or avoidance movement according to their orientation (landscape or portrait). While instructions are based on picture orientation, one orientation will contain images of alcoholic beverages 95% of the time (and non-alcoholic beverages 5% of the time) and will require an avoidance movement (pushing of a joystick, which decreases image size). The other orientation will contain non-alcoholic beverages 95% of the time and alcoholic beverages 5% of the time and will require an approach movement (pulling the joystick, which increases image size). The requirement to push away nearly all (95%) of alcohol images is intended to train participants to over-ride their pre-existing tendency to approach alcohol, and we hope that this will generalise to a reduced tendency to approach alcohol and its related cues following discharge from detoxification. This requirement will be reversed on 5% of trials to reduce the likelihood of participants being un-blinded to the nature of the training.

The training task usually takes approximately 15 minutes. It will be repeated on each of the three following days, such that the participant receives four consecutive days of training while in detoxification. The intervention will be administered by trained and qualified researchers employed by Turning Point (Eastern Health) or Monash University.

Training will commence no earlier than the 3rd day of inpatient withdrawal, though may be commenced later as long as there are 4 consecutive days available on which to conduct the training prior to the participants planned discharge day. In cases where participants receive the standard 7-day inpatient withdrawal, we aim to time sessions such that the final session will occur the day before discharge. However, due to variations in length of admission that sometimes occur, with some admissions lasting up to 2 weeks, the timing of training relative to the date of discharge will vary.

Data collectors will report any deviations from intervention adherence to the project manager, who will maintain a record of these deviations. Deviations may include interruptions to training sessions (e.g. due to computer errors or other unexpected events), non-standard scheduling of sessions (e.g. skipping a day, due to a participant being unwell or unavailable on a day a session is planned), or failure to complete 4 sessions due to unexpected early discharge from the withdrawal unit. All participants who commence training will be included in analyses, according to intention-to-treat principles, but participants who do not complete 4 sessions will be excluded from secondary per-protocol analyses.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the control sham-training task, 150 participants will be exposed to 240 computerised images 40 different alcoholic and 40 different non-alcoholic drinks and instructed to respond by using the joystick to move the images to the left or right according to their orientation (landscape or portrait). Each orientation will contain images of alcohol beverages 50% of the time and non-alcoholic beverages 50% of the time. Thus, there will be an equal frequency of requirement to move alcoholic images to the left and to the right, and neither motion expands or shrinks the images, meaning participants in this condition are not systematically trained to either approach or avoid alcoholic images, though this training is matched to the CBM task in terms of exposure to images and requirement to respond to each one. The training will be repeated on each of the three following days, such that the participant receives four consecutive days of training. The sham-training will be administered by trained and qualified researchers employed by Turning Point (Eastern Health) or Monash University.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is whether, compared to those receiving sham training, participants receiving CBM training will show significantly higher rates of abstinence from alcohol. At the 2-week follow-up, a researcher will conduct a time-line follow-back interview assessing alcohol (and other substance use) during covering the time since discharge.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks post-discharge.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difference between groups in rate of abstinence from alcohol at later time points (after the primary time point, i.e. 2-week follow-up). This will be measured by time-line follow-back interviews assessing alcohol (and other substance) use during the 30 days prior to each of the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3-months, 6-months and 12-months post-discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We aim to test whether stronger baseline approach bias scores will be associated with a larger effect of CBM (i.e., baseline approach biases will moderate CBMs effect on abstinence). Approach bias will be measured prior to the commencement of the training intervention by using the Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT), and we will test whether AAT scores moderate the effect of CBM (i.e. whether there is an interaction between the effects of AAT scores and group) on abstinence from alcohol at follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2-weeks, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months post-discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost saving in the CBM group compared to controls in terms of change in cost of repeated inpatient detoxification treatment and acute health care use during the year following discharge (after accounting for the costs of implementing CBM training in the CBM group). Acute health service and substance withdrawal treatment episodes will be indexed using excerpts from a modified version of the Lifetime Drug Use History. We will record self-reported numbers of ambulance call-outs, emergency department attendances, episodes of substance withdrawal treatment, and hospital inpatient admissions (as well as duration of any substance withdrawal or hospital inpatient admissions) at each follow-up, and use this to estimate each participant's cost of acute health service use and substance withdrawal readmission during the year following discharge. We will compare net spending (cost of CBM intervention + cost of further detoxification/acute health service use ) in the CBM group to net spending (cost of further detoxification/acute health service use) in the control group to test whether the CBM intervention leads to cost-savings for the health care system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One year following discharge from detoxification. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cue-induced desire ratings of alcohol images following CBM training, using a measure designed specifically for this study. Participants will view 20 computerised images, 10 of alcoholic beverages and 10 of non-alcoholic beverages. Participants rate wanting of images by marking a point along an accompanying 100 mm line with end caps either side indicating I do not want this at all to I really want this. Scores range from 0-100, based on the mm distance between the participants mark and the lower end point (i.e. a score of 0 indicates no wanting at all; a score of 100 indicates maximal wanting). Within each of the two beverage categories (alcoholic; non-alcoholic), 5 of the 10 images are identical to images to be used in the CBM training task and the other 5 are novel images not used in other study tasks. Thus, we will test whether the training task reduces cue-induced alcohol desire, and also whether this generalises to other alcohol images not used in the CBM training task.</outcome>

    <concealment>A researcher not involved in recruitment or data collection generated randomisation sequences prior to the commencement of recruitment. Since separate laptop computers will be used for cognitive bias assessment and training at each site, the randomisation sequence for each site was programmed into the corresponding computer, such that the participant is automatically randomised when they commence training (based on the participant’s number in the sequence). The outcome assessor will also be blinded. </concealment>
    <sequence>The sequence was generated using a computerised random number generator. A 1:1 allocation ratio was used for the randomisation, stratified by site, and based on permuted blocks of variable size within each stratum. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint is abstinence/relapse at 2-weeks post-discharge. In the ITT analysis of the primary endpoint, the divisor for the proportion of abstinent participants in an arm will be the number randomized to that arm and individuals lost to follow-up will be deemed to have relapsed. These proportions will be compared using a two-sample binomial test (two-sided a=0.05) and a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions will also be reported. In a supportive analysis of the primary endpoint, participants who complete fewer than 4 training sessions or who miss the follow-up, will be excluded from the denominator (and the numerator) when the proportion of abstinent patients is calculated in each arm. This per-protocol analysis will use the same statistical methods as the ITT analysis. In a supplementary analysis of all available assessments (from 2-weeks to 12-months) a logistic regression analysis, using the method of generalized estimating equations (GEE), will be used to compare the arms, and changes over time in the arms, adjusting, if need be, for sites. Additional exploratory analyses will also investigate adjusting the estimated difference between the arms for such covariates as pre-admission drinking days, mean drinks per drinking day and severity of alcohol dependence score. Full details will be given in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) that will be documented prior to the first analysis of the primary endpoint.
Logistic regression analyses (GEE method) will also be used to investigate the moderating effect of baseline approach bias score by including baseline scores as covariates in the model and testing the significance of all two-way interactions, as well as the three-way interaction, of treatment arm, time and the covariate. To determine the economic feasibility of CBM, in terms of savings to the treatment system (evidenced by fewer repeat inpatient detoxification's and episodes of acute health service use at the 12-month follow-up), we will compare net spending (cost of CBM intervention + cost of further detoxification/acute health service use for each participant) in the CBM group to net spending (cost of further detoxification/acute health service use) in the control group. The statistical significance of the difference between the groups will be assessed with a t-test and a variance-stabilising transformation, such as the logarithm, will likely be required. For cue-induced wanting, outcomes will be assessed with a repeated measures ANOVA assessing within-subjects variables of time (pre-training/post-training), picture-type (alcohol/non-alcohol), and novelty (used in training/not used in training), with the between-subjects conditions of group (CBM/Control). This will be followed up by separately testing effects of time, picture, type, and group at each level of novelty, i.e. conducting separate analyses for those images that were used in training and for those images that werent, to examine generalisability.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multi-site parallel groups randomised controlled trial will aim to recruit 300 alcohol-dependent patients (aged 18-65) admitted for inpatient detoxification at De Paul House (St. Vincents Hospital Melbourne), Wellington House (Eastern Health) or Windana Drug and Alcohol Recovery. The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of CBM training during inpatient alcohol detoxification in terms of increased abstinence rates 2 weeks following discharge,relative to controls who receive sham training. We also aim to explore rates of abstinence, 3, 6, and 12 months post-discharge as a secondary outcome. Another secondary aim is to determine if pre-training levels of approach or attentional bias moderate the effectiveness of CBM, based on the hypothesis that those who drink due to strong cognitive biases are likely to benefit from treatments targeting these biases, while those with low cognitive biases, whose drinking is driven by other factors (e.g. relief from distress) may benefit less from CBM. We also aim to measure the difference between groups in rates of use of further inpatient withdrawal and acute health services during the year following discharge to assess whether CBM training leads to cost savings to the health system, and to measure differences between groups in cue-induced desire for alcohol following CBM training.

We hypothesise that, compared to those receiving sham training, participants receiving CBM training will show significantly higher rates of abstinence from alcohol at all followups. We also anticipate that stronger baseline attention and approach bias will be associated with a larger effect of CBM (i.e., baseline attention/approach biases will moderate CBMs effect on abstinence). We expect significant net cost saving in the CBM group compared to controls in terms of reduced cost of repeated inpatient detoxification treatment and acute health care use during the year following discharge (after accounting for the costs of implementing CBM training in the CBM group). Compared to those receiving sham training, participants receiving CBM training will show significantly reduced cue-induced desire to alcohol images (but not to images of non-alcoholic beverages). We expect that this interaction will remain, with similar effect size, when analyses are restricted to images not included in the training task, demonstrating generalisation of reduced cue-induced desire beyond the specific stimuli that participants were trained to avoid.</summary>
