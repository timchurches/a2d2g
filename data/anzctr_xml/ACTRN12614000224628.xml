  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be a one-day education workshop that will provide information about the physiology of falls, risk factors for falls and theoretical and practical aspects of the provision of interventions to prevent falls. It will involve didactic and interactive sessions with groups of between 30 and 40 people. Workshop participants will also have access to internet-based resources to assist with prescription of evidence-based fall prevention exercises. The program aims to embed evidence from falls prevention principles and practices into the delivery of community-based exercise programs that aim to prevent falls. </interventions>
    <comparator>A waiting list control group will be used. People allocated to the control group will receive the education intervention three months after the intervention group.</comparator>

    <concealment>To ensure allocation concealment, randomisation to groups will be undertaken by an investigator not involved in recruitment using a computer generated random number schedule with randomly permuted block sizes. Randomisation to intervention or control groups will occur after completion of baseline questionnaires and initial assessment of fall prevention knowledge and exercise prescription behaviour. Allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who will ber at the central administration site and will have no contact with potential participants.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Between-group differences on the knowledge assessment (primary outcome) at follow-up will be analysed with linear regression with study group as the independent variable, knowledge score at follow-up as the dependent variable, baseline score on the knowledge assessment as a covariate. The difference in the proportion of people reporting a change in fall prevention exercise prescription behaviour (primary outcome), between the intervention and control groups will be assessed with the relative risk statistic. Between-group comparisons of the secondary outcomes of a) the proportion of older people seen in the last month for whom balance challenging exercise was prescribed; and b) the proportion of exercises prescribed by participants to older people in the past month that comply with fall prevention guidelines, will be undertaken using the relative risk statistic. An intention-to-treat approach will be used for all analyses.
Sample size calculations indicate that a 20% difference in the proportion of people reporting an increase in exercise prescription behaviour will be detected with a sample size of 220 (control group rate 50%, intervention group rate 70%, power = 80%, alpha = 5%, 15% dropouts). This sample size will also provide 80% power to detect a 20% between-group difference in the proportion of people who improved on the knowledge test at 3 month follow-up (control group rate 50%, intervention group rate 70%, alpha = 5%, 15% dropouts).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine if a specific, one-day education program delivered to allied health and exercise professionals in a workshop format and access to internet-based support materials, results in increased prescription of evidence-based exercises designed to prevent falls in older people. Secondary aims are to determine if the education program results in an increase in the proportion of exercise prescription strategies used in the past month that comply with evidence-based fall prevention guidelines and if fall prevention knowledge increases after three months. We hypothesise that the intervention group participants will prescribe evidence-based fall prevention exercise to a higher proportion of their older clients during the follow-up period than the control participants and that they will prescribe a higher number of evidence-based fall prevention exercises and will perform better on an assessment of fall prevention knowledge at three months follow-up compared with control participants.</summary>
