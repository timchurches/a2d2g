    <interventions>To compare the efficacy of additional Microdacyn with standard practices for prevention of
intra-operative wound contamination in clean surgical procedures.  Microdacyn hydrogel (Oculus, Mexico) will be applied  by the patient to the skin at the site of the imminent surgical incision.
Arm 1.  Standard care + Microdacyn applied twice daily for 7 days pre-operatively
Arm 2.  Standard care + Microdacyn applied four times daily for 2 days pre-operatively

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>An almost identical trial to this one was undertaken in November 2016 to January 2016.  The number of swab samples with moderate to heavy growth (more than 11 colonies on at least one plate) was 20 of 130 (15%) in the standard group and 4 of 124 (3%) in the Microdacyn group.  No statistical analysis has been done yet on these results.  In the current study, there will be three Microdacyn groups with different duration of pre-operative treatment (a dosing study) and we expect similar efficacy compared with control in the 2-day and 7-day groups. 

Standard descriptive statistics including means, medians, ranges, frequencies and percentages will be used to summarise baseline and post randomization measures. Outcomes will be compared between randomized groups using Chi-square, fishers exact tests and Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate. A two-tailed p-value &lt;0.05 will be taken to indicate statistical significance. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Infections after surgery, especially prosthesis surgery, are uncommon but potentially devastating.  The bacteria that cause most of these infections are thought to enter the wound during the operation.  Routine peri-operative anti-septic and antibiotic procedures do not eradicate bacteria hiding under the skin surface in hair follicles and sweat glands.  These bacteria leak into the wound during the operation.  In a randomized, controlled trial 9 months ago (unpublished to date), we found 2 days of pre-operative Microdacyn reduced the quantity of the bacteria that contaminated 'clean' wounds by 80%.  We wish to perform this study in a new and larger group of participants undergoing a wider range of surgical procedures and compare different doses and durations of Microdacyn .  
Protocol: Randomized trial of Microdacyn (3 dose arms) versus standard care for prevention of intraoperative wound contamination in clean surgical procedures
Trial sites: Nelson Hospital, and Manuka St Hospital, Nelson 7010
Laboratory: Medlab South, Nelson Hospital,
Objectives of the trial
To compare the efficacy of additional Microdacyn with standard practices for prevention of
intra-operative wound contamination in clean surgery.
Trial design: A randomized, unblinded, four-armed, parallel trial of efficacy, including 150 patients. This trial is designed to be run according to the quality standards of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki for human trials.
Primary endpoint
1. Bacterial contamination of intra-operative wound swabs.
Secondary endpoints
1. Post-operative wound infection.
2. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE).
Hypothesis: Prophylactic treatment with Microdacyn reduces contamination of surgical fields; a longer course of treatment will be more effective than a single dose</summary>
