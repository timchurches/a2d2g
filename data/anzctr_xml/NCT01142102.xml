Experimental: Arm 1 - Radiation Therapy


Treatment: other: Radiation Therapy
A radical dose of radiotherapy to be delivered to the entire bladder volume: 64Gy in 32 fractions over 6 weeks and 2 treatment days.
Conventional plan is used to deliver treatment for fractions 1 to 7 using a standard planning approach and a CTV to PTV margin of 1.5cm.
Adaptive plan is used to deliver treatment for fractions 8 through 32 using the same standard techniques as for fractions 1 to 7 but using one of three specific CTV volumes,namely: small, average or large. In all these cases the CTV to PTV margin is 0.7cm. Image guidance using a treatment unit based verification CT unit (Cone Beam CT or CT on Rails)based on soft tissue delineation is used to position the treatment fields and select the plan to best cover the CTV.
