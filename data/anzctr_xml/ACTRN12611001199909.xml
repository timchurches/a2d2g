  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of an oral antibiotic (Azithromycin) and an inhaled mucus-clearance agent (nebulised salt water, known as hypertonic saline) in people with bronchiectasis that is not due to cystic fibrosis. The interventions will be administered over a 6-month period. The investigators hypothesise that each intervention will improve the quality of life of people with bronchiectasis by reducing the severity of the chronic lung infection.</summary>
