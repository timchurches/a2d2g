  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the efficacy of Escitalopram, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake
      Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, in the treatment of Bipolar II Disorder.

      The use of antidepressants for those with bipolar disorder appears common in clinical
      practice but is not countenanced - at least as monotherapy - in formal treatment guidelines.
      This view reflects concerns about the possibility of antidepressant drugs inducing switching
      and rapid cycling in those with Bipolar Disorder. Although the effectiveness of treating
      Bipolar II patients with SSRIs has received very little attention in the literature,
      observations of Bipolar II patients treated with SSRIs suggest they may have general mood
      stabilising properties. Many patients have reported improvements not only in their depressed
      mood, but also a reduction in the severity, duration and frequency of hypomanic episodes.

      In this proof of concept study we specifically assess whether a standard dose of an SSRI
      antidepressant is more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency, severity and
      duration of both depressive and hypomanic episodes.</summary>
