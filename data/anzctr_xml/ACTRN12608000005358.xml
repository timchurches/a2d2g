  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is routine clinical practice to administer high flow oxygen to patients with a heart attack or angina; however, there is some evidence to suggest that this approach may be harmful, especially in patients who are not hypoxic.  This single group interventional trial aims to test this by recruiting 50 inpatients from the coronary care unit at Wellington Hospital who have confirmed coronary disease and a history of angina at rest or with minimal exertion.  Subjects will receive high flow oxygen for 30 minutes.  Subjects will be monitored to establish if angina occurs during the oxygen administration and if so how soon after it starts.  ECGs will be taken throughout the study to monitor for any significant changes.</summary>
