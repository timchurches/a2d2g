    <interventions>This study is a retrospective registry which is designed to evaluate the contemporary patterns of care for patients who are admitted to hospital with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Australia and New Zealand for a 2 week period between 14 - 27 August, 2012. 

Information on the clinical characteristics, the in-hospital investigations and management patterns provided during 'usual care' will  be compared to guidelines for recommended practice. The data will be collected from the medical records, entered onto an electronic case report form and transmitted to a central data repository at The George Institute in Sydney for analysis and reporting. 

A study coordinator in each State will obtain follow-up data by contacting patients12 months after their admission to assess morbidity and mortality.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a prospective registry which is designed to evaluate the contemporary patterns of care for patients who are admitted to hospital with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Australia and New Zealand.

More than 400 centres that treat ACS patients will participate and the researchers expect to enrol approximately 4,000 patients over a 2 week period. The main objective of the registry is to provide a greater understanding of the management and health outcomes of patients across the full breadth of hospitals in both countries.

Information on the clinical characteristics, the in-hospital investigations and management patterns will be collected. This will be compared to guidelines for recommended practice. These data will inform future strategies to improve ACS care within Australia and New Zealand.</summary>
