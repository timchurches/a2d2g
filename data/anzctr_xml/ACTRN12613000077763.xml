  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients receive standard analgesic management. Intraoperatively; 40 mg of intravenous parecoxib and intra and postoperative intravenous morphine to be titrated to achieve a numercial rating scale (NRS) pain intensity rating of less than 4 in the post anaesthesia care unit.  
Postoperatively; oral sustained release oxycodone of 10 miligrams twice per day plus as required immediate release oxycodone 5 -10 mg every 2 hours if required, together with celecoxib administered at a dose of 200 mg twice per day daily 
Pre and post operative (2 months)  sensory testing of wind up using electrical stimulation and observation of pain using NRS. Early postoperative measurements will include 24 hour and 7 daily NRS pain intensity ratings and LANSS, weekly NRS pain intensity and LANSS for a total of 8 weeks, as well as opioid and NSAID consumption. The 2 month review will include information regarding pain intensity, opioid, NSAID and other analgesic requirement, short form Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire (BPI), anxiety assessment according to profile of moods scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, LANSS and the presence of numbness and allodynia over site of surgery.   </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence of post herniorrhaphy pain at 2 months can be predicted with knowledge of preoperative pain processing integrity testing. We propose to use a testing which predicts wind-up like pain which is based on a technique of quantitative sensory testing. We propose using the RIII reflex, a known pain research tool, as a way of assessing for the presence of, or a higher propensity to develop wind up as it has the advantage of calculating an individualized pain threshold for each subject and then provides summated testing at a level relative to the individualized pain threshold.</outcome>

      <outcome>Area of and intensity of allodynia and hyperalgesia Brush-evoked allodynia will be assessed by lightly stroking the inguinal region of the lower abdominal wall using a brush (SENSELab TM 05, Somedic AB, Sweden) which will be moved from outside the potential site of surgery and converging towards the likely site of the hernia (as indicated by the patient).  12 locations situated in a circle surrounding the likely site of the hernia will be chosen. Once the 12 brush strokes are completed an area of best fit will be drawn and this area will be measured in cm2 as the allodynic area. 
Hyperalgesia will be assessed by lightly stroking the inguinal region of the lower abdominal wall using a Von Frey hair in the same manner as assessment for allodynia.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The operation of inguinal herniorraphy is associated with long term pain in 10-12% of patients.There are various factors that might influence the development of chronic post surgical pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy. Using quantitative sensory testing maybe a way to predict the occurrence of chronic post surgical pain syndrome</summary>
