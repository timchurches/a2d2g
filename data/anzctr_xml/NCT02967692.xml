  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - PDR001
Other interventions - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Dabrafenib
Treatment: drugs - Trametinib

Experimental: Investigational treatment arm - Part 1: Safety run-in Up to 18 evaluable patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutated melanoma will be enrolled and treated at different dose levels to determine the recommended Phase 3 regimen of PDR001 in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib.
Part 2: Biomarker cohort Approximately 20 patients with previously unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutated melanoma will be enrolled to describe changes in the immune microenvironment and biomarker modulations
Part 3: Randomized double blind Approximately 500 patients with previously untreated unresectable and metastatic BRAF V600 mutated melanoma will be enrolled to compare the anti-tumor activity of PDR001 in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib versus placebo plus dabrafenib and trametinib.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo comparator arm - Matching placebo in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib


Other interventions: PDR001
PDR001 will be supplied in vial in liquid or lyophilized pharmaceutical form. PDR001 will be administered via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes (up to 2 hours) once every 4 or 8 weeks.

Other interventions: Placebo
Placebo will be a Dextrose 5% in water (D5W) infusion supplied by the site.

Treatment: drugs: Dabrafenib
Dabrafenib will be provided by the sponsor to the investigative site or supplied locally as commercially available. Dabrafenib will be administered orally twice daily (150 mg BID) for Days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle.

Treatment: drugs: Trametinib
Trametinib will be provided by the sponsor to the investigative site or supplied locally as commercially available. Trametinib will be administered orally once daily (2 mg QD) for Days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle.
