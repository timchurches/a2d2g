  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive regular semi-personalized lifestyle reminders sent via mobile phone text messages for 6 months.  Each participants will receive 4 text messages per week for 6 months.  These will be sent at random times of the day (9.00am, 12noon, 3.00pm, 5.00pm) and on random days of the week (Monday through Friday).  Non-smokers will receive two general messages, one nutritional message and one physical activity message per week.  Smokers will receive one general message, one nutritional message, one physical activity message and one smoking cessation message per week.  Messages will be practical in nature, less than 160 characters in length and will be generic for varying age and genders.  Prior to study commencement, a bank of 100 messages will be developed based on scientific literature and multidisciplinary expert review and finalised via a qualitative review process.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment Group: Participants in the treatment group will receive repeated semi-personalized lifestyle reminders sent via mobile phone text messages for 6 months

Control Group: Participants in the control group will participate in "usual care".  Usual care will include ongoing management by the patient's treating doctor/s  including potential pharmacotherapy and lifestyle counseling as determined by their usual doctors.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To establish the feasibility, patient acceptability, effect on risk factors and thereby overall potential of repeated semi-personalized lifestyle reminders sent via mobile phone text messages in a population at high risk of cardiovascular events.
The main hypothesis that will be tested is that a program of brief and repeated lifestyle messages will improve cardiovascular risk factor levels compared to usual care.</summary>
