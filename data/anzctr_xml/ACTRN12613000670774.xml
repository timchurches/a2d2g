  <interventions>
    <interventions>A mindfulness meditation intervention emphasises concentration,is  implemented from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm (7 hours) a day for 3 consecutive weeks.
Concentration training began with a sitting meditation and follow by a walking meditation. 

According to sitting mediation, participants sat quietly with eyes closed and placed their attention on breathing either at the tip of the nose or from the diaphragm. The sitting meditation was operated approximately 3 hours (9.00-12.00) in the morning. 

Next, a walking meditation was used as an alternative to sitting. In walking meditation, participants simply stood, then began to walk at a fairly slow but normal walking pace and in a normal manner. The walking meditation was carried out in the afternoon from 1.30 pm to 5 pm. </interventions>
    <comparator> Mindfulness Meditation is applied for intervention group for 3 weeks. As control group, there is no any activity being applied as "no treatment". Control participants attend a normal class in the college. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anger emotions determine as high anger when are above 75th percentile, and normal emotion when are lower than 75th percentile.

The StateTrait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-2) scale is a 32-item questionnaire developed to measure characteristic styles of anger emotions.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test  is assessed  one week prior to intervention. Post-test is conducted 1 and 3 months follow-up.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Violence behaviours measure harmful activities within 30 days. 

The measure of violent behavior used in this study was based on the Pittsburgh Youth Studys measure of serious violence. The  self-reported measure consists of five items: aggravated assault; two robbery items; rape; and gang fights.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test measurement is implemented 1 week before, and 1 and 3 months post-test after finishing intervention. </timepoint>

    <concealment>All full-time students in the college are invited to the study,and the allcocation for either intervention or control group based on a classroom timetable. 
If they have a rigid timetable- they will allocate to control group. </concealment>
    <sequence>Quasi-randomisation method is used in the study. The allocation is based on willingness and the classroom timetable. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size in the study was determined  by using type I error, type II error, and standard deviations and the number of sample sizes were 36 for both groups. Nevertheless, forty participants were recruited for the mindfulness meditation group and fifty-six for the control group in order to achieve the study design. 

Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare scores on the dependent measures at pre- and post-test (1-month and 3-month follow-up). Independent t-tests were used to calculate intervention effects between pre-treatment and post-treatment for all measurement scales for both the intervention and control groups. </statisticalmethods>
