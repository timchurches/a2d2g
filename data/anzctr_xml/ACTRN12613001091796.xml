    <interventions>The participants in this study, which forms Part 2 of a 4-part study, involves a prospective survey for all permanent/semi-permanent Royal Adelaide Hospital Intensive Care Unit staff (i.e. medical staff [consultants, senior registrars], nursing staff [clinical service coordinators, associate clinical service coordinators, clinical nurses, critical care registered nurses, registered nurses, enrolled nurses], physiotherapists [principals, rotational]). Return of the completed survey will be taken as an indication of informed consent. The survey consists of a series of closed statements that require responses using a visual analogue scale and two open questions that explore perceived barriers to the early progressive mobilisation of Intensive Care Unit patients. The survey will be distributed on a single occasion to relevant staff.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this quality improvement project is to undertake a series of studies with the overall aim of increasing the frequency of mobilisation of patients in the Royal Adelaide Hospital Intensive Care Unit. The study will
comprise four parts as follows:
1. A prospective audit of the frequency of mobilisation in the Royal Adelaide Hospital Intensive Care Unit, including reasons that patients are not mobilised.
2. A prospective survey evaluating Royal Adelaide Hospital Intensive Care Unit staffs perceptions of the barriers to mobilising Royal Adelaide Hospital Intensive Care Unit patients.
3. Implementation of strategies to address these barriers (e.g. education, improving inter-disciplinary communication).
4. A prospective repeat audit of the frequency of mobilisation in the Royal Adelaide Hospital Intensive Care Unit following implementation of these strategies, including reasons that patients are not mobilised.
This registration form is for part 2 of the study.</summary>
