  <interventions>
    <interventions>EMA401 Sodium Salt at a dose level of 50 mg EMA401 equivalent (2 x 25 mg capsules) will be administered orally as a single dose to subjects in each dosing period, either in the fasted state, following a standard high fat meal, or with 250 mL of orange juice with no added sugar.
All subjects will be required to fast for at least 10 hours overnight prior to dosing. EMA401 will be administered to the following treatment groups: 
Fasted; two 25 mg capsules with 240 mL of non-carbonated water.
High fat meal; two 25 mg capsules with 240 mL of non-carbonated water, following a standardised high fat and high caloric breakfast (50% fat and 800 to 1000 Kcal), starting 30 minutes prior to dose administration. 
Orange juice only: two 25 mg capsules with 250 mL of commercially available orange juice with no added sugar.  
All subjects will then consume no further food until 4 hours post-dose. There will be a minimum 7-day wash-out between each treatment period.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study is a three-period, three-way crossover design. In each period, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, five subjects will be randomised to the fasted dose administration, another five subjects will be randomised to the fed dose administration and the remaining five subjects randomised to receiving orange juice only.  Over the three periods, each subject will be allocated once to each mode of dose administration.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of EMA401 after a single oral dose of EMA401 Sodium Salt, comparing dose administration following a high fat meal or with orange juice against dose administration in the fasted state, in healthy adult males.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In each of the 3 treatment periods, blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose following each dose administration (18 samples in each period, 54 samples in total).</timepoint>
