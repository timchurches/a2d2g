  <interventions>
    <interventions>RCT design with shift days randomized to three arms - intervention (SWAT shift), standard care (extra consultant) or control (no consultant). The SWAT shift is the intervention arm in which the consultant will have a specific job role and description aimed at facilitating early assessment and treatment of patients in the Emergency Department (ED). The role of the SWAT doctor is to see patients in an early treatment area, take a very brief history and provide instructions to a nurse and junior doctor for investigations, consults and likely disposition that the patient will need. These can therefor be started earlier than would have happened had they had to wait to be seen by the next available emergency doctor. If the patient requires a bed, monitoring, or further treatment and investigations they will be moved to the appropriate area for this and their care handed over to one of the emergency doctors in that area to continue and follow up on these. This role will exist for and average of two 7 hour shifts per week for 5 months.	We have conformed to CONSORT guidelines for RCT and Clustered trials.</interventions>
    <comparator>The standard care arm has the consultant assigned as an extra consultant on the floor. He/She is free to see patients in an order of their choosing as well as supervising junior staff and the patients they have seen.They can ask nursing staff and junior staff to order and arrange investigations and consults. This will run over an average of two 7 hour shifts per week for 2 months.
The third arm will involve a non clinical consultant shift where they will not be on the floor seeing patients directly. They will be in the office doing education and administrative activities.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measured with be Emergency Department Length of Stay. This will be obtained from FIRSTNET, The computer data base used to store all patient information. A print out of all eligible patients will be given each day to Rebecca Davis. This will be done by Sook Lee, out data manager. The print out will have patient Medical Record Number (MRN) but not name. It will be kept in a locked office in the ED and only Rebecca Davis will have access to it. Identifying Medical Record Number (MRN) will be removed and not used on the final data collection excel spreadsheet.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured in hours for each patient who is eligible for the trial. Data will be collected each day. The trial will run for 5 months. Data from the day before will be collected each morning by Rebecca Davis.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Improving public hospital performance and efficiency has become an important health policy priority with the introduction of the National Emergency Access Target initiative. Reducing patient length of stay in the emergency department is an important component of this initiative and various strategies have now been introduced and proposed to try and tackle this problem. One such proposal is improving access to senior clinicians in the emergency department as soon as possible after a patient arrives. A flexible model of senior workup and assessment teams have been implemented at RPAH which consists of an Emergency Physician, Senior Emergency Nurse and Resident Medical Officer with the aim of performing limited and directed patient assessments, initiating treatments and arranging imaging studies and consultations before formal assessment has been completed within the emergency department. These SWAT (Senior Workup Assessment and Treatment) teams are rostered from 10AM to 5PM on days that a SWAT shift can be staffed. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the impact of this clinical redesign on patient length of stay and the ability to discharge or admit a patient from the emergency department within four hours of patient arrival. the results of this quality improvement initiative will be useful in assessing the effectiveness of such models of care and redesigning processes of care in the emergency department.</summary>
