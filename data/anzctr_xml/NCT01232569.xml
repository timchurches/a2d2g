      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) at Week 24 - The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatic arthritis (RA) and includes swollen and tender joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health (GH) status. The index is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × v(TJC28)) + (0.28 × v(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(ESR)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints. GH = a patient's global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end = no disease activity [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms], right end = maximum disease activity [maximum arthritis disease activity]). When ESR equaled 0 mm/hr, it was set to 1 mm/hr. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. A negative change score indicates improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a DAS28 Score = 3.2 (DAS28 Low Disease Activity) at Week 24 - The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatic arthritis (RA) and includes swollen and tender joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health (GH) status. The index is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × v(TJC28)) + (0.28 × v(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(ESR)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints. GH = a patient's global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end = no disease activity [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms], right end = maximum disease activity [maximum arthritis disease activity]).

      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a DAS28 Score &lt; 2.6 (DAS28 Remission) at Week 24 - The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatic arthritis (RA) and includes swollen and tender joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health (GH) status. The index is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × v(TJC28)) + (0.28 × v(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(ESR)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints.

      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With Good, Moderate, or no European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Responses at Week 24 - Change of the Disease Activity Score 28 score from baseline was used to determine EULAR responses of good, moderate, or no response. For a post-baseline score = 3.2, a change from baseline of &lt; -1.2 was a good response, &lt; -0.6 to = -1.2 was a moderate response, and = -0.6 was no response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 3.2 to = 5.1, a change from baseline of &lt; -0.6 was a moderate response and = -0.6 was no response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 5.1, a change from baseline &lt; -1.2 was a moderate response and = -1.2 was no response. A good response could not be achieved for post-baseline scores &gt; 3.2.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Van Der Heijde Modified Sharp Radiographic Score at Week 24 - The degree of joint damage was assessed using the van der Heijde modified total Sharp score (mTSS). The methodology quantifies the extent of bone erosions for 44 joints and joint space narrowing (JSN) for 42 joints, with higher scores representing greater damage. The independent read of X-ray images was performed by 2 primary readers. In case of discrepancy between the 2 primary readers, an adjudicator was involved. The mTSS can range from 0 to 448 with a higher score indicating more joint damage. A negative change score indicates improvement.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Physical and Mental Component Scores of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey at Week 24 - The SF-36 Health Survey uses patient-reported symptoms on 8 subscales to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The Physical Component Summary (PCS) score summarizes the subscales Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, and General Health. The Mental Component Summary (MCS) score summarizes the subscales Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. Each score was scaled from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating better HRQoL. A positive change score indicates an improvement in HRQoL.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate the
      reduction in disease activity and the safety of tocilizumab (RoActemra/Actemra) in
      combination with traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with
      active, moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In the double-blind part of the study,
      patients will be randomized to receive either 162 mg tocilizumab or placebo subcutaneously
      every 2 weeks for 24 weeks using a pre-filled syringe. In the open-label part of the study,
      patients will be randomized to receive 162 mg tocilizumab subcutaneously every 2 weeks from
      Week 24 to Week 96 using a pre-filled syringe or an auto-injector.</summary>
