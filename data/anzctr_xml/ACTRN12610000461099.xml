  <interventions>
    <interventions>A graduated below-knee compression stocking will be worn on one leg for approximately120 minutes by trial participants and lower limb blood flow will be measured by ultrasound at time (T) = 0, T = 30, T= 60 and T = 120 minutes after the participant dresses in the stocking.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment - i.e. no stocking.  Lower limb blood flow will also be measured by ultrasound in the other leg of each trial participant; so that each participant is their own control.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prolonged seated immobility is a risk factor for the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Graduated compression stockings represent a non-pharmacological approach in reducing the risk of DVT associated with prolonged seated immobility. The simplicity of their use and their minimal side effects have made them popular in preventative care, both in the hospital post operative setting and amongst travellers.  This study plans to investigate the pressure profile and effect on blood flow in the lower legs of a newly developed below the knee graduated compression stocking manufactured using merino wool.</summary>
