  <interventions>
    <interventions>MOODCARE includes up to 10 telephone counselling sessions,each approximately 30 minutes in duration, over 6 months after hospital discharge for ACS, using Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) delivered by psychologists. The sessions will be most intensive over the first 3 months when depressive symptoms are most likely to affect patients following ACS and to impact on their quality of life and adoption of secondary preventive behaviours. Psychologists will aim to reduce symptoms of depression, as well as improve Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk factors and overall Quality Of Life (QOL).</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual Care (UC) will involve standard treatment (e.g cardiac rehabilitation) following discharge for ACS. It is recognised that there will be variation between the cardiac rehabilitation programs offered to those participants assigned to the Usual Care (UC) group not only between hospitals but between states. However, we anticipate that the standard cardiac rehabilitation offered to those in the control group will have the following characteristics: (1) three identified phases: Inpatient rehabilitation (Phase 1), Ambulatory outpatient rehabilitation (Phase 2), Maintenance (Phase 3), (2) the usual duration of programs will be six to eight weeks, (although in some places it may be as short as four weeks), (3) Sessions may be offered once, twice or occasionally three times per week, (4) most exercise programs will be of low or moderate intensity, (5) most programs will include group education, but the content and method of the delivery of such education programs will most likely vary greatly, (6) Psychological and social support may be given on an individual basis, as required, or may be provided to groups of patients and family members. Participants in UC condition will receive general health newsletters from the project team every six months for 24 months</comparator>

    <concealment>All consenting patients will be assessed for depression prior to hospital discharge, using psychometrically robust and valid instruments, i.e., the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Patients identified in hospital with a score on the PHQ9=5-19, will be contacted by a Research Assistant (RA) via telephone within 1-2 week of discharge for baseline assessment which includes a diagnostic assessment using Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Following this, patients will be randomised (central randomisation via project website) to either usual care or the telephone-based care management program for depression (MOOD-CARE)</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will recruit ACS patients who exhibit signs of depression from six hospitals, randomise them to MOOD-CARE or usual care (UC), and follow them for up to 2 years. MOOD-CARE is a state-of-the-art telephone counselling program which has the potential to improve psychological, physical, social and vocational functioning; reduce demands on the health system; and potentially, to extend survival for the growing number of Coronary Heart Disease patients in Australia.</summary>
