  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) Provision of high intensity phototherapy and a photo radiometer; 
2) Promulgation of standard guidelines for phototherapy and exchange transfusion, as used by the lead Myanmar hospital responsible for neonatal care policy. American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 guidelines for infants born at 35 weeks gestation and above  specify Total Serum Bilirubin thresholds for commencement of intensive (&gt;=30 W/cm2 per nm at 430-490 nm) and standard (&lt;30 W/cm2 per nm at 430-490 nm) phototherapy and Exchange transfusion, by infant age in hours and risk factors (including gestational age-group). The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence 2010 guidelines (used for infants born &lt;35 weeks gestation by the Myanmar lead hospital for neonatal care) provide thresholds for phototherapy and Exchange Transfusion by gestational week at birth, and age in hours. Hospitals were given coloured graphs reproduced from the American Academy of Pediatrics guideline to affix to nursery walls, and MS Excel spreadsheets containing the NICE thresholds. Adherence to the guidelines was not externally monitored during the intervention period.
3) Half day training in use of the equipment and guidelines by an Italian Neonatologist. Training was provided in two cities, Yangon and Mandalay, on separate dates, each catering to key staff from two hospitals; 19 staff attended at one location and 21 at the other.  Training was by lecture format, with discussion of the guidelines and exercises to demonstrate use of the guidelines, followed by hands-on practice in use of the equipment. </interventions>
    <comparator>The pre-intervention period within each hospital was defined as 1 January to 31 December 2011. Routine care during this period include treatment with existing fluorescent phototherapy machines, none of which provided intensive phototherapy as defined in the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 guidelines. In this period, each of the four hospitals had its own guideline for commencement and cessation of phototherapy, and for provision of exchange transfusion.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Relative Risk Ratio After vs Before, separately for each hospital, aggregated by the Mantel-Haenszel method separately for the two inborn and outborn strata in the absence of marked heterogeneity. The sample size was pragmatically determined as the number of admissions  for jaundice and the number of exchange transfusions performed in a 12 month periods pre- and post-intervention. Historical data indicated that the number of exchange transfusions was likely to be sufficient to detect a halving of the exchange transfusion rate in each of the four hospitals with alpha of 0.05 (two-sided) and at least 80% power, assuming no change in number of admissions for jaundice. Results of this order were considered feasible, as clinicians were performing exchange transfusion due to lack of effective phototherapy to reduces bilirubin levels.. If results were homogenous, within the inborn and outborn strata, aggregation by Mantel-Haenszel methods would increase the power, allowing detection of a smaller reduction. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Myanmar, approximately half of all neonatal hospital admissions are for hyperbilirubinaemia, and tertiary facilities report high rates of Exchange Transfusion (ET). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot program in reducing ET, separately for inborn and outborn neonates.

The study was conducted in the Neonatal Care Units of four national tertiary hospitals: two exclusively treating inborn neonates, and two solely for outborn neonates. Prior to intervention, no high intensity phototherapy was available in these units. Intervention in late November 2011 comprised, for each hospital, provision of two high intensity LED phototherapy machines, a photo radiometer, and training of personnel. Hospital-specific data were assessed as Relative Risks comparing ET rates pre- and post-intervention, and individual hospital results were pooled when appropriate.</summary>

    <ethicsreview>Approved</ethicsreview>
    <publicnotes>Ethical approval was sought and received retrospectively. The intervention was funded by charitable donations on the understanding that the intervention would be promptly implemented.. It was agreed with the Ministry of Health, at the outset, that routinely collected summary data would be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, and to inform and guide future interventions in Myanmar. The relevant ethics committee meets annually: it was no not considered justified to delay implementation while seeking ethical approval for routine implementation of a proven healthcare intervention (intensive phototherapy); thus it was decided to seek retrospective ethical clearance.</publicnotes>
