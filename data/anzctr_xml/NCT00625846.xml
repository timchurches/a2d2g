          -  Known active and/or untreated brain metastases and/or brain metastases requiring
             ongoing therapy (e.g. corticosteroids); NOTE: (because of the poor prognosis often
             associated with brain metastases and because of the potential risk of bleeding in
             active brain metastases associated with multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
             therapy, patients with active and/or untreated brain metastases and/or those with
             brain metastases requiring ongoing therapy - e.g. corticosteroids - are excluded from
             trial enrollment; enrollment will, however, be permitted in cases of patients with
             longstanding treated and inactive brain metastases not requiring ongoing therapy,

             months or greater as assessed by intracranial imaging - and providing that there is no
             indication of increased vascularity of the treated metastases by magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) imaging conducted =&lt; 14 days prior to registration; when questions arise

          -  Pregnant women; NOTE: (breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with GW786034/pazopanib)

          -  Receiving any medications or substances known to affect or with the potential to
             affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of GW786034 (pazopanib); NOTE: the eligibility
             of patients will be determined following review of their case by the Principal
             Investigator; efforts should be made to switch patients who are taking enzyme-inducing
             anticonvulsant agents to other medications

          -  Receiving any concomitant medications that are associated with a risk of QTc
             prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes; NOTE: these medications should be

    <summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in
      treating patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by stopping blood
