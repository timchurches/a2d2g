    <sequence>Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation or not. The randomisation list will be generated by the independent study statistician using a computer generated list and will be arranged in permuted blocks. Randomisation will occur at the baseline visit.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>No interim efficacy or safety analyses are intended. All baseline demographic and clinical features will be summarized by randomized groups using means, medians, standard deviations ranges and frequencies and percentages as appropriate. No formal hypothesis testing will be undertaken on the baseline measurements. The change in serum urate (primary outcome), weight and oxypurinol concentration from baseline to 6 months will be compared between randomized groups using ANCOVA with the relevant baseline level used as the covariate. The means changes and the difference in the mean change will be summarized with 95% confidence intervals. The mean number of flares will be compared between groups using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. The percentage of participants; with flares and needing rescue therapy will be compared between randomized groups using fishers exact tests. The time to first flare will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared between randomised groups using the log-rank test.  All analyses will be undertaken SPSS. All tests will be two-tailed and a 5% significance level maintained.  Primary data analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat population, all randomized participants. Secondary analysis will be based on the per-protocol basis which excludes participants with major protocol deviations. There will be no imputation of missing data. 
All adverse events and serious adverse events will be tabulated by system/organ class, severity and relatedness by randomized group as both frequency of event and percentage of participants experiencing the event. Key adverse events potentially related to fish oil treatment e.g. nausea, fishy after taste may be compared between randomized groups using Chi-square or Fishers exact tests as appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Management of gout focuses on treating the acute attacks and long-term lowering of serum urate so that acute attacks stop. Gout attacks are common when urate lowering treatments are started so treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, colchicine or steroids are recommended during the first 6 months of urate lowering therapy. However, each of these drugs has potential adverse effects and are contra-indicated in many people with gout. Omega-3 fatty acids are a natural non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and may therefore be an appropriate alternative. This study will provide preliminary evidence required to design a full clinical trial of fish oil in gout.  </summary>
