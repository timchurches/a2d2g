  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be enrolled to 1 of the following 3 interventions:

In Part 1 of the trial, comprising up to 8 single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts of 10 subjects each, study drug is administered SC in the abdomen in single doses to ascending dose cohorts [3.5µg, 12 µg, 32 µg, 48 µg, 72 µg, 100 µg, 124 µg, and 152 µg ACP-014  (N=8) or placebo (N=2)] until dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed.

Cohort X- After completion of the SAD cohorts, up to 16 subjects will be enrolled in the subsequent 2 by 2 randomized crossover cohort. 8 subjects (optimally 4 males and 4 females) will receive single SC doses of 12 µgACP-014  in either the abdomen/thigh (A/T) or the thigh/abdomen (T/A) in a crossover fashion. The other 8 subjects (optimally 4 males and 4 females) will receive the highest tolerated single dose of ACP-014  in either A/T or T/A in a crossover fashion to obtain initial information on potential PK differences between SC dosing in the abdomen vs. the thigh. All subjects will receive two single doses of ACP-014 at least 7 days apart.

In Part 2, study drug is administered SC in the abdomen daily for 10 days to approximate steady-state to up to 9 multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts of 10 subjects each (8 subjects receiving ACP-014 , and 2 subjects receiving placebo). The initial dose cohort of 3.5 µg ACP-014  daily may begin after completion of the 32 µg SAD cohort, based on an expected accumulation ratio of 3 plus an additional 10-fold safety margin. The 2nd MAD dose will be 7.0 µg/day, followed by 12 µg/day, 16 µg/day, 20 µg/day, 24 µg/day, 32 µg/day, 40µg/day and potentially 48 µg/day.

Pharmacokinetic analysis

All subjects who will have received the study drug and for whom the primary pharmacokinetic data are considered sufficient and interpretable will be analyzed in the pharmacokinetic analyses. Given the exploratory nature of this study, and the relatively low number of subjects per dose level, pharmacokinetic parameters will generally be estimated with summary statistics. The pharmacokinetic parameters and their statistical evaluation will be included in the clinical study report. Based on the well-understood PK/PD relationship of PTH in general, and PTH(1-34) in particular, and the data showing that continuous infusion of PTH(1-34) provides optimal treatment of both adults and children with hypoparathyroidism, PK data will not be used for dose advancement, nor will the PK data for a given cohort be available at the time of the safety teleconference for that cohort. Instead, dose advancement will be based on the totality of the safety data available, including primarily the serum calcium response.

Safety analysis

The reporting of the safety data is descriptive, and will include all subjects receiving at least one dose of ACP-014  or placebo. Descriptive analysis will include the incidence and type of AEs, changes in laboratory, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG parameters from pre-dosing to all post dosing time points. Listings of abnormal laboratory data by treatment group will be presented. Treatment-emergent abnormal ECGs will be summarized. Incidence of abnormal vital signs and ECG observations over time will be summarized by treatment/dose group. All AEs will be coded using MedDRA and tabulated by System Organ Class. Individual events within eachSystem will be presented in descending frequency. AEs will also be tabulated by severity and relationship to the study drug and will be presented by dosage. SAEs will be summarized separately from non-serious AEs. Important safety findings will be listed and summarized as appropriate. 

Interim analysis: 
The safety data from each cohort will be analyzed at the completion of each
cohort.

Pharmacodynamic analysis

The absolute and percent change from baseline will be summarized for each PD parameter. All subjects who have received ACP-014  or placebo, and for whom the primary PD data are considered to be sufficient and interpret-able, will be included in the PD analyses. Data from all clinical assessments will be listed where appropriate, and summarized by cohort using descriptive statistics. 

Interim analysis: 
The PD data from each cohort will be analyzed at the completion of each
cohort.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is testing the safety, tolerability, immunology (how the study drug affects the immune system), pharmacokinetics (how the body effects the study drug) and pharmacodynamics (how the study drug effects the  body) of single and multiple doses of a new drug called ACP-014 when given as a subcutaneous (into the skin) injection. Ascendis Pharma is developing the drug ACP-014  for the potential his study will run in 3 Parts:

 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Phase: will assess the effect of a single ascending dose of ACP-014  or
placebo when administered as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection abdomen.

 Cross Over (Cohort X) Phase: will assess the effect of a single subcutaneous dose of ACP-014  in their
abdomen and thigh. This phase of the study involves all participants receiving both study treatments in a particular
sequence.

 Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Phase: will assess the effect of multiple ascending daily doses of ACP-014 
when administered as subcutaneous injections into the abdomen.

Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in up to 8 cohorts (groups) with up to 10 participants in each cohort. In each cohort, 8 participants will receive the active drug (ACP-014)  and 2 will receive the placebo. This study is a dose escalation study and total participation consists of 35 days.
