  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study to test the ability of the heart hormones plasma NT-proBNP and/or BNP to distinguish early structural and/or functional cardiac changes in asymptomatic subjects at risk of later adverse cardiac outcomes.
100 people in all will be invited to take part. Fifty will be asymptomatic, aged 45-65 years with treated or untreated hypertension of 10 or more years duration any of whom may or may not have additional risk factors, including diabetes, dyslipidaemia, obesity.  None of these subjects will have any overt cardiovascular medical history. The other fifty people will be age, gender and BMI-matched unmedicated controls with no history of cardiovascular risk factors or events and with normal findings on physical examination.  Both groups will have normal renal function. 

All participants will be asked to attend one outpatient clinic for:
Full medical history.
Physical examination including full cardiovascular examination and recording of age, gender, height, weight, waist circumference, heart rate, blood pressure, heart sounds and venous pressure.  
Recording of any medications.
Routine haematology, biochemistry  including haemoglobin, white cell count, creatinine, Na, K, fasting sugar and lipid profile.
Echocardiography with full assessment of dimensions and both systolic and diastolic function.
Blood sampling for plasma BNP and NT-proBNP 

A second attendance will be required for a Cardiac magnetic resonance scanning to measure left ventricular mass will be performed.</summary>
