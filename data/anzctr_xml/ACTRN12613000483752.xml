  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is relaxation in a flotation tank. This tank is a device filled with magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt) saturated water (1.3 g/cm^3) heated to 35-36 degrees Celsius. In the tank there is darkness and silence. Ear-plugs are used.

The participants receive  a total of twelve flotation sessions  (each consisting of 45 minutes) during seven weeks. There is one session every 3-4 days over the 7 week intervention period.  There is a session attendance monitoring at the floatation tank centre. If a participant do not arrive, or get sick, a new scheduled session is offered. </interventions>
    <comparator>persons on waiting list for floatation tank is control group. They will be offered the interventions about 8 weeks later.</comparator>

    <concealment>An agreement was made between the owner of a flotation centre and three managers from three different companies about a health-care program involving flotation-tank treatments. All three companies advertised through intranet correspondence, their company magazines, and through emails, offering all employees to participate in the health-care program. All interested participants were invited to an information meeting at the flotation centre, where they were further informed about the program. Information was given that the flotation-rest program would enable them to participate in a scientific study concerning the effects of this treatment program. Further information was given regarding that the participation was voluntary, confidential, that they would be randomly selected to either experimental group or waiting list, and that they could terminate their participation at any given point. They were also informed it was possible to participate in the health-care program without participation in the present study.</concealment>
    <sequence>at the first meeting, the participant pulled a "lottery ticket" out of a closed box. It was written "floatation-tank" or "waiting list" on this ticket.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects in a series of 12 treatments (during 7 weeks) of flotation-REST in healthy participants, as a health-care intervention. Earlier research regarding flotation-REST mainly involves individuals with a diverse array of ailment, and so there is a need to further investigate this method when used by working professionals in order to find out if it is a suitable method for preventing stress and stress-related problems. We would like to know if healthy persons can have beneficial effects of this method. We know it is an efficient method for rehabilitation for persons on sick-leave, but we have never investigated it for healthy persons.

The local research ethical committee does not have anything to add on ethical grounds for the study  "Beneficial effects of treatment with sensory isolation in flotation tank as a helath-care intervention" .</summary>
