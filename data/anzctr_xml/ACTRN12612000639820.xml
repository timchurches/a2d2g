  <interventions>
    <interventions>Manual lymphatic drainage, performed initially by lymphoedema-trained physiotherapists who will also instruct patients how to perform manual lymphatic drainage, to be done on a daily basis, for less than one hour for six weeks postoperatively. Manual lymphatic drainage is a specialised form of massage designed to assist drainage of the excess lymph fluid from the upper chest and arm. It is a very light skin massage (as opposed to deep tissue/sports-type massage) and hence can be performed by a trained physiotherapist but also by patients themselves.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Limb volume, calculated assuming the arm is a cylinder of varying radius on the basis of arm circumference measurements starting at 20cm proximal to the cuticle of the middle finger and at 4cm intervals proximal to that.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3-4 months after the end of the intervention, then 6, 12, 18, 24 &amp; 36 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Validation of the use of bio-impedance technology (QuadScan 4000) to calculate the presence of lymphoedema against standard validated limb volume measurements.</outcome>
