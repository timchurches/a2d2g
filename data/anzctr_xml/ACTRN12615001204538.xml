  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of DRL_BZ versus the Reference Medicinal Product (RMP; Avastin (Registered Trademark) [EU-approved]) and the Reference Product (RP; Avastin (Registered Trademark) [US-licensed]) after administration of a single 1 mg/kg intravenous (IV) dose in healthy male subjects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for analysis of serum concentrations of the study drugs will be collected at the following specified times to perform a comparison of PK similarity.
All PK sampling time points are relative to end of infusion (i.e., after fixed infusion of 90 minutes, or up to 93 minutes, considering the maximum of 3 minutes infusion
interruption allowed). Sampling time points relative to end of infusion will have a designated nominal time point: End of infusion, 1 hour, 2 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post end of infusion and so on up to Day 85.
Mid infusion (at 45 minutes) and end of infusion (at 90 minutes +/- 3 minutes) are relative to the start of infusion.
 The primary PK parameters will consist of:
- Cmax, AUC(08) and AUC(0t).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety of the administered dose of DRL_BZ, RMP, and RP in healthy male
subjects.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The following assessments will be reviewed:
Vital Signs: Pre Dose, 30 mins, 60 mins, Post dose 15 mins, 30 mins, 6 hour, 12 hour, Day 2, Day 3, Day 5, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Day 43, Day 57, Day 71, Day 85
Physical Examination: An abbreviated physical examination will be performed on every alternate day during the residential period and Day 85
ECG: Pre Dose 30 mins, 90mins, Post dose 4 hour, Day 2, Day 5, Day 15, Day 85
Adverse Events will be collected at each and every visit throughout the trial
Clinical Laboratory Tests: Screening, Day 8, Day 15 and Day 85</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the immunogenicity of the administered dose of DRL_BZ, RMP, and RP in healthy
male subjects.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immunogenicity will be assessed by means of the occurrence of ADA, ADA titres, and the occurrence of neutralising antibodies.
Blood Samples taken at Predose, Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 85 will be assessed
After the End-of-Study visit, subjects who are confirmed positive for anti-bevacizumab antibodies will be followed for 12 months after study drug administration.
Blood Sampling will be collected at 6, 9, and 12 months after study drug administration or until 2 consecutive samples have been negative for ADA, whichever comes first. (All
subjects who have an early discontinuation from the study following study drug administration, and are confirmed positive for anti-bevacizumab antibodies will have an
additional visit at 3 months following study drug administration for a follow-up assessment of their ADA status.)</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The diagnostic parameter %AUCex will be reported, as a measure of the percentage of AUC(0-00) obtained by extrapolation. 
The few published values of the inter-subject CV of the PK parameters determined over
sufficient subjects are
- 27.5% (ponderated mean by the number of subjects treated at each dose level for
AUC after multiple dose; AUC was considered because its CV is higher than
those of Cmax, only arithmetic CV available),
- 30.2% (ponderated mean by the number of subjects treated at each dose level for
AUC after multiple doses; AUC was considered because its CV is higher than
those of Cmax, only arithmetic CV available) and
- 31.0% (highest CV% recalculated from bioequivalence comparison confidence
intervals [CIs] after the first dose).
Under the above conditions, a total of 165 evaluable subjects (55 per arm) would provide
90% power for each pairwise comparison assuming geometric mean ratios of 95.00%, a
CV of 31%, using 90% CIs to assess equivalence and the usual pre-defined 80.00% to
125.00% equivalence margins for the geometric mean ratio test/reference on the original
scale. This sample size would provide a power of approximately 80% to show equivalence
for all 3 pairwise comparisons based on simulations under the above assumptions.

Due to the uncertainty in the actual PK variability of bevacizumab and trying to limit the
study size to that strictly needed, a BSSR will be performed after approximately 40
evaluable subjects per arm (150 subjects total assuming 20% dropouts provision) have
completed the study, as little precision is gained in the estimation of the pooled variability
beyond this number. This number of subjects is expected to provide a sufficiently precise
calculation of the variability in the actual study population.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Avastin (Registered Trademark) is currently used in many countries for the treatment of certain cancers.
The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the similarities in the manner in which a new drug, DRL_BZ is distributed around the body compared with European approved and USA licensed Avastin. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a healthy male adult from 20 to 45 years of age with a BMI of 18.0 to 28.5 kg/m2 and body weight of 50 to 100kg. Participants enrolled in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either the new DRL_BZ drug, USA licensed Avastin or European approved Avastin. All participants will receive a single dose which is adjusted for their weight. Participants will have a number of blood samples taken until Day 85 after the dose and will be monitored for side effects for 85 Days. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide information regarding the similarity of drug distribution and safety of the new drug DRL_BZ compared to currently used Avastin for the treatment of certain types of cancer.</summary>
