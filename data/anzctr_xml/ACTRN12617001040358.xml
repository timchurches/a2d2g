    <interventions>Staff working in units which are randomized to intervention group will be able to take part to educational sessions in palliative and end-of-life care over 3 months. The focus of these sessions will be on the importance of familiar and safe surroundings in end-of-life care, encountering a dying patient and his/her family members, communication skills, advance care planning, assessing symptoms and symptom alleviation, working in a way to anticipate complications to avoid crises, life sustaining treatments, and the principles of good quality end-of-life care. The staff are encouraged to assess their residents' needs and wishes concerning to improve and maintain their well-being. The educational sessions include analyses of real-life decision-making regarding transfers to hospital emergency department. Different ways on how the care unit can be prepared to help residents suffering from acute symptoms, on how to relieve symptoms, and when to consult the physician of the unit or the emergency department, will be discussed. Local hospice-at-home care and home nursing services will be collaborated in the education. The possibilities of receiving treatment, assistance and services from hospice-at-home care to the sheltered housing communes, will be collaboratively decided. After receiving the education all the nursing staff and the consulting physicians will be encouraged to approach elderly residents and/or their family members for advance care planning. 
The educational sessions will be performed in small groups of 10-20 staff members. The teaching method will be interactive encouraging discussions and questions. Sessions will encourage the staff members to share and learn from previous experiences and patient cases in their own units to help them enhance a more successful team work. Methods used will also include thorough assessments of real life situations to enable learning from successful cases as well as from possible past mistakes. These sessions are based on constructive learning theory and experiental learning of adult student. While the adult learner has already gained the basic knowledge of the subject, his/her educational needs are complementary to this basic knowledge. The education given to the nursing staff and doctors of the intervention group will include:
-	symptom assessment, symptom relief and good palliative care
-	how to anticipate complications and to avoid unnecessary crises in residents' condition
-	assessing residents' needs and wishes concerning their well-being
-	importance of teamwork, consulting strategies, working with hospice-at-home care
-	hospital transfers and their effect on well-being of residents, acute situations: when is it necessary to refer a patient to emergency department;
-	communication with patient and family members;
-	advance care planning in practice; advance decision-making, Do-Not-Resuscitate  and other physician orders for life sustaining treatments
-	end-of-life care and support to family members.
The aducational sessions will be administered by geriatricians. There will be 4 or5 sessions depending on the educational needs of the staff. The educational needs will be assesssed by a survey before the education is administered. The education will be tailored according to these needs and wishes. The durations of each session will be 3 hours.  
The fidelity and adherence of education will be assessed: how many sessions the members of the staff participate. Their feedback of the sessions will be assessed and in this way their motivation will be supported.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample sizing is based on 15D scoring change. Sample size was estimated as follows: In this population the standard deviation (SD) of 15D score is presumed to be 0.11 (Pitkala et al. 2008), thus a clinically significant change in the 15D score is presumed to be 0.04 (Sintonen 2001). If type I error is 5% and power 80%, to fill these presumptions the sample size would have to be 112 participants per group. As the study and follow-up takes twenty-four months, statistically approximately 40% of the residents, who usually have comorbidities, will die during the follow-up period. Because of the expected high percentage of drop-outs, we will recruit approximately 150 individuals per group to reach at least two assessment points in 112 participants. With this number of participants, we will be able to show a mean 0.8 day difference of hospitalizations between the intervention and control groups, if we assume an SD 2.3 in hospital days (80% power, type I error 5%). 
All participants assessed at baseline and at least at one other time point will be included in the data analyses of the changes in 15D. All randomized participants will be included in the hospital utilization and cost analyses (intention-to-treat). When presenting the results in averages, the median and arithmetic means are used. As expressing variabilities, the standard deviation and the range will be used. In nominally scaled variables distributions will be expressed in proportions. Differences between groups at start will be measured statistically in continuous and normally distributed variables using the t-test.  Ordinal scale variables or variables which do not fulfill the parametric testing presumptions will be statistically measured with Mann-Whitneys U-test. Testing the nominal scale variables will be done using the X²-test or the Fishers exact test. 
Differences between groups in changes of repeatedly measured 15D scores will be tested with generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. Repeated measures will be analyzed using mixed-effect models with the appropriate contrast. As the data for services and costs will be highly skewed, bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap estimation will be used to derive 95% CIs.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this cluster randomized, controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate whether educational intervention in palliative care directed to nursing staff can reduce hospital transfers and improve the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) of older people living in assisted living facilities and nursing homes in Helsinki and Vantaa. We aim to develop a training model that can be used widely in sheltered housing facilities to improve older residents' end-of-life care.
The study will enroll 300 residents of sheltered housing with 24-hour assistance from the cities of Helsinki and Vantaa. The inclusion criteria are: 65+y; Finnish speaking, permanent resident in a sheltered housing, and diagnosis/condition affecting severely health, functioning and prognosis. The participants and their caregivers will be interviewed at baseline, at 6 and 12 months. At 24 months the use of hospitals and other services as well as care transitions will be retrieved from central registers. Primary outcome measures will be HRQoL by 15D measure and use of hospital days during 24-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be number of hospital admissions and other care transitions, use of health services, symptoms by SM-EOLD scale, pain by PAINAD, well-being by PWB, and caregiver satisfaction by SWC-EOLD.  The study nurses will be blinded to randomization. The sheltered housing units will be randomized as units (cluster randomization) to avoid contamination of intervention on control participants. The intervention is an educational package over 3 months including: symptom assessment /alleviation, good palliative care, anticipation of complications to avoid unnecessary crises, assessing residents' needs and wishes concerning their well-being, teamwork, consulting strategies, working with hospice-at-home care, hospital transfers and their effect on well-being of residents, communication with patient and family members, advance care planning, DNR and other orders for life sustaining treatments, end-of-life care and support to family members. The control participants will be treated in normal care in their own wards and own consulting physicians. The trial will start in fall 2017, the follow-up will last until spring 2020; the analyses and reports will be completed in 2021.
