    <concealment>Subject must satisfy all eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent to participate.
Eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomised to one of the four treatment groups (olive oil, omega-3 oral supplement 1, omega-3 oral supplement 2 or topical omega-3 eye drops) using a participant/randomisation number sequence generated in advance that randomly assigns subjects to one of the four groups. This randomisation schedule will be generated by an independent data manager and provided to a separate independent entity responsible for labelling the investigational product. 
To preserve masking within the groups taking the oral supplements, the three different types of oral supplements will be packaged in identical containers. Investigators collecting and analysing data will not be involved in the reconciliation of returned study product.  
After the 12 week intervention period, subjects allocated to the placebo (olive oil) group will then receive two-weeks of treatment with a ‘gold standard’ anti-inflammatory (topical corticosteroid) for two weeks. </concealment>
    <sequence>An independent data manager will generate a simple random number sequence in Microsoft Excel for participant randomisation. The sequence will include equal numbers for the four treatment groups. The code will be kept by the independent data manager and made available for labelling of the investigational product by sequential participant number.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Contact lens discomfort is a multifactorial condition that is characterised by episodic or persistent adverse ocular sensations related to contact lens wear, which can lead to decreased wearing time and discontinuation. Currently, the main form of treatment for contact lens discomfort is the use of artificial tears (lubrication drops), which can assist in reducing these symptoms by supplementing the deficient tear fluid. However, as artificial tears fail to address the underlying cause of the condition, for many patients they are inadequate in completely relieving symptoms. New and enhanced therapeutic treatments are therefore needed. 

Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of contact lens discomfort. The aim of this proof-of-concept, single site clinical trial is to evaluate the benefit of different formulations of omega-3 supplements for treating contact lens discomfort. </summary>
