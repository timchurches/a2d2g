  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises: A cycle of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO) with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance (CMR therapy). The CMR is a biomedical radiofrequency instrument. The protocol used, called Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (ONPF), involves the application of a probe of the CMR on specific points of the auricular pavilion for an activation time of roughly 500 mms. The ONPF protocol is activated in a precise sequence on seven auricular points. The protocol envisages 18 sessions of ONPF treatment on alternating days, for eight (8)weeks. 
Assessment, at baseline and at the end of treatment, with Psychological Stress Measure Test (validated in Italian).</interventions>
    <comparator>The reduction of the subjective perception of stress and stress-related pychophysiologic sensations after an NPPO cycle with CMR device, shows significant results (P&lt;.05), respect to a control group that was treated with inactivated CMR.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A high proportion of patients with emotional problems present only psychophysiologic sensations indicative of general distress. These symptoms are medically unexplained and difficult to treat.
In this study we have use  the Psychological Stress Misure
validated in Italian) to test the effectiveness of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO) with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance - CMR Therapy in reducing the subjective perception of stress and stress-related psychophysiologic sensations. 
The reduction of the symptomatology of stress and stress-related psychophysiologic sensations after an NPPO cycle with CMR therapy shows significant results (P&lt;.05) with respect to a control group that was treated with inactivated CRM.</summary>
