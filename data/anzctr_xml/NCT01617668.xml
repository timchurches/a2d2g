    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - LCL161
Treatment: drugs - paclitaxel

Experimental: Paclitaxel with LCL161 - Patients randomized to the experimental arm received paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly + LECL161 1800 mg once weekly for 12 weeks. Equal numbers of patients with gene expression signature positive and negative disease were included in each treatment arm.

Active Comparator: Paclitaxel without LCL161 - Patients randomized to the control arm received paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks. Equal numbers of patients with gene expression signature positive and negative disease were included in each treatment arm.


Treatment: drugs: LCL161
LCL161 was available as 300 mg, tablets, which was supplied in child-resistant bottles.

Treatment: drugs: paclitaxel
Commercially available paclitaxel was sourced locally by each study site. Generic paclitaxel could be used for study treatment.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate in Breast After 12 Weeks of Therapy - pCR rate was defined as histopathologically confirmed absence of invasive disease in the breast. To assess whether adding LCL161 to weekly paclitaxel enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel in women with triple negative breast cancer. Analyses were performed separately in the gene expression signature negative and positive groups. This analysis was based on Bayesian design using a binomial distribution for the data with a beta prior. The measurement type used for this analysis is posterior median and the method of dispersion is Credible Interval (Crl) and not Confidence Interval (CI). Median values are posterior medians of pCR rate for each group.</outcome>

      <outcome>Difference in pCR Rates Between Treatment Arms - pCR rate was defined as histopathologically confirmed absence of invasive disease in the breast. To assess whether adding LCL161 to weekly paclitaxel enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel in women with triple negative breast cancer. Analyses were performed separately in the gene expression signature negative and positive groups. This analysis was based on the posterior distribution of the difference in pCR rates between the experimental and control arms of the study, within each gene expression signature group.The measurement type used for this analysis is posterior median and the method of dispersion is Credible Interval (Crl) and not Confidence Interval (CI). 95% Confidence interval is actually 95% credible interval.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Posterior Distribution of Difference of pCR Rates After Treatment With LCL161 + Paclitaxel Between Patients With Gene Expression Positive and Negative Tumors - To assess whether use of the gene expression signature identifies tumors more likely to respond to treatment with LCL161 and paclitaxel. The measurement type used for this analysis is posterior median and the method of dispersion is Credible Interval (Crl) and not Confidence Interval (CI). 95% Confidence interval is actually 95% credible interval.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Posterior Distribution of Difference in pCR Rates After Treatment With Paclitaxel Only Between Gene Expression Positive and Negative Tumors - To assess whether use of the gene expression signature identifies tumors more likely to respond to treatment with paclitaxel only. The measurement type used for this analysis is posterior median and the method of dispersion is Credible Interval (Crl) and not Confidence Interval (CI). 95% Confidence interval is actually 95% credible interval.</outcome>

      <outcome>pCR Rate in Breast After 12 Weeks of Therapy With Single Agent LCL161 and LCL161 + Paclitaxel, Regardless of Gene Signature Status - To assess whether adding LCL161 to weekly paclitaxel enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel in women with triple negative breast cancer regardless of tumor gene expression signature status. This comparison is between the 2 study treatments, regardless of gene signature status. The measurement type used for this analysis is posterior median and the method of dispersion is Credible Interval (Crl) and not Confidence Interval (CI). 95% Confidence interval is actually 95% credible interval.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>pCR Rate in Breast, Regional Nodes and Axilla - To assess other indicators of disease response for the LCL161 + paclitaxel combination compared to paclitaxel alone. The pCR in breast, regional nodes, and axilla were determined based on the America Joint Committee on Cancer Staging [AJCC] stages T1c, T2, N0-N2, M0) were (AJCC) pathologic staging recorded on the eCRF: a patient was considered to be a responder in breast, regional nodes, and axilla if the pathological complete response was reported for breast and if the regional lymph nodes staging was pN0 (including i-, mol-, mol+).The measurement type used for this analysis is posterior median and the method of dispersion is Credible Interval (Crl) and not Confidence Interval (CI). 95% Confidence interval is actually 95% credible interval.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rates of Breast Conserving Surgery and Mastectomy - Assessed by Percentage of Patients Who Underwent Breast Conserving Surgery, Masectomy and no Surgery - To assess other indicators of disease response for the LCL161 + paclitaxel combination compared to paclitaxel alone. Rates of breast conserving surgery and mastectomy also contributed to the overall assessment of disease response and were summarized by treatment arm within each gene expression signature status. For this analysis, patients with multicentric breast cancer were excluded, as all patients in this group were expected to be treated with mastectomy.</outcome>
