  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Guselkumab
Treatment: drugs - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Secukinumab

Experimental: Group I: Guselkumab Plus Placebo - Participants will receive 1 injection of active guselkumab and 1 injection of placebo when guselkumab is scheduled to be administered (Weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, and 44) or 2 injections of placebo when no guselkumab is scheduled to be administered (Weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40). Placebo injections will be administered to maintain the blind.

Active Comparator: Group II: Secukinumab - Participants will receive 2 injections of active secukinumab subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and every 4 weeks (q4w) thereafter through Week 44.


Treatment: drugs: Guselkumab
Participants will receive 1 injection of active guselkumab at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, and 44.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Participants will receive 1 injection of placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, and 44 and 2 injections of placebo at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40.

Treatment: drugs: Secukinumab

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants who Achieve Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 48 - The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 90 response was defined as at least a 90 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to baseline.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants who Achieve PASI 75 Response at Both Week 12 and Week 48 - The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to baseline.</outcome>
