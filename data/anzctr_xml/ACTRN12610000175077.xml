  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness and tolerability of integrated radiotherapy and chemotherapy with oxaliplatin 5-flurouracil (5-fu) and folinic acid before surgery in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum (back passage). 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have locally advanced cancer of the rectum (back passage) which you have not yet received treatment for. 

Trial details 
Participants will receive integrated preoperative radiotherapy with FOLFOX chemotherapy over 11 weeks, prior to standard surgery 4-6 weeks later . Patients will be monitored to determine their tolerance and response to treatment.</summary>
