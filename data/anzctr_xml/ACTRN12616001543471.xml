  <interventions>
    <interventions>Thinking in motion-
A physical training program , which offers  cognitive challenge's as  dual task, memory Challenge's, attention Challenge's, orientation Challenge's
and more: based on EWMN motion Observation.
Training takes place 3 times a week for 3 months in groups of max 14 participants for 45 minutes.
The intervention sessions are designed in three parts:
A. Warm-up- preparing the body for physical activity, experience working with rhythm, mood elevation and motivation. The warm-up  takes place in a circle with rhythmic background music. This part has both physically and mentally purpose. Exercises intervention may be frustrating for practitioners and one of the goals in the warm-up  is to create a good atmosphere high spirits motivation, fun and create a sense of partnership. The warm-up structure is inspired by dance therapy groups of Chase (Chaiklin, Schmais, &amp; Lewis, 1986). Additionally, the warm-up  is important for softening the joints, increasing range of motion, strengthening muscle power, balance and other contractile elements relevant to exercises which will appear later in the practice.
B. The central part of the training -  The exercise session will focus on one or two exercises how will develop. The exercises is performed with metronome background or music.
C. End - creating a ending  activity, coping positively with frustration and a sense of partnership. Closer  will take place by highlighting success and carrying out a task as a meaningful achievement and as a "grand Finale " . In addition, the physical goal is to bring the body into a state of rest, stretching muscles, and regulation of breathing.

The intervention is face to face with a guide in a closed room, with  a circle of chairs, music and blackboard.
The intervention is customized by level of functioning of  the group members.
The intervention guide  hes a BE.d degree and a teaching certificate in the field of theater and dance and MA in movement therapy from the University of Haifa . Has extensive experience in dance training and experience of three years working with the elderly in movement .
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is given the option to train independently using a computer training course by Cognifit/ they are given the recommendation to practice 3 times a week for 3 months
During working hours at the center day they heve the possibility to request technical support for connecting the software and reading the tasks.
The software provides computer training. Each training session lasts 20 minutes+- . The training includes 3-4 a short games practicing different cognitive abilities .

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the effectiveness of a unique movement intervention which is based on a theoretical model and inspiration by Eshkol Wachman motion note (EWMN). This study examines the effect of this intervention on walking ability in ecological situations, by performing a dual-task (walking while performing a cognitive task simultaneously). While examining the inclusion potential in this training and examining other parameters that has potential to underlie expected changes as cognitive function, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. The study is a randomized clinical trial. At the beginning of the study T0- tests will be executed. After examining the results of the MoCA test, subjects will be divided according to cognitive function to control it as a intervening variable. After this distribution, the subjects will randomly be divided into intervention and control group. The intervention group will receive training three times a week for three months and the control group will be given the opportunity to train independently using a computer training program by Cognifit- with a recommendation to practice three times a week for 3 months. After three months of training subject will be test again- T1, to examine the effect of the exercise. The main hypothesis of the research is that the intervention group will improve in dual-task performance and improve in the quality of walking such as speed, step size and variability of steps. Such findings will indicate this training to be effective in improving the quality of walking and hopefully helps to reduce falls in the elderly</summary>
