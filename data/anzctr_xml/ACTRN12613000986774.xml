  <interventions>
    <interventions>Excision with conjunctival autograft involves removal of the pterygium leaving an area of bare sclera, which is closed by the movement of a free conjunctival transplant from another part of the ocular surface.   The conjunctival autograft will be attached with autologous blood acting as a bioadhesive.  The surgical intervention takes approximately 30 minutes and patients will be followed at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.  </interventions>
    <comparator>There will be 2 comparator groups.  One group  of participants will have the conjunctival autograft attached with vicryl sutures and another group will have the conjunctival autograft attached with fibrin glue.  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical assumptions based on researchers experience have been used.  Patients with vicryl sutures tend to have more postoperative pain (5/10) compared to those with fibrin glue or autologous blood (1-2/10).  Sample size calculations were completed based on these assumptions and 30 patients in each group was determined to be suffient to show a statistical difference with 80% power and 95% confidence level.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our aim is to study the efficacy of pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft with autologous blood and compare with the gold standards of sutured autograft and autograft with fibrin glue. Conjunctival autografts with autologous blood have been reported to be effective in the literature.  Only a small number of prospective studies with small numbers of patients have studied conjunctival autografts with autologous blood.  Comparing this method to that with sutures and with fibrin glue will provide meaningful comparative data on efficacy of method, rates of recurrence, cost and patient comfort.  We hypothesize that patients will experience less discomfort and will have similar rates of graft stability and recurrence.  </summary>
