  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single oral dose of methylphenidate (40 mg) capsule and a placebo lactose tablet will be administered to healthy adults to investigate the neurochemical basis of self-control. All participants will receive all conditions of treatment over two separate sessions. The two testing sessions will be separated by at least one week to allow for drug washout. The order in which each participant receives the two treatment conditions is randomised and blinded. No abnormal condition or disease is being investigated as part of this study. The medications in this study are already approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resource depletion - when people are given two consecutive tasks that require self-control, they generally perform worse on the second task compared to when participants perform a task that does not require self-control followed by self-control task, suggesting that self-control is a depletable resource. We will measure the participant's cognitive performance using computer tasks following custom designed computer tasks known to induce depletion of self-control. During these tasks participants will be asked to press buttons to visual stimuli (e.g., abstract symbols and objects).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ones ability to self regulate or control their behaviour is important for human function, and recent studies have suggested that self-control is a depletable resource. When participants perform two consecutive tasks that require self-control, their performance on the second task is worse than when people perform a task that does not require self-control followed by a self-control task. This phenomenon is referred to as resource-depletion. Although previous studies have shown that methylphenidate can improve various aspects of self-control, its effects on resource depletion are unknown. We will give methylphenidate to healthy individuals to investigate its effect on cognitive performance following resource depletion. We will also measure cardioviascular responses, cortisol levels and record electroencephalography (EEG) to study the neural processes associated with resource depletion, and those influenced by methylphenidate.</summary>
