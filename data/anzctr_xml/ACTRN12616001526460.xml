  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend a baseline visit at the Brien Holden Vision Institute, where a qualified optometrist will measure their best-corrected subjective refraction (required sphere power and required cylinder power) using a phoropter.

Following the baseline, participants will attend 4 separate visits on different days at the Brien Holden Vision Institute. Each visit will take approximately 30 minutes.

At each of these visits, participants will undergo pre-determined changes to their cylindrical axis and power in a randomised fashion using a phoropter, by a qualified optometrist. Visual acuity (taken with an electronic letter chart at 6 metres) and subjective vision response (clarity, vision satisfaction using a 1-10 numeric scale) will be obtained for each change.

A different cylinder power is assessed at each visit: (1) the required cylinder power, (2) the required cylinder power minus 0.25 D, (3) the required cylinder power minus 0.50 D or (4) the required cylinder power minus 0.75 D. The order of these powers is randomised.

Within each visit, the following cylindrical axes will be tested in a randomised fashion: aligned, misaligned by +10 degrees, +20 degrees, +30 degrees, -10 degrees, -20 degrees, -30 degrees. 

In summary, at each of the four visits, participants will be shown 7 different views of a letter chart, and vison and subjective response will be measured for each view.

The washout period between each cylindrical axis will be approximately 5 minutes. The washout period between each cylindrical power will be at least one night.</interventions>

    <exclusivecriteria>-Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including
infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would
affect visual acuity measurements.

adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical
trial.

    <statisticalmethods>Visual acuity will be recorded on a LogMAR scale. Data will be summarised as means +/- standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Visual acuity will be compared between cylindrical powers and axis using repeated measures ANOVA and/or linear mixed model. Interactions will be tested and, if present, the significance of a factor will be determined for each level of the other factor.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to find out how varying eye prescription impacts on vision and satisfaction of vision. To achieve this, we wish to monitor participants' eyes responses to the changes to their prescription we introduce. A minimum of 20 people will take part in this study.
At each visit, a pre-determined number of changes to their prescription will be shown to the participant through a phoropter (standard optometric equipment used to determine spectacle prescriptions), they will then be asked to read a letter chart and rate their vision clarity and satisfaction.</summary>
