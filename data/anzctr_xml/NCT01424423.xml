    <inclusivecriteria>-  Suitable as determined by the Principal Investigator, based on his/her overall
             evaluation. A patient with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The drug being tested in this study is GSK1223249. The drug works by inhibiting a protein
      that prevents nerve growth.

      The trial is expected to involve approximately 36 patients. The study objective is to
      investigate the tolerability, safety and the way the body handles GSK1223249 after a range of
      single doses in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).</summary>
