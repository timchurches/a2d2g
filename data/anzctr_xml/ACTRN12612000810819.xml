  <interventions>
    <interventions>On each testing day, participants consume four capsules containing an inert placebo, 320mg of KeenMind(Registered Trademark) (CDRI 08) BM extract or 640mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) (CDRI 08) BM extract. KeenMind (Registered Trademark) (CDRI 08) is standardized for no less than 55% of total bacosides. Each capsule contains 160 mg BM extract (25:1) equivalent to 4 g of dried herb. 

Each participant is required to attend a total of 4 sessions  (1 practice visit and 3 study visits) that will be conducted one week apart to ensure sufficient washout between each acute condition. Total amount of testing days is 4 weeks (inclusive of practice visit).

There will be three separate testing days where either the placebo, 320 mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) or 640 mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) will be taken exclusively each day.</interventions>

      <outcome>Cardiovascular measures
- blood pressure
- arterial stiffness
- cerebral blood flow

Brachial blood pressure is calculated in the morning with the participant seated and following a 5 min rest period. All measurements are calculated using an automatic sphygmomanometer, designed for professional use (Omron, 705IT) and validated according to both the European
Hypertension Society (EHS) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocols. Measurements are completed using an appropriately sized cuff by an experienced research assistant and a cardiac technologist. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is calculated according to the following formula (2 x DBP + SBP)/3. Pulse pressure and augmentation index PP and augmentation index are calculated centrally using a non-invasive device (SphygmoCor; AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) by means of applanation tonometry. Through a mathematical transfer function, SphygmoCor derived the ascending aortic waveform from a recording of the radial artery before automatically calculating a range of cardiovascular parameters indicative of arterial stiffness. PP is automatically calculated by deducting the central diastolic pressure from the central systolic pressure whereas central augmentation index is calculated by dividing the augmentation pressure by the PP, multiplied by 100. All recordings are to be completed with the participant sitting down whilst their arm rested on a table with their palm facing upwards.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants responded to advertisements. After successfully completing a telephone screen, they completed a practice session where they were introduced to the computerised test, passed a brief medical test and informed consent was obtained. They were then given a numerical identification number and was randomly allocated to a treatment series. Participants then returned for 3 testing sessions, receiving a different treatment each visit. The person who determined if a participant was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the participant would be allocated. Allocation was concealed by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is aiming to determine the effects of Bacopa on cognitive function, cardiovascular function and stress. Bacopa is a herb found in wetlands and muddy shore lines that has been used in traditional Indian medicine as a treatment for epilepsy and asthma. Russo &amp; Borrelli (2005) claim that it has been used for over 3000 years as a memory and intellect enhancer. There is also evidence to suggest that Bacopa is an antioxidant, playing an important role in reducing the oxidation of fats in the bloodstream.

This study will investigate the cognitive, cardiovascular and stress effects of a two doses of bacopa compared to placebo.

Participants will be required to consume one of three treatments on each testing day, and will consume the other treatments on the other two days of testing. After the first battery of tests, each participant will be administered their treatment and have a two hour wait period. At the end of this period the participant will complete the second series of battery tests. There will be a seven day washout period and the process will be repeated again.
(1) Bacopa  320mg 
(2) Bacopa  640mg
(3) Placebo</summary>
