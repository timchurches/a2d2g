  <interventions>
    <interventions>Supplemental oxygen either 35% through a venturi mask, or 60% through a breathing circuit.

A venturi mask, also known as an air-entrainment mask, is a medical device worn over the mouth and nose, that delivers a known oxygen concentration to patients.  It is attached via long tubing to an oxygen cylinder during the endurance shuttle walk testing.

The breathing circuit is routinely used in cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a stationary bike, allowing investigators to measure oxygen uptake and expired carbon dioxide.  It is also a convenient way of delivering supplemental oxygen during such testing. It has a mouthpiece much like scuba diving apparatus and is secured to the patient via a support frame over the head. 

These two devices will only be worn during the exercise tests, (10 to 30 minutes in duration).

As per trial protocol, this is a crossover study, where each individual will perform 2 endurance shuttle walk tests (1 on oxygen via venturi mask, the other on air (sham) via venturi mask).  The same individuals will also perform 2 maximal exercise tests on a stationary bike (1 on oxygen via breathing circuit, the other on air (sham) via breathing circuit).  Crossover from intervention to placebo or vice versa will occur not less than 24 hours apart, and not greater than 28days apart.  The washout period required for supplemental oxygen is only 15 to 20 minutes, but the 24 hours between testing is to allow complete recovery from the exercise itself.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control arm will involve giving air through the same devices (venturi mask and breathing circuit).  There will be no way for the subject to determine if they are breathing oxygen or air.  There will be no difference in test procedures between intervention and control.  The air is a placebo or sham intervention, because there is no physiologic difference between breathing air with or without a mask (or breathing circuit). This arm of the study is to assess the subjects' performance unaided, versus the active arm which involves the addition of oxygen.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study looking at exercise physiology in people with lung fibrosis.  In particular, investigators are interested in the role of oxygen in exercise endurance, maximal exercise levels, and in its effect on reducing strain on the heart.

Participants will perform endurance exercise tests and maximal exercise testing on both air and oxygen. The hypothesis is that oxygen will improve endurance and reduce strain on the heart.  This study will form the basis for future trials that examine the benefits of supplemental oxygen over longer periods.</summary>
