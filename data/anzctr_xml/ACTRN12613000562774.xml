  <interventions>
    <interventions>The denervation procedure itself involves an endovascular catheter-based approach to disrupt renal sympathetic nerves using radiofrequency (RF) ablation. This is a single intervention, which takes approximately 40 minutes for the proceedure in the cardiology angiography suite. This procedure will by performed by Assoc Prof G Wilkins. Data will be collected at baseline (over a week prior to the procedure) and following renal denervation at 1, 3, and 12 months. The impact of renal denervation will be measured by changes in blood pressure; cardiac function by way of holter monitoring and echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular function; multiunit postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) will be recorded through the use of microneurography in the peroneal nerve; circulating plasma catecholamines as an indirect marker of sympathetic activity</interventions>
    <comparator>An open interventional study with each participant acting as their own control. Each individual will have baseline studies of blood pressure, cardiac function (holter monitoring for 48 hours to assess beat to beat variability and echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular function), MSNA studies, blood samples taken to measure circulating plasma catecholamines. Following the baseline measurements, the individual will undergo the endoluminal ablation of their renal sympathetic nerves by radiofrequency ablation. They will then be followed closely for the next 12 months, with repeat measurements of the above parameters at 1 month, 3 months and 12 months.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Assessment: MSNA levels from baseline to the above time points (1,3, 12 months) will be evaluated to calculate mean change, as well as 95% CIs. This change will be assessed by repeated-measures ANOVA with pairwise comparison of significant values. A 2-tailed paired t test of P&lt;0.05 to be regarded as statistically significant. Other measures such as 24 hour BP, holter monitoring, plasma catecholamines, LV Mass, etc will be compared in a similar manner.
This is a pilot study. There has been no such previous interventions in this group of patients. As such there is no data to inform a power calculation. This pilot study is to generate such data to inform a properly conducted randomised intervention trial in the future.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sudden cardiac death accounts for 26-45% of cardiovascular deaths in patients on dialysis. Sympathetic overactivity from the diseased kidneys is thought to contribute substantially to the high risk of cardiac events. The Australasian Kidney Trials Network (AKTN) have initiated a feasibility study of beta blocker therapy (BLOCADE) to test the tolerability of carvidolol in dialysis patients, with the view to a full study investigating sympathetic blockade on cardiac events in dialysis patients. Renal sympathetic denervation by radiofrequency ablation is a new novel alternative to medical therapy to reduce sympathetic overactivity. It would be logical to compare ÃŸ blocker therapy to renal denervation in dialysis patients in a head to head study.  However, it is necessary to test the feasibility of renal denervation in this high risk group and to obtain appropriate data that would accurately inform end points and surrogate markers of the endpoints.  The surrogate end points are changes in blood pressure, reduction in anti-hypertensive medications, changes in heart rate, changes in sympathetic nerve activity measured directly by microneurography and indirectly by changes in circulating neuro-hormones. 
This application is for a feasibility study to inform scientific committee of the AKTN to allow a well designed intervention study to reduce sudden cardiac death in a very high risk population, that is patients on dialysis.
