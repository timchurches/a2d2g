    <concealment>A central Coordinating Centre in The USA will design and maintain a secure website system for enrolment and randomisation assignments. Only authorized site personnel are given access to the randomisation pages. On the website, authorized site personnel will enter participant eligibility information and verify that the parent/guardian signed informed consent. The system will verify that the participant is eligible and then provide the authorized site personnel with a unique randomisation assignment number that matches a number on the treatment (HS or IS) package stored at the site . Randomisation to HS or IS will be stratified by age (36 to 54 months, 55 to 72 months). </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation list will be created based on random permuted blocks stratified on age. Electronic copies of the randomisation lists will be archived in a secure off-site location for the duration of the trial and for three years thereafter.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>120 patients (approximately 55 subjects from Australia, 55 from Europe, and 10 from two US centres) will be recruited to the study. Multiple linear regression will be used to determine the cross-sectional (values at end of study) and longitudinal (change in outcomes between beginning and end of study) relationships between LCI, the volume proportion of the lung with structural airways disease assessed by PRAGMA-CF  and secondary PRAGMA-CF outcomes percentage bronchiectasis and trapped air), and airway dimensions relative to adjacent arteries outcomes, with exposure variables included as appropriate. The relative ability of PRAGMA-CF and LCI to discriminate between treatment and active comparator arms will be determined by using linear regression against percentage disease and LCI in separate analyses, in the subset of patients with matched LCI and CT data.

For the power calculation, we used the mean (standard deviation) %Dis as measured on TLC CTs in fifty 4-6 year old children in the Perth CF cohort: 5.18 (2.54)%, with a range of 1.05  14.13%. A sample size of 50 in equal size groups with alpha=0.05 and beta=0.80 will be able to detect a difference of 1.44% (i.e. relative difference between the two treatment arms of 28% given the anticipated level of 5.18%). We estimate that we will fail to acquire a scan, or scan of sufficient quality at the end of study in around 20% of children. Hence we aim to enrol approximately 60 patients per group to end up with 50 patients per group with a chest CT scan.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with cystic fibrosis (CF) often have thick mucus in the airways of the lungs that is hard to cough up. The mucus builds up and eventually leads to chronic cough and lung infections. Research has shown that even young children with CF may have thickened mucus in the lungs.
Inhaling a concentrated salt solution, called hypertonic saline (HS), may help thin the mucus in the lungs. Thinning the mucus can make it easier to cough up. This helps to clear the lungs and improve lung health. Research studies about the safety and effectiveness of inhaled HS have been done in adults and children with CF 6 years of age and older. Patients in these studies took HS for up to a year. HS appears to be a safe treatment in these age groups. The main side effects were cough, throat irritation, and wheezing. The use of HS in older children and adults decreased the need for antibiotics for acute respiratory infections. It also improved lung function and quality of life.  HS is now routinely used by many CF patients over 6 years of age. Because HS treats a very early step in the chain of events that leads to chronic lung problems in people with CF, it may be particularly helpful when started early in life. 
Based on several studies, HS appears to be safe in children less than 6 years of age, but its effectiveness has been difficult to measure.  In a previous study, children less than 6 year-old receiving HS had the same number of lung infections as children receiving normal saline. However, we think that children this young need a more sensitive test to see if HS works in preventing lung damage.  In this study Computed Tomography (CT) scans will be used to get an image of the lung. In addition a new type of breathing test, called Multiple Breath Washout (MBW), will be used. This is relatively easy for preschool children to perform, and may allow us to measure the effectiveness of HS in preschool children with CF. The MBW tests measures lung function. This study will be conducted in parallel with the North American SHIP001 clinical study, registered on Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02378467. </summary>
