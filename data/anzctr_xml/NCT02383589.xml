    <summary>This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, parallel-arm,
      multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab compared with MMF in
      participants with moderate-to-severely active PV requiring 60-120 milligrams per day (mg/day)
      oral prednisone or equivalent. Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of PV within the
      previous 24 months (by skin or mucosal biopsy and immunohistochemistry) and evidence of
      active disease at screening.

      Approximately 124 participants will be enrolled at up to 60 centers worldwide. Participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rituximab plus MMF placebo or rituximab
      placebo plus MMF. Randomization will be stratified by duration of illness.

      The study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to 28 days, a 52-week
      double-blind treatment period, and a 48-week safety follow up period that begins at the time
      of study treatment completion or discontinuation.</summary>
