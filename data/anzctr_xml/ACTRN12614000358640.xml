    <studytitle>Randomised Controlled Trial on the modification of drinking and safety behaviour through the use of participant designed, self generated text messages via mobile phones delivered at times scheduled by the participant
</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In people aged 18 or over, do self-designed and self-scheduled text messages delivered via a web application to their phones prompt safer drinking practices while they are out socialising with friends? Are personally designed and scheduled messages more effective in reducing harms than are predesigned &amp; scheduled safe drinking messages?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to 3 month access to a web site which (a) allows them to generate text for their own messages or (b) sends pre-set and pre-timed safe drinking messages. In group (a), the frequency of use of the web site and messaging is at the participants own discretion. They are the most qualified to determine when they will need a prompt to consider their safety and drinking behaviour. The web site provides no information on alcohol related harms.  It provides no suggested messages or message topics to Group A. 
 
Group (b) will have 3 months access to the web site messaging. Their messages will be pre-set and relate to keeping safe while drinking. (see comparator section)</interventions>
    <comparator>For Group B, 20 messages are sent over 13 weeks, primarily on Saturday or Friday and occasionally on Thursday.  A participant will receive 2 messages / week on most weeks
Most of the messages are delivered between 8.30 pm and 11.30 pm, as indicated from the feasibility studies. Examples of these messages include:Time to grab some food; I could have a coffee now; Time to call a taxi?;Ease up on the drink

    <sequence>Participants will be randomized in 1:1 rate (block size of 4) to each of the two groups using Fishers Method of Blocked Randomisation programmed into the intervention web site . The pattern consists of groups of 4 with 3 groups completing a pattern for 12 participants.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>For each treatment group, paired t tests will be used to assess the treatment effect between baseline and 13 weeks and at 6 months using a repeated measures design. Change in consequence scores from baseline to 13 weeks using t tests will assess the effect of the intervention.  Change from 13 weeks to 6 months using t tests will assess the longevity of the treatment effect. The feasibility study intervention group, which created self-designed safe drinking messages, reported a reduction in harms of 23% over three months with dropout rate of 17.6% compared with a harm reduction of 3% in the control group (Renner et al, under review).    Based on these data, a sample size of 45 participants per group (total 90) is required to provide 90% power at p=0.05 to detect an absolute difference between the two groups of 20%.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Feasibility studies on the SPILLIT safe drinking intervention have shown that participants are willing to create their own personal safe drinking messages and schedule when these messages should be sent to their mobile phone.

A full RCT is now required to assess the treatment effect of personalised safe drinking messages.  This will be accomplished by comparing the SPILLIT intervention design (Treatment A) with a safe drinking intervention which provides pre-designed and scheduled safe drinking messages (Treatment B) to the participants.  These pre-designed messages will be sourced from the HPA (ALAC) safe drinking messages (used with permission) and from the anonymous messages generated during the feasibility studies.  

I wish to note a change to my protocol to implement this RCT.
