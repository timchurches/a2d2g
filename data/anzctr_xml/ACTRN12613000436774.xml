    <interventions>Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiosurgery (SABR) involves highly hypofractionated radiotherapy given as an ablative treatment. A single fraction of 20Gy will be the prescribed dose.
As part of this study you will be required to discuss your past medical history and progress of your prostate cancer with the doctor. A general physical examination with a focus on where the cancer has spread to is part of the study. You will have standard blood tests including your hormone levels and prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. Also as part of this study you will be required to have a special scan called an 18F-PET/CT (stands for fluoride-positron emission tomography/computer tomography) scan. This involves an injection of a radioactive chemical and then a scan to see where your prostate cancer has spread to.
If the tests show that the research study is suitable for you, and you still wish to take part, you can join the study and begin the treatment.
Prior to your stereotactic body radiotherapy you will be required to fill out quality of life and pain questionnaires. This may take up to 20 minutes of your time. You will have either a single session ofstereotactic body radiotherapy (SABR) or in the rare situation where there is not enough time available you may be required to return for two sessions (if you have two lesions) and three sessions (if you have three lesions).
In order to deliver this treatment, you will need to attend a planning CT scan session, where you will receive a CT scan and your body measurements are taken in the position that you will be lying in for your radiotherapy. This visit takes approximately one hour. Once the radiotherapy treatment has been planned, a further mock-up visit is required to ensure that the radiotherapy plan can be smoothly delivered when it comes to the time of treatment. This session will take between 45 minutes and 90 minutes. When the treatment starts, the total time required to deliver the treatment will be approximately one hour. All sessions are usually conducted on different days and we will contact you to give you the dates and times to attend for these sessions once they have been booked for you.
Follow-up will involve a visit at approximately 1 month, and every 3 months until two years after the radiotherapy treatment. At each visit you will be reviewed by the doctor and have a prostate blood test (PSA). At each visit you will be expected to indicate on a questionnaire if you have any pain. At the 1, 3, 12 and 24 month visits you will be expected to fill out a quality of life questionnaire which will take about 20 minutes of your time. You will have a whole body bone scan at 12 or 24 months after your treatment. At 6 months after your radiotherapy treatment you will have another 18F-PET/CT scan, which will be very similar to the scan before your treatment. The purpose of this scan is to assess the effect of the treatment on your lesion(s).

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the feasibility of SABR in prostate cancer patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer (up to 3 bone or lymph node metastases).
Feasibility will be considered to have been achieved for a given patient if both of the following conditions hold true for that patient:

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To estimate effectiveness of treatment
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The effectiveness of treatment will be assessed by means of the local progression free survival (LPFS) at 2 years post treatment. LPFS at 2 years will be estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve, along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.

The QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific, self-administered, structured questionnaire designed for use in clinical trials, it contains 30 questions (items). The QLQBM22 is a validated additional module designed for patients with bone metastases

    <statisticalmethods>Primary Aim:
The point estimate for feasibility as a binary variable will be provided along with its 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Feasibility will be considered to have been achieved for a given patients if all of the following conditions hold true for that patient: 
a) Successful completion of treatment within +/- 3 days of intended treatment
b) Image guidance verification of treatment delivery within 5mm
The point estimate for feasibility as a binary variable will be provided along with its 95% CI.
Tolerability will be defined as:
a)No greater than 15% of patients will experience a grade III or higher acute toxicity
b)There will be no grade 5 toxicities related to SABR
Secondary Aims:
The proportion of patients who suffer from grade 3 or higher acute toxicities will be provided along with its 95% CI. Acute toxicities monitored will include General, Gastro-intestinal, Hepato-biliary, Musculo-skeletal and Renal and urinary disorders
The effectiveness of treatment will be assessed by means of the local progression free survival (LPFS) at 2 years post treatment. LPFS at 2 years will be estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve, along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.
Quality of life of patients will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BM22 instruments. A trained PET physician will provide a visual analysis of Na-18F PET scans. Na-18F PET response will be described at 6 and 24 months as counts and percentages with exact 95% confidence intervals.
Analysis Plan: 
Two analyses are planned. The analysis for the primary endpoints will be performed after the last patient has been followed for 3 months and the analysis for the secondary endpoints will be performed after 2 years of follow-up.
The sample size of 30 patients is pragmatic. If 24 feasible cases are observed in the sample of 30, (an 80% feasibility rate) then the 90% CI for the true underlying rate is [64%, 91%]. The 95% confidence interval will be [61%, 92%].

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is assessing the feasibility and safety of Stereotactic  Ablative Body Radiosurgery (SABR) in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. 
Who is it for?
You may be eligible for this study if you have Prostate Cancer that has spread to lymph nodes or the bones. 
Trial Details:
The research project is testing a new treatment for prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate to the lymph nodes or bones. The new treatment is called Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy.
Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy. Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) appears to be effective in controlling cancer in other sites elsewhere in the body, including the lung, kidney and the liver. We aim to test the ability of this new technique to control cancers arising from the prostate, and that have spread to bone or lymph nodes.
As part of this study you will be required to discuss your past medical history and progress of your prostate cancer with the doctor. A general physical examination with a focus on where the cancer has spread to is part of the study. You will have standard blood tests including your hormone levels and prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. Also as part of this study you will be required to have a special scan called an 18F-PET/CT (stands for fluoride-positron emission tomography/computer tomography) scan. This involves an injection of a radioactive chemical and then a scan to see where your prostate cancer has spread to.
If the tests show that the research study is suitable for you, and you still wish to take part, you can join the study and begin the treatment.
Prior to your stereotactic body radiotherapy you will be required to fill out quality of life and pain questionnaires. This may take up to 20 minutes of your time. You will have either a single session of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SABR) or in the rare situation where there is not enough time available you may be required to return for two sessions (if you have two lesions) and three sessions (if you have three lesions).
