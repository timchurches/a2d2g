  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>We hypothesize that there will be a higher rate of endotracheal tube leak in uncuffed compared with cuffed tubes, and that the rate of sore throat will be higher in the uncuffed group.</healthcondition>
    <healthcondition>We hypothesise that the rate of respiratory complications will be similar between the groups receiving either cuffed or uncuffed endotracheal tubes.</healthcondition>
    <healthcondition>We furthermore hypothesise that the loss in lung volume following a standardized recruitment maneouver will be greater in the children intubated with uncuffed ETTs as compared with cuffed ETTs.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparing the use of Cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETT) to Uncuffed endotracheal tubes in the paediatric population.
The tubes will be used during elective surgery requiring invasive airway management. The duration of use will depend on the duration of the procedure in general between 30 and 120 min.</interventions>
    <comparator>The patients will be randomised to receive either a cuffed or an uncuffed ETT. 
The differences between the tubes will be assessed using standardised volume ventilation to identify the leak between the different ETT devices and age groups. 

Treatment: Volume ventilation - Tidal volume of 6ml/kg 

Baseline tidal volumes &amp; lung compliance prior to and after standardised recruitment manouvers.

Recruitment manoure 10 slow breaths up to 35 cmH2O with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O then Pressure Support Ventilation  Peak pressure 10 on PEEP of 5

Incidence of respiratory adverse events (bronchospasm, laryngospasm, coughing, desaturations &lt; 95%, airway obstruction &amp; stridor in both groups.

Documenting incidence of above on CRF

Incidence of sore throat &amp; airway trauma in both groups.
Documentation of blood staining on airway device post removal &amp; completion of validated pain questionnaire by parent /child prior to discharge.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>There will be a higher rate of endotracheal tube leak in uncuffed compared with cuffed tubes.
This will be assessed by calculating the difference between inspiratory and exspiratory tidal volumes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intraoperativley</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of sore throat will be higher in the uncuffed group.
This will be assessed postoperatively using a VAS scale 0-10.</outcome>

    <concealment>The patients will be randomised by computer generated block randomization. 

The randomization will be divided into 2 groups: School (&gt; 6 years) and preschool children (&lt; 6 years) with half the children recruited into each group.

Following written informed consent, the participant will be assigned the next available Participant Number in the randomised group. The Participant Number will correspond to a numbered randomisation envelope. The randomisation will be concealed in the closed envelope and will only be opened by the anaesthetist in charge of the patient at induction of anaesthesia. The participant number will be used to identify the patient for the duration of the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Having an operation is very safe for most patients and we wish to do research to improve patient care. To ensure the safe delivery of oxygen and anaesthesia gases to the child, the anaesthetist will insert a tube into the childs mouth. Then the childs lungs can be inflated and deflated by these gases. There are two tubes which can be used for this purpose. Both look very similar, except one has an inflatable balloon on the end. Both devices do the same thing and have been independently shown to be safe for use in children. However, a direct comparison between the two tubes is lacking in the paediatric population on how easily the lungs can be inflated.  Therefore, the first aim of this study is to show if there are differences in inflating the childs lungs. The second aim is to show there are no differences in the potential injury to the childs throat from either tube type.</summary>
