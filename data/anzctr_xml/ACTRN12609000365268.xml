  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise training: Exercise training sessions of 30 minutes' duration, 5 times per week, for 8 weeks. The exercise modalities were walking and running on flat ground and cycling on a cycle ergometer. Participants conducted 10 minutes of each modality at each training session with no break between modalities. The exercise sessions were supervised by a sports coach. The target intensity was moderate, determined by the sports coach who asked the participants about their level of exertion and also noted that their respiratory rates were elevated but that they could still speak in sentences. 
Other usual daily activities were also maintained throughout the duration of the study. These did not include any other specific exercises, and included daily self care, and group activities such as printing, painting, hand craft, and theatre.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligibility was first confirmed by one investigator. Following confirmation of eligibility, enrollment, and baseline measurements, a second investigator (who was not involved in assessment of eligibility or enrollment or baseline measurements) flipped a coin to randomly allocate each participant to one of the two treatment groups. Therefore the first investigator (who decided whether a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial) was unaware when that decision was made to which group the subjects would be allocated.</concealment>
