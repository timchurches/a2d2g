  <interventions>
    <interventions>This was a proof of concept and not a randomised trial. A non-concurrent, prospective, comparison trial was conducted where we recruited 120 and 114 women into intervention and comparison groups respectively. Women in the intervention group received MumBubConnect, a text messaging service with automated responses delivered once a week for 8 weeks. Breastfeeding practice, self-efficacy, perceived social support and coping strategies were all observed and measured at baseline and at week nine. Women were sent a reminder text if they had not responded, women not responding to more than two text messages were phoned. The content of the text messages included an enquiry text to which the women responded with key words and received back information to help them problem solve with a helpline number or an affirmation. The messages were based around common problems identified in the literature and were developed through focus groups with women with infants and young children.</interventions>
    <comparator>Women in the comparison group received their usual care and were sampled up to two years after the intervention group. Usual care in this study was defined as anything the women may have received including immediate postpartum midwife visitations, lactation consultants, accessing the Australian Breastfeeding Association or other resources. The women for the comparator group were recruited from August to October 2012. </comparator>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible women were recruited for the intervention during a three week period in September and October and November 2010, via national broadcast media . (radio interviews and mainstream press release).  Initially, women who self-selected into the intervention were going to be randomised into control and intervention groups but due to the overwhelming response for support, a control group was deemed unethical, therefore all women who registered were allocated to the intervention group as a convenience sample. As a result, a second group was recruited via social media to act as a comparison group between August and October 2012 using the same method of recruitment. </concealment>

    <designfeatures>The intervention group received the intervention and then a control group was recruited after all media interest had dissapated two years later. The intervention and control groups had similar recruitment strategies. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>As a proof of concept the aim was to recruit as many women as possible in a short time period. 

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 21. T-tests were used to test for differences between groups for independent variables and changes in independent variables. Chi-square tests were used to test for differences between categories such as income and education. ANCOVA was used to test if the independent variable was having an effect and allowed the influence of the covariates to be controlled for during analysis. Hierarchical regression was used to investigate change in breastfeeding outcome, between groups, adjusting for co-variates. When controlling for covariates, factors that were significant at the bivariate level were adjusted for in the model</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breastfeeding is recognised as the optimal method for feeding infants with health gains made by reducing infectious diseases in infancy; and chronic diseases, including obesity, in childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Despite this, exclusivity and duration in developed countries remains resistant to improvement. The objectives of this research were to test if an automated mobile phone text messaging intervention, delivering one text message a week, could increase any breastfeeding rates and improve breastfeeding self-efficacy and coping.</summary>
