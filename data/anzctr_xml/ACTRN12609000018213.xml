    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After the research nurse has obtained the patientâ€™s consent, he/she will telephone a contact who is independent of the recruitment process for allocation concealment. Subsequently, baseline data will be collected. All questionnaires are self-administered by patients. Therefore, the research nurse will not have involvement in completing these questionnaires.</concealment>
    <sequence>Blocked randomisation will be performed by a computer generated random number list prepared by an investigator who has no clinical involvement in the trial. Stratification by primary cancer diagnosis group will also be carried out.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are 283 new outpatients each month registered to cancer care services at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital (RBWH). The first visit of oncology patients and families to an outpatient cancer centre often causes intense anxiety and negative emotions. Recent nursing initiatives in cancer care services include a multidisciplinary orientation program for the head and neck cancer patients. This multidisciplinary orientation program will be extended to all newly registered cancer patients in 2009. This pilot study will evaluate the effects of the multi-disciplinary orientation program on the levels of self-efficacy and anxiety of newly registered cancer patients at the RBWH.</summary>
