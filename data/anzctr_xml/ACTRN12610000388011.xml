  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Food allergies are common and result in a significant burden to families and the health care system. One approach to prevent food allergies may be to introduce specific foods earlier than currently recommended. The study will compare early regular introduction of egg from 4-6.5 months of age compared to the more common practice of egg avoidance until 10 months of age. If successful at reducing egg allergy, this approach will have a significant impact on reducing the burden of allergic disease.</summary>
