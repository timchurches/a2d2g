    <concealment>Selection will be on a first come first enrolled basis with an a priori intention to ideally enrol 16 smokers and 16 non-smokers. 
Participants from Lismore and the surrounding district will be recruited by advertisement in local print and electronic media. 
An initial telephone screening process will identify individuals who satisfy criteria for inclusion. 
Suitable candidates will attend an initial study clinic for final assessment. At this visit, candidates will undergo physical screening tests.
Informed consent will be obtained at this clinic.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent investigations into a range of native Australian species grown commercially for the food
industry have emphasised the need for further research into the potential health benefits of
these species, in particular, Davidsonia pruriens (Davidson Plum).
An open label exploratory pilot study is proposed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant effects of an extract of Davidson Plum in humans.
Additionally, a range of physical and cognitive screening tests will be trialled that incorporate
known markers of health status, including lung function, grip strength, mobility impairment,
mood and quality of life.
It is hypothesized that the oral administration of the study medication over 2 weeks will result in
a statistically significant change in markers of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status.
Both smokers and non-smokers will be enrolled. The analysis will look at the total population
and then at smokers and non-smokers separately.</summary>
