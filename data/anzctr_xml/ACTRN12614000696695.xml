  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will prospectively evaluate patients with a new diagnosis of Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) as they are treated with a standard weaning course of Prednisolone (duration 46 weeks). The demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiologic characteristics (on musculoskeletal ultrasound and whole body PET/CT scan [in selected cases]) of patients whose disease relapses (defined by the PMR-Activity Score) will be compared with those in sustained disease remission. Identification of this "refractory" subset of patients will permit future treatment to be tailored to individual risk of disease relapse and prevent complications from unnecessarily prolonged glucocorticoid therapy.  </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>At study completion, statistical analyses will be undertaken using SPSS 20.0 to compare those PMR patients who relapsed with those who remained in remission with standardized low-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Parametric data will be compared using t-tests and one-way ANOVA, while non-parametric data will be compared using the chi-square test or Kruskall-Wallis. P-values of &lt; 0.05 will be classified as statistically significant.  A more detailed multivariable and conditional logistic regression is also planned to control for the effects of variables such as gender, BMI and smoking status.

Due to a lack of literature indicating anticipated effect size in a pilot study such as this, sample size calculation is difficult. That said, a similar study design by Cimmino et al. (2011) did achieve a statistically significant result with enrolment of 60 patients.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the fact that Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease of the elderly, it is poorly understood. With no diagnostic tests available, diagnosis is dependent upon a history of muscle pain and stiffness in the hip and shoulder regions, combined with raised inflammation levels in the blood. Treatment consists of Prednisolone (commonly referred to as cortisone) prescribed in a one size fits all approach. However, the way in which PMR patients symptoms respond is very variable; some improve almost overnight, whilst other individuals require higher doses for much longer periods of time. Unfortunately, such long-term Prednisolone use can result in many complications including osteoporosis, weight gain, high blood pressure and diabetes. Similarly, uncontrolled PMR is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. This project aims to identify the characteristics of patients that fail to respond adequately to Prednisolone treatment. It is hypothesized that this information will delineate a distinct subset of refractory PMR patients, thereby permitting further study of alternate therapy in this group and minimizing the side effects of Prednisolone use long-term.</summary>
