  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend 1 hour, twice weekly Argentine Tango dance classes for four weeks. Dance classes designed and led by professional dance instructor and supervised by experienced physiotherapists. Feasibility and safety of the intervention will be monitored throughout the intervention phase. At each session a form will be completed which will detail attendance and the recording of any adverse events such as falls, injuries and complaints of musculoskeletal pain.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility: including outcomes below
Recruitment: time taken, recruitment rate, ratio of those eligible vs. non-eligible. Adherence. Attrition. Safety: monitoring for adverse events and near misses, level of supervision required. Adverse events will include (but it not limited to) falls, injuries (sprains, strains, lacerations), complaints of musculoskeletal pain or discomfort. Near misses may include (but not limited to) slips or trips that do not result in a fall. Safety will be monitored by physiotherapist supervising the dance classes and recorded on a monitoring form that is completed at the end of each session.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will explore the feasibility and safety of an Argentine tango dance intervention. Will involve a single group pre-test/post-test design with 8 participant diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Participants will be invited to participate a 4 week dance intervention. Feasibility and safety outcomes will be monitored and assessed at throughout the intervention. Secondary outcomes (efficacy) of gait, balance, motor impairment, depression and HRQOL will be measured at baseline at 4 weeks. Results will inform a future RCT that will investigate the therapeutic benefits of a dance intervention for people with PD.</summary>
