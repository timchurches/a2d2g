  <interventions>
    <interventions>Compare three methods of cryotherapy (ice water, soft ice, ice gel) in healthy women. The pack were applied once (one session) for twenty minutes on the right thigh. The packs measuring 8cm wide by 16cm in length with a volume of 240ml were involved in fine cotton fabric avoiding direct contact with the skin. A digital Minipa (registered trade mark) model MT 405 thermometer was used to monitor the right thigh temperature.</interventions>

      <outcome>what kind of pack reduce more the temperature of the skin with less bad sensation. A digital Minipa (registered trade mark) model MT 405 thermometer monitor was used on the right thigh to control the temperature. We used a questionnaire developed to use in this particular research project where the women related the sensation during pack application, in 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes after start intervention</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study that was conducted by 32 students of the graduation course of a private college of nursing in the city of Sao Paulo, divided into three groups (ice water, soft ice, ice gel). The temperatures were verified (axillary, thigh, of the three packs) between zero and twenty minutes. Results: The packs temperatures were: soft ice from negative 9°C to 2°C, ice water from 0°C to 8°C and ice gel from negative 11°C to 2°C. There was a significant difference between the temperatures average of the thigh with 10 minutes (p=0.007), 15 minutes (p=0.003) and 20 minutes (p=0.005).  The gel was the most efficient in cooling compared to the others two methods. The three methods of cryotherapy reach the recommended temperature for analgesia and can be tested in women with perineal pain.</summary>
