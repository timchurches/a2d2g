    <studytitle>An intervention to reduce the prevalence and impact of asthma and food allergies occurring in association with atopic dermatitis through improved skin care in infants and young children.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>To test our hypothesis we propose to conduct a prospective randomised controlled study.  The study will investigate the impact of a number of simple intervention measures on epidermal barrier protection as measured by transepidermal water loss in infants and young children.

In addition, this randomized, controlled study will measure the prevalence and severity of atopic dermatitis.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The below intervention will be advised to the parents to follow in their babies for a period of 5 years. 
Telephone contact for approximately 20 minutes will occur at weeks 1, 3, 6, 12, 26, 38, 52 and then every 6 months until the age of 5 years post-gestation.
Transepidermal water loss will be measured at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months to assess the integrity of the infants barrier function.
Parents will be encouraged to limit bath times to less than 5 minutes, bathe their children without soap, detergent or bubble baths and to use an emollient after bathing.  In addition mothers will be given specific advice about appropriate temperatures for ducted central heating (maximum of 19 degrees Celsius), and measures to keep cool while sleeping.
The  children will attend respiratory examination with spirometry and measurement of airway hyper responsiveness at age 5.</interventions>
    <comparator>The parents of babies in the control group will be contacted every 6 months about the condition of their babies and the status of their health will be recorded. The contacts will be every 6 months for 5 years. No advice will be given to them. Control group will receive 6 monthly telephone contacts enquiring about the development of eczema, food allergy and asthma. The children will attend a skin examination with measurement of transepidermal water loss at water loss at ages 1, 2 and 3 years.
The children will attend respiratory examination with spirometry and measurement of airway hyper responsiveness at age 5.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis/research questions:
That mothers can be effectively coached on a number of simple measures that will improve skin barrier function in their infants that will reduce the incidence of Atopic Dermatitis
And that improvement in skin barrier function will reduce the incidence and severity of atopic dermatitis in the short term and ultimately, food allergy and asthma associated with atopic dermatitis
And that null mutations in the fillagrin gene increase the risk of future development of atopic dermatitis, food allergy and asthma associated with atopic dermatitis.
And that null mutations in the fillagrin gene are predictive of infants who stand to obtain the greatest benefit from interventions to improve skin barrier function.


To test our hypothesis we propose to conduct a prospective randomised controlled study.  The study will investigate the impact of a number of simple intervention measures on epidermal barrier protection as measured by transepidermal water loss in infants and young children.
In addition, this randomized, controlled study will measure the prevalence and severity of atopic dermatitis.</summary>
