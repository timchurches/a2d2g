  <interventions>
    <interventions>Auditory hallucinations (AHs), often described as voices, are a common symptom of schizophrenia and related psychoses. Command hallucinations (CHs) are a type of auditory hallucinations in which the voice heard by the patient commands him or her to perform a particular action. When heard, such commands often impose great pressure for obedience.  CHs frequently urge dangerous acts and are associated with greater levels of disability and distress compared to patients with non-command AHs. Although anti-psychotic medication is helpful in preventing compliance, it is not fully effective.  We are conducting a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural treatment for CHs (TORCH: Treatment of Resistant Command Hallucinations). The aim of TORCH is to reduce the distress, worry and harmful or self-defeating behaviour associated with CHs. Treatment comprises 15 sessions with a psychologist, normally conducted at weekly intervals.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The evaluation of TORCH is being undertaken by comparing TORCH with a control condition, Befriending.  In Befriending, participants receive an equal amount of therapist contact, in the form of positive and enjoyable social conversation and activity, but not the specific components of TORCH.  Participants in both groups are offered an additional 2 follow-up therapy sessions in the 6 months following completion of their therapy.  A subset of participants have been randomised to a 4-month wait-list condition in order to permit a comparision of both TORCH and Befriending with standard treatment.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Assessments are conducted by research assistants who are kept blind to treatment allocation.  Participants are given written and verbal instructions not to say which group they are in or refer to their treatment in any way.  Research assistants are located in a different office to therapists to help maintain blindness.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization was by variable length blocks.  Sequences of fix length blocks were generated using the first random generator available at www.randomization.com.  Switching between blocks was determined by an additional random sequence generated by the same method.  A similar procedure was used to generate assignments to treatments for participants initially assigned to the wait-list condition.  All seeds were recorded so that sequences could be replicated if necessary.  Assignment of participants to conditions was done by the study statistician who worked independently of staff involved in the recruitment, assessment and management of participants in the study.</sequence>
