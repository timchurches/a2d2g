    <concealment>All patients wil be assessed to comply with all the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Once there is confirmation of eligibility the patient will be registered.  Once registered, the patient will be randomized 2:1 through an online system to receive WBRT in combination with nimotuzumab (experimental arm) or WBRT in combination with placebo (control arm), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. Study allocation is concealed using central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patient randomization in a 2:1 (experimental: control) fashion will be coordinated centrally by  SciAn Services Inc. via a validated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Such randomization will be performed by using the Minimization Method stratifying according to study center, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) (1 vs. 2) and number of brain metastases (1-4 vs &gt; 4).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of the drug nimotuzumab in treating people with brain cancer which has spread (metatstases) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 

Who is it for?

You can join this study if you have NSCLC and it has spread to the brain where it is not suitable for surgical removal.

Trial details

Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will receive whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in combination with intravenous nimotuzumab administered weekly during radiotherapy and following radiotherapy. The other group will receiver WBRT in combination with a non-active compound (placebo). Treatment and monitoring continues until any progression of disease or unacceptable side effects. Participants will be assessed by laboratory tests, imaging studies, standardized neurologic examination, and neurologic symptoms.

Brain metastases are found in 20% to 40% of adult patients with cancer and the current standard treatment is WBRT alone. New therapies are needed, and the current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of nimotuzumab in treating the disease.</summary>
