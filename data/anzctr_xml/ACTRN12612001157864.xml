  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a randomised crossover trial and patients with vascular disease and healthy volunteers will receive both Prasugrel and Placebo in oral capsule form. A single loading dose of 60mg of Prasugrel will be given on day 1 and then 10mg per day maintenance for 6 days. Placebo will also be administered for 7 days as a separate drug treatment. There will be a wash out period of 3 weeks between the two treatment periods.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo treatment phase for both vascular patients and healthy individuals will be an oral microcellulose capsule. 

Healthy individuals will receive both the prasugrel and placebo treatments with a wash out of 3 weeks in between treatments</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be recruited from the carotid surveillance programme. This programme
actively follows patients with carotid artery stenosis of 50-69% for 2 years. Currently
there are in excess of 300 patients in this programme and preliminary examination of
this group suggests 20-25% are not on any antiplatelet medication. Study patients
will be invited to participate in the study by a phone call. Healthy volunteers will be
recruited from advertisements around Wellington hospital and Otago Medical School.
Both patients with vascular disease and healthy volunteers will receive Prasugrel and placebo with a 3 week wash out period in between.
Participants will be randomised into either study A or B groups to either receive Prasugrel or Placebo first with a cross over to the other drug in between. The participant and study doctor will not know which group the patient is, a third party will randomise and allocate the drugs.</concealment>
    <sequence>A online random number generator will be used to allocate the patient to group A or B</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effects of Prasugrel (a drug
that makes your platelets less sticky) against a placebo (no medication but still a
tablet). We want to see how Prasugrel affects the way the blood clotting cells
platelets, interact with immune cells in the blood. The disease that causes the
narrowing of arteries is driven by immune cells and it could be important to see how
inhibiting platelets affects these immune cells and potentially decrease the narrowing
of arteries</summary>
