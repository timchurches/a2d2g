  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study proposes an intervention with ribose-cysteine [2(R,S)-D-ribo-(1',2',3',4'-tetrahydroxybutyl)-thiazolidine-4(R)-carboxylic acid], a dietary supplement sold in 14 countries that has been developed to boost the levels of glutathione, an important antioxidant in the body. Ribose-cysteine is listed with Australias Therapeutic Goods Administration as a permissible ingredient and is sold by the network marketing company, Max International. While a few animal studies have been performed on its glutathione enhancing and lipid-lowering properties, no study has been conducted to establish the potential cardio-protective effects of ribose-cysteine in humans. We propose an intervention study of post menopausal women between the ages of 45 and 65 with an LDL cholesterol &gt; 2.5 mmol/L that are not currently on lipid-lowering medication. The use of females only is to reduced the variability in lipid levels which differ significantly between the sexes. Postmenopausal female are being recruited as they are more likely to have LDL cholesterol levels &gt;2.5 mmol/L and they represent an important group in the community at risk of CVD. 
The trial will be conducted in a simple randomized crossover design with participants (blinded to treatment) receiving either ribose-cysteine or placebo followed by a 1 month washout period before crossover. Participants will be supplied with either a daily supplement of 500 mg ribose-cysteine for 3 months or placebo (both to be taken as oral capsules which will be supplied by Max International).  Participants will be instructed to return empty containers at the end of each arm of the study to monitor compliance. Blood samples (40 ml) will be collected at the beginning and the end of each treatment arm and the plasma, blood cells and genomic DNA isolated. Blood pressure, body weight and height will be measured along with the collection of diet, supplement, medication and physical activity information at each sampling. Participants will be instructed to report any noticeable side effects throughout the study.  
Blood samples will be measured for ribose-cysteine,  glutathione (GSH), cysteine, F2-isoprostanes (an oxidative stress marker), glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, apoA1, LDL cholesterol, apoB  and Lp(a).  The activity of  the antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase and selenium levels (Se is a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase) will also be measured.  Alanine transferase (ALT) will be measured to check the supplementation has no effect on liver function. Genomic DNA will be subject to genotyping of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in GSH and lipid metabolism. </interventions>
    <comparator>A placebo oral capsule containing the excipients used in the ribose-cysteine capsules will be administered as the control for the study. Each placebo capsule contains microcrystalline cellulose (275mg), magnesium stearate (8 mg) and silicon dioxide syloid (3 mg). </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The design is a two-arm crossover intervention study. Participants will randomly be divided into two groups with one group receiving 500 mg ribose-cysteine and the other a placebo for 12 weeks.  Participants will cross over to the other arm after a 4 week washout period. Based on this study design we plan to recruit 60 participants. Allowing for 20% dropouts and  missing data, our power calculation requires that 60 women will be required at baseline to detect a difference between the two groups in LDL cholesterol of 0.4 mmol/L (a major outcome of the trial) with 90% power using a two-sided test, significance at 0.05, and SD for LDL of 0.48 mmol/L.  A correlation between repeated measures of 0.5 is assumed.  A biostatistician will help us analyse the data. Statistical analysis of the data will use linear mixed models to examine any differences in LDL cholesterol concentrations and other outcomes between interventions.  Models will adjust for baseline values of each outcome.  Treatment orders will be balanced, providing an unbiased estimate of the difference between the treatments in the absence of missing data.  Period (first, second) will be included in the models to reduce variability attributable to any period effects and carry-over effects will be tested for to ensure that the washout period was effective.  Standard model diagnostics will be performed and log-transformations investigated and retained if this improves model residual normality.  Should model assumptions not be satisfied with untransformed data or by using transformations, mixed quantile regression will be used instead.  Two-sided p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses will be performed using Stata 14.2 or R 3.3.1</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ribose-cysteine is a dietary supplement sold in 14 countries that has been developed to boost levels of glutathione (GSH).  Glutathione is an important antioxidant in the body that protects against oxidative damage. Supplementation of ribose-cysteine in mice promotes a significant increase in glutathione based antioxidant status, lowers low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and oxidised lipids and shows cardio-protective effects. This study aims to establish if ribose-cysteine supplementation will produce similar effects in humans. A secondary aim is to establish if variations in genes involved in GSH and LDL metabolism affects the response to ribose-cysteine.</summary>
