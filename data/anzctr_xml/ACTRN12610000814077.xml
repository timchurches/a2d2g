  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: participants will be offered one movie ticket which will be posted upon completion of a telephone interview*. 

Arm 2: participants will be offered a 1/500 chance of winning an iPod (valued at A$200 as of September 2010) upon completion of a telephone interview*.  Once 500 interviews are completed, across the whole project, the iPod winner is randomly drawn and the winner is notified by telephone.

*The one-off telephone interview, conducted by research staff interviewers, is of 40-50 minutes and is completed as soon after the general practice consultation as possible. The content includes the young person's experience of the practice and the consultation, questions on their lifestyle and psycho-social health risks plus their use of other health services. Young people's interest in participation is registered at the general practices by research assistants prior to the consultation.</interventions>
    <comparator>In a prior phase of this work (2007-2010), young people interviewed after their general practice consultations were offered entry into a prize draw for an iPod. In order to increase completion rates, in the next phase of our work, we are now conducting a nested randomised control trial of incentives within the overall trial by comparing the completion rates for those who now receive the iPod draw incentive versus the guaranteed movie ticket incentive. The incentive resulting in the better completion rate will then be used in the remainder of the overall trial.</comparator>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Research assistants (RAs) approach young people (YP) in the clinic waiting room and ask if they would be willing to provide their first name and telephone number in order to be contacted about the Project. RAs will be blinded to the randomisation of each YP until they have selected the YP they are to approach (e.g. if more than one in the waiting room at the same time) thus preventing any subconscious judgement about individual YPs and their potential incentive preference. According to a pre-randomised schedule the YP would be offered either the iPod draw or the movie ticket as an incentive upon completion of the telephone survey. A clear record of YP who agree, refuse or turn out to be ineligible will be kept by the RA. Also, the time of the day, date and randomisation allocation revealed to the RA will be recorded by the RA for later cross-checking of the fidelity of the allocation.
To eliminate the bias that might arise from the diversity between clinicians and practices (e.g. patients within one practice are more likely to be more similar to each other than to patients in other practices) we will randomise all patients within each practice.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random order for the allocation of subjects is generated using simple randomisation by using a randomisation table, that is created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation in Microsoft Excel). The software ensures a balanced allocation between two arms (i.e. Intervention arm and Control arm). No stratified allocation is to be employed in the study.]</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are conducting a trial to systematically evaluate if 14-24 year old young people are more likely to complete a telephone interview if they receive a guaranteed movie ticket upon completion compared with a 1/500 chance of winning a bigger prize ie an iPod. This trial is nested within a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) ("Health risk screening and counselling of adolescents and youth friendly practice: a cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care" - ISRCTN16059206) which is exploring the effects of a systems level intervention encouraging youth friendly practice in primary care.</summary>
