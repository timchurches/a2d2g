  <interventions>
    <interventions>Medical scribes are being used during consultations in emergency departments at Cabrini Emergency Department during a study on the economics and utility of medical scribes in Australian Emergency Departments (September 2015-September 2016, ACTRN12615000607572).
A medical scribe is a personal assistant to the emergency physician who stands near the physician during consultations documenting the consultation and arranging tests, consultations and hospital beds as required. They use a computer-on-wheels connected to the hospital electronic medical record.

This study will administer a survey to patients or their representatives, seeking to determine their thoughts and attitudes towards the scribe being in the room and assisting with the consultation. It will be administered to the patient/representative on a single occasion only, whilst the patient is in the Emergency Department</interventions>
    <comparator>The controls will be patients who attend the Emergency Department during the same time periods who don't have a medical scribe allocated to their doctor that visit.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Press Ganey patient net-promoter scores relating to Cabrini ED became available mid study to us from 2015.

We used a non-inferiority calculation with a clinically important drop in net promotor score being thought to be 10% - a small informal survey of our hospital administrators indicated that a scribe program would be at risk even if scribes provided strong economic gains if there was a more than 10% drop in net-promotor score.

We used the net promoter score and the 2015 data was as follows:

The proportion of net promoters is 92% and non-inferiority is defined as no more than 10% less than this (i.e., 82%), the number of patient interviews is set out - 
92 cases: 92 controls - balanced groups
69 cases: 104 controls - 1:2 ratio
We opted to recruit 92 patients to each group

Secondary outcomes: descriptive and qualitative analysis based on 5-point Likert scores and free-text responses.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a pilot observational study, conducting a cross-sectional survey on patient attitudes and satisfaction with medical consultations whilst a medical scribe is present during an Emergency Medicine consultation. 

It will use a convenience sample of all patients attending Cabrini ED between the dates of April 2016 to September 2016 (the period of time there is a study being undertaken on the economics of using medical scribes at Cabrini Emergency Department). It will commence once ethics approval is obtained from Cabrini HREC.

It will use a survey developed specifically for the purpose. Items will relate to patient satisfaction with the consultation and patient satisfaction with various components of the consultation. It will also include a net promoter score for the Emergency Department. It will compare consultations with scribes to consultations without scribes during the same time period using the same group of physicians and the same investigation site.

Medical scribes are an emerging role in health. Their numbers are rapidly expanding. Research to date has focused on the economics of their use. There is a need for health administrators and emergency doctors to understand their potential impact on the patient during consultations and this exploratory work should assist with directing future work and guiding administrators and doctors on whether and how to utilise scribes in the future.</summary>
