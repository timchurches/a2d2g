  <interventions>
    <interventions>The BCAA supplements will be a mix of 7g of BCAA powder and non sugar cordial in 1 liter of water. The amount consumed will be 2ml/kg of body weight for every 15 minutes during prolonged cycling exercise. Participants will have to cycle twice with at least 3 days gap as wash out period and during each session participants will have to cycle as quick as possible to reach pre-determined total energy expenditure which will endure for about 60 - 90 minutes</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Eighteen healthy men between the ages of 18  44 years old will be recruited for this study from the community by the local advertisement. The minimum sample size for this study was calculated based on power analysis (a = 0.05, power = 0.80, calculated sample size = 6) using differences in (plasma concentrations of free tryptophan), pre and post of a 60 min bout of steady-paced treadmill running (75% VO2max) in subjects who were fed with combined carbohydrate, protein &amp; fat meal 3 hours before running (Zanker et al., 1997).

A mixed model analysis will be used to examine the effects of BCAA supplementation across time and the interaction between the two. LSD will be used as Confidence Interval Adjustment. Significance level is set at p&lt;0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fatigue is common during exercise, with fatigue being described as sensations of tiredness with associated decrements in muscular performance and function. Exercise-induced fatigue is unique as it presents acutely and both the perception and duration of fatigue may be manipulated. Studies have shown that at the end of prolonged exercise, the concentration of serotonin was ultimately high compared to before exercising. Although we know the consumption of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)are able to reduce the concentration of serotonin, there are still discrepancies to prove the effectiveness of BCAA in delaying fatigue and improve performance. </summary>
