  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present clinical trial aims to compare the efficacy and safety profile of topical adapalene 0.1% and BPO 2.5% gels in patients with mild acne vulgaris.
For this purpose, 60 patients equally received either topical adapalene 0.1% gel or topical BPO 2.5% gel once daily to the entire face (except periocular area and lip) for two consecutive months.
Three months later, number of lesions, side effects and patients' satisfaction were compared between the two groups.</summary>
