  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of this pilot study is to explore whether chronic stroke survivors who observe digital video images of basic movements (e.g., a healthy person picking up a cup), and then, directly after each observation attempt to physically mimic the observed action improve their motor function (the intervention). The purpose of this training is to activate mirror neurons to prime the motor system for regaining possible motor skill function. This will be examined using a within-subject design. The intervention phase will consist of three one hour sessions per week delivered over two weeks. Each one hour session will involve approximately five different motor skill tasks with 10-15 repetitions of each.
</interventions>
    <comparator>In the within subject design, subjects will undergo a control phase prior to the intervention phase. Control phase will involve viewing random dynamic environmental images (videos) prior to physically practising selected motor skills. This is aimed not to activate the mirror neuron system (and prime the motor system) as the intervention is hoped to. The control phase will consist of three one hour sessions per week delivered over two weeks. Each one hour session will involve approximately five different motor skill tasks with 10-15 repetitions of each. There will be no wash out period between the control and intervention phases.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sensorimotor function of Upper extremity using Fugl-Meyer Assessment - Upper Extremity (FMA-UE). This outcome will be assessed approximately 2 days pre and post control phase and approximately 2 days post intervention due to the time required for assessment.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Goal achievement of Functional motor skills using Functional Test of the Hemiplegic/paretic Upper Extremity (FTHUE). This outcome will be assessed approximately 2 days pre and post control phase and approximately 2 days post intervention due to the time required for assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre- and Post- control phase and Post- intervention phase</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Range of motion at the elbow joint using three-dimensional Kinematic analysis (sub-sample only). This outcome will be assessed approximately 2 days pre and post control phase and approximately 2 days post intervention due to the time required for assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre- and Post- control phase and Post- intervention phase</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Confidence in using impaired limb assessed using Self-efficacy questionnaire (adapted from extremity constraint-induced therapy evaluation - EXCITE trial). This outcome will be assessed approximately 2 days pre and post control phase and approximately 2 days post intervention due to the time required for assessment.  </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The following inclusion and exclusion criteria have been based upon availability and capability to recruit chronic stroke survivors during an honours degree.
Inclusion criteria:
(a) 18 years old and over
(b) those not in an in-patient rehabilitation program of a hospital
(c) those participants who have had a stroke that has impaired normal function of their upper limb, but where they have some capability to move the limb (Functional assessment score between 20 to 55 of a standard test Fugl-Meyer). 
(d) able to communicate effectively with investigator in order to complete testing and intervention
sessions tasks
(e) able to commit to time requirements of testing and intervention phases
