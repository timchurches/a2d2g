  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three different donor site dressings
- Cuticerin. A smooth acetate gauze dressing impregnated with a water repellant petrolatum ointment
- Sorbact. A hydrogel applied to a mesh dressing designed to absorb bacteria onto itself from the wound bed by hydrophobic reaction
- Algisite. This is a calcium alginate dressing, the most common dressing used on donor sites in this region

All dressings come in premade peel packs, and can be simply applied in theatre directly to the wound bed. This will then be covered with an absorbent second layer dressing (allevyn) and tape (hypafix). Dressings will be removed at seven days to assess the wound, then reapplied if necessary every seven days until full re-epithelialisation</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control - with all dressings being compared against each other. All three dressings currently in use in the department.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to re-epithelialisation assessed in two ways.
- Clinical judgement by surgeon treating the patient
- Blinded second assessment from digital photographs</outcome>
      <timepoint>Expected 7-14 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain while dressing in situ. Pain at dressing change. Assessed via multiple methods - FACES-R/NRS/FLACC - depending on age of patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Expected 7-14 days. Once daily while dressing is on (parent, self report). During clinic visit weekly for nurse report</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cosmetic appearance of donor site by POSAS (Pt and Observor Scar Assessment Scale)
3D camera (for depth/height, and colour)
Ultrasound (for thickness of scar tissue)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dressing costs. Assessment will include
- Nursing time for dressing changes
- Cost of dressings
- Medication costs associated with dressings (analgesia)
all as per current clinical standards</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time for dressing change will be measured at each dressing change.
Medication and dressing costs will be totalled once donor site wound has re-epithelialised</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ease of dressing application. Measures used will include
- flexibility and conformity using a NRS 0-4
- Patient/parent  perception  comfort, ease of movement and ease of dressing removal using NRS 
- nursing assessment ease of application, care, and removal</outcome>
      <timepoint>Until re-epithelialisation. Expected 7-14 days as above. May extend to 28 days in rare cases</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of dressing changes</outcome>
      <timepoint>Expected dressing change each week at clinical review. If additional dressings are needed (due to strikethrough from wound, or longer time to re-epithelialise) these will be assessed. Expected longest time to remain under dressings is 4 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Itch</outcome>
      <timepoint>Itch with dressings in situ, and at three and six month checks. Itch will be assessed using the Itch man scale &lt; 6years of age by parent report, &gt;6years by self report
This will be assessed four hours after operation (to allow assessment prior to discharge), also at 24 hours by phone call, and at each dressing change as for pain scores.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paediatric split skin grafts leave a donor site, requiring a dressing. The optimum dressing for this site is the subject
of much discussion and debate amongst burns clinicians. In our unit there are currently three dressings in regular
use. We therefore have equipoise to undertake a randomised controlled trial in an effort to determine which is the
best of the three. Outcome measures we will be examining relate to both patients and staff. These outcomes
include
pain
and itch while the dressing is on
ease
of application, care, and removal
time
to reepithelialisation
cost
cosmetic
appearance of the donor site
There are a number of such trials in the literature. None of them have directly compared our three dressings
(algisite, cuticerin, sorbact). Few of the trials in the literature have looked at children, so the answer is not already in
the literature.
By using real world controls we hope to find the optimum dressing in our environment. This will become our new
preferred dressing, and will naturally then become the new control against which we will measure the performance
of newer products that will inevitably come onto the market in subsequent years.
Patients will be randomised to one or more of the three arms of the study, without them or the assessing staff being
aware of the contact dressing. We will then measure outcomes with the above aims in mind; using previously
validated scoring systems examining the responses of parents, patients and staff members. We will use both
qualitative and quantitative assessment methods.</summary>
