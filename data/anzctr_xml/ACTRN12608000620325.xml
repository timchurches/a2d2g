    <interventions>The effect of below knee graduated compression stockings in adults with normal circulation on venous volume flow after 10 minutes in each of the positions of lying supine, sitting and standing upright</interventions>
    <comparator>Randomised controlled trial, crossover design.  Control group is measurements of venous flow in the same leg but without the stocking on.
Each participant had a 10-15 minute washout period (from any prior physical activity) on arrival.  All participants are asked not to under-take any strenuous activity on the day of their ultrasound scan, such as running or cycling. There is no wash-out period for the crossover between the two interventions of wearing the stocking and not wearing the stocking as this is not considered necessary.</comparator>

    <concealment>18 healthy adult volunteers enrolled.  All volunteers given detailed explanation of the trial and written informed consent obtained.  Information on basic demographics and height/weight recorded, and eligibility criteria checked, including a brief physical examination of the lower limb to ensure no circulatory compromise.
Eligible volunteers then get calf circumferance and ankle circumferance and knee to ankle length measurements taken by researchers, as a "fitting" for the appropriate sized stocking, which are then requested from the manufactor (Sigvaris).  6-10 weeks later, allowing time for stockings to arrive, the study participants get an appointment for their ultrasound scanning time.  Each participant has their left leg scanned for venous blood flow rates in the superfical femoral vein in the lying supine, sitting at 90 degrees and standing upright positions (in this order) after 10 minutes in each position, both with and without the graduated compression stocking on.  The order as to whether the participant is scanned with the stocking on first, or the stocking off first, is determined by the random allocation code.  The researcher who determines if the participant is eligible for the study is not aware of the order of the randomisation code at enrollment.  The randomisation code is generated by a second researcher after the initial enrollment process has taken place.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prolonged seated immobility at work and with long distance air travel is now recognised to be associated with an increased risk of deep vein thormbosis (DVT) through a reduction in lower limb venous blood flow.  Graduated compression stockings represent the preferred approach to improve lower limb venous blood flow, thereby reducing the risk of DVT associated with seating seated during long distance travel or whilst at work.  The effect of Sigvaris below-knee light graduated compression stockings on lower limb venous blood flow when subjects are stationary in different positions is unknown.  In particular, it is uncertain if the stockings have a direct ability to increase venous blood velocity (speed) in the seated position.  If it's use is shown to have a direct effect on the venous blood flow in seated subjects, compared to without a stocking, then it would be reasonable to assume that the associated risk of DVT would be reduced.
Study hypothesis:  that Sigvaris below knee light graduated compression stockings increase venous blood velocity recordings in the deep vein system of the lower limb (the superfical femoral vein is a deep vein) when assessed on Duplex doppler ultrasound scanning, compared with not wearing a stocking.</summary>
