  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - rituximab
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - methylprednisolone
Treatment: drugs - prednisone

Experimental: Cyclophosphamide, prednisone, rituximab - Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone or methylprednisolone IV twice daily on days 1-5. During courses 1 and 2 only, patients also receive rituximab IV over 2-5 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression, a new primary or secondary malignancy, or unrelated disease


Other interventions: rituximab
Cycles 1 and 2 only: Given IV Incremental: First dosage: &lt; 21 years of age: 0.5mg/kg/hr (maximum of 50 mg/hr) for the 1st hour = 21 years of age: 50 mg/hr for the 1st hour. Subsequent dosages: &lt; 21 years of age: 1.0mg/kg/hr (maximum of 50 mg/hr) for the 1st hour = 21 years of age: 100 mg/hr for the 1st hour. Days 1, 8 and 15.

Treatment: drugs: cyclophosphamide
Given IV over 30-60 minutes Dose 600 mg/m2 in 50-250 mL of normal saline (NS) or Dextrose-Water 5%(D5W) (at a maximum concentration of 20 mg/ml) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle

Treatment: drugs: methylprednisolone
Methylprednisolone 0.8 mg/kg IV over 12 hours on days 1,2,3,4 and 5 of each cycle.

Treatment: drugs: prednisone
Dosage 1 mg/kg orally every 12 hours on days 1,2,3,4 and 5 of each cycle. Oral prednisone may be rounded up to the nearest 2.5 mg as necessary for tablet size

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and
      methylprednisolone use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing
      or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them
      or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining
      cyclophosphamide and either prednisone or methylprednisolone with rituximab may be effective
      in treating lymphoproliferative disease following organ transplantation.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cyclophosphamide and either
      prednisone or methylprednisolone with rituximab in treating patients who have Epstein-Barr
      virus-positive lymphoproliferative disease following organ transplantation.</summary>
