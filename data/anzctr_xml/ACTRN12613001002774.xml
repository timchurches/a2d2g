  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomisation of 40 post liver transplant patients from the Auckland Liver Transplant Unit to one of 2 study groups in a double-blind, placebo controlled study.  
Both groups will receive 4 weeks of VLCD (Optifast). This consists of 3 Optifast drinks per day and 2 cups of vegetables per day, with 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil (800 cal/day).
After the Optifast phase patients will commence a healthy diet as advised by the study team and healthy eating booklet. Dietary advice will be given every 4 weeks with face to face interview during the treatment phase. These sessions will be conducted by the gastroenterologist and/or research nurse during study visits which will take up to 1 hour. Patients will be randomised to 12 weeks of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis (14B CFU), (1 capsule orally twice daily), or identical appearing placebo in the control group (1 capsule orally twice daily) prior to lunch and dinner. 
Patients will return with their left over tablets at the conclusion of the trial to assess compliance and will be asked regarding compliance and any adverse effects at each clinical assessment every 4 weeks..

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculation, anticipate the primary endpoint will be achieved by 50% of those receiving the probiotic supplement and 5% of the placebo group, we will have 80% power to detect this difference at 5% level of significance with 18 cases and 18 controls (10% drop out, 20 patients in each arm).
Intention to treat analysis. Quantitative data, analysis performed using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for comparisons of two or more than two independent groups. Difference in proportions of categorical data using Fishers exact test when the number of subjects is &lt;5, and by Chi-square test for 2x2 tables when the number of subjects in each cell is =5. Multivariate logistic regression analysis to analyze clinical variables and treatment outcome. Continuous data categorized into normal and abnormal values for multivariate analysis, and by Youden index for cut-off variable of significance. Data will be expressed as means or median, range and interquartile range when appropriate. P values &lt;0.05 is considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The risk factors of obesity, diabetes and elevated cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease after liver transplant. There is recent animal evidence that the gut organisms play an important part in the risk of having these problems.
This research project is designed to see if probiotics prevent weight gain after a low calorie diet for 4 weeks and improve  blood sugar control and cholesterol, and reduce fat within the liver in patients who have previously undergone liver transplant. </summary>
