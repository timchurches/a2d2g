  <interventions>
    <interventions>CPAP treatment of sleep apnoea using a custom fitted mask (the TrueFIT Custom Mask).  An impression is taken of the central features of the study participants face.  The mask is made, the participant fitted with the mask and educated as to the use of the mask and the ResMed sleep apnea system.  The ResMed is a 1.4 kg unit, 112 mm x 164 mm x 145 mm, operating from mains power.  The system pumps air at a predetermined increased pressure to the mask and gathers information about mask usage.  The participant is asked to use the mask and Resmed each night for a total of 1 year.  The participant's technique with the mask and equipment is reviewed at each study visit, and further education provided as necessary.</interventions>
    <comparator>CPAP treatment of sleep apnoea using the best-fit commercially available standard mask. The mask is selected and fitted and the study participant educated as to the use of the mask and the ResMed  positive pressure and recording system.  The participant is asked to use the mask and Resmed each night for 1 year .  The participant's technique with the mask and equipment is reviewed at each study visit, and further education provided as necessary.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compliance (usage in hours per night) and consistency of use (nights used for more than 20 minutes)</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks from baseline and 52 weeks from baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerability, assessed by the number of treatment changes (mask change or adjustments, pressure adjustments), the frequency, severity and nature of expected adverse events (side effects), the frequency and severity of mask leaks, pressure range.  Side effects include dry mouth, dry throat; a lot of saliva; sore gums or lips; skin soreness; eye irritation; blocked nose; claustrophobia; air leaks from the mask; air flow annoyance from the outlet port; mask coming off; pressure from the straps or the mask; and difficulty fitting the mask, and social consequences.  Participants will be asked about side effects at follow up visits (weeks 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52).</outcome>
      <timepoint>52 weeks from baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy, assessed by the frequency, severity and nature of the physiologicial measures of disease severity (Apnoea Index, Apnoea Hypopnoea Index &amp; snoring/events/amplitude/hour), daytime sleepiness and functional status</outcome>
