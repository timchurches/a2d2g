  <interventions>
    <interventions>The PRECICE 8.5mm Intramedullary Limb Lengthening  (IMLL) System is indicated for limb lengthening of the tibia and femur.  It is composed of an implantable intramedullary device (IMLL Device), locking screws, an external remote controller (ERC), and reusable instruments. The implantable IMLL Device is available in different configurations and lengths to accommodate a variety of patient anatomies. 

The PRECICE 8.5mm IMLL System is implanted with a minimally-invasive surgical procedure identical to that of the commercially-approved PRECICE system and similar to other intramedullary limb lengthening devices.  The Distraction Phase (lengthening phase) begins after an appropriate latency interval, typically 5 days after surgery.  

During Distraction Phase, the device is lengthened (typically 1mm per day) until the desired length is achieved depending upon each individual patient's leg length discrepancy.

Consolidation Phase begins immediately after distraction phase and ends upon radiographic verification of union (corticalization of bone regenerate observed on 3 sides of the treat bone).  Subjects return for study follow-up examinations every 4 to 6 weeks during Consolidation Phase. As with the Distraction Phase, the Consolidation Phase will differ for each patient according to their treatment program as defined by their physician.</interventions>

    <concealment>The treating surgeon and his staff will pre-screen patients to determine eligibility.  The treating surgeon will meet with the qualifying patient to introduce the study, provide the informed consent document, and answer any questions the patient may have.  After all of patient's questions have been answered and the patient would like to proceed with participation, the informed consent document is signed by the treating surgeon, patient, and patient's parents or legal guardian as applicable.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Data collected in this study will be summarized using tables, graphs and patient data listings.  Demographic, safety data and primary and secondary endpoints will be summarized.  Descriptive statistics will be provided for every variable.  Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include mean, standard deviation, range and sample size.  Categorical variables will be summarized with percentages based on an exact binomial distribution. 
Baseline characteristics will include patient age, gender, weight, height, and cause of discrepancy.   Descriptive statistics will be presented for all baseline characteristics. 
The incidence of all adverse events will be reported descriptively with number of events, number of subjects having one or more events, percentages and sample size.  Adverse events will be characterized by their relatedness to the study procedure and/or the study device.  Procedure-related adverse events occurring during implantation and during the distraction visits will be presented separately.

Due to the feasibility nature of this study, the number of participants needed to achieve the study objectives was not determined using statistical assumptions.  The proof of concept will be evaluated with the clinical assumption that up to 10 patients maximum will yield the sufficent amount of data required to review any adverse events and device function.  </statisticalmethods>
