    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Ellex Integre NIR laser

Active Comparator: NIR Laser Treatment 25 miiliwatts (mW)/cm2 dose - The Ellex Integre NIR (near Infrared Light) Laser dose of 25 milliwats(mW)/cm2 for 90 seconds for 12 treatments at 2 to 3 day intervals over 5 weeks.

Active Comparator: NIR laser treatment 100mW/cm2 dose - The Ellex Integre NIR Laser dose of 100 mW/cm2 for 90 seconds for 12 treatments at 2 to 3 day intervals over 5 weeks.

Active Comparator: NIR laser treatment 200mW/cm2 dose - The Ellex Integre NIR (near Infrared Light) Laser dose of 200 mW/cm2 for 90 seconds for 12 treatments at 2 to 3 day intervals over 5 weeks.


Treatment: devices: Ellex Integre NIR laser
Each NIR light treatment will consist of a 90 second exposure of the macula of the study eye to the Ellex Integre NIR laser with the patient fixating on the central aiming beam. The laser light beam is 4.5mm in diameter with a central masked area of 1.0 mm diameter containing the central fixation target. In this way the central macula will be spared in the event of an adverse effect of the laser, which we do not anticipate.
The patient will be seated at the slit lamp laser delivery system and after the eye has been dilated and anesthetised with topical eye drops a standard fundus contact lens will be placed on the eye through which the post area pole will be visualised while the treatment is delivered. There will be 12 treatments administered over a 5 week period.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study aims to establish that treatment with near infrared light (NIR) reduces
      diabetic macular oedema in patients suffering diabetic retinopathy by exerting a positive
      beneficial effect at retinal cellular level.

      Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of severe loss of vision and the most common cause of
      blindness in individuals between the ages of 20 and 65 years in developed countries.Swelling
      of the central retina or "macular oedema". Patients will be treated in an office clinic,three
      times a week for a treatment duration of 2 minutes per session, a total of 12 times over the
      duration of 4 weeks and will be assessed at 8 weeks to establish any change induced in
      retinal oedema.Safety folllow up will be assessed at 3 and 6 months post treatment.</summary>
