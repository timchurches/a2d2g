    <interventions>This study involves the use of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to improve cognitive flexibility and emotional self-regulation in young people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
The intervention frequency will be one session of 20 minutes of HD-tDCS for 5 consecutive days. The intensity of the total injected current is 1.693 milliamps (mA). It includes a ramp-up and rump-down period of 30 seconds. This is a double blind study where twenty participants will receive active stimulation and twenty sham (placebo) stimulation. HD-tDCS involves a weak electrical current applied to the brain area of interest via small electrodes placed on the scalp.
A trained expert in non-invasive brain stimulation techniques with a first aid accreditation will administer the HD-tDCS.
A safety HD-tDCS protocol will be given to participants before and after each session. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment group will be administered sham (placebo) HD-tDCS stimulation over the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the same brain region used for the experimental group. 
Sham treatment will be administered for 20 minutes, same as the active treatment. 
TDCS sham procedures consist in switching off  the stimulator after 30 s of the stimulation, this has been shown  to be effective as subjects failed to discern between active and sham stimulation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in electroencephalography components when conducting a probabilistic reversal task.  Specifically, changes in feedback related negativity (FRN) component of the probabilistic reversal task will be investigated as our primary outcome measure. The version of the probabilistic reversal learning task used in this clinical trial can be found in Chase el al., 2011, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in electroencephalography components when conducting a cognitive reappraisal task  which measures emotional self-regulation tasks. Specifically, changes in the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP) of the cognitive reappraisal task will be investigated as our primary outcome measures. The cognitive reappraisal task is a well validated task that has been used in many research studies to measure emotional regulation (Feeser et al., 2014). For this clinical trial we will use a similar version seen in  Parvaz et al., 2012, Cognitive Affective Behavioural Neuroscience,

    <statisticalmethods> Assuming a medium-large effect size (Cohens d=0.5-0.8) a sample size of 40 participants (i.e., 20 per group) will be required to achieve adequate power (80%, alpha level=0.05). This was based on the effect of the brain stimulation in the reversal learning task 1-month post intervention.The consultant biostatistician performing the analyses will be blind to participants allocation to treatment groups. Descriptive analyses will be used to characterise the subsamples included in each treatment group, and hypothesis-testing analyses (t-tests, squared chi or ANOVAs) will be used to check that the randomisation procedure yields homogeneous groups for all relevant variables. Mixed-model ANOVA (combined within and between subjects) will be used to test the study hypothesis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ASD is characterized by two core symptom clusters: i) social deficits, and ii) repetitive and restrictive patterns of behaviours and interests (RRPBIs). This latter symptom cluster has been less researched in the scientific literature than the more salient social deficits. However, RRPBIs lead to severe impairments in cognitive flexibility skills and everyday functioning. Some of the characteristics of RRPBIs include inflexible routines (e.g., never eating food that is coloured green, never going outside without a favourite pair of shoes), rigid adherence to rules, resistance to change, obsessions, and high difficulties in adapting to new social contexts. Related to this, people with ASD showing highly rigid behaviour and thinking may persevere obsessively in a conversation topic or get very upset when their routines are changed (e.g., always going to the shops the same way). These problems are intimately related to failures of emotional self-regulation, which is used to control one's behaviour, particularly when experiencing intrusive thoughts and negative emotions, and is thus essential for adaptive social interactions and daily functioning. The associated cognitive inflexibility and impairments in emotional self-regulation also leads to increased levels of parental stress and negative parenting styles that decreases the quality of life for both children and parents. 
Inflexible and perseverative behaviours can be measured using reversal learning paradigms whereas emotional self-regulation is usually measured using cognitive reappraisal tasks. These two processes are widely distributed across the brain however, recent cognitive neuroscience research has revealed that a single brain region within the frontal lobe, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), is primarily responsible for monitoring cognitive flexibility and controlling negative emotions, thoughts, and behaviours. Moreover, there is recent evidence from brain scanning techniques that demonstrates abnormal activity within the vlPFC in ASD. Thus, the vlPFC is a clear target for the neurobiological treatment of cognitive inflexibility and impairments in emotional self-regulation in ASD.
For this study 40 participants between 16-30 years old with ASD will be recruited. All sessions will take place in the School of Psychology, Deakin University Burwood Campus. Participants will first undergo a comprehensive assessment using clinical, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological measures. They will then be randomly allocated to receive either active HD-tDCS or sham (placebo) HD-tDCS. They will receive 20 minutes of HD-tDCS (active or sham) for five consecutive days. They will then undergo the same comprehensive assessment at the end of the last treatment and one-month after treatment. We will also collect detailed information about participants' experience of HD-tDCS, including any side-effects.
Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the aims of this research are:
1. To investigate the safety of using HD-tDCS among young people with autism spectrum disorder.
2. To investigate the efficacy of using HD-tDCS among young people with autism spectrum disorder to reduce impairments in cognitive flexibility and emotional self-regulation skills. We will examine a range of clinical, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological features.
