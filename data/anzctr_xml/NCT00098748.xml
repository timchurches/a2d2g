  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Maraviroc (UK-427,857), a selective and reversible CCR5 co-receptor antagonist, has been
      shown to be active in vitro against a wide range of clinical isolates (including those
      resistant to existing classes). In HIV-1 infected patients in the United States, maraviroc
      (UK-427,857) is approved for use as part of combination antiretroviral treatment in
      treatment-experienced and treatment-naive adult subjects. At least 50% of
      treatment-experienced patients are infected with R5-tropic HIV-1 exclusively. However, even
      in patients infected with a dual tropic (R5 + X4) phenotype, a large proportion of the virus
      population still uses CCR5 exclusively. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      antiretroviral activity, and safety, of maraviroc (UK-427,857) (in combination with other
      agents) in HIV infected, treatment experienced patients who are failing their current
      antiretroviral regimen and not infected with R5-tropic virus exclusively. This study will
      involve more than 200 centers globally to achieve a total randomized subject population of
      192 subjects. Patients will be randomly (1:1:1) assigned to one of three groups: Optimized
      Background Therapy [OBT (3-6 drugs based on treatment history and resistance testing)] +
      maraviroc (UK-427,857) 150 mg taken once daily, OBT + maraviroc (UK-427,857) 150 mg taken
      twice daily, or OBT alone. Randomization was stratified by Enfuvirtide use in OBT (yes/no)
      and Screening HIV-1 RNA level (viral load) (&lt;100,000/= 100, 000 copies per milliliter [copies
      per mL]). The study will enroll over approximately a 9 month period with 48 weeks of
      treatment. Physical examinations will be performed at study entry, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
      24, 32, 40 and 48. Blood samples will also be taken at study entry, weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16,
      20, 24, 32, 40, and 48. Additionally, blood samples will be drawn twice, at least 30 minutes
      apart, at weeks 2 and 24 for maraviroc (UK-427,857) pharmacokinetic analysis. As part of this
      clinical study a blood sample will also be taken for non-anonymized pharmacogenetic analysis.
      Patients will undergo a 12-lead electrocardiogram at study entry, weeks 24 and 48.</summary>
