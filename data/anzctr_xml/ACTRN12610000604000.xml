  <interventions>
    <interventions>Computerised Cognitive Brain Training (CCBT) will be conducted during normal work hours and delivered via the Spark! online system directly to the subjects normal work computer. Regime is  3 sessions a week, of 20 minutes each for a total of 16 weeks. 

The Spark! CCBT program comprises 36 of HappyNeuron Incs suite of cognitive exercises. These exercises target the cognitive domains of memory, attention, language, executive functions and visuospatial abilities in a drill and practice fashion. Multi-domain training is likely to be maximally effective as suggested by our recent systematic review . During each session, subjects will practice a number of exercises from across a range of cognitive domains, and gradually be challenged by exercises of greater complexity and cognitive demand during the course of the 4-month period in an individualized manner prescribed by the systems in-built algorithms.

This system is propriety software of The Brain Department Pty Ltd.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control comprises viewing a series of educational National Geographic videos at subjects' work station and answering related multiple choice questions delivered via an online survey. Frequency and duration of this computer-based audiovisual stimulation matches the CCBT intervention</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive Domain scores:
1.	Memory: Verbal memory and Non-verbal memory
2.	Attention: Divided attention Part I and Part II
3.	Visual Spatial: Visual Spatial Orientation
4.	Language: Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)
5.	Disinhibition: Stroop
6.	Reasoning and problem solving: Matrix
7.	Speed: Staged Information Processing Speed, Visual Sequence Comparison.

In addition, two General Cognitive summary scores will be calculated:
8.	Average of domain scores
9.	First principal component of baseline cognitive tests results

All cognitive tests will be administered to the intervention and active control group by a combination of computerised neuropsychological software tests and paper-and-pencil test format.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline
Proximal follow up (after 16-week intervention)
Longitudinal follow-up (6 months after proximal follow up)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychological Well Being
1.	Job Satisfaction:
Overall job satisfaction scale for positive appraisals 
Intention to quit scale for negative appraisals

2.	Psychological wellbeing:
Relative absence of Psychological Distress: this will be measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS).
Self-Esteem: Professional self esteem scale 
Quality of Life: the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS)  and Ryff?s Scales of Psychological Wellbeing (SPWB)

Two primary outcomes of  job satisfaction and psychological wellbeing will be calculated as the sum of standardized z-scores.






















 
These self report scales will be administered via email and online survey at baseline, proximal follow-up and longitudinal follow-up.
Primary Outcome Measures:  job satisfaction and psychological wellbeing will be calculated as the sum of standardized z-scores.</outcome>

      <outcome>Workplace Productivity 
Calculated as the sum of standardized z-scores across each of the following productivity measures:	
a)     average handling time
b)	conversion rates
c)	work quality ratings</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cognitive brain training, which involves repeated exercise on a range of cognitive problems, may help improve cognitive function and slow age-related mental decline.

Previous studies of brain training have mainly focused on clinical populations, and so its effectiveness in healthy, working age individuals is not known. 

We therefore propose to measure the effectiveness of brain training across a wide range of outcomes with scientific, business and health relevance, including cognition, psychological wellbeing and workplace productivity.</summary>
