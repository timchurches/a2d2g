  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GS-5816

Experimental: Participants with renal impairment - Participants with severe renal impairment will receive a single dose of GS-5816.

Active Comparator: Participants with normal renal function - Participants with normal renal function will receive a single dose of GS-5816.


Treatment: drugs: GS-5816
GS-5816 100 mg (2 x 50 mg tablets) administered orally

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of GS-5816 as measured by AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax - AUClast is defined as the concentration of drug from time zero to the last observable concentration
AUCinf is defined as the concentration of drug extrapolated to infinite time (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinite time)
Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of drug</outcome>
