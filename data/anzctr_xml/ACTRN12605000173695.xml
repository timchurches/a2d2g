  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will utilise a pre-post design where each participant will be evaluated firstly with their existing prosthesis and then again with the microprocessor controlled componentry.  Each participant will be assessed at an interdisciplinary clinic and goals established with them.  During this assessment they will see a rehabilitation specialist, a physiotherapist, and a prosthetist.  Where appropriate a psychologist, orthopaedic specialist and pain specialist will be available.</interventions>
