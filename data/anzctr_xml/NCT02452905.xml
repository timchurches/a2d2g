  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Nitazoxanide
Treatment: drugs - Placebo (for Nitazoxanide)

Active Comparator: Nitazoxanide - Nitazoxanide 7.5mg/kg oral/nasogastric/nasoenteric tube three times per day for five days.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - The placebo is identical to the active drug described above except that it does not contain the active compound nitazoxanide. It is reconstitutes, administered and dosed as per the active study drug.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of respiratory distress - The calculation of a Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) by the use of the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) from baseline (day 1) to study day 4 adjusted for the standardised change in respiratory rate with points being assigned by change increments of 10% Internal reliability and responsiveness of the RACS as a measure of respiratory distress in infants has been previously demonstrated and it correlates well with other measures of respiratory distress</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to day 4</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nasopharyngeal excretion of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) - The change in nasopharyngeal viral excretion as measured by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 72 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of parent reported solicited symptoms associated with bronchiolitis during and after treatment - The time until the severity of ALL solicited symptoms associated with bronchiolitis (loss of appetite, activity level, respiratory effort and irritability) have first been assessed as mild or normal from the day of randomisation to the end of study day 7</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to day 7</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Actual duration of hospital admission for any reason - The period of time for which hospitalisation is required for any medical reason</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 to 3 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Need for interventional supportive medical care - The use of oxygen therapy, supportive ventilation, admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and supportive hydration therapy (NG or IV). Duration of use is calculated from the calendar day of randomisation to the date of cessation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to day 7</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchiolitis is an extremely common cause of respiratory illness in infants caused by viral
      infection.This study evaluates whether treatment with nitazoxanide (NTZ) reduces the duration
      and severity of respiratory symptoms caused by bronchiolitis. Half of the participants will
      receive NTZ while the other half will receive a placebo.</summary>
