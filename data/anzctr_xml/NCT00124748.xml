    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Imatinib mesylate

Experimental: Imatinib 400 mg - Oral dose of 400mg Imatinib once daily. All patients received the assigned dose starting on Day 0 (Visit 3). The dose of Imatinib could be interrupted, reduced, or escalated based on guidelines defined in protocol.

Experimental: imatinib 800 mg - Patients randomized to receive 800 mg Imatinib were to receive 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) oral administration, in the morning and the evening. All patients received the assigned dose starting on Day 0 (Visit 3). The dose of Imatinib could be interrupted or reduced based on guidelines defined in protocol.
