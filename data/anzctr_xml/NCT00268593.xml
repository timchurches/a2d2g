  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) response (incidence and duration) - 70% of patients (n = 36) had a &gt;50% reduction in PSA from baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6-8 weeks post enrolment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiologic response rate in patients with measurable disease - Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. This end point was not reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. This end point was not reported.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PSA progression-free survival - Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. This end point was not reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. This end point was not reported.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease progression-free survival - Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. This end point was not reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. This end point was not reported.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival - Median survival was 61 weeks and 1-year survival was 71%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Survival data collected to 100 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability - Recruitment was stopped due to higher than expected febrile neutropenia rate (27%). Fifty-one SAEs were reported in 33 patients, of which 7 were related to PI-88 treatment: non-neutropenic sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pulmonary embolism, febrile dyspnoea, haematuria (x2), left middle cerebral artery infarction.
Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported in &gt;5% of patients comprise dehydration, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea and thrombocytopenia.
Two patients died during the study, one due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and one due to metastatic prostate cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. Safety data collected throughout duration.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate questionnaire (FACT-P) - Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. This end point was not reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recruitment was stopped early due to elevated rates of febrile neutropenia. This end point was not reported.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exploratory predictive value of biologic parameters C-reactive protein (CRP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL6), D-dimer - Change in VEGF trended towards prediction of survival (p = 0.056); pre-treatment and post-treatment levels of CRP were predictive of survival (p = 0.026, and p = 0.005 respectively) but the change in CRP was not (p = 0.999). IL-6 pretreatment levels were not predictive (p = 0.5111) but post-treatment (p = 0.0008) and change (p = 0.0020) were.
These data need to interpreted with caution due to the small patient numbers involved.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Docetaxel (Taxotere) is an approved chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of
      androgen-independent prostate cancer. The aim of the study is to investigate whether addition
      of the investigational drug PI-88 will increase the efficacy of docetaxel in this disease.
      PI-88 inhibits cancer growth by inhibiting the development of new blood vessels and starving
      the tumour of oxygen and nutrients (anti-angiogenic). Because PI-88 and docetaxel have
      different mechanisms of action, they are expected to have increased (synergistic) activity
      when combined.</summary>
