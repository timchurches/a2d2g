  <interventions>
    <interventions>The present study will test the anti-stress, cognitive, and neurophysiological effects of acute L-theanine, Chamomile, Alpha GPC and phospholipid administration when compared to a placebo (vehicle control), using a randomised, controlled, double-blind, crossover design. 

Participants will be required to attend three sessions. The first visit is a screening and practice session, assessing eligibility and familiarising participants with cognitive tasks. Finally, structural brain information will be obtained during an MRI scan.  Subsequently, two testing days will be conducted a minimum of 48 hours apart. Participants will be assigned to a treatment sequence, such that one of each treatment is received across the two testing days. At testing days participants will receive a standardised lunch upon arrival, followed by a 30-minute break, then undergo baseline assessment of stress, mood, and cognitive function. After baseline assessment, treatment will be administered. 30-minutes after administration of treatment, participants will once again undergo assessment of stress, mood, and cognitive function, followed by recording of brain activity during rest and an attention task using magnetoencephalography (MEG). After this, the assessment of stress, mood, and cognitive function will be conducted a third time. 

Participants will consume all interventions orally as a drink of approximately 430 ml (14.5 fl oz). Both active and vehicle control treatments contain identical  ingredients of sweeteners (crystalline  fructose and sucralose) and preservatives (sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate) , gum acacia and malic acid. In addition, the active treatment contains L-Theanine (200 mg, L-Tea-Active), L-Alpha Glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha GPC; 25 mg)), phosphatidylserine (1mg) and chamomile (10 mg). </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female.
2. Aged 18-40 years.
3. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.
4. Understands and is willing and able to comply with all study procedures.
5. Fluent in written and spoken English.
6. Are in good general health with no history of psychiatric disease.
7. Must have normal, or corrected to normal vision
8. Participants must be right handed. This is for ease of analysis of the MEG data. There are hemispheric differences in terms of structure and function between right and left handed individuals that prove to be problematic when analysing the output. Given that this investigation will employ a method where participants need to press buttons as a response (in turn involving the motor cortex), it is wise to use an all right handed population.

    <concealment>Participants responded to advertisements. After successfully completing a telephone screen, they completed a practice session where they were introduced to mood questionnaires and then practiced the computerised cognitive tasks that will be used on testing days, passed a brief medical test and informed consent was obtained. They were then given a numerical identification number and was randomly allocated to a treatment series. Participants then returned for 2 testing sessions, receiving a different treatment each visit. The person who determined if a participant was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the participant would be allocated. Allocation was concealed by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
