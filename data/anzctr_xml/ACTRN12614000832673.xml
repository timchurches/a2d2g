  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ANZCPR group is a collaborative network of perfusion and interested researchers, who share the commitment to cooperation and collaboration in the pursuit of excellence in perfusion. The ANZCPR group are uniquely positioned to promote the establishment of a unique source of information for the Cardiac Surgical (Perfusion) community, and thus to meet the following vision and mission statements.

Vision: Empower all Cardiac Surgery Team Members to improve the understanding and practice of cardiopulmonary bypass to improve cardiac surgical patient outcomes.

Mission: Maintain and develop the Australian and New Zealand Collaborative Perfusion Registry for cardiac surgical procedures performed throughout Australia and New Zealand.
Promote the reporting and understanding of the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on patient outcomes through encouraging evidence based practices, quality assurance, quality improvement and research.

The ANZCPR group (formally known as Perfusion Downunder Collaboration (PDUC)) has evolved from the successful Perfusion Downunder (PDU) organisation which was established in 2005. The objectives of PDU were summarised in their mission statement, to promote original prospective research into the effects of perfusion management on patient outcomes and so validate perfusion practices and interventions throughout Australia and New Zealand". This is being achieved through a meeting of scientific rigour that engages a faculty of excellence with objectives that meet those of the mission statement. The long term objective is to grow perfusionist generated research initiatives, and to seek scientific based consensus on various perfusion strategies. An overriding objective is to foster networking both scientifically and personally within the perfusion profession. The ANZCPR collaboration is an associated entity with the PDU organisation which is sponsored by Cellplex Pty Ltd. The ANZCPR collaboration is governed by a clinical steering committee independent of the sponsor.</summary>

    <publicnotes>PLEASE NOTE: Data is retrospective to Ethics Committee (EC) approval dates as 4 sites started prospectively collecting data from 2007 - EC approval at the institutions involved was not required at the time for the collection of non-identifiable data onto a database, however an EC audit application and approval was required if requesting to audit the data.  This changed in 2008/2009 and so EC applications were made at all institutions from that time forward.</publicnotes>
