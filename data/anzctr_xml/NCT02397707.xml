  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of a single dose
      of GS-9857 in adults with normal and impaired hepatic function. Adults in the healthy control
      group will be matched to adults with impaired hepatic function by gender, age (± 10 years),
      and body mass index (± 15%).</summary>
