  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Assess the rate of oral rehydration solution intake in  the first 4 and 24 hours by children with acute gastroenteritis. The parents of enrolled children were instructed to record on a specific form:  amount of ORS consumed by the child in the first 4 and 24 hours</outcome>
      <timepoint>At first 4 and 24 hours of gastroenteritis</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the rate of resolution of diarrhea as total diarrhea duration and stool pattern. The parents of enrolled children were instructed to record on a specific form:  number and consistency of fecal outputs at 24, 48 and 72 hours;  time of the last abnormal (loose or liquid) stools preceding a normal evacuation;  occurrence of vomiting or adverse events.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis was performed by a statistician blind to the preparations received by children in the two groups. The Kolmorogov-Smirnov test was performed if continuous variable have a normal distribution. For categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square test or Fishers exact test were performed as appropriated. The two groups were compared for continuous variables by t-test for equality of means. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis (ITT). Patients allocated in each group were considered available for ITT analysis when received at least 2 doses of treatment. All tests of significance were two-sided. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software package for Windows (release16.0.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>All children aged 5 to 36 months observed in pediatrician offices for diarrhea lasting less than 24 hours with mild-moderate dehydration were considered eligible for the study. the patients were randomly allocated to: Group 1  receiving standard hypotonic oral rehydration solution; or to Group 2  receiving a hypotonic super-oral rehydration solution containing zinc2+ in gel formulation. The parents of enrolled children were instructed to record on a specific form: (a) amount of oral rehydration solution consumed by the child in the first 4 and 24 hours; (b) number and consistency of fecal outputs at 24, 48 and 72 hours; (c) time of the last abnormal (loose or liquid) stools preceding a normal evacuation; (d) occurrence of vomiting or adverse events.</summary>
