  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the interventional group will be given light boxes emitting light of up to 10 000 lux to use for a set period of individually determined time of the morning throughout their hospital stay, both in the intensive care unit (ICU) and ward. This should increase their daily light exposure. During the night patients will be given eye masks to reduce night time light exposure.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control groups will have standard hospital treament while being given similar light boxes that are modified to give out less than 10 lux while having a negligible effect on light exposure.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep is important for patient post-operative recovery. Following cardiac surgery, patients are often found to have disturbed sleep. If sleep quality or quantity is compromised there may be a consequent delay in post-operative recovery. The hospital environment has various characteristics which may cause sleep disruption:  the lighting environment is thought to be weaker than a natural lighting environment, patients are in pain, they are regularly awoken for monitoring and the hospital is noisy . As a response to the lighting environment, the circadian clock controls the timing of various physiological processes, including sleep. Consequently, sleep-wake cycles are influenced by lighting and time of day. We will monitor activity-rest rhythms to determine whether the disrupted sleep commonly experienced by the post-operative patient is possibly due to circadian disruption, inadequate pain management or some other variable. We aim to establish whether the use of an interventional therapeutic light source can improve post-operative recovery. Hypothetically, if circadian disruption is the underlying cause of sleep disruption, correctly timed light exposure should consolidate sleep-wake cycle timing, improving sleep quantity and quality. This may also have positive secondary outcomes such as improved mood and decreased recovery time.</summary>
