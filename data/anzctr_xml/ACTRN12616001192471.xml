  <interventions>
    <interventions>Aripiprazole. 
Aripiprazole to be administered by oral tablet(s) in accordance with the following schedule: 2mg once daily in Week 1; 5mg once daily in Week 2; 10mg once daily in Week 3; Week 4 to Week 12 increments to 15mg once daily, 20mg once daily then 30mg once daily for participants who have persistent symptoms and can tolerate further dose escalation, at discretion of treating team, with at least a 1-week gap between dose increments. The maximum allowable dose will be 30mg/day; Week 13 to Week 39  aripiprazole prescribed at discretion of treating team. At any stage, a dose may be reduced or an increment postponed at the discretion of the treating team, in consultation with the investigator(s). If a break in pharmacotherapy occurs, the participant may be recommenced on the investigational product, with the restarting dose at the discretion of the treating team, in consultation with the investigator(s).
 
Medication adherence will be monitored via capsule counts, recorded in returns to the Pharmacy and with the 10-item self-report Medication Adherence Rating Scale (Thompson, Kulkarni &amp; Sergejew, 2000). At each study visit, participants will be reminded in person to take study medication and to return empty containers. Participants may also be assisted with SMS or phone call reminders. They may be supported to program reminders in their phone calendar, a reminders app, or with a medication-reminder app.  

Participants will receive weekly psychosocial treatment in the Helping Young People Early (HYPE) program at Orygen Youth Health, comprising general psychiatric care, clinical case management and up to 16 x 50-minute sessions of individual Cognitive Analytic Therapy. Treatment is provided by a multidisciplinary team including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists. social workers and occupational therapists and is delivered at Orygen Youth Health sites and in the community.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo. 
Placebo will be administered using the same dosing schedule as the aripiprazole intervention.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size and Power:
Controlling for covariates, with the chance of detecting small to medium effects (effect size f = 0.20) at the 0.76 power level, and using a conservative attrition estimate of 20% (previous HYPE research attrition 14% (Chanen, et al., 2008)), we would require a total of  n=154: 77 aripiprazole and 77 placebo participants.

For MRI, there is a consensus that groups of approximately n=22 are appropriate for detecting small effects (Cohens d=0.2) with 80% power (Desmond &amp; Glover, 2002; Mumford &amp; Nichols, 2008). 

Statistical Analyses:
The main analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat population. To determine whether there are group differences on the primary and secondary outcome measures we will use a likelihood based mixed-effects model, repeated measures approach (MMRM) (Gueorguieva &amp; Krystal, 2004). The MMRM model includes the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction. Planned comparisons will be done with the MMRM models to determine between group differences in change of symptoms measures from baseline to week 12. We will also undertake sensitivity analysis to allow us to examine the impact of various ways of scenarios (e.g., dealing with missing data) on the robustness of outcomes. 

To analyse the MRI data, first-level connectivity maps for each participant will be carried forward to the group level using the summary statistics approach to random-effects analyses. We will adopt a 2 X 2 flexible factorial design (group x time) to impute the causal effect of aripiprazole on connectivity with the auditory cortex seeds. Statistical comparisons will proceed in two stages: (i) a small volumecorrected comparison of hypothesised regions-of-interest (ROIs), and (ii) a whole brain exploration of connectivity differences. For the hypothesis-based comparisons, between-group statistical parametric maps will be thresholded at PFWE &lt;0.05 (KE &gt; 10 voxels), corrected for a mask volume that encompasses the inferior frontal gyrus, defined bilaterally using the WFU PickAtlas. Similarly stringent criteria will be used for the whole-brain analyses. Flexible factorial models, similar to that outlined above, will be adopted to test for main effects and interactions using the appropriate combination of F and t-tests.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) affects over 95,000 15-24 year-old Australians and is a leading cause disability and mortality in this age group. Up to half of patients with BPD experience distressing and disabling auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) but opinion about their veracity and their treatment is polarised. Second generation antipsychotic medications (SGAs) are prescribed frequently off label for BPD, despite limited supporting evidence. Recent studies show that AVHs in BPD and schizophrenia are phenomenologically indistinguishable. However, no randomised controlled trial (RCT) has ever tested whether conventional pharmacotherapy for AVHs in schizophrenia is applicable to AVHs in BPD. This study is a 12-week, single-centre, RCT of aripiprazole versus placebo, with a 27-week follow-up period, for 15-25 year-olds with BPD and AVH. The primary outcome is AVH severity, measured using a standardised scale. Secondary outcomes include BPD severity, general psychopathology, functioning, experience of psychotic symptoms and changes in neurobiological mechanisms underlying AVHs that are associated with treatment. Currently, the NHMRC clinical practice guidelines for BPD recommend against the use of antipsychotic medications as first-line treatment for BPD, which places them in direct conflict with NHMRC clinical practice guidelines for psychotic disorders. This novel study will advance knowledge about treatment for BPD by providing information about the efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of AVHs when they co-occur with BPD. It will also extend knowledge about the phenomenology of AVHs, whether AVHs should be considered as part of the symptom profile of BPD and the neurobiological basis of this symptom.</summary>
