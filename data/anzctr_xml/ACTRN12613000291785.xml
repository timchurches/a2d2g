  <interventions>
    <interventions> Sixteen (BMI 19-25 kg/m2) healthy subjects, aged between 18 - 35 years, will be recruited.  All subjects will be required to be weight-stable at study entry, as determined by their self-reported weight in the preceding 3 months, and will be required to maintain their normal physical activity over the course of the study.
Each subject will be studied on three occasions, separated by at least 3 (and up to 7) days.  Each visit will be either sedentary or involve exercise on a treadmill at one of two intensities (35 and 70% VO2max) for 60 minutes, with the three interventions administered in a counter-balanced order, by administering the various procedures in different sequences.  On each occasion antropyloroduodenal motility, plasma CCK, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY concentrations, appetite perceptions, energy intake and energy expenditure will be measured. 
Peak aerobic capacity of each subject will be determined within a week before the start of the study using a screening treadmill test (GXT), which will be supervised by a medical doctor in the Department of Medicine.  This test involves collection of ventilatory and respirometric measurements from the subject during progressive increases in speed (0.8 km/h/2 min) while walking/running on a level treadmill.  During the GXT, subjects will be monitored with a Polar a 12-lead electrocardiogram will be performed, and blood pressure will also be monitored.  The subjects will also wear the SenseWear bands to provide a direct comparison with the VO2 max test..  During this screening test, as well as at intervals during the study, subjects will breathe through a mouthpiece equipped with a two-way valve. This protocol is well established and commonly used in exercise studies (62).  Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) will be measured from expired gases that are continuously sampled from a mixing-chamber and analyzed for gas flow and for oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations by a metabolic cart (VO2000, Medgraphics, St. Paul, MN, USA).  Heart rate will be monitored with a PolarÂ® heart rate strap and watch. </interventions>
    <comparator>Sedentary
Participants will be required to remain lying down during the sedentary study for 60 minutes. Measurements will be made at the same time points as for the exercise interventions. On this occasion antropyloroduodenal motility, plasma CCK, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY concentrations, appetite perceptions, energy intake and energy expenditure will be measured. </comparator>

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a 30 minute screening visit. A questionnaire is is answered by the volunteer, based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria and eligibility is determined. A signed consent form is obtained. 
Peak aerobic capacity of each subject will be determined within a week before the start of the study using a screening treadmill test (GXT).  This test involves collection of ventilatory and respirometric measurements from the subject during progressive increases in speed (0.8 km/h/2 min) while walking/running on a level treadmill.  During the GXT, subjects will be monitored with a Polar a 12-lead electrocardiogram will be performed, and blood pressure will also be monitored. 
Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised into a treatment for each study visit, using a randomisation table created on an excel spreadsheet. Randomisation involved contacting the holder (study assistant) of the randomisation table to inform them of the next subjects details and study dates. The unblinded assistant is therefore responsible for allocating random treatment to the subject.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate hunger, energy intake, antropyloroduodenal motility, and plasma concentrations of the gut hormones, ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY3-36 (PYY3-36), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), in response to exercise of two intensities, 35% and 70% of peak oxygen consumption (VO2), and a no-exercise control condition, in healthy, lean young men. 
Each subject will be studied on three occasions.  Each visit will be either sedentary or involve exercise at one of two intensities (35 and 70% VO2max) for 60 minutes, with the three interventions administered in a counter-balanced order.  On each occasion antropyloroduodenal motility, plasma CCK, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY3-36 concentrations, appetite perceptions, energy intake and energy expenditure will be measured.  Peak aerobic capacity of each subject will be determined within a week before the start of the study using a screening treadmill test.  During this screening test, as well as at intervals during the study, subjects will breathe through a mouthpiece equipped with a two-way valve. VO2max will be measured from expired gases that are continuously sampled by a metabolic cart.
