Experimental: Single-Arm - CBT-501


Treatment: drugs: CBT-501
Subjects will be assigned to a dose level in the order of study entry. Treatment includes a minimum of four 28-day cycles at three planned dose levels (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg). Each treatment cycle is comprised of 2 doses of study drug administered by IV infusion on Days 1, 15 on a 28-day cycle.
