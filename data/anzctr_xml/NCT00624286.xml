    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Indacaterol 150 µg
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to indacaterol

Experimental: Indacaterol 150 µg - Patients inhaled indacaterol 150 µg once daily in the morning between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) for 12 weeks. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting ß2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo to indacaterol - Patients inhaled placebo to indacaterol once daily in the morning between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) for 12 weeks. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting ß2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.


Treatment: drugs: Indacaterol 150 µg
Indacaterol was supplied in powder filled capsules together with a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) device.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to indacaterol
Placebo to indacaterol was supplied in powder filled capsules together with a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) device.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) 24 Hours Post-dose at the End of the Study (Week 12 + 1 Day, Day 85) - FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose at the end of treatment. The analysis included baseline FEV1, FEV1 pre-dose and 30 minutes post-dose of salbutamol during screening, and FEV1 pre-dose and 1 hour post-dose of ipratropium during screening as covariates.</outcome>
