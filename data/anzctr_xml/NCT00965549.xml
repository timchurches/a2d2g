    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - INSULIN GLARGINE (HOE901)
Treatment: drugs - Insulin aspart
Treatment: drugs - Insulin Glulisine

Experimental: Lantus + Apidra basal plus one - Before randomization (common with arm 2):
A 1 to 2 weeks of screening period: patients will continue on their current insulin and oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) therapy.
8 weeks of run-in period: patients will switch their treatment for insulin glargine (one daily injection at bedtime) and all OADs (with the exception of metformin) will be discontinued.
After randomization:
24 weeks of treatment period: Insulin (Lantus®) + metformin (if applicable) + a single injection of insulin glulisine (Apidra®), the latter administered at the patients largest meal of the day

Active Comparator: NovoMix 30 Biphasic - Before randomization (common with arm 1):
A 1 to 2 weeks of screening period: patients will continue on their current insulin and oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) therapy.
8 weeks of run-in period: patients will switch their treatment for insulin glargine (one daily injection at bedtime) and all OADs (with the exception of metformin) will be discontinued.
After randomization:
24 weeks of treatment period: Insulin aspart/ insulin protamine crystallised insulin aspart (NovoMix® 30) + metformin (if applicable)


Treatment: drugs: INSULIN GLARGINE (HOE901)
LANTUS®: Solution for injection. 100U/mL in a prefilled pen (SoloStar®)

Treatment: drugs: Insulin aspart

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority at six months of a basal plus one
      insulin regimen (Lantus plus one injection of Apidra) compared with a biphasic insulin
      regimen (NovoMix 30) at controlling glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes.

      The secondary objective are:

        -  To compare the proportion of patients in each treatment group reaching HbA1c target (&lt;
           7%) at the end of the treatment period

        -  To compare the rates of hypoglycaemia (total, severe, nocturnal)

        -  To compare the change in body weight from visit 10 to visit 24

        -  To compare the change in diabetes specific quality of life and other patient reported
           outcomes from visit 10 to visit 24

             -  Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - status and change (DTSQs+c)

             -  Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) questionnaire

             -  Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ)

             -  EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ5D) questionnaire

        -  To record the change in the daily dose of insulin from visit 2 to visit 10 and visit 10
           to visit 24</summary>
