  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study involves a screen-and-treat design. All eligible families will be screened approximately 1 week after the accident.  Families who screen at 'high-risk' will then be randomly allocation to intervention or treatment as usual conditions.  Families who screen at 'low-risk' will not need to participate in the intervention. However, these parents will be invited to fill in some brief questionnaires at 2 weeks and 6 months after the accident to monitor the progress of their child over this period. 

The intervention will consist of 2 face-to-face sessions (60 min) and 2 follow-up calls or short follow-up face-to-face meetings (5-15 min), respectively.  All sessions will be conducted with parents and with children participating when developmentally appropriate. Treatment Session 1 will begin approximately 2 weeks post accident. Follow-up phone-call 1 will be 3 days after Session 1. Session 2 will be conducted 1 week after Session 1 and follow-up call 2 will occur 4 weeks after Session 1.

The treatment will be conducted according to a manual that will specify the treatment procedures and timing. The first session aims to: (1) obtain the parents story about their childs accident and medical treatment to normalise experiences and to convey empathy and understanding and to assess level of parental distress (2) provide psychoeducation materials to help parents understand and normalize their own reactions and to promote positive coping (3) provide psychoeducation materials to help parents to understand and normalize the reactions of their child and to identify signs that indicate risk for ongoing problems (4) provide parents with general coping strategies to prevent or manage their childs distress (5) provide parents with a storybook (Max the brave) to help them talk to their child about accident related experiences and to show how the character successfully copes with the experience (6) give children an Owl Toy Lu Lu that they can use for comfort and to feel brave in scary situations and (7) teach parents how to help their child to create an accurate story about the accident and medical treatment and to provide exposure to these memories.  The second session aims to (1) educate and normalise how parenting behaviours and the parent-child relationship can change following a childs accident and help parents to identify any unhelpful behaviours and discuss goals for change and (2) teach parents how to effectively manage their childs traumatic stress reactions (i.e. Fear and avoidance, Separation anxiety, Tantrums, aggression and disobedience and Sleeping problems). </interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual: Treatment as usual consists of the social worker (SW) initiating contact with families to offer services. If problems are identified (i.e. parental guilt, distress, concerns regarding child coping, external stressors) the SW interventions would include: acknowledgement and normalisation of these concerns, reactions, feelings, psychoeducation around responses to injury, trauma, coping and adjustment and referrals to appropriate services if needed. SW will continue to follow-up with the family at the next appointment/s and further explore adjustment and coping if necessary. From there, if significant issues are present appropriate referrals are made. Occupational therapists (OTs) use social stories and medical play to help children prepare for medical procedures. They also provide psychoeducation on concerns parents may have related to sleeping and behaviour.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Australia, accidental injury represents the most common type of traumatic event experienced by children under the age of 6 years.  Recent research has shown that around 10-30% of young injured children will go on to develop chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Parents of injured children are also at risk of PTSD and this is associated with short and long-term consequences for their childs physical and psychological recovery.  PTSD is a complex and serious disorder that is associated with a range of adverse psychiatric and health outcomes; poorer adherence to medical treatment; reduced wound healing; diminished health-related quality of life; impaired parent-child relationships; and can significantly impact psychological, cognitive, social and neurobiological development. Despite the significance of this problem, to date, the mental health needs of injured young children have been neglected. One reason for this is due to the uncertainty and considerable debate around how to best provide early psychological intervention to traumatised children and adults. In particular, there are currently no published studies on early intervention for young traumatised children. The proposed research therefore aims to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of a screening and indicated prevention program for injured young children (1-6 years) and their parents.  The study will employ a randomised control trial design and children who are screened as high-risk for PTSD and their parents will be randomised to either (1) 2-session face-to-face child and family focused intervention or (2) treatment as usual.  Assessment will be completed at baseline (2 weeks), 3 and 6 months post injury.  The development, evaluation and dissemination of effective indicated prevention programs for young children and parents have the potential for enormous national and international benefit.</summary>
