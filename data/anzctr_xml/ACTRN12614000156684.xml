    <interventions>Survivorship care plan- A patient-held written plan for follow-up care after treatment for early breast cancer. 
The survivorship care plan has three components:
(1) Record of cancer pathology and treatment
(2) Plan for follow-up care (specialist visits and tests)
(3) Lifestyle information to maximise health and wellbeing 

The care plan will be developed by one of the patient's regular cancer specialists, in consultation with the woman herself, during a 30 minute consultation. A schedule for follow-up consultations and tests will be developed. The woman will also be advised about what to expect (health and emotions) in the months and years to follow, and who to contact if there are problems between visits.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate whether the addition of a survivorship care plan to standard follow-up care is feasible and whether it will have an impact on quality of life and unmet needs in survivors of early breast cancer.

Who is it for?
Participants in this study are women aged 18 years and above who have completed hospital-based treatment for early invasive breast cancer (surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

Study details
All participants in this study receive a survivorship care plan in addition to standard follow-up care. The survivorship care plan is a written summary of cancer treatment with a follow-up plan for future care. The care plan will be developed by one of the patient's regular cancer specialists, in consultation with the woman herself. A schedule for follow-up consultations and tests will be developed. The woman will also be advised about what to expect (health and emotions) in the months and years to follow, and who to contact if there are problems between visits. 

Participants will complete baseline questionnaires evaluating their unmet needs and quality of life. They will then receive routine cancer follow-up, supplemented by the survivorship care plan for a period of 18 months. Questionnaires will be repeated at 6 and 18 months from enrolment in the study. The 6 and 18 months questionnaires will also include an evaluation of the care plan.
