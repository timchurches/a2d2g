  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a 6 month trial with ethical approval for future follow-up assessments over the longer term.  The present trial will consist of 208 persons 60-90 years of age, living  independently or supported accommodation within an aged care facility. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of four conditions:
Group 1 : Diet change to reflect a greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet
Group 2 : Exercise change to  walk  up to 30 minutes every second day
Group 3 : Combined diet and exercise change 
Group 4 : Control group with no diet or exercise change

Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three interventions or to a control group with no lifestyle change. 

Diet: The diet has been created by a dietician and clearly outlined in a healthier living booklet that the dietician has prepared for this trial. The administration of the diet will be by the participants.Those allocated to the diet change group will be required to score their diet in relation to a Mediterranean diet sheet and achieve at least an 85% adherence to the diet.   Instruction on how to self assess the diet sheets and further internal programs of guidance with the participants will be given to participants to inform them of food choices via a specifically designed Mediterranean Healthier living diet recipe booklet.  Participants will cook for themselves and be issued with recipes and meal ideas. Each person in the diet change group will be allocated 6 X 750ml bottles of premium extra virgin olive oil for the study ( allowing for an average usage of 46ml/day). An ongoing interaction with the participants will take place at 6 weeks (10-20 min telephone call)after the initiation of the trial by a member of the research team and then again at the 3 month (20-30 min face-to-face discussion) intervention and then again at 4.5 months ( 10-20 min telephone call)  to ensure their adherence to the diet guide and also to ensure their enthusiasm and participation is maintained. 
Those allocated to the exercise group will be required to walk 35 to 40 mins four to five days per week as their aerobic exercise. An ongoing interaction with the participants will take place at 6 weeks after the initiation of the trial by a member of the research team and then again at the 3 month intervention and then again at 4.5 months  to ensure their maintaining the walking programme and also to ensure their enthusiasm and participation is maintained. 
Walking does not require supervision or training. A guidance document prepared will be given to the participants with a pedometer to measure steps and distance covered during the walk. 
Combined exercise and diet: Participants allocated to the exercise and diet change group will be required to walk 35 to 40 mins four to five days per week and will follow the procedure outlined in the diet condition i.e. achieve at least an 85% adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Each person in this group will also be allocated 6 X 750ml bottles of premium extra virgin olive oil for the study.An ongoing interaction with the participants will take place at 6 weeks after the initiation of the trial by a member of the research team and then again at the 3 month intervention and then again at 4.5 months  to ensure their adherence to the diet guide and walking program  to ensure their enthusiasm and participation is maintained.
The non intervention group  will also receive ongoing interaction  at 6 weeks after the initiation of the trial by a member of the research team and then again at the 3 month intervention and then again at 4.5 months  to ensure  their enthusiasm and participation is maintained.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiovascular health: 
Blood pressure and Arterial Stiffness and Aortic Blood pressure
This will be measured by using a SphygmoCor Xcel system. The SphygmoCor XCEL PWA device provides measurement Central Aortic Blood Pressure and Augmentation index in 60 seconds. A blood pressure cuff is placed on the patients arm, over the brachial artery. The SphygmoCor XCEL system, , takes the patients brachial systolic and diastolic pressure, and then captures the patients brachial waveform. The brachial waveform is then analyzed by the SphygmoCor Brachial GTF to provide a Central aortic waveform, and Central Blood pressure measurements such as Central Aortic Systolic BP, Central Pulse pressure (Pulse Wave Analysis) and Augmentation index are also displayed. 
Pulse wave velocity will also be derived, using a femoral cuff to capture the femoral waveform and tonometer pressure sensor to capture the carotid waveform.</outcome>

    <concealment>After agreements are in place with independent living aged care facilities, posters and bulletins will be used to invite residents to an information session.  As a result of the session, information will be provided to the potential participant and an initial eligibility screening will be performed.Participants will initially be screened to assess eligibility against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential participants will also be administered the MMSE to check for potential cognitive impairment, one of the exclusion criteria. Potential participants will also be administered the Geriatric Depression Scale to determine if any depressive symptoms are present, also part of the exclusion criteria. Participants will be requested to have their consent forms to be signed by their medical practitioner to ensure their health status will allow them to participate as well as informing their doctor of the trial. Once the signed consent forms are received, a participant is centrally randomised to a group by a computer generated randomisation and the study will be initiated.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation of participants to treatment groups will be determined by a computer number random generator.Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number.

    <statisticalmethods> Using Cohens effect size criteria, this represents a medium effect size (Cohen, 1992). Power analysis was conducted using GPower 3.1.3 to determine the sample size required for a four armed intervention (exercise change only, diet change only, exercise and diet change, no change) using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) design. It was indicated that a total sample of 180 participants would be required to detect a medium effect size (f=.25), at a power level of 0.8 and a significance level of p&lt;.05. In order to allow for a 15% drop out from the trial, a total sample of 208 participants will be recruited for this trial, with 52 individuals randomised to each arm of the study.     </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to investigate the effects of a 6 month lifestyle intervention, based on a diet and exercise program, on cognitive function, mood general health and well-being. The intervention will be conducted in those aged 60-90 years who live independently in age care accommodation. 
We have published data showing that it is possible to improve mood and cognitive parameters in younger individuals with as little as 10 days adherence to a Mediterranean diet. The six month intervention period represents maintenance over a longer period of time important for longer term adoption of a change of lifestyle.
