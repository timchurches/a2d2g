Active Comparator: Alpha-cycoldextrin - All subjects randomized to receive Alpha-cycoldextrin will orally ingest two tablets containing Alpha-cyclodextrin, with their standardized liquid breakfast (100 micro Ci of [3H]triolein and 20 micro Ci of [14C]tripalmitin). The tablets will be consumed with 150 ml of still water immediately prior to consuming each meal. Subjects will be observed for a period of 48 hours as an in-patient, and then an additional 24 hours as an out-patient. During this time they will undergo a meal fatty acid metabolism study, through blood and fecal sampling, to assess meal fatty acid oxidation and storage.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - All subjects randomized to receive placebo will orally ingest two placebo tablets with their standardized liquid breakfast (100 micro Ci of [3H]triolein and 20 micro Ci of [14C]tripalmitin). The tablets will be consumed with 150 ml of still water immediately prior to consuming each meal. Subjects will be observed for a period of 48 hours as an in-patient, and then an additional 24 hours as an out-patient. During this time they will undergo a meal fatty acid metabolism study, through blood and fecal sampling, to assess meal fatty acid oxidation and storage.


Other interventions: Alpha-cyclodextrin
Alpha-cyclodextrin (a-CD) is a soluble dietary fiber that has a history of use in foods and as a pharmaceutical excipient. Recently the ability of the fiber to bind to dietary fat has led to further investigation of the possible health benefits of dietary supplementation with this fiber.

Other interventions: Placebo
Identical looking placebo tablet to active (Alpha-cyclodextrin)
