  <interventions>
    <interventions>A total of 70 participants will be recruited. The research will be conducted within Waitemata District Health Boards Nutrition and Dietetic Services outpatient service. Nutrition and Dietetics Service receive weight management referrals for patients from specialists and Waitemata District Health Board staff. All clients referred to the Nutrition and Dietetic Services outpatient service at North Shore and Waitakere Hospitals between June 2014 and March 2015 will be screened for eligibility.  
Participants will be seen in a small group setting with approximately ten participants per group. Participants will be able to bring along a support person to each session.  The group education sessions will consist of one x 1.5 hours per week over a four week period (total of four sessions).  Sessions will be held in the early evening on the hospital grounds.  The group sessions will be structured and use active learning principles.  Participants will be given a programme plan and resource hand outs on topics covered during the sessions.  Homework activities will be discussed and identified at the end of each session for the participant to complete during the upcoming week.  
To identify changes in eating behaviours participants will complete Intuitive eating questionnaire (IES-2) and Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire.  To identify changes in food intake participants will complete a short questionnaire regarding food intake in relation to New Zealand Food and Nutrition Guidelines and also a 24 hour food recall.  Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, BMI, waist and hip) will also be collected.

The groups will be facilitated by the researcher, a NZ Registered Dietitian trained in an intuitive eating approach and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy.  

Post group education at 4, 8 and 12 weeks , participants will be seen by the Researcher/Dietitian for an approximately 30 minute individual session held in the Dietitian Outpatient Office. During the individual session the participant will reflect on the progress made in the preceding weeks relating to their behaviours, eating habits, changes they have made
