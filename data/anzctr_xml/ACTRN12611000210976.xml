  <interventions>
    <interventions>The glycaemic index (GI) of a meal is not normally measured, it is calculated according to a formula using the GIs of the individual foods contributing to the meal. It has been suggested that this predictive method is inaccurate. We therefore designed a study to test how the GIs of three meals, obtained using the predictive formula, compared with the direct determination of the GIs of the meals. The three meals all comprised a portion of chicken, sweet potato, peas, carrots and sauce having a combined carbohydrate content of 25 g. Another 25 g of carbohydrate was provided by including in the meal either potato, rice or pasta.The meals were approximately equicaloric (2100 kJ) and contained approximately 55% carbohydrate, 27% fat and 18% protein. Each meal was consumed comfortably within 15 minutes. Each participant consumed each of the meals with at least two days between successive tests. Participants were given a standard protocol to follow including an overnight fast.</interventions>
    <comparator>Three meals were consumed and the GIs of the meals directly measured. These GI values were compared with the meal GIs estimated from knowing the GI of each of the foods contributing to the meal and summing them up using a mathematical formula.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the comparison of meal GIs obtained using two methods, direct measurement and estimation. Direct measurement involved measuring postprandial hyperglycaemia in response to a glucose reference beverage and to each of the meals at intervals over 2 hour periods. The GIs of each of the meals was subsequently calculated by expressing the blood glucose incremental area under the curve of each meal relative to the glucose reference beverage.  Estimation involved determining the GIs of each of the carbohydrate foods contributing to the meals and summing the GIs according to a formula.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome is to examine how the postprandial blood glucose concentrations obtained following the consumption of three test meals compare.</outcome>
