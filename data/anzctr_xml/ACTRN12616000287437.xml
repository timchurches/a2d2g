    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Interested subjects will contact the study investigator who will then assess the subject's eligibility to participate over the phone. If the participant is deemed eligible, the participant will be sent a consent form, participant information statement and will be enrolled in the study. They will also be sent a series of self-administered questionnaires (medical history, physical activity, 3-day food record) along with instructions. All forms will need to be completed and returned upon baseline visit.
Allocation to treatments will be based on the computer generated block randomization method to ensure well-balanced groups. The allocation concealment will be conducted using sealed opaque envelopes</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation to treatment will be based on the computer generated block randomization method. Males and females will be stratified to allow for gender sub-group analysis.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size determination
Seventeen participants will give an 80% power to detect a 1.0 unit drop in HOMA-IR. To determine whether effects are gender-specific the sample size will be doubled to ensure an adequate sample of males and females. To allow for drop-outs 20 participants will be recruited to each group (males, placebo and intervention; females, placebo and intervention) giving a total of 80 participants.
Baseline data
Baseline measures will be used as covariates. Gender, BMI and other potentially confounding variables such as weight and age may be added as covariates if they are significantly correlated with the outcome measures.
Treatment effects
All the data relating the significant effects of n-3PUFA are expressed as mean Â± SEM or median + IQR as appropriate. The effect of interventions on glucose tolerance, HOMA-IR, blood glucose levels and HbA1C between groups will be estimated by using two-way ANOVA with post hoc comparisons (Tukeys honestly significant difference).
Significance (P-value set at 0.05) indicates the changes from the baseline values. Changes from the baselines will be determined using paired t-tests. This statistical analysis helps in determining whether there will be a significant main effect for each independent variable by testing for between subject effects. Sub-group analysis will allow investigators to investigate any gender-based differences in effect.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Development of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with overweight and obesity. Due to the increasing prevalence of obesity in Australia, combined with an increasingly aged population, type 2 diabetes and associated health complications will become an increasingly burdensome public health problem in the near future. Epidemiological studies, as well as animal studies, suggest that a higher omega-3 status might be protective against obesity-related insulin resistance, however, intervention trials have had equivocal results. Recent evidence suggests that the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on insulin resistance might be sex dependent. Therefore the aim of the current study is to determine whether there is a sex-dependent response on measures of insulin resistance to an omega-3PUFA intervention</summary>
