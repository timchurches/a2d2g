  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Coeliac disease is a condition which affects 1% of the Australian population and is an abnormal immune response to ingested gluten resulting in damage to the small bowel.  The aim of treatment is to heal the small bowel and thus avoid long term complications. Despite adherance to a strict gluten free diet, up to 1 in 3 people fail to achieve this healing.  The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and safety of budesonide, a corticosteroid medication, in inducing faster and more complete healing of the small bowel than the gluten free diet alone in patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease.</summary>
