  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dual delivery of the Lidcombe Program for stuttering and also individualized speech sound disorder based on interventions that are evidence-based for this caseload.  The Lidcombe Program is delivered in 2 stages, with stage 1 considered the active treatment stage and stage 2 being the maintenance/monitoring stage.  Currently approximately 90% of children complete stage 1 of the Lidcombe Program in around 20 weeks, although this is for children who stutter in isolation.  It is not known how long children with concomitant speech sound disorder will take to respond to the Lidcombe Program.  Similarly, there are many evidence-based forms of speech sound disorder intervention types.  During this trial, the intervention chosen will be based on the individual child's goals and needs, in line with surrounding evidence.  As such it is impossible to predict treatment time in this instance.
Much of the research looks at treating these two co-occurring disorders in isolation.  This experimental phase I trial aims to look at whether the two disorders can be treated at the same time, using evidence-based approaches to therapy.  The research team will treat participants for up to 9 months if required.  If participants have not reached the end of stage 1 of the Lidcombe Program by 22 weeks, treatment will revert to delivering the Lidcombe Program alone, as is standard protocol.  If after 9 months, participants require ongoing intervention (i.e. stage 2 of the Lidcombe Program or treatment for residual speech sound error), referrals will be made for participants to access this treatment via the appropriate service provider(s).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome for the stuttering will be percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS), based on 10 minute parent conducted audio recordings made away from the clinic.  Two recordings would be conducted: one with the child speaking to a household resident, and the other speaking to a non-household resident, although this person must be familiar to the child (all assessment occasions noted below).  Percentage of syllables stuttered will also be gained within the clinic (at all assessment occasions noted below).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. At entry into research program
2. At entry into stage 2 of Lidcombe Program
3. Nine months post entry into the study
4. Twelve months post entry into the study
5. Eighteen months post entry into the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome measure for the speech sound disorder will be measured by percentage of consonants correct (PCC), based on conversational speech sample.  Samples will be gathered within the clinic from interaction between either parent and child or researching clinician and child  (at all assessment occasions noted below).  Percentage of consonants correct within a single word naming test, one sub-test from the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (at all assessment occasions noted below).</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Diagnosis of stuttering obtained by consensus between 2 speech pathologists or between 1 speech pathologist and caregiver
Diagnosis of speech sound disorder determined by the presence of either a) two or more age-inappropriate phonological processes or; b) one atypical phonological process
Participants and caregivers will have a functional command and understanding of the English language
Hearing levels reported within normal limits
Pass a receptive and expressive language screener.  If screener not passed, then receptive and expressive language abilities rated at no greater than mildly delayed on subsequently administered standardised assessment
Oral motor structure and function must be measured and assessed as being within normal limits
Speech sound errors must be phonological in nature (i.e. not suspected childhood apraxia of speech, lateral lisps etc. therefore child must be stimulable in at least 1 context for the sounds in error)

    <concealment>This is a non-controlled trial, therefore all participants wishing to enroll will be delivered the same treatment protocol.
Procedures for enrolling are:
The information statements will be distributed to the treating clinicians at the University of Newcastleâ€™s Stuttering Clinic, who are not part of this research project.  These clinicians will pass on the information statement and consent forms to interested participants, conforming to NS3.3.17 (National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research, 2007) (where the researcher is the treating clinician, consent from participants sought by person independent to the research).  Participants may be drawn from current presenting clients or from the current clinical waiting list.
Clinical staff will invite potential interested participants to contact the research team if they have queries about the project.  If willing to consent, participants will give signed consent forms back to treating clinicians who will then pass these on to the research team.
Once consent forms are received, the student researcher will contact the family to arrange a suitable time to engage participants in conversation about the research procedures and gain verbal assent from child (if appropriate).  An initial battery of assessments will be conducted at this time to ascertain eligibility criteria.  If potential participants meet these criteria, they will be advised of this and may commence the therapy protocol as soon as convenient.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this clinical trial is to establish whether stuttering and speech sound disorder can be treated simultaneously.  It is estimated that between 30-40% of children who stutter also have a speech sound disorder.  Both disorders are known to have effects that may continue into the child's school years and beyond if not treated early.  Currently there are a number of effective interventions that aim to treat fluency and speech sound disorders when they present in isolation.  A small number of participants will be recruited to carry out a combined stuttering/speech sound disorder treatment program to establish safety and correct clinical protocols.</summary>
