  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Smoking is the most significant cause of lost healthy life in New Zealand. Smoking cessation dramatically reduces the risk of smokingrelated diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer and is thus a key strategy for reducing health inequalities. Medicines currently available in New Zealand to help people stop smoking, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, nortriptyline and varenicline, are not used by many smokers (at least 70% of whom want to quit) because of low acceptability, side effects, cost and contraindications. Cytisine, an alkaloid found in plants such as Golden Rain and the New Zealand Kowhai, may address some of these concerns. Cytisine is a partial agonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is thought to act by attenuating unpleasant tobacco withdrawal symptoms while simultaneously making smoking less rewarding. It has been used in Central and Eastern Europe for several decades.  Evidence from three placebo-controlled trials conducted several decades ago in Eastern Europe suggests that cytisine is effective. However, these trials reported limited safety data, and no other human data are available in the literature. With cytisine appearing promising as a smoking cessation aid, it is essential to obtain human pharmacokinetic, dose response and adverse effects data to inform future studies.</summary>
