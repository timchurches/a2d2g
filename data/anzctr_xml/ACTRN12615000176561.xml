    <studytitle>Health And Bread Intervention Trials: Effect of changing bread composition on cardiovascular disease marker. </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>The effect of a 12 week intervention changing the composition bread, so its composition is either lower in sodium or contains nuts or beetroot, on markers of cardiovascular disease in comparison to a control bread amongst those with at least one characteristic of the metabolic syndome.

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be assigned to one of the studys four arms for a period of 12 weeks. The four arms consist of: 1) a low sodium bread (1g of salt per 100g bread), 2) a beetroot bread which is high in nitrate (35g beetroot per 100g bread), 3) a nut bread which is high in L-arginine and unsaturated fats (30g nuts per 100g bread) and 4) a control bread. Participants will be provided with bread throughout the study. Adherence will be monitored via tick sheets, volume of bread uneaten, and changes in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations, urinary sodium and food diaries.

Apart from changing the bread composition, participants will be allowed to eat their usual diet. 
Participants should consume 6 slices or more of bread per day.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure,  will be measured in triplicate using a SphygmoCor (AtCor medical). The participant will be seated for at rest for at least 15 minutes prior to the test.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity will be measured using a SphygmoCor (AtCor medical), this will be completed following the blood pressure measurement.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body composition - segmental body composition will be measured by bioelectrical impedance (BIA), (Tanita). Participants will have arrived at the clinic fasted for all tests. </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Consumer acceptability - . Hedonic ratings, (overall liking) of the breads will be measured during a sensory testing session in the laboratory at baseline and upon completion of the 12-week intervention period. In addition, monotony ratings (desire to consume) and overall liking of the nuts breads will be measured at weekly intervals during the intervention. Ratings of overall liking and desire to consume will be measured on 150mm visual analogue scales (VAS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood loTotal cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides will be measured. Two blood samples will be collected during each testing week to account for intra-individual variation in blood lipid measures. Total and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations will be measured by enzymatic methods using a Cobas Mira Plus analyser. Plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration will be calculated using the Friedewald formula </outcome>
