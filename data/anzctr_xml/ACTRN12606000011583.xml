  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to receive Coninuous positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment with no humidification or humidification using thermosmartTM technology. After four weeks of treatment participants will be crossed over to the alternative arm of the study. They will complete four weeks on this arm.

Participants will complete a subjective questionnaire after one night and at the end of each arm of treatment (i.e. weeks four and eight) weeks. At the end of four and eight weeks objective compliance will be obtained from the CPAP device.</interventions>
