  <interventions>
    <interventions>Parents and children in the feather intervention group were supplied with and instructed to use only the feather pillow and quilt on a daily basis for 12 months, with no other forms of upper bedding apart from sheets. Consistent with usual practice, the duck feather and down bedding was commercially pre-washed in hot water, chemically treated and hot air dried by the manufacturer before use, with documentation of the procedures used. (Myer House Brand, Hangzhou, China). On hot nights, the replacement use of thin cotton covers was advised if needed. Feather pillows were used all year. A mite-occlusive cover (Auspharm, Australia) was fitted to the child's mattress.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group received verbal advice from the research nurse at baseline explaining the then current bedding advice including house dust mite occlusive mattress covers may provide some benefit and synthetic pillows and quilts have been recommended for use in children with severe asthma. The advice was in accord with the National Asthma Campaign recommendations. In addition they were provided with a written set of instructions covering this advice. A mite-occlusive cover (Auspharm, Australia) was also fitted to the child's mattress. The control group were to use the mattress cover and the synthetic bedding for a period of 12 months.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A block randomisation approach with age blocks by year of birth was used to balance age distribution in each arm and achieve method concealment. The randomisation procedure employed a “biased coin” method to minimise the likelihood that the chance of being allocated to the intervention differs by season.  Research nurses conducting clinical assessments were blind to which group the children had been assigned.</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation sequence was generated by an independent statistician with subjects randomized against this sequence by research nurses at the study sites.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Patient blinding was achieved by providing an alternative intervention to the control group. Each participant, regardless of group allocation, was informed that they had been allocated to a bedding intervention with some preliminary medical literature support that it may benefit asthma. The analyses were first conducted by an independent statistician who had not been involved in the study design or progress in any way and was blind to which group was the intervention group and which the control group</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is not clear whether children with asthma should be advised to avoid feather pillow and quilts in case feather bedding makes asthma symptoms worse. Some exploratory studies have suggested feather bedding might actually be better for children with asthma. The trial was designed to assess whether a new feather pillow and quilt was associated with a reduction in asthma severity among house dust mite sensitised children with asthma over a one year period compared to the use of non-feather bedding</summary>
