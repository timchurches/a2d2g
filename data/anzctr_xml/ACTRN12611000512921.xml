  <interventions>
    <interventions>Non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 1 to 7% of all strokes and around 30% with SAH die within one month. SAH is characterised by bleeding in the subarachnoid space between the thin arachnoid and pia mater coverings of the brain.  Ruptured cerebral aneurysms account for 85% of non-traumatic SAH.  

Using linked administrative data-sets, it is now feasible to examine SAH care.  We aim to use routinely collected data to carry out a large-scale analysis of outcomes for SAH.  We aim to determine short and longer-term quality of care and the safety and efficacy of procedures undertaken to treat SAH in a contemporary acute care setting.  Our proposed project is a cost effective, timely alternative to existing labour-intensive efforts to observe SAH care and outcomes. Our methods minimise selection and referral biases, utilising state-wide data from the largest cohort of SAH patients ever studied in Australia (~5,000).  Our proposed project aims to analyse linked administrative data-bases to identify patients with SAH and characterise short and long-term outcomes, such as fact and cause of death and re-admission to hospital. 

Outcomes will be assessed from time of hospital admission to up to 10 years post-hospitalisation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Epidemiological description of outcomes for non-traumatic SAH will be undertaken.  Specifically, the following analyses will be conducted
-Age- and sex-standardised incidence;
-Mortality rates;
-Relative survival amongst 90-day survivors;
-Recurrent SAH
-Uptake of rehabilitation and "exposure" to hospital rehabilitation.

Variation in these outcomes according to patient, hospital  and disease characteristics, and year of hospital admission will be explored.

These outcomes will be determined by linkage of hospitalisation data to subsequent hospitalisations and mortality indices (cause and fact of death).</outcome>
      <timepoint>-Yearly incidence rates will be calculated for the years 2000-2007.
-Data to estimate mortality at 24-hours, 48-hours, 7-days, 30-days, 90-days, 180-days, 1-year, and up to ten years will be available (ie from 2000 to 2010).
-1-year to up to 10-years relative survival will be calculated.
-Risk of recurrent non-traumatic SAH at up to nine years after hospital admission for acute SAH (ie from 2000 to 2009).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A proxy measure of disability, "time spent in hospital", will be determined from hospital admissions data, adapting a validated measure in which time spent at home was correlated with standardised measures of disability in stroke patients (Quinn, Dawson, Lees et al 2008).  The number of days spent in hospital will be calculated and this measure will be applied to those patients who survive the follow-up period.

Variation in these outcomes according to patient, hospital  and disease characteristics, and year of hospital admission will be explored.

      <outcome>Management and patterns of care of non-traumatic SAH. Examples of outcomes investigated are as follows:
-Uptake of neurosurgical interventions (eg clipping, coiling, CSF shunting, intraventricular drainage);
-Arrival and transfer to a hospital offering a neurosurgical unit (ie Category A stroke unit hospital);
-ED triage prior to admission to hospital for SAH or prior to death from SAH;
-Time from hospital admission to administration of neurosurgical interventions;
-Hospital caseload;
-ICU and mechanical ventilation;
-modifiable patient complications of care;
-Uptake of diagnostic procedures

      <outcome>Methodological sub-studies are planned, including:
-Validation of administrative recording of SAH and other comorbidities, procedures and patient characteristics;
-Development of a "severity index" against gold standard specialist assessment using Glasgow Coma Score, Hunt and Hess Scale and World Federation of Neurological Sciences scales;
-effect of "look-back" period  for comorbidity, herald symptoms and other antecedents;
-Fact of death as a proxy for "SAH cause-specific death" at 30-days, 90-days and 12-months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These outcomes will utilise hospitalisation data from July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2009 and death data from July 1, 2000 to June 30 2010.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, yet 30% of people affected with SAH will die within 90 days and survivors are often disabled. Unlike ischaemic stroke, there is a relatively higher risk of SAH in younger age groups, yet risk factors are ill-defined. Therefore, determining health service variables impacting on outcomes will inform policy and practice. It is now feasible to examine SAH care and its outcomes on a large scale at a relatively modest cost. We will analyse linked routinely collected morbidity and mortality data to explore outcomes and patterns of care in SAH on a large scale. The study will describe discharge destinations and readmissions and be able to quantify the effect of hospital services according to different models of care, resources and settings (eg principal and non-principal referral, neurosurgical vs non-neurosurgical) and neurovascular interventions. Such a large-scale analysis of services and care patterns will be of international significance informing bed-side care and health service planning to improve individual, health service and societal outcomes. We hypothesise that the risk of 30-day, 90-day and 12 month all-cause mortality will be correlated with health service delivery for patients with SAH. Specifically, patients with SAH admitted to a hospital offering a neurosurgical unit will have a reduced risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality and spend less time in hospital in the year after a SAH. There will be significant variation in all-cause and disease-specific mortality and hospital re-admission according to: hospital type (eg principal referral versus other, rural versus urban location), caseload, and patient and disease characteristics. We will identify emergency presentations and hospital separations for SAH in New South Wales from July 2000 until June 2010. Data from these sources will be linked to the NSW Registry of Birth, Deaths and Marriages (fact of death) and ABS Causes of Death data.</summary>
