  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between dietary NaCl (sodium chloiride or salt) intake and hypertension and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Reduction in dietary NaCl intake lowers blood pressure significantly, with a subsequent reduction in cardiovascular events. Reducing dietary NaCl increases arterial compliance and reduces arterial stiffness in older people with systolic hypertension. Experimentally, NaCl affects arterial stiffness by altering vascular structure along with smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell function through a variety of mechanisms. There are only a limited number of studies which have examined the effects of dietary NaCl on arterial wall function in vivo in humans. These studies have focused predominantly on large artery compliance. This study proposes to examine the impact of low, normal and high dietary NaCl on arterial function in normal healthy volunteers. Arterial function can be measured non-invasively by pulse wave analysis, pulse wave velocity and markers of endothelial function. Using these different techniques collectively, we will be able to document the impact of dietary NaCl on arterial compliance in normotensive individuals. This will then allow for subsequent studies investigating the impact of dietary NaCl in at risk populations of hypertensive individuals and those with chronic kidney disease.</summary>
