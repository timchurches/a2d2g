    <scientifictitle>In the non-depressed caregiver population, does a single session of behavioural activation intervention, compared to no intervention, boost wellbeing and reduce symptoms of depression and stress. </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will comprise of a single 90 minute session of Behavioral Activation. The intervention is adapted from the Brief Behavioural Activation Treatment for Depression manual (Lejuez et al, 2011) whereby participants are assisted to identify their key values across five life areas
(relationships, education/career, recreation/interests, physical health, spirituality) and then identify activities, or goals, within each area that they would like to engage in. Goals for engagement are set in a structured and hierarchical manner, starting with those most easily achievable, to assist participants to meet them. The intervention will be delivered on an individual basis, by a postgraduate clinical psychology student. 

Following the intervention session there will be a two-week intervention period, in which participants will work toward goals and monitor progress using monitoring forms. At the end of the intervention period, participants will re-complete outcome measures of wellbeing, depression, stress. </interventions>
    <comparator>The intervention will be compared to a wait list control group. Individuals in the control group will receive the intervention once the intervention group has completed first follow up measures (completed 2 weeks following intervention). It is anticipated the control group will be on the 'wait list' for approximately 1 month before receiving intervention.  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis using G*power was calculated to determine the number of participants required for an 80% probability of capturing a moderate interaction (i.e., f =.25) between group (intervention, control) and time (pre-test, post-test). According to G*Power, approximately 48 participants will be required (24 in each group). This was determined at an adjusted Bonferroni level of .0125. 

Hypotheses will be tested with a series of Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). In order to optimise the likelihood of convergence, the GLMMs will be be tested separately for each of the outcome measures. To control for inflation of familywise errorrate, as a result of analysing each outcome independently of other, each GLMM will be evaluated at a Bonferroni adjusted alpha-level of .0125

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project will assess the utility of a single session behavioral activation intervention to improve wellbeing in a non depressed sample. To assess the possible preventative benefits of the treatment, the study will employ a sample of carers, who are hypothesised to be at increased risk of developing depressive symptomatology due to lifestlye factors such as high stress. It is predicted that a single session of behavioral activation will significantly improve wellbeing outcomes, as indicated on self report measures, compared to a waitlist control and that this pre/post improvement will be significantly maintained at follow up.</summary>
