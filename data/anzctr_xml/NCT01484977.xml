  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Lacosamide

Experimental: Lacosamide - Lacosamide will be added to levetiracetam while withdrawing the sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drug (AED)


Treatment: drugs: Lacosamide
50 mg and 100 mg lacosamide tablets will be combined and taken in two equal doses per day to provide the required total daily dosage of 100 - 600 mg/day. Subjects were titrated to a minimum of 200 mg/ day during the Treatment Period.
Maximum duration of study drug administration is approximately 23 weeks.

    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subject is male or female, at least 18 years of age

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial-onset seizures according to the
             International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981)

          -  Subject is taking levetiracetam (LEV) in combination with 1 sodium channel blocking
             antiepileptic drug (defined as carbamazepine, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin,
             or eslicarbazepine) as adjunctive treatment for epilepsy

          -  The minimum required seizure frequency during the 8-week Retrospective Seizure
             Baseline is on average = 2 partial-onset seizures per 28 days (based on investigator
             assessment of subject report) with at least 1 seizure per 4 week period within the

             without additional concurrent stable vagal nerve stimulation (VNS). The VNS must have
             been in place for at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) with

    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the study drug lacosamide
      (200-600 mg/day) when added to a stable dose of levetiracetam (1000-3000 mg/day) with
      withdrawal of the concomitant sodium channel blocking-antiepileptic drug (AEDs) in subjects
      not well controlled on their current regimen.</summary>
