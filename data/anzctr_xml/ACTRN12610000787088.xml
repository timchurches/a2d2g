  <interventions>
    <interventions>High risk group and prophylaxis group are assigned to receive 900mg (two 450mg tablets) of valganciclovir (Valcyte) once daily for 3 months commenced within 72 hrs after liver transplantation and monitored regularly for CMV infection/disease. Dose will be changed based on creatinine clearance.

 Pre- Emptive group Monitored regularly for CMV infection only. If this occurs patients will be given 5 mg/kg intravenously over one hour, of ganciclovir (GCV) twice daily for 2 weeks CMV infection is determined on testing with Qualitative Polymerease chain reaction (PCR)

Valganciclovir doses as per creatinine clearance:
Creatinine clearance  &gt;/=60 ml/min	900mg daily    
Creatinine clearance 40-59 ml/min 	450mg daily
Creatinine clearance 25-39 ml/min	450mg second daily
Creatinine clearance 10-24 ml/min	450 mg twice weekly</interventions>
    <comparator>High risk recipients- CMV positive donor to CMV negative recipient received valganciclovir and are monitored weekly for CMV in blood for 3 months, then monthly for the next 12 months.
All other combinations ( CMV positive donor and CMV positive recipient, CMV negative donor and CMV negative recipient, CMV negative donor and CMV positive recipient were randomised to either receive valganciclovir or monitoring. Which is the same as the high risk group- weekly CMV monitoring through blood (CMV PCR testing) weekly for the first 3 months then monthly for the next 12 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients who undergo liver transplant surgery have a significant incidence rate of infection by Cytomegalovirus, also known a CMV. This virus is responsible for decreased liver function and transplant failure. In this study, we will monitor CMV infection in liver transplant patients. Monitoring of patients will be performed by laboratory tests and will help determine the best way to prevent and treat CMV infection/disease. Researchers around the world have used various strategies to reduce the incidence of CMV infection/disease in liver transplant patients. These include laboratory tests for detecting CMV as a guide to administering intravenous ganciclovir (pre-emptive therapy) or preventative therapy by giving patients oral valganciclovir from time of transplantation (prophylaxis).</summary>
