Other interventions - Secukinumab
Other interventions - Placebo

Experimental: Secukinumab 150 mg s.c. with loading - Secukinumab 150 mg s.c. with loading: Secukinumab 150 mg at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by dosing every four weeks starting at Week 4. After primary outcome evaluation, Secukinumab dose may be escalated to 300 mg as judged appropriate by the investigator

Experimental: Secukinumab 150 mg s.c. without loading - Secukinumab 150 mg s.c. without loading: Secukinumab 150 mg at Baseline, followed by dosing every four weeks starting at Week 4, with Placebo at Weeks 1, 2 and 3. After primary outcome evaluation, Secukinumab dose may be escalated to 300 mg as judged appropriate by the investigator

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Placebo to Secukinumab at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by dosing every four weeks starting at Week 4 until Week 16/24, depending on patients responder status. From Week 16/24, patients will be switched to Secukinumab 150 mg every four weeks. After primary outcome evaluation, Secukinumab dose may be escalated to 300 mg as judged appropriate by the investigator

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) - The ACR20 response is a validated composite assessment. The patient is defined as an ACR20 responder if there is a = 20% improvement in 3 clinical clinical domains relevant to psoriatic arthritis. ACR20 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28-CRP) utilizing hsCRP - The DAS28 response is a validated composite assessment. The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity based on Swollen and Tender Joint Counts, ESR or CRP and the Patient Global Assessment. DAS28 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psoriatic Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) - The PASI75 is a measure of disease activity based on extent of the disease, severity of erythema, scaling and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis with an improvement in the PASI score of at least 75% compared to baseline.
PASI75 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Score (SF-36-PCS) - The SF-36-PCS is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across 8 domains (both physical and emotional). Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. SF-36-PCS is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50) - The ACR50 resonse is defined by at least 50% decrease in the swollen and tender joint count, and at least 50% improvement in 3 of the following 5 criteria: physical disability on the Health Assessment Questionnaire, pain score on a visual analog scale, patient global assessment, physician global assessment and acute phase reactant [either erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)].
ACR50 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) - The ACR20 response is a validated composite assessment. The patient is defined as an ACR20 responder if there is a = 20% improvement in 3 clinical clinical domains relevant to psoriatic arthritis. ACR20 is used to assess the efficacy of secukinumab, with or without loading, versus placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall safety and tolerability as measured by number of adverse events and serious adverse events - These assessments will be implemented in terms of physical examination and vital signs outcomes, clinical laboratory results, nature and frequency of the observed adverse events and serious adverse events, frequency and severity of any injection site reactions, ECG outcomes and the detection of immunogenicity. During the first 24 weeks of the study, comparisons between the secukinumab treatment arms and the placebo treatment arm will also take place.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to provide 16-week efficacy, safety and tolerability data versus
      placebo to support the use of secukinumab 150 mg by subcutaneous (s.c.) self-administration
      with or without a loading regimen and maintenance dosing using pre-filled syringe (PFS) and
      to assess efficacy, safety and tolerability up to 2 years in subjects with active AS despite
      current or previous NSAID, non-biologic DMARD or biologic anti-TNFa therapy</summary>
