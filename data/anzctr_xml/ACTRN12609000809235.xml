  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group: Half of women recruited into the study will be randomly assigned to a telephone-delivered exercise rehabilitation program and will receive an exercise workbook, an exercise tracker to log their physical activity and telephone support calls over 8 months from a study-trained Exercise Physiologist. Exercise Physiologists will contact participants regularly over 8 months to assist them to progress through their workbook to develop a safe and appropriate exercise regimen (16 calls over 8 months). 

The final goal is to have women exercising at least 4 times per week, at moderate intensities, with exercise sessions lasting 45+ minutes.  To achieve this goal, the exercise programs will be gradually progressed across the weeks by introducing different types of exercise and slowly increasing their intensity and duration.  Progression in exercise will depend on the participant and how she is dealing with the exercises and her breast cancer treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group: The other half of women recruited into the study will be randomly assigned to the usual care control group and will participate in all study assessments and receive usual care from their treating clinicians, which generally includes information booklets on recovery following breast cancer treatment. Duration of the intervention is 8 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The long-term presence of physical and psychosocial symptoms following breast cancer treatment is well established. However, Queensland is a geographically dispersed state, where many women with breast cancer live in rural and remote areas with limited support resources. Queensland-based research highlights that these women are more likely to have more extensive surgeries, and experience poorer quality of life and higher unmet needs. 

Exercise is one strategy with a large evidence base supporting its effectiveness in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life (QoL) among women following breast cancer. However, the majority of studies have been conducted overseas, and with women in urban areas.  

This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of a telephone-delivered exercise-based rehabilitation support program for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer living in regional, rural and remote areas of Queensland, Australia. Feasibility and effect size data from the pilot study will be used to refine the intervention and to inform a subsequent application for a fully powered randomized controlled trial.

This study forms an arm of a larger study that is currently being undertaken (ACTRN12606000233527) with an urban sample of women who have received breast cancer treatment via Brisbane-based hospitals (Royal Brisbane &amp; Womens Hospital, Mater Hospital and Wesley Hospital).</summary>
