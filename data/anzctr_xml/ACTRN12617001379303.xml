  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.. ActiCal activity monitoring devices (Philips Respironics) 2 are worn by participants on the wrist and hip for 4 consecutive days up to 8 weeks prior to surgery. On the day of surgery, immediately after the surgery, the patients will be fitted with the same monitors again, which they are asked to wear for 10 to 14 days (including nights).

2. Nonin WristOx oxygen saturation device. (Nonin WristOx2, NOX medical)will be worn for 4 consecutive nights up to 8 weeks prior to surgery. On the day of surgery, immediately after the surgery, the patients will be fitted with the same monitors again, which they are asked to wear for 10 to 14 nights. 

All participants will wear both devices during the same time period.</interventions>

      <outcome>To explore nocturnal oximetry (number and extent of desaturations) using the Nonin WristOx oxygen saturation device pre and post tonsillectomy</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 nights of nocturnal oximetry in the  8 weeks prior to surgery compared to 10 to 14 nights

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore how sleep quality measured using the ActiCal activity monitoring devices and WristOx device change within the first 2 weeks following tonsillectomy.

Variables regarding sleeping patterns, sedentary behaviour and physical activity will be derived from the accelerometer count data using a customised LabView V7® (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) program. Indicators of sleep quality and quantity from the ActiCal will be derived using adaptations of validated methods. Daily minutes in each intensity level using validated age cut points for hip (sedentary &lt;45, light &gt;44, moderate &gt;2028, vigorous &gt;2872 counts per minute) and wrist worn devices  (sedentary &lt;209, light &gt;208, moderate &gt;1552, vigorous &gt;4844 counts per minute) will be determined.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>This study is an exploratory pilot study in a completely novel field using an entirely non-invasive approach of testing. There is currently no data in the literature with regards to oximetry and activity monitors and their correlation to the severity of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE) in the paediatric population. Therefore, based on our previous work assessing the incidence of PRAE in children undergoing tonsillectomies, we estimate that a sample size of 60 children with complete data sets will allow us to assess our primary aim. Children with incomplete data sets will be replaced.
All data will be reported according to the STARD 2015 guidelines. 
Thus, we believe n=60 will provide us with sufficient information on the comparison of these two variables for an appropriate and more refined sample size calculation for future research on this topic. 
The Actical data will be analysed using proprietary software for a standard set of activity and sleep-based measurements. Sleep-based measurements will include sleep onset latency, sleep duration, time spent awake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. These are a standard set of actigraphy-based measurements that are reported in all studies of sleep using actigraphy. Data for each variable will be averaged when obtained over multiple nights. Activity-based measurements will be obtained from the count values summed over a user-specified interval of (15 seconds for this study), resulting in a count value per 15 second epoch. Variables regarding sedentary behaviour and physical activity (in the day time) will be derived from the accelerometer count data using a customised LabView V7 (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) program. Daily minutes in each intensity level using validated cutpoints for hip (sedentary &lt;45, light &gt;44, moderate &gt;2028, vigorous &gt;2872 counts per minute) and wrist worn devices (sedentary &lt;209, light &gt;208, moderate &gt;1552, vigorous &gt;4844 counts per minute) will be determined. 
The averaged data for each variable will be compared pre- and post-adenotonsillectomy. The significance of the difference between the pre and post measurements will be assessed using the paired T-test with the significance level set at &lt;0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in kids, with approximately ½ million/annum in US, mainly performed as day cases.  In Australia, in 2012/13, there were 38575 admissions due to tonsillectomies, representing 724 admissions per 100000 people aged 17 years and under. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB), rather than infection has become the primary reason for tonsillectomy. SDB is defined as an abnormal respiratory pattern during sleep. It presents as a spectrum from simple snoring to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The incidence of peri-operative respiratory complications is 10 times higher for children with OSA compared to those without OSA. Perioperative respiratory adverse events necessitating a medical intervention occur in about 10% of children undergoing adenotonsillectomy, 60% of these occur in the immediate post-operative period.  However, desaturations can continue for an unpredictable further period of time in a substantial number of children following tonsillectomy.
Currently the gold standard test for assessing presence and severity of OSA/SDB is polysomnography. It is however, a high cost, labour intensive test and is associated with long waiting lists and therefore rarely used in these children. There has been some research on using preoperative oximetry to stratify a patients need for more or less observation (e.g. ambulatory surgery, ward special, ICU).
This study will enrol patients scheduled for tonsillectomy and assess their baseline sleep quality via a questionnaire, overnight pulse oximetry and awake-sleep pattern using novel portable activity monitoring devices (ActiCal).  These will be performed in the patients home prior to surgery. Then any breathing problems within 24 hours of surgery will be recorded.  We will then examine if these problems can be predicted from our preoperative measures. If successful this would allow better stratification of risk of patients for tonsillectomy allowing them to get the most appropriate level of post-operative observation required for each individual child.
We will then follow the patients with the same monitors for up to 14 nights after surgery to determine the extent/course of improvement provided by surgery to blood oxygen levels and the impact on sleeping pattern. This will also allow better characterisation of the course of a patients night time oxygen levels in the days after surgery, and allow examination of the impact of strong pain killers given around surgery on this parameter. This would help clinicians make more informed decisions in relation to length of stay after surgery. Currently there is very little data to inform these decisions or care pathways. Additionally the activity monitors will help us track the childs return to normal physical activity which has not previously been assessed objectively. This would allow more evidenced based information to be conveyed to parents about typical recovery after tonsillectomy surgery.</summary>
