      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a modified form of the BFM-2000 protocol can be administered to patients with newly diagnosed and untreated ALL aged between 15 and 40 years in a comparable timeframe to patients under 15 years of age.

All patients will commence treatment with Protocol 1, which is an intensive chemotherapy induction protocol. Various prognostic factors such as cytogenetic abnormalities, initial response to prednisolone, achievement of remission, and MRD levels after induction and consolidation, will determine whether patients continue treatment outlined in Protocol M, or are to be treated on the High Risk protocol, or undergo allogeneic HCT. Patients removed for allogeneic HCT will be withdrawn from the study, but will continue to be followed, with relapse, disease-free and overall survival data being recorded.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All of the following criteria must be satisfied for registration on the study.
1. A morphological diagnosis of ALL byWHO criteria, confirmed by immunophenotyping and cytogenetics. All clinico-pathological subtypes will be eligible, except for mature B or Burkitt ALL (L3).
2. Has provided written, informed consent
3. Available for follow up for at least 3 years
4. Males capable of parenting a child and women of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable and adequate method of contraception while undergoing protocol treatment and for 28 days following the last dose of protocol treatment. Note: due to a potentially increased risk of thrombosis in asparaginase containing regimens, cessation of the combined oral contraceptive in female patients should be considered and an alternative medically appropriate form of contraception be instituted.
5. Bone marrow blast count &gt;/= 20%
6. Adequate renal and hepatic function at Screening as defined by:
a. Total bilirubin &lt;2.5 x ULN unless medically correctable
b. Serum creatinine less than or equal to 200 micromol/L unless medically correctable
7. Normal left ventricular ejection fraction, according to institutional criteria. If the clinical circumstances require that treatment must be given urgently before this can be ascertained, the absence of clinical cardiac impairment is acceptable, provided that a normal left ventricular ejection fraction is confirmed prior to the first consolidation cycle.
8. An ECOG performance status score of 0-3 at Screening </inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Presence of any of the following criteria will exclude the subject from registration on the study.
1. Subjects aged less than 15 or more than 40 years at Screening
2. Patients known to have Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease
3. Presence of serious cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal disease.

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The patients will be screened and enrolled by their treating physician. 

Before the patient can commence day 1 treatment of prednisolone and IT MTX, the investigator should ensure that all of the following requirements are met:
- The patient has signed and dated the screening PICF
- All Screening assessments and investigations have been performed.
          - the only exception being that extenuating circumstances prevent the gated heart pool scan or echo pre-treatment to assess cardiac function– in this instance the test must be completed and results known prior to registration to confirm eligibility
- Blood and marrow samples are mandatory for study entry and must be collected before any treatment is commenced.
- All of the required samples have been sent or are in the process of being shipped to the central laboratories for MRD testing and laboratory studies.
If the investigator feels that the patient must commence treatment immediately, (prior to receiving the final screening test results), treatment with prednisolone &amp; IT MTX can commence prior to registration if:
-the treatment specified in this protocol for day 1 to day 7 is standard of care at the treating hospital.
-the patients’ eligibility is confirmed and the patient is registered prior to day 8 of treatment.
The day the prednisolone is commenced is regarded as day 1 of the protocol. Registrations will not be accepted once day 8 systemic chemotherapy has commenced

All patients will commence treatment with Protocol 1 which is an intensive chemotherapy induction protocol. Various prognostic factors such as cytogenetic abnormalities, initial response to prednisolone, achievement of remission, and MRD levels after induction and consolidation, will determine whether patients continue treatment outlined in Protocol M, or are to be treated on the High Risk protocol, or undergo allogeneic HCT. Patients removed for allogeneic HCT will be withdrawn from the study treatment, but will continue to be followed, with relapse, disease-free and overall survival data being recorded

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be a national clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a chemotherapy treatment, administered to adolescents and young adults with a newly diagnosed bone marrow cancer, called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).

Who is it for?

You may be able to join this study if you are aged between 15 to 40 years and have been recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), for which you have not yet undergone any treatment. 

Trial details:

ALL is the most common form of childhood cancer, but in over 80% of children it can be cured with chemotherapy. Adults with ALL do much worse and this trial will examine whether exactly the same treatment given to children can also be given to adults, and if so, are the results as good. In order to determine this, all patients in this trial will be administered the same chemotherapy treatment given to children. Patients' response to this chemotherapy will determine subsequent treatment. 

Participants in this trial will be regularly assessed throughout this trial to determine remission rates, survival, toxicity and quality of life.</summary>
