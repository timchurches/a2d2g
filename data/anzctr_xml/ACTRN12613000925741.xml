    <statisticalmethods>Sample size 
It is constructed to have a population mean score of 50 and a population standard deviation of 10.  The test-re-test reliability is documented as approximately 0.8, which implies an error standard deviation in the analysis of covariance of approximately 4.5 (assuming that 80% of the test variance is explained by correlation with the pre-test result).

Given a Holms corrected test procedure, the minimal detectable effect size for a varying sample size is shown in Table 1.


Sample Size (per Group)	Minimum Detectable Effect Size
15	5.61
20	4.79
25	4.25
30	3.86
 
In a study of pre-treatment sexual health in prostate cancer   Zinreich et al identified that a score of 48 (i.e. a difference of 2 from the population mean) is functionally normal. The study has therefore been powered to detect a between group difference of 4.  


Outcomes
The primary endpoint (questionnaire responses at baseline 4 and 8 weeks) will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance, with baseline (pre-treatment) questionnaire scores as a covariate. Treatment arm will be represented by a factor n the analysis of covariance. Least squares means will be tabulated. Strict control of the family wise type one error rate for multiple time points will be maintained using Holms adjustment.

Testosterone and other hormone levels at study termination will be analysed using an analysis of covariance, with baseline and week 8 values as a covariate and study arm as a factor.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to assess the herbal formulation in  reducing the symptoms of andropause and influencing serum testosterone levels.

The inadequate production of testosterone in men as they age has been associated with Andropause, a variable complex of symptoms, including decreased androgen production, occurring in men after middle age. Andropause has an obvious effect on male sexual health, but may also affect general health in men as they age.

The key features of Andropause include:
Lethargy and fatigue
Diminished sexual desire/libido
Increased abdominal fat (waist circumference greater than 102cm)
Depressed mood or irritability
Decreased cognitive function
Hot flushes or sweating
Decreased lean body mass and muscle volume/strength
Decreased body hair and skin alterations
Low bone mineral density or increased incidence of fractures
Sleep disturbance
