French patients - 

Australians patients - 


Other interventions: Blinded inter-country reading of pelvic MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
This experiment will consist of an inter-country reading of patients' pelvic MRIs, "blind" to the other country's decision. The MRI shared will be the one based on which the treatment decision will be made. In case of medical contraindication to perform pelvic MRI, the scan will be used to assess the care-decision concordance between both countries.

Other interventions: MDT (Multidisciplinary team) meeting observation
3 per centre with "real" patient cases and "theoretical" patient cases (blinded pelvic MRI re-reading).

Other interventions: Semi-structured exploratory interviews and focus group with MDT health professional attendees
Will identify care management systems for PRC-bTME and LRRC patients, explore social representations that direct the formulation of a therapeutic decisions and identify cultural, medical and personal factors

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical resection rates in both countries - Expressed as a percentage and corresponding to the ratio between the number of patients operated and the number of patients discussed in colorectal MDT meetings for PRC-bTME and LRRC. These rates will be expressed separately in each country and compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Concordance rate of operative decisions between France and Australia - An analysis of concordance between French and Australian operative decisions will be carried out through the radiological (or theoretical) resectability rate, expressed as a percentage and corresponding, after blind inter-country reading of pelvic MRIs, to the ratio between the number of patients judged to have resectable tumours and the number of all MRI re-reading.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months, 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The incidence of rectal cancers is at 15,000 new cases per year in France of which 10 to 15%
      are locally advanced (T4bNxM0) at the moment of diagnosis. The rate of invaded resection
      margins (R1) for these locally advanced and fixed rectal tumours varies from 10 to 20%. The
      invasion of the resection margins triples the risk of local recurrence. In the absence of
      surgical treatment, the 5-year survival rate for patients having had pelvic recurrence of
      rectal cancer is lower than 4% whereas it varies from 35 to 40% in cases of curative
      resection. The care and management of locally advanced and fixed rectal tumours and pelvic
      recurrence of rectal cancer constitutes, therefore, in the absence of recommendation, a
      difficult therapeutic problem with great variability in the methods of care and management
      around the world. These variations in practice can be explained by structural and
      organizational differences, as well as cultural dissimilarities. With regards to the
      organization of its healthcare system, Australia is shown to be a leader as regards the care
      and management of locally advanced and fixed rectal tumours and pelvic recurrence of rectal
      cancer.</summary>
