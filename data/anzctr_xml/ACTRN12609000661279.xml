  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of Part 1 of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 100 mg SCH 527123 when dosed for 14 days in healthy adult subjects.  The information from this part will provide evidence for/against using 100 mg SCH 527123 in future trials that may involve patients (ie, COPD subjects)

The primary purpose of Part 2 of this study is to determine the dose-response relationship between doses of SCH 527123 and compared with inactive treatment (placebo, sugar pill) and active treatment (prednisone).   The information from this trial will be used to compare the oral mucosal neutrophil response between SCH 527123 with active (prednisone) and inactive (placebo) treatment.</summary>
