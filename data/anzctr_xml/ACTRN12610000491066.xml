  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study 105 (VX08-770-105) is an open-label, VX-770 treatment extension of Study VX08-770-102 (Study 102) and Study VX08-770-103 (Study 103). This rollover study evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of treatment with the experimental drug, VX-770, for a duration of up to 96 weeks. Male and female subjects 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis who have completed Study 102 or 103 without major protocol violations are eligible to enrol. This project is an international, multi-centre trial, with subjects from 70 sites worldwide including Australia, Europe and North America.
