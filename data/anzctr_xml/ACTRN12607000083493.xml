    <studytitle>A Cluster Randomised controlled trial of an Automated versus manual device for Blood pressure management.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A cluster randomised controlled trial of the effect of general practitioner blood pressure measurement of all patients aged 18 years or over who present during the study week, using automated or manual blood pressure device on digit preference, number of measurements (overall and per individual),  prescribing of antihypertensive medications, dose adjustments, and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>GP participants in practices randomised to receive automated blood pressure measuring device, the OMRON HEM-907 in all clinical rooms.
The duration of the intervention will be one week after an initial 1 week run-in phase.
Blood pressure recordings of all patients aged 18 years or more and hypertension management (where relevant) is determined by research nurses auditing clinical records once after the trial week.
Both the number and level of blood pressure is determined by searching electronic and paper clinical records of the patient for the study week and recording each on an audit sheet.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypertension is the commonest problem managed in general practice. In this setting as in others control remains less than ideal. As there is a linear relationship between blood pressure level and risk of death any change in standard management that leads to improved blood pressure control is likely to be beneficial.
CRAB will compare the measurement and management of sequential adults attending a general practice over a week.  It will use the endpoints of digital preference, the number of individuals who have a blood pressure measurement, the number of measurements an individual has, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and drug management where hypertension is treated. It is a trial of clinical effectiveness in general practice where the majority of hypertension is managed.
This study will provide evidence for the potential changes in blood pressure recording and hypertension management of the introduction of new devices not containing mercury which are inevitable due to occupational health and safety concerns of this toxic material.  The OMRON HEM-907 device is a validated blood pressure measurement device.  We hypothesize that the use of automated measurement devices will increase the number of people who have a blood pressure measurement, the number of recordings per individual and will improve the management of individuals with hypertension.</summary>
