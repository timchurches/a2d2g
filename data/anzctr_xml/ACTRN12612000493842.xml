  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study which will identify if surgery and anaesthesia increase the risk of adverse central nervous system outcomes, including acceleration of the Alzheimer's disease process and subsequent earlier expression. Cognition and function will be measured for 18 months postoperatively to identify any change including signs and symptoms of dementia.</interventions>
    <comparator>The effect of anaesthesia and surgery will be assessed by comparing the change in cognition in surgical patients with the change in cognition observed in patients in the AIBL study (without surgical intervention) who have been matched for age, gender, baseline cognition and CSF profile.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the extent to which a pre-operative CSF signature of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid beta 1-42; total-tau and phospho-tau) predicts postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and increase in clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale in elderly patients who receive general anaesthesia for orthopaedic surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3, 12 and 18 months postoperatively</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify an association between POCD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Baseline cognitive and functional data collected at baseline assessment will be compared with 3, 12 and 18 month follow-ups cognitive and functional assessment to measure cognitive outcomes and risk of dementia.   </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3, 12 and 18 months postoperatively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify risk factors for POCD and progressive cognitive decline (MCI and dementia) after anaesthesia and surgery.
Medical history details of risk factors will be collected from the patient at baseline and verified by the patient's medical record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 3 months postoperatively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overarching hypothesis for this study is that in older adults who undergo surgery, occult or preclinical Alzheimers Disease (AD) increases the risk of adverse central nervous system (CNS) outcomes, including acceleration of the AD disease process itself and subsequent earlier clinical expression. The specific hypotheses are: 
1.	In older people undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery, the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signature of Alzheimers Disease (AD) at baseline will be associated with a greater incidence and or severity of decline in Clinical Dementia Rating scale at 18 months post-operatively, compared with a non-surgical group with a CSF signature of AD and equivalent baseline cognition.
2.	At baseline, a CSF signature of AD in surgical patients will be associated with a higher incidence of PostOperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) and functional change at 3, 12, and 18 months post-operatively compared to surgical patients without the CSF AD signature.
3.	Individuals classified with POCD will be at higher risk of conversion from cognitively normal to MCI or to dementia, or from MCI to dementia, compared with those who are not classified with POCD.
