  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cardiovascular disease in patients suffering chronic kidney disease over a 10 year period will be assessed.  Data for all patients who were originally enrolled in the Landmark 1 trial in 2000 and for whom a three year follow up was completed in 2003 will be collected for up to 10 years.  Mortality and transplant data for all original participants will be obtained for the 10 year follow up from the ANZDATA Registry database.  This is the database in which nephrology data from Australia and New Zealand is kept.  Other data will be obtained from the Nephrology Database at the Princess Alexandra Hospital.  No contact will be made with any of the subjects as most are now deceased or have had renal transplant.
Proven novel imaging techniques, such as 2D speckle (2DS) tracking, an automated, quantitative technique which allows measurement of myocardial function in all 3 planes of cardiac motion have shown promise in shorter term studies involving this patient group and will for the first time be utilised in this long term follow-up to track the cardiovascular impact of CKD. This will be done by re-measuring the original echocardiograms taken of study subjects. These echocardiograms are stored in the Cardiovascular Imaging Research Centre of the University of Queensland, School of Medicine trial database.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The commonest cause of death in individuals with impaired renal function is cardiovascular disease (CVD) and in 2008 contributed to 2.3% of all deaths in Australia. According to current Australian Government predictions the incidence rate of treated end stage renal disease is projected to increase by nearly 80%from 11 per 100,000 population in 2009 to 19 per 100,000 population in 2020. This is important as data from the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry report indicates that 40% of all deaths in patients receiving dialysis were due to CVD. This is replicated in findings from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) where CVD mortality was 42.2%. Given this, it is now well recognised that the presence of CKD is a potent risk factor for CVD. Indeed individuals with CKD have a 10-fold to 20-fold greater risk of CVD than age- and sex-matched, healthy controls. Once on dialysis CKD patients are less likely to receive cardiovascular interventions and far more likely to die than in those without CKD. 
CVD risk in this population is partially attributable to an increased presence and severity of conventional CVD risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and smoking. Additionally however there are other risk factors specific to CKD such as anaemia, abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism and chronic inflammation. 
Previous work carried out by our Group in this area was funded by an NHMRC Centre of Clinical Research Excellence Award (455832). The findings of this work have provided insights into the alterations in cardiovascular structure and function undergone in CKD and the pathophysiological factors underlying CVD risk. Despite the aggressive nurse-led risk factor intervention undertaken in the original study(LANDMARK1) there was little effect on cardiovascular structure, ventricular function or outcome after 2 years of follow-up. We have ascertained, through The Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry, (ANZdata), that at least two thirds of the patients in this previous trial are now deceased and of those still living, a majority have proceeded to kidney transplant.  We would access the ANZdata database for dates and cause of death of the deceased patients and renal transplant status.  We would access the Nephrology database at the  Princess Alexandra Hospital to ascertain MACE.  We will analyse the baseline data for these patients to ascertain the main cardiovascular factors that predicted outcome.
