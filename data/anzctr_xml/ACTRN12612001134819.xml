  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: The study eye will receive a drop of sterile 50% glucose (10 Microlitres) every 5 minutes for one hour. Pain and discomfort will be assessed through out the period of treatment. It will be assessed on a pain scale of 1 to 10. 1 being nil pain and 10 being the worst pain. This will be documented in the patient's case notes.


Sham control: on another visit separated by at least one week, the same patients will receive a saline drop in the same manner, and undergo the same tests. (The optic disc photo is important to record the subtype of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in case there is a clear pattern, but does not need repeating.)</interventions>
    <comparator>Group A is the intial study group of 16 non-diabetic subjects with moderate to severe glaucoma.
Group B is the second study group of 6 non-diabetic subjects without any history of glaucoma.
Both Group A and B will have a visit with the instillation of Glucose drops and another visit with saline drops as the placebo.</comparator>

      <outcome>Contrast Sensitivity</outcome>
      <timepoint>10 minutes after the last drop (either glucose or saline) instillation, the baseline measurements will be repeated in the same order. Any change in refraction will be corrected. The primary outcome will be the change in the Contrast Sensitivity measurement at 12 cycles per degree compared to baseline. This single outcome was chosen based on previous data showing an improvement in this parameter after IOP reduction, and to avoid reductions in the alpha value due to multiple hypothesis testing.

The contrast sensitivity in this study is measured using the Vector Vision CSV -1000 E illuminated chart.</timepoint>

    <sequence>after informed consent at the screening visit, the most severely affected eye will be randomized to receive either treatment (T) followed by sham (S) or vice versa; i.e. either TS or ST. Patients will be masked to the treatment and the investigator measuring CS will also be masked to treatment.</sequence>

    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The main experiment is a repeated measures crossover study. This study can exploit the benefits of a crossover design without suffering disadvantages. The main potential disadvantage of a crossover design is persistence of the treatment effect, but due to the short-acting nature of the intervention, there will be no carry over effect. The crossover design effectively halves the numbers required and eliminates any confounding covariates. Using an ANCOVA analysis of the difference in CS between treatment and sham with an estimated correlation of 0.7 between the baseline and post-treatment and a mean difference of .3 with a standard deviation of .35 (based on previous data).</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to improve visual outcomes for patients who suffer with glaucoma.  This outcome is known as contrast sensitivity.  

Glaucoma: is a disease in which the optic nerve is damaged, leading to progressive, irreversible loss of vision. It is often, but not always, associated with increased pressure of the fluid in the eye.

The purpose of this study is to establish a proof of a principle known as neuroprotection.  

Neuroprotection: refers to the ability to directly promote survival of the optic nerve.
The optic nerve is the nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.

Contrast sensitivity:  is the ability to differentiate between light and dark (contrast).</summary>
