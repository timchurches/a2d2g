  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be required to attend the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Clinical Research Facility for an appointment that will involve questionnaires, skin examination and mapping of skin naevi using 3D total body photography in their underwear. The participant will need to provide a saliva sample in order to sequence their genomic DNA. The initial appointment is expected to take between 1 to 2 hours, depending on how many naevi the participant has. We will also ask participants to conduct a skin self-examination every 3 months for the duration of the study (3 years). Half of the participants will be randomised to receive a dermatoscope attachment for their mobile phone to use in the self examinations. Skin self-examinations will take approximately 10 to 20 minutes. A dermatoscope is used to take a magnified images of skin lesions and is routinely used by dermatologists for assessment and possible diagnosis. Participants randomised to receive the dermatoscope attachement will be asked to take images of any naevi that are concerning them. We anticipate this may add up to an extra 5 minutes to your skin self-examination. Participants will be provided with instructions and a body chart to record their skin self-examination results on and are asked to mail/bring it to follow up appointments. 
We will also require participants to attend follow up visits every 6 months for the duration of the study. These visits will involve a repeat of 3D total body photography to monitor skin naevi changes. We will also ask participants to consider donating benign naevi for excision and any residual tissue from suspicious lesions recommended for excision. Tissue donated will be used for additional molecular analysis of gene products and proteins known to be involved in melanoma development and progression. This aspect of the study is optional, and will not affect their eligibility for the trial. Follow up appointments will take also take 1 to 2 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>As part of the study, half of the participants will be randomised to receive a dermatoscope to use in their self skin examinations. Therefore the comparator group will be those who do not receive the dermatoscope. 
the skin self-examinations are performed using the same method in both groups, however the participants with the dermatoscope will also be asked to take photo's of any naevi that they are concerned about, as well as record written details on a body chart form provided to them. The comparator group will only need to record written details and provide no images.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>For the cross sectional data, descriptive statistical analyses including counts and proportions will be used to describe the number of naevi (&gt; 2mm, &gt; 5mm) and the average number of dysplastic naevi by participant sex, age and body site. Participants will be grouped by phenotype, or pigmentation/naevus genotype, and the number and type of naevi by body site in each of these subgroups will be summarised. Descriptive statistics will also be used to summarise dermoscopic features of naevi by body site. Depending on the distribution of the outcomes, parametric or non-parametric approaches to bivariate analyses will be considered. 

To assess the unadjusted and adjusted strength of association between participants phenotypic or genotypic characteristics and naevi outcomes, linear or logistic regression models will be fitted, depending on whether the outcome is used in continuous or categorical format. These models will be conducted in crude and adjusted form to ascertain the independent contribution of explanatory factors (for example skin type) on the outcomes.  Interaction terms will also be fitted where appropriate (for example phenotype and genotype) to explain naevus counts or distributions.  

At each timepoint the cross sectional analyses will be repeated, and in addition changes in numbers of naevi over time will be calculated. Repeated measures models will be built to assess changes in naevus number, type or severity over time.

For the randomised controlled skin self-examination trial, success of randomisation will be assessed by providing a table of characteristics by participant randomised to the two groups.  We will assign a correct positive finding to a spot or mole identified and noted on the body chart by the participant as needing management by a doctor, which also requires close monitoring or excision according to the examining dermatologists opinion. Similar to our previous study (Manahan et al, 2015), in the per-person analyses, a correct positive will be assigned if the participant finds at least one such lesion. This assumes that if the participant found one such spot or mole, they would consult a doctor who would then do a whole-body CSE and find any other lesions requiring treatment. In the per-lesion analyses each spot or mole will be counted individually. Any such spots or moles that in the dermatologists opinion require close monitoring or excision and were missed by the participant are counted as false negative. We will compare the sensitivity and specificity of SSE versus dermoscopy-assisted SSE to find spots or moles that require management by a doctor in per-person and per-lesion analyses. Analyses will take into account the clustering of lesions within patients by using variance inflation factors and regression type models such as Generalised Estimating Equations (GGEs) or Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). 

To address the research question of how well do clinical molecular and genetic changes of in-vivo and ex-vivo microbiopsies as assayed by Next Generation exome sequencing reflect the histopathological outcomes, we will use measures of sensitivity and specificity, as well as area under the curve calculations to compare the classification quality of microbiopsy against gold standard clinical or histopathological workup.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is about identifying what genetic differences and dermatological characteristics (such as form and structure of moles and eye/hair colour), are associated with skin cancers and who is at greatest risk. The study is also looking at how people conduct their own skin self-examinations.

Who is it for? We will be contact people via letter off the Brisbane Electoral Roll. The letter will include a Information sheet and contact details in which the letter recipient can use to make an initial appointment to participate in the study.
