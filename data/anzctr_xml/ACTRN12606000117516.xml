    <interventions>The study will correlate the toxicity-adjusted dose of imatinib after 3 months of therapy with polymorphisms of drug elimination genes, particularly ABCB1 (MDR1). Patients will be asked to give a single blood sample for genotyping (at any time) and we will collect clinical data on dose and toxicity retrospectively from medical records.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the genotypes of ABCB1 (a type of gene found in your cells) in a larger group of patients to test whether the correlation (matching of genes with more side effects from drug treatment) seen in the previous small study are true.  The primary (main) endpoint will be a correlation of ABCB1 genotype and imatinib dose after three months of therapy that will allow for dose adjustments based on toxicity (side effects). The larger patient numbers will also allow a haplotype (gene) analysis to be done.

The importance of dose individualisation is illustrated by studies that show better outcomes for cancer patients who have post-treatment dose adjustments based on therapeutic drug monitoring or on toxicity. However, with these methods, the optimum dose for each patient is often not reached until after the majority of the treatment course has been given. A correlation between ABCB1 genotype and toxicity-adjusted dose has practical significance since a simple blood test could allow effective dose selection in individuals.

Approximately 300 patients will be required.</summary>
