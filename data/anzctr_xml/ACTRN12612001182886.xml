  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is theta-burst stimulation. This is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered in a patterned style that can increase or decrease excitability of brain tissue. Theta-burst stimulation will be delivered at a low intensity (80% of active motor threshold of target muscles). 600 pulses are delivered in an intermittent pattern, taking about 3 minutes. The stimulation will be delivered to each cerebellar hemisphere, with a 2 minute break between sides. The intervention will take place every working day for 10 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham theta burst stimulation will be used as a control intervention, using a sham coil that emits the same noise as the real coil, but does not emit a magnetic pulse. Otherwise the sham intervention will be delivered exactly as for theta-burst stimulation</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toronto Western Spasmodic Tortocollis Scale. This is a validated scale to assess symptoms of cervical dystonia and the impact on a persons life</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of intervention period
4 weeks after end of intervention period
12 weeks after end of intervention period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cervical Dystonia Quality of Life Questionaire (CDQ-24). This is a qualtify of life questioniare validated for use in people with cervical dystonia, to assess the impact of the disorder on a persons life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of intervention period
4 weeks after end of intervention period
12 weeks after end of intervention period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>TMS measurements.
TMS will be used to assess excitability of corticomotor neurons and output pathways to the cervical muscles. The measures will be motor-evoked potentials (MEPS), cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI) and short afferent inhibition (SAI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mid intervention
End of intervention period
4 weeks after end of intervention period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Grooved pegboard task.
This task will assess manual dexterity. It involves placing pegs into holes that have grooves in different directions meaning pegs must be manipulated into the correct position.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mid intervention
End of intervention period
4 weeks after end of intervention period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cervical Range of Motion.
This will be assessed using a goniometric device placed on the head (CROM3).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mid intervention
End of intervention period
4 weeks after end of intervention period</timepoint>

    <concealment>Subjects will be allocated to a group by an independent investigator using a minimisation process to ensure comparable groups. Allocation will be concealed from investigators performing outcome measurements as interventions are delivered separately to outcome measures.
