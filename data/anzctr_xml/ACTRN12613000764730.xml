  <interventions>
    <interventions>(1) Treadmill walking - 30 minute sessions, 3 times a week for up to 8 weeks at 60% heart rate reserve. Maximum possible total dose of treadmill training is 12 hours. Participants will be individually monitored throughout the treadmill sessions by a physiotherapist. 

(2) Chronic Disease Self Management (CDSM) - During the same period that participants are receiveing treadmill training, they will also receive a CDSM program. This will involve 5-10 minute sessions, 3 times a week for up to 8 weeks. The sessions will be delivered individually to the participants by the treating physiotherapist prior to or during the treadmill sessions. Participants will be taught behaviour change techniques such as goal setting and action planning to encourage initiation and maintenance of physical activity.

(3) Usual care - Participants will also receive usual physiotherapy and rehabilitation during this time although treadmill training will replace over-ground gait retraining.

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 60 will be recruited to this study. This sample will be primarily one of convenience and aim to recruit people with a range of ages, stroke severity and functional ability post stroke across both genders. This sample size would enable us to detect an effect size of 0.5; which reflects a difference in physical activity of 1200 steps per day with 80% power at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05. This number is also sufficiently powered to detect clinically minimally important differences in secondary outcome measures. 

Within groups statistical analysis will be performed on all outcome measures at all time points. Results will be reported as point measures and measures of variability. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be analysed using paired samples t-tests or repeated measures ANOVA or nonparametric analyses as appropriate. Results will be accepted as statistically significant at p&lt; 0.05. SPSS 19.0 will be used and statistical significance will be set at 0.05 level of significance. 

Qualitative component: Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and will analysed using a symbolic interactionism framework to explore therapist perception of the evidence regarding retraining walking and fitness, high-intensity treadmill training and the barriers and facilitators to implementing this. Interviews will be conducted prior to commencement of and on completion of the treadmill intervention with therapists across both facilities.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a leading cause of disability amongst Australians. After stroke, activity levels are low, with few people able to exercise at an intensity which will reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events. This project examines the feasibility and effectiveness of usual physiotherapy staff in rehabilitation implementing a combined high intensity treadmill training program with a self management approach to improve activity levels, mobility, cardiovascular risk profile in stroke survivors, increasing their independence and reducing the burden of care. In addition, this project will investigate the barriers and facilitators to physiotherapists implementing this approach to stroke management as part of their clinical practice.</summary>
