  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intensive and specific nutritional care, including prescribed diet to achieve 1.5-2g protein/Kg/day and 30-35 KCal/Kg/day; including recommended consumption of 2-3 tetrapaks of specialized nutritional formulae - enriched with arginine, Vitamin C and Vitamin A. Review by intervention Dietitian 4-5 times per week of 15-30 minutes to monitor intake and adjust diet to maximise nutritional intake.  Up to period of 4 weeks, or until discharge or healing of PU.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard nutritional care includes current nutritional care provided by treating team, including a dietitian.  This may vary from the patient receiving only a standard hospital diet and not being referred to a dietitian, to being prescribed a high protein/energy diet and being reviewed by a dietitian regularly.  Patients receiving standard nutritional care may be prescribed nutritional supplements, but not the specialized nutritional formulae enriched with arginine, Vitamin A and C.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean difference in protein and energy intake between groups, as assessed from food intake records collected on data collection days of day 0,5,10,15,20,25,30 and analysed using FoodWorks nutritional analysis software.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost comparison of treatment between two groups.  This will be determined from the organisation's perspective and data collected includes: The mean difference in cost between the 2 groups will be determined for: nutritional supplements, intervention staff time, patient length of hospital stay.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All eligible patients will be advised of the study by ward nurses or Skin Integrity Nurses and asked if they wish to participate. If the patient agrees, the Research Nurse is notified and then undertakes consent to participate in the study with the patient.  Upon consent the Research Nurse notifies the Study Coordinator, who in turn refers to computer generated randomizer, and notifies Research Dietitian of the randomization outcome.  Allocation occurs after consent and involves contacting the holder of the allocation schedule  at a central administration location.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study intends to investigate if there is any improvement in healing of pressure ulcer in hospitalized patients receiving an intensive and specialized nutrition intervention compared to standard nutritional care.  This pilot study is being conducted initially to determine if the nutrition intervention is feasible, how many patients can be enrolled and if the nutrition intervention improves healing.  This data will assist in planning future, larger studies.</summary>
