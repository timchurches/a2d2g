  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment of early childhood dental caries by school dental therapists using the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment approach (ART) compared with the standard care provided by dentists within public dental services. Children will have teeth requiring restorations treated using hand instruments, without the use of local analgesia and the prepared tooth restored with a glass-ionomer cement. The duration of each treatment session is expected to last approximately 15-20 minutes. Preventive application of fluoride varnish to interproximal areas and areas with white spot lesions will also be undertaken every 6 months. Children will be assessed 12 months after treatment completed</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard dental treatment provided by dentists within public dental services using standard treatment protocols. Children requiring restorative treatment will have teeth prepared using engine driven instruments and local analgesia, and the prepared cavity restored with the material chosen at clinician's discretion. Preventive therapeutic agents will be provided the discretion of the treating clinician. Children will be evaluated 12 months after treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of restorations will be assessed at 12 months following the criteria of Frencken et.al. (1996) by examining each child participant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluated 12 months after post intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of dental caries will be evaluated after 12 months using the criteria of Drury et.al. (1999)by a clinical examination of each child participant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluated after 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child oral health-related quality of life will be evaluated by parent completed questionnaire of ECOHIS of Pahel et.al. (2007) at baseline and at the 12 month clinical examination.</outcome>
      <timepoint>evaluated at baseline and after 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>cost-effectiveness of the intervention using cost-consequence analysis. Input costs will be derived from the salary of clinicians and dental assistants and estimates of time spent in
providing care (including re-treatments) will be derived from information recorded in clinical records of study participants and Public Dental Services' Patient Management System. Material costs will also be estimated from clinical records on type and amount of materials used and the cost of materials (obtained from Public Dental Service). Fixed costs (buildings and infrastructure) and overheads and utility costs are common and similar in magnitude to both arms of the trial and will not be considered. Differences in costs and in
effectiveness will be compared in a cost consequence analysis using the primary and secondary effectiveness measures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluated at the conclusion of the trial after 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parent/carer acceptability of care provided. Focus group interviews will be undertaken with a sample of study participants at the conclusion of the study. Nvivo9 computer software will be used to code the transcripts from the focus groups. Emergent themes from the focus groups will then be explored. Transparent validation of emergent themes and content will be performed by using two coders. Thematic analysis will be performed as such an approach allows for contextual differences between perceptions, experiences and belief to be developed and explored.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluated at the conclusion of the trial after 24 months</timepoint>
