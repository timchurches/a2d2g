  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In infants with gastrointestinal complications, constructing an ileostomy is a common temporising
surgical intervention whilst waiting for future definitive surgery. An ileostomy is a surgically created
opening into the ileum (the final part of the small intestine) which connects the healthy end of the
ileum to an artifical bag on the surface of the skin; allowing the distal and diseased bowel to be
bypassed and heal. Intestinal waste passes out of the ileostomy, bypassing the colon. Intestinal
waste which has bypassed the colon usually has a higher content of water and electrolytes because
the small intestine does not conserve electrolytes, in particular sodium as well as the colon.
It is known that infants with high ileostomy fluid losses are at risk of dehydration, sodium deficit
and failure to thrive. To prevent this, clinicians at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) Neonatal Unit
(NNU) have traditionally replaced ileostomy fluid losses with intravenous saline when those losses
are above 20ml/kg/day. This method requires recurrent insertion of intravenous cannulae, or
insertion of central venous lines because the median duration between fashioning and closing an
ileostomy is 44 days (Range 16-107 days). Central lines are important risk factors for sepsis in
infants. Moreover, some infants have very difficult intravenous access. Therefore in these situations,
clinicians at RCH NNU have been replacing high volume ileostomy fluid losses with oral rehydration
solution.
The aim of this pilot study is to determine sample size calculations, data variability and feasibility
for a future study with the specific aim to determine whether oral rehydration solution replacement
is as effective as intravenous saline for replacement of ileostomy fluid losses in infants.
In this study consented infants with ileostomy fluid losses of 20-40ml/kg/day who are tolerating full
enteral feeds and additional salt supplementation will be allocated to receive both intravenous saline
and oral rehydration solution for two weeks each. The order of which will be randomly assigned.
They will receive each type of rehydration fluid for 14 days; a total of 28 days. Irrespective of the
method of fluid replacement, the ileal fluid volume will be replaced over the following 24 hours if
over 20ml/kg/day.
During the study, information including third daily weight; weekly urine sodium, ileostomy sodium
and sodium supplementation dose; daily total fluid balance (total fluid input and output), ileostomy
losses and replacement, and any complications that may occur will be recorded on a standardised
data sheet. No additional blood tests are required, therefore discomfort should be no greater than
currently associated with being an inpatient in the NNU.
Descriptive statistics will be generated for all outcome measures to determine population variability
and sample size for a larger study.</summary>
