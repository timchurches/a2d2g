  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent studies by the US Gynecologic Oncology Group have found that patients, who are given chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity as well as through a vein, live longer than those who are given chemotherapy through a vein only. 

TRIPOD is a study which will determine if it is possible and safe to treat ovarian cancer patients, in Australia and New Zealand with chemotherapy given directly into the abdomen as well as through a vein. This study will enroll at least 35 patients which will take approximately 1 year. 

The aim of the study is to determine if it is possible to treat women with ovarian cancer with chemotherapy, some of which is given directly into the abdomen as well as into the vein. It will also determine how safe it is, what side-effects it causes and how it affects quality of life.</summary>
