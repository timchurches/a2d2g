  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention, myCompass, is an automated self-help program available via the internet to people's desk-top computers and mobile phones.  The intervention consists of real-time monitoring of symptoms with SMS prompts, therapeutic modules, fact sheets, motivational statements, mental health tips and a journal.  It will be recommended that participants use myCompass for at least 1 hour per week and complete daily self-monitoring.  Participants will use the full myCompass program for 7 weeks. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is a common mental health problem in people with diabetes and is associated with lower quality of life, poorer blood glucose control, and higher rates of functional disability, diabetes related complications and mortality.  The internet is recognised increasingly as a useful way of increasing public access to evidence-based treatments for mental health problems.  In a recent study, researchers at the Black Dog Institute showed that a new internet and mobile phone intervention, 'myCompass', improved significantly mental health outcomes for people with mild to moderate depression, stress and anxiety.  The proposed study will examine whether use of myCompass improves mental health outcomes in people with diabetes, and is associated with improved self-managment and blood glucose control.</summary>
