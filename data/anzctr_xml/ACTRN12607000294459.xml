  <interventions>
    <interventions>Accelerated BEP chemotherapy, consisting of:
- Bleomycin 30000 international units intravenous (IV) days 1 and 8
- Etoposide 100mg/m2 IV days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Cisplatin 20mg/m2 IV days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
with pegylated G-CSF (pegfilgastrim, Neulasta) 6mg SCI administered on day 6

For patients with intermediate or poor risk disease, treatment is repeated every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. An additional 4 weeks of Bleomycin will be administered if lung function tests allow to a maximum of 12 doses. Total duration  12 weeks

For patients with good risk disease, treatment is repeated every 2 weeks for 3 cycles. An additional 3 weeks of Bleomycin will be administered if lung function tests allow to a maximum of 9 doses. Total duration  9 weeks</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint of the study is the feasibility of the regimen, defined as the proportion of patients eligible to start their 4th cycle of BEP within 50 days of their first dose of chemotherapy.
Success will require completion of 3 cycles of BEP followed by adequate recovery of full blood count from the 3rd cycle of BEP (absolute neutrophil count = 1.0 x 109/L, platelet count = 100 x 109/L) prior to day 50
Both intermediate-poor risk patients (who will proceed to a 4th cycle of BEP), and good risk patients (who will have completed their etoposide and cisplatin) will be included in this endpoint
Patients completing treatment with non-protocol specified modifications will not be counted as successes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At day 50 after first dose of chemotherapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. The proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 and 4 toxicities, as defined by the Common Toxicity Criteria v3.0 of the National Cancer Institute (NCI CTC V3.0); especially febrile neutropaenia, infection, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, pulmonary toxicity and secondary haematological malignancy. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed prior to each cycle of BEP, prior to additional bleomycin, and after surgery or 30 days after last protocol chemotherapy.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2.  The proportion of patients with continuous complete remission (CCR) at 12 months. CCR requires disease status of CR or no evidence of disease (NED) for non-seminomas; and CR, NED or residual, marker-negative radiologic abnormalities for pure seminomas.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at 12 months post-protocol completion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. The relative dose intensity of treatment compared with standard BEP
- The relative dose intensity is calculated by dividing the actual mean dose (per week) of drug delivered in the study, by the mean dose (per week) of drug delivered in a standard BEP regimen.
- The actual mean dose of drug delivered for both cisplatin and etoposide will be calculated by dividing the total dose administered (per meter squared) by the number of weeks over which the drugs were administered.
 The planned mean dose for cisplatin is 50mg/m2/week (300mg/m2 over 6 weeks or 400mg/m2 over 8 weeks).
 The planned mean dose for etoposide is 250mg/m2/week (1500mg/m2 over 6 weeks or 2000mg/m2 over 8 weeks).
- The mean dose of standard BEP is as follows:
 for cisplatin: 33.3 mg/m2/week (300mg/m2 over 9 weeks or 400mg/m2 over 12 weeks)
 for etoposide: 166.6 mg/m2/week (1500mg/m2 over 9 weeks or 2000mg/m2 over 12 weeks)
- The planned relative dose intensity is therefore 1.5</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at the end of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4.  The proportion of patients with maximum reductions from baseline in diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) adjusted for haemoglobin and/or vital capacity of:
 (i) &lt;15% (ii) 15% - 25% (iii) &gt;25%</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed prior to the commencement of each cycle of accelerated chemotherapy, at end of treatment and prior to additional bleomycin treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5. The proportion of patients with significant changes in patient-rated neurotoxicity (deterioration of = 5 points on a 40-point scale), as measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity questionnaire (FACT/GOG-Ntx) (Calhoun, Welshman et al. 2003)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patient rated neurotoxicity assessed at each treatment cycle and at the end of treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study on the safety and effectiveness of accelerated treatment with three chemotherapy drugs (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin with pegylated G-CSF) known as accelerated BEP, in treating people with advanced germ cell tumours. 

 

Who is it for?

You can join this study if you have germ cell cancer that has spread to distant sites and is widespread. 

 

Trial details

All participants will receive accelerated BEP chemotherapy intravenously over two week cycles. The number of cycles will be determined by the persons risk of disease and their response to treatment. 

Accelerated BEP is a more intense treatment than the standard treatment, and may cause more side effects. This clinical trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of the new regimen as well as its impact on lung function, and neurotoxicity as rated by the participants.</summary>
