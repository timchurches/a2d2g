    <exclusivecriteria>1) History of malaria. 
2) Travelled to or lived (2 weeks or more) in a malaria-endemic country during the past 12 months or planned travel to a malaria-endemic country during the course of the study. 
3) Has evidence of increased cardiovascular disease risk (defined as greater than 10%, 5 year risk)
4) History of splenectomy.

7) Known inherited genetic anomaly (known as cytogenetic disorders) e.g., Downs syndrome 
8) Volunteers unwilling to defer blood donations to the ARCBS for 6 months. 
9) The volunteer has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, severe depression, bi-polar disease, or other severe (disabling) chronic psychiatric diagnosis. Participants who are receiving a single antidepressant drug and are stable for at least 3 months prior to enrollment without decompensating may be allowed to enroll in the study at the investigators discretion. 
10) Presence of acute infectious disease or fever (e.g., sub-lingual temperature 38.5 degrees C) within the five days prior to study product administration). 
11) Evidence of acute illness within the four weeks before trial prior to screening. 
12) Significant intercurrent disease of any type, in particular liver, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, rheumatologic, or autoimmune disease by history, physical examination, and/or laboratory studies including urinalysis. 
13) Have ever received a blood transfusion. 
14) Evidence of any condition that, in the opinion of the clinical investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives or pose excessive risks to participants.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study of safety and infectivity in 2 healthy volunteers of a new Plasmodium falciparun Malaria bank (HMP02Pf) obtained from an malaria infected patient under HREC approval from both Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital and Queensland Institute of Medical Research. The Malaria bank was prepared under highly controlled conditions using protocols developed in conjunction with the Red Cross the US FDA and QGen. The clinical protocol is based on prior studies using the 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum isolate. The malaria bank has had full serological and PCR evaluations over 6 months meeting the criteria of ARCBS blood donation requirements. This study is to establish the safety and comparative growth kinetics of the other 3D7 malaria inoculum. The antimalarial agent used to treat the malaria is the TGA approved Riamet, which was also used to eradicated the malaria infection in the patient donor.</summary>
