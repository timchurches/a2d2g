  <interventions>
    <interventions>Healthy lean and obese subjects will each undergo two studies (sitagliptin 100 mg oral versus control), in double-blind, randomised fashion, separated by 3 - 14 days. Patients with type 2 diabetes will be studied on 4 occasions each: twice during therapy with metformin 850 mg twice daily for 7 days (days 5 and 8, sitagliptin 100 mg oral or control), and twice during treatment with a matching placebo twice daily for 7 days, with a washout period of 14 days between treatment periods. In the diabetic patients, the order of both metformin and placebo, and sitagliptin and control, will be randomised, except that during the second metformin/placebo treatment period, the order of sitagliptin and control will be identical to the first treatment period. On each study day, glucose will be infused into the duodenum at 2 kcal/min from 0 to 120 min. Within each group (healthy lean, healthy obese, diabetic), each subjects acts as his own control, but comparison will also be made between groups.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine whether the antidiabetic medicine, sitagliptin, has the capacity to increase intestinal hormones called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), decrease blood glucose levels and reduce appetite in healthy subjects and people with type 2 diabetes. We will also determine, in the people with diabetes, whether these effects are enhanced when sitagliptin is given together with another diabetes drug, metformin.</summary>
