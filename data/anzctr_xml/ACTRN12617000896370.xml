  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will examine cerebrovascular and cognitive function in patients with complex congenital heart disease and age-gender matched controls, using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound. The procedure will take up to 3 hours and will be performed by Dr Rachel Wong, the study coordinator, in week one. There is only one visit in this study.
Volunteers will be required to attend the Clinical Nutrition Research Centre (CNRC) for screening. If they are eligible, data collection for our outcome assessments will continue at the same visit. 
Anthropometric measurements of height, weight and waist circumference will be obtained before clinic blood pressure is assessed to determine compliance with the studys blood pressure criteria. 
Participants will then be fitted with a headpiece supporting an ultrasound probe on each temporal region. An investigator will adjust the probes until a measurable blood flow signal is obtained in each middle cerebral artery (MCA). If the investigator is unable to obtain a blood flow signal in both MCAs, the participant will be excluded from the study. Otherwise, the participant will be assessed. The ultrasound will continuously record the changes in blood flow velocities in the MCA during a cognitive test battery. 
After the cognitive test, the investigator will adjust the ultrasound probes to locate the posterior cerebral arteries [either the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) or the basilar artery (BA)] on either side of the temporal window.  Once a suitable blood flow signal is located, participant will be asked to open and close their eyes as guided by the investigator. Participants will not be excluded if blood flow signals from the posterior arteries are not found. 
A walking test will be administered as the last assessment.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to cognitive testing at the level of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). 
Using TCD ultrasound, changes in blood flow velocity in the MCA during cognitive testing will be measured. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CVR to photic stimulation.
CVR to photic stimulation (neurovascular coupling) at the level of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA; posterior circulation) will be assessed using TCD ultrasound.
We will measure the increase in blood flow in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) in response to photic stimulation. Blood flow velocities will be recorded continuously during two continuous cycles of 20-sec of checkered board stimulus, followed by 20-sec of eyes shut. This will be repeated after a 5-min interval.

    <statisticalmethods>Participant characteristics (body mass index, waist circumference, clinic BP, medication use, history of sleep apnoea or myocardial infarction) will be used as covariates. Age and gender may be added as covariates if they are significantly correlated with the outcome measures. Echocardiography and cross sectional imaging (CT/MRI aorta), where available, will be assessed.
Participant characteristics will be used as covariates if they are significantly correlated with the outcome measures. A two-sample t-test will be used to compare the group differences in outcome measures. Linear regressions will determine if there are relationships between gait speed and cerebrovascular function and cognitive performance. Where appropriate, Bonferroni adjustments will be made to allow for multiple comparisons.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adults with congenital heart disease have excellent survival rate. However, late complications such as early-onset of cardiovascular events can affect quality of life later in life. We have recently demonstrated that adults with previous aortic coarctation repair (a procedure to correct narrowing of the hearts main artery) have increased stiffening of the blood vessel in the brain, which may explain the heightened risk for stroke in this group of patients. The hardening of the blood vessel in the brain decreases the ability of the vessels to dilate effectively, thus decreasing blood flow in the brain. Over time, this can lead to poor mental performance and increases ones risk for early-onset dementia. 
In this study, we are looking to examine whether patients with complex congenital heart disease may have disturbances in the blood flow in their brain and how this affects mental performance. We will use transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to measure blood flow in the brain during a series of mental tests and compare patients with complex congenital heart disease with healthy control participants. 
We are seeking a total of 30 participants - 15 adults with complex congenital heart disease and 15 adults without heart disease. Participants will be recruited via public advertisement, word of mouth and referral from the cardiologists at the John Hunter Hospital.
