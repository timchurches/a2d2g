  <interventions>
    <interventions>A simple randomised controlled trial (RCT) design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component online program for decreasing stress and improving mental and physical wellbeing (called Stress eHealth). 

The Stress eHealth program is placed within the Federation University eHealth Platform, which is a platform. People who visit the website, either directly or through seeing the program advertised, will be invited to take part in the Stress eHealth evaluation study. Those that consent will be randomly allocated to the Stress eHealth program (immediate access group) or a wait control group (delayed access group). The delayed access group will receive the intervention following a 10-week waiting period.

Stress eHealth contains five modules, delivered weekly over the five weeks, and is designed to help people cope with challenging situations and enhance their mental and physical wellbeing. 

Each module will take between 10-20 minutes to complete. Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., to remind them to log on, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions at the beginning of each week, to monitor their progress. 

Stress eHealth has five modules: 
1.	Stress and Health
2.	Your Thoughts
3.	Relaxation and Physical Activity
4.	Social Connectedness and Strengths 
5.	Mindfulness


Participants randomised to the Stress eHealth (immediate access) group will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 1-5) assessment, post-intervention assessment (Week 6) and a 1 and 3 month follow-up assessment (Week 10 &amp; Week 18). The will have access the Stress eHealth program for the entire duration of the study. 

Those randomly allocated to the waitlist condition will be asked to complete the same assessment phases, except for the 3 month follow-up assessment, as they will be given access to Stress eHealth program following the 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 10). However the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they complete the Stress eHealth program (Week 16).</interventions>
    <comparator>Delayed access participants are asked to wait (will not receive access to Stress eHealth) but will be asked to complete the same assessment questionnaires as the intervention condition up to the 1 month follow-up assessment time point. Following completion of the 1 month follow-up assessments they will be provided access to Stress eHealth and then as to complete post-program questionnaires.</comparator>

Previous research has reported medium effects can be expected. Therefore, assuming a small-medium effect (i.e. GPower f(v) test = 0.40), significance set at 5% (p = .05), power at 80%, a sample of 64 will be required to demonstrate statistical significance. However allowing for a 40% attrition rate, we will be required to recruit 107 participants.</statisticalmethods>
