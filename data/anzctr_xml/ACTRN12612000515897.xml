    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by public notices and advertisements placed in community newspapers.  Telephone screening will firstly identify participants within the required age ranges and exclude those likely to be experiencing exclusion factors (family history of diabetes and heart disease, anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical use and BMI &gt;30). Participants meeting this screening will be forwarded the Participant Information Sheet and Consent form. The participants will be invited to a face to face meeting with the researchers to ensure the Participant Information Sheet has been read and understood. If written consent is provided, a written general health questionnaire and baseline blood sample will be drawn to verify inclusion criteria by excluding diabetes and risk of heart disease.  Participants meeting the inclusion requirement will be invited to undertake the study and a date provided for the first breakfast meal. Allocation will be concealed by use of sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Meals high in fat cause a marked postprandial increase in low-grade inflammation. Although short-term, the resulting inflammatory response may have implications in long-term risk for chronic illness such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unknown whether the postprandial inflammatory response to high-fat meals differs in older adults, and is still not clear how digestion and metabolism of fats is affected by age.

This study aims to analyse the digestive, physiological, inflammatory and immune responses to a single meal in young adults compared with older adults, of either a fast-food breakfast (high in saturated fat and calories), or a healthy breakfast (low in saturated fat, following dietary guidelines set out by The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating).</summary>
