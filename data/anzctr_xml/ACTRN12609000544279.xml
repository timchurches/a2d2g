  <interventions>
    <interventions>Liposomal Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCL) for Inhalation is a dispersion developed for inhalation consisting of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride encapsulated in liposomes and formulated to contain 50 mg/ml of ciprofloxacin. The mixture formulation also referred to as MIXTURE contains equal volumes of this Liposomal Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCL) for Inhalation (50 mg/ml) [50%] and the Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCl)
solution (24 mg/ml) for Inhalation [50%]. Formulations will be administered using an AKITA Jet nebulizer or an AKITA Apixneb.nebulizer

Healthy subjects will receive Liposomal Ciprofloxacin HCL for Inhalation doses in the morning .
The three doses are:
A: Liposomal Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCl) for Inhalation (LC) plus normal saline using AKITA Jet nebulizer in healthy subjects.

B: Liposomal Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCl) for Inhalation(LC) plus Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCl) Solution for Inhalation = MIXTURE by AKITA Jet nebulizer in healthy subjects

C: MIXTURE - Liposomal Ciprofloxacin for Inhalation (LC) plus Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCl) Solution for Inhalation
(FC, combined = MIXTURE) by the Apixneb nebulizer in healthy subjects.
Doses will be randomly assigned to each subject, to be received in one of six different sequences 
The intervention administered as three separate formulation/device combinations. Each of the Liposomal Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCL) for Inhalation treatments will be separated by at least 5 days or 120 hours for ciprofloxacin to wash out of the body.

Non-Cystic Fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis patients will be screened and six subjects will be selected under separate inclusion and exclusion criteria from the healthy subjects. The single dose selected from the safety and tolerability results of the healthy subject cross-over dosing will be administered as a single dose to the 6 subjects with non-CF bronchiectasis. The reference dose,Tobramycin solution for inhalation(TOBI 'Registered Trademark'), will also be administered to the subjects with non-Cystic Fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis. The selected dose will only be administered once. The same pre and post dose assessments for each dosing day will apply to the non-Cystic Fibrosis (CF)bronchiectasis population as the healthy subjects.  

There are 3 treatment days separated by at least 5 days or 120 hours for ciprofloxacin to wash out of the body.  Subjects will report to the Phase I Unit the afternoon prior to the reference treatment day where they will recieve Reference formulation Tobramycin solution for
inhalation (TOBI 'Registered Trademark') administration by inhalation</interventions>
    <comparator>Tobramycin solution for
inhalation(TOBI 'Registered Trademark') was selected as a taste and tolerability comparison because it is an approved and marketed product in CF patients with known safety ,tolerability and bitter taste by inhalation.
Tobramycin solution for
inhalation(TOBI 'Registered Trademark')  has also been studied in non-Cystic Fibrosis(CF) bronchiectasis patients (Barker etal) It will be administered as a reference with the PARI LC Sprint nebulizer, as approved for use, to determine the acceptability/tolerability of the different formulations/doses given in this study.  A cross-over design is used in the study of healthy subjects to have each subject serve as their own control.
The study staff will prepare the reference dose by loading 5 mls from the 5ml ampoule in to the PARI LC Sprint nebulizer for reference formulation dosing.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two different formulations of Liposomal
Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCL) for Inhalation in two different nebulizers administered as three separate formulation/device combinations, and the tolerability of an inhaled reference
product, tobramycin solution for inhalation (TOBI 'Registered Trademark'), in healthy adults.
Safety and tolerability measurements will be taken for 24 hours after each dosing event. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic measurements will also be acquired over the same 24 hour time period. Subjects will receive a follow-up call from the study staff on the evening of each discharge from the clinic, and at 3 days following each ciprofloxacin dose to be asked if any
adverse events have occurred. Additionally, all subjects will be called 7 days after their last ciprofloxacin dose to ask if any adverse events have occurred.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety and tolerability measurements will be taken for 24 hours after each dosing event and be based on these results:
Tolerability
Taste questionnaire results and the presence or absence of cough and/or irritation at +15, +30, and +60 minutes relative to dosing following treatment and reference dosing.
Nebulisation time.
Safety endpoints:
Pulmonary Function Test (PFTs) Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR), Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, Forced Expiratory Flow in the mid 50% of forced exhalation (FEF25-75,), vital signs, lab tests, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Adverse Events (AEs), physical examination findings, will generally be evaluated as comparisons in continuous variables (mean change) or categorical variables (contingency tables):
Change from pre-dose baseline at each post-dose evaluation where baseline is the
last test prior to dosing.
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic measurements will also be acquired over the same 24 hour time period.
Venous blood specimens will be collected into 9 ml lithium heparin tubes, on all ciprofloxacin treatment
days, at 30 minutes prior to dosing, immediately post-dosing (IPD), and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 22 hours after dosing commences</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of the selected Liposomal
Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (HCL) for Inhalation formulation/device combination in subjects with non-Cystic Fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis, compared to the tolerability of an inhaled reference product, tobramycin solution for inhalation (TOBI 'Registered Trademark'), and to compare these results with the data acquired in healthy volunteers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The same pre and post dose assessments for each dosing day will apply to the non-CF bronchiectasis population as the healthy subjects. Subjects will receive a follow-up call from the study staff on the evening of each discharge from the clinic, and at 3 days following their ciprofloxacin dose to be asked if any adverse events have occurred. Subjects will return to the Phase 1 unit 7 days (or up to 10 days) after their ciprofloxacin dose for a brief physical
examination, vital signs and pulmonary function testing, together with safety bloods of hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis and questioning about adverse events.

Pre-existing conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as adverse events. In this study adverse events will be documented and reported from screening to study completion for all subjects who receive at least one dose of the study drug.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of two formulations of liposomal ciprofloxacin when inhaled using two diflerent nebulizers. It will also study the uptake and removal of
ciprofloxacin from the human body. The sponsor wants to know which formulation/device combination is the most tolerable to test in patients with bronchiectasis, a rare disease that affects
people's lungs.
There are two parts to this study. The first part will include healthy adults and the second part will include patients with bronchiectasis.</summary>
