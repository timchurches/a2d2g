  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 1 interferons are released by cells in response to viral infections and function to limit virus replication. We propose that lozenges containing low doses of interferon can be used as an effective treatment for influenza. This grant will fund a clinical trial during the cold and flu season in Perth to test the effectiveness of this treatment

AIM
To conduct a clinical trial for the prophylactic use of Low Dose Orally Administered Type 1 Interferon lozenges for winter colds and flu in Perth, Western Australia 

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of orally administered natural human IFNa (150 IU), as compared to placebo, on the frequency and severity of winter cold and flu-like symptoms (WCFLS) during the main winter colds and flu season in Australia. Frequency and severity of WCFLS will be assessed using a questionnaire submitted on a weekly basis by study subjects.

The secondary objectives will be to compare IFNa and placebo treatment with respect to changes in 
- days of work missed 
- cold/flu medication usage
- number of physician visits required due to cold/flu symptoms
- number of pharmacy visits required and 
- rates of 4-fold or greater antibody increases for a panel of respiratory viruses.

Estimates of potential cost savings to the West Australian Health system following the use of interferon lozenges will be calculated based on the results of the study.</summary>
