  <interventions>
    <interventions>SDD intervention group; 
All patients in the intervention group will receive all 3 treatments. all treatment will occur simultaneously. The topical and enteral intervention will continue until tracheal extubation, removal of the enteral feeding tube, 24-hours unsupported spontaneous ventilation via tracheostomy, or ICU discharge, whichever comes first, for a maximum of 90 days. The IV Antibiotic intervention will be continued for 4 days. The study treatments will be administered by qualified ICU nurse.

The intervention will entail:
1. SDD paste: The six-hourly topical application of 0.5g paste,
containing colistin 2%, tobramycin 2% and nystatin 2%, to the buccal mucosa and oropharynx.
2. SDD suspension: The six-hourly administration of 10 mls
suspension containing 100 mg colistin/ polymixin, 80 mg
tobramycin and 2 x 106 IU nystatin, to the gastrointestinal
tract via the gastric / jejunal tube.
3. A four-day course of an intravenous antibiotic. Patients not already receiving a therapeutic antibiotic will be prescribed cefotaxime 1g six-hourly or ceftriaxone 1g daily, with dose adjusted as appropriate for organ dysfunction. Ciprofloxacin (400mg 12-hourly) may be used as an alternative if there is a contraindication to cephalosporins (e.g. allergy). Patients already receiving an alternative intravenous antibiotic to treat infection will not receive this additional intravenous antibiotic, but will continue the prescribed antibiotic for the usual duration of therapy</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group- standard care

In Australia and New Zealand there are no national guidelines so local policy is determined by each ICU. In these countries we will recommend control and SDD group management is in line with current national standards of practice that may or may not include a VAP bundle</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>SuDDICU sample size and plan of analysis 
We have estimated hospital mortality for our targeted patients of 29%. The original design aimed to detect an absolute risk reduction in hospital mortality from 29% to 25.5% (3.5%).This reduction is based on what we believe to be an appropriate minimally clinically important difference for a mortality benefit in critical care patients and in previous well designed studies with values in high quality large positive studies Power and intercluster correlation coefficient (ICC)- We powered the study with an alpha of 5% and a beta of 90% power.
For the revised SuDDICU-ANZ x-cRCT, the inter-period correlation (IPC) coefficient is estimated at 0.005. SuDDICU-ANZ will therefore recruit 8,000 patients from 25 to 30 ICUs and will have 80% power to detect a 3.3% absolute reduction in hospital mortality from a baseline mortality of 29%, depending on the precise number of clusters.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Selective Decontamination of the Digestive Tract (SDD) is a treatment designed to reduce the risk of infection and improve survival for critically ill patients. SDD is the application of antibiotics and antifungal drugs to the throat and their instillation into the stomach, combined with a short course of intravenous antibiotics. 

Although many trials suggest that SDD works, the research results have not been convincing enough to lead to the widespread uptake of SDD around the world. Additionally clinicians are concerned that SDD will increase antibiotic resistance amongst endemic bacteria. As a result, SDD is not currently widely practiced. 

This trial aims to resolve this uncertainty. We will be conducting the definitive randomised study examining the effect of implementing SDD. For 24 months, ICUs in Australia and NZ will be randomly assigned to either deliver SDD in the first 12-month period and be a control ICU in the second 12-month period, or to be a control ICU first and deliver SDD in the second period. 8000 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients will be enrolled. Mortality rates will be compared between the SDD and control groups antibiotic resistance rates will be evaluated in samples from all patients prior to, during and after the trial to determine the effect of SDD on the microbial ecology. 
The SuDDICU-ANZ trial will provide definitive answer to a fundamental question in intensive care medicine - does SDD reduce critically ill patients risk of dying without increasing antibiotic resistance rates? If SDD is found to be effective without increasing antibiotic resistance, the study will have a global impact, leading to improved survival and reduced infection rates in critically ill patients. The results of this study will change practice and be of immense value to clinicians, policy makers and regulators.</summary>
