  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of chemotherapy with the drug Omacetaxine in people with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (cancer of blood cells) which is in chronic, accelerated, or blast phase and you have have had no success with or have been intolerant to therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (iminitab - Glivec).

Trial details
All participants will be treated with induction course cycles consisting of subcutaneous (SC) Omacetaxine administered twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days. During this induction therapy, participants will be evaluated every 7 days with complete blood and platelet counts; the number of consecutive dose s of Omacetaxine or intervals between subsequent cycles may be adjusted as necessary, according to guidelines provided in the treatment plan.

Omacetaxine causes programmed cell death in myeloid cancer cells. Patients will be monitored from the beginning of treatment until any return of the disease or until they die. The study aims to measure the effectiveness of treatment, and investigates the tolerance to and toxicity of Omacetaxine.</summary>
