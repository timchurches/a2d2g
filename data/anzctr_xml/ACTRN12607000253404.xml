  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention condition was a group programme that incorporated cognitive behavioural treatments for both anxiety disorders and anger/aggression. This treatment comprised of 9 hour-long sessions extending over 11 weeks with separate child and parent groups. Specific treatment strategies included psychoeducation about anxiety and anger, cognitive restructuring, graded exposure for anxiety-based avoidance, anger self-management (such as self-talk), goal-setting and behaviour management.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment was also 9 hour-long sessions over 11 weeks, and comprised group cognitive behavioural treatment (for both children and parents) for anxiety  alone. The strategies included psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring and graded exposure.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a group treatment that targeted both anxious and aggressive behaviours in children with both these problems. We predicted that this group programme would lead to a greater reduction in anxiety and aggressive problems than a programme that targeted anxiety alone.</summary>
