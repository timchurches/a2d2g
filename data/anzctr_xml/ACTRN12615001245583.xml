  <interventions>
    <interventions>As per below: there is no washout period between the end of period 1 and start of period 2.


In this study participants will receive three treatments, Treatment 1 (capsule), Treatment 2 (beverage) and Treatment 3 (beverage) to test the effect of Flex-Aid on stopping or reducing the night-time muscle cramps.  Each treatment will be taken by mouth at home each night approximately 45 minutes before bedtime over 3 periods of time lasting 14 days each.

Each treatment may include a combination any of the following ingredients:
*Ginger extract (up to 750mg)
*Cinnamon extract (up to 500mg)
*Capsicum extract (ingredient in hot peppers, up to 38mg)
*8.3 grams of sugar from corn syrup
*Sugar
*Red food colouring

Treatment 2 and 3 (beverages) may smell like cinnamon, be the colour of soda and taste similar to atomic fireball candy or be very sweet.  They may also be very hot and spicy. 

Participants will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin - random selection) to the order that they will receive the study treatments.  Participants will be asked to take Treatment 1 (capsule), Treatment 2 or 3 (about 1/4 cup) up to 42 times during the study.  


Approximately eighty (80) male and female subjects will be enrolled into the Run-in Phase of Period 1.  Period 1 consists of two parts as follows:
Part 1 is a 7-day washout phase where subjects washout of existing treatments for nocturnal muscle cramps.  Only subjects on treatments for leg cramps will be enrolled in the washout phase,
Part 2 is a 14 day single blind phase where subjects will self administer treatment 1 each day for 14 days.   Approximately 48 eligible subjects who meet eligibility criteria will continue on to cross-over Periods 2 and 3 to achieve 40 subjects to complete the study (Treatments 2 &amp; 3).  Treatments 2 or 3 will be taken once every night for 14 days during Period 2; and the alternative treatment 2 or 3 once every night for 14 days during period 3.  Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in cross-over periods 2 and 3. 

Please note there is no wash-out period between treatments 2 and 3. Subjects will be provided all the necessary supplies and instructions for drug preparation as required at the scheduled study visit between Periods 2 and 3 (14 to 17 days). Treatments 2 and 3 occur consecutively. 

The PI will appoint a qualified member of the study team to make telephone contact with each subject on Day 7 +/- 2 days in each study period to assess adherence to intervention protocols by asking the subject to indicate (and provide details concerning) whether or not the investigational product was consumed each night at the appropriate time during the preceding interval. Missed or inappropriately timed doses will be recorded. Subjects will also be asked to complete a daily study diary that includes time and date of dosing. </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.          Male or female subjects who self-report having four (4) or more nights with at least one nocturnal-time leg and/or foot cramp within the last 4 weeks prior to Screening.
2.	Subjects greater than or equal to 50 years of age at screening.
3.	Negative urine drug and alcohol results at Screening and throughout the study.
4.	Negative results at Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).
5.	Males will either be surgically sterile or agree to use, through the duration of the study, one of the following approved methods of contraception: a male condom; a surgically sterile sexual partner; use of an intrauterine device by female sexual partner; a female condom; contraceptive sponge; a diaphragm; a cervical cap; an intravaginal system or oral, implantable, transdermal, or injectable contraceptives. Males will refrain from sperm donation throughout the duration of the study.
6.	All females, regardless of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at Screening and negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to treatment administration for each study period. Females of childbearing potential (i.e., not postmenopausal or surgically sterile [e.g., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bi-lateral oophorectomy]) will be required to use a medically acceptable method of contraception starting from Screening throughout the duration of the study. A postmenopausal woman is defined as having spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 1 year with a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) value consistent with postmenopausal status as per PI judgment. Acceptable methods of contraception include a hormonal or non-hormonal intrauterine device; female condom; diaphragm/cervical cap; contraceptive sponge; a male sexual partner who agrees to use a male condom; a sterile sexual partner; or abstinence (subjects reporting abstinence who become sexually active while on the study must agree to use other additional barrier methods of contraception). The following contraceptive methods are acceptable only when used with an additional barrier method as mentioned above: birth control pills, birth control patches, vaginal ring, hormone under the skin, or hormone injections. Females will refrain from egg donation for the duration of the study.

    <concealment>Each subject will be assigned a unique identification number upon Screening. Subjects who complete the study screening assessments and meet all the eligibility criteria will receive the corresponding treatment (i.e., Inactive treatment or Flex-Aid), according to a randomization schedule:

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Determination of sample size:
Up to 80 male and female subjects will be enrolled into the Run-in Phase of Period 1 (Part 2). Approximately 48 eligible subjects will continue on to cross-over Periods 2 and 3 to achieve 40 subjects to complete the study (allows for an 11% drop out rate).

With a sample size of 20 completed subjects in each treatment sequence, the 2 x 2 cross-over design will have 80% power to detect a treatment difference (Flex-Aid  Inactive treatment) in mean number cramps/14 day period of -3.0 assuming the standard deviation of differences is 6.450, using a two group t-test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level. Assuming an 11% dropout rate, 48 subjects total will be randomized in cross-over Period 2 to achieve a total of 40 subjects to complete the study. 

Efficacy Analysis

For the primary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline in the number of cramps over a 14 day treatment period will be determined.  A paired Wilcoxon signed rank test will be conducted to test for treatment effect at the 5% level of significance.  Test for carryover and period effect will also be conducted at 10% and 5% respectively.
Other efficacy endpoints may be analyzed using the same method as appropriate.

Descriptive statistics- arithmetic mean (AM), standard deviations (SD), sample size (N), coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum and maximum values will be calculated for the continuous efficacy endpoints (primary and exploratory) by treatment and time point.
Categorical efficacy endpoints will be summarized in frequency counts.

ANOVA may also be used to compare for treatment differences for the efficacy endpoints as appropriate. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effects of Flex-Aid on the frequency of nocturnal foot and/or leg cramps when self-administered within 45 minutes before going to bed. We aim to assess the effect of Flex-Aid on quality of life and pain/intensity of the nocturnal foot and/or leg cramps as well as the safety and tolerability of Flex-Aid.

FlexPharma hypothesizes that the acetic acid contained in teh pickle juice of teh beverage works by activating certain ion channels (Transient Receptor Potential TRP) which are known to exist in primary sensory neurons in mouth, esophagus and gut, and that their activation upregulate inhibitory circuitry in the spinal cord to prevent repetitive firing of alpha motor neurons thereby relieving the cramp. This study investigates whether natural activators of TRP ion channels may relieve muscle cramps.</summary>
