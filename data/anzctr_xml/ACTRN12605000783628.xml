  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the first of three studies that aim to the efficacy of psychotherapies focused on the expression of emotion, Pennebaker &amp; Beal's (1986) written disclosure methodology will be applied to an individual psychotherapeutic context.  In an extension of the Pennebaker &amp; Beal (1986) paradigm; and in accord with recent theoretical developments (i.e., A to D Emotion Theory; Pennebaker &amp; Chung (In-Press)), Participants allocated to the Treatment group will be encouraged to use emotion labels when expressing their deepest thoughts and feelings with respect to the following topics: Diagnosis (weeks 1 &amp; 6); Treatment/Waiting for Results (weeks 2 &amp; 7); Living in Remission (weeks 3 &amp; 8); Most Distressing/Traumatic Experience (weeks 4 &amp; 5).  Participants randomly allocated to the Treatment group will attend 8 x 1 hour, individual sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Control group will continue to receive routine care from their respective health care professionals. </comparator>

1.  At Time 2 (i.e. immediately post intervention) there will be a 50% decrease in GHQ 12 (General Health Questionnaire; Goldberg, 1992) scores from a Mean of 5.76 in the control group to a Mean of 2.88 in the intervention group, with a common standard deviation of 3.04, with at least 80% power at the 5% significance level</outcome>

      <outcome>2.  At time 2, there will be a 25% decrease in suppression (measured by the Courtauld Emotional Suppression Scale; Watson et al., 1983 ) from a Mean of 49.17 in the control group to a Mean of 36.87 in the intervention group, with a common standard deviation of 13.45 (Giese-Davis et al., 2002),with at least 80% power at the 5% significance level.</outcome>

      <outcome>3.  At Time 2, there will be a 25% increase in Emotional Approach Coping  (EAC; Stanton, 2002) from a Mean of 2.59 in the control group to a Mean of 3.23 in the intervention group, with a common standard deviation of 0.8 (Stanton, 2002), with at least 80% power at the 5% significance level.</outcome>

    <concealment>The Randomisation to control and intervention groups will be handled by administrative personnel at the Royal Adelaide Hospital,  to ensure researchers involved in the trials are removed from this process.  Given the nature of the study, however, it is not possible to conceal whether or not one receives psychotherapy.</concealment>
    <sequence>Administrative personnel at the Royal Adelaide Hospital will use the facility available on the Microsoft Excel Program to allocate Participants to the Routine Care Group or the Treatment Group.</sequence>
