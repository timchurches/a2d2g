  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With the rise in overweight and obesity, the number of women developing diabetes in pregnancy increases as well. Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with complications for mother and baby during the pregnancy but also later in life with higher rates of obesity in babies whose mothers had diabetes in pregnancy and higher risks for the mother to develop type 2 diabetes. Prevention of diabetes in pregnancy is ideal. This study will investigate if probiotics are an effective method to reduce rates of diabetes in pregnancy in overweight and obese women.</summary>
