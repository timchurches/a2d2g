  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each subject will recevie a single oral dose of 1g paracetamol and 400mg ibuprofen on a single occasion. Treatment will be administered with 500mL of water under fasting conditions.</interventions>
    <comparator>No comparator/control treatment will be administered. All subjects will be administered paracetamol &amp; ibuprofen; pharmacokinetics will be assessed across body weight groups.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the impact of varying body mass index on paracetamol, ibuprofen and metabolite pharmacokinetics in adults.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening: within 1 month prior to treatment administration.
Study Visit: Subjects are confined to the study unit from prior to dosing until 8 hours after treatment administration. Fingerprick blood and saliva samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected prior to dosing, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 &amp; 8 hours after treatment administration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the relationship between venous blood plasma paracetamol, ibuprofen and metabolite concentrations and those obtained from saliva and fingerprick blood samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Venous blood, saliva and fingerprick blood samples will be collected at 0.5, 2 &amp; 4 hours after treatment administration.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Participant has a history of allergy and/or sensitivity to paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
2. Participant has a medical condition or has received treatment with a pharmacologic agent for which administration of paracetamol and/or ibuprofen is contraindicated as outlined in the current product information.
3. Participant has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the medical officer, might affect the results of the study or may not be in the best interest of the participant to take part.
4. Participant has received treatment with paracetamol or ibuprofen containing products within 24 hours of study treatment administration.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Whilst paracetamol and ibuprofen are relatively safe and effective medications, high doses have been associated with potentially fatal liver damage or gastrointestinal problems whilst administration of low doses can result in inadequate treatment of pain and/or fever. This study is being conducted to investigate how increased body size impacts on how the body handles these medications. It is proposed that the results of this study will be used to guide dosing strategies for patients who are overweight or obese.</summary>
