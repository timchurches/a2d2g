  <interventions>
    <interventions>Selection of healthy adults missing a tooth on each side of the same jaw confined to the smile window ( 2nd premolar to 2nd premolar ).
Subjects will be treated with identical dental implants placed using same surgical protocol but the restorations will differ . Test implant will undergo the ONE ACT concept.
The One Act concept refers to one abutment one crown at one time concept. This means at the time of implant placement surgery, an acrylic transfer jig will be made by fixing a transfer / impression coping onto the implant and then laying self curing acrylic over the adjacent natural teeth and around the transfer coping locking it in. This bridging/ jig is removed along with the transfer/ impression coping.  

The implant is then going to be buried under the gum by closure through sutures which is referred to as the first or two stage surgery approach.

The transfer jig which was fabricated at the time of the surgery before closure is fitted onto a pre-prepared dental cast with a hole drilled out in the location where the implant was placed in the mouth. When this exercise is done a dummy implant is affixed to the transfer coping exactly as the real one was in the mouth and the dummy implant/ analog is set into the dental case with the hole filled with some self curing acrylic glue . Once set , the transfer coping is unscrewed and now we have our working model with an exact location of the implant as in the mouth transferred onto the cast. 

While the healing is taking place over 3 months , the laboratory will work with the model and create an abutment and a definitive, anatomically contoured crown all ready to go in at the same time. When 3 months have lapsed after initial surgery , at the time of second stage surgery , the definitive abutment and the definitive crown will all be inserted and finished at one time , thereby adhering  to the one abutment one crown at one time concept. The crown will be contoured to match the tooth as nature would have and the soft tissue is expected to heal and mature around the predefined shape of the crown. 

With this concept the whole treatment can be finished at the second stage surgery. For the purposes of the study the first two visits will be used up in preliminary assessments and consent including preliminary data collection.

On the third visit the dental implant will be placed and then the fourth visit will involve a review and removal of sutures. The fifth visit at 3 months after first stage surgery, at the second stage surgery,  the treatment will be completed.      

Dental X rays and Photographs will be recorded at 6 and 12 months as part of assessment and comparison on which intervention resulted in better bone levels and soft tissue aesthetic outcome. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control Implant will undergo the traditional approach to restoration of a single tooth implant in the anterior aesthetic zone.
The first two visits will be used up in preliminary assessments and consent including preliminary data collection. On the third visit the dental implant will be placed and then the fourth and fifth will be a review and removal of sutures. 
Visit 6 , 3 months after surgery will see the exposure of the implant though a second stage surgery and fixation of an anatomically shaped and customised transmucosal healing abutment. Sutures will be placed if required.
Visit 7, Review and removal of sutures
Visit 8, a month after Visit 6, dental impressions will be taken for the fabrication of a temporary crown in an attempt to further refine the soft tissue shape around the implant.
Visit 9, Placement of temporary abutment/ crown
Visit 10 , used for first round of data collection for the test implant 
Visit 11, after 4.5- 5.5 months of having the temporary crown in place, a new impression will be recorded to make a permanent crown to match the shape of the gum.
Visit 12, insertion of permanent crown
Visit 13 , 6 months after permanent crown , for review and data collection.
Visit 14, 12 months after permanent crown, for review and data collection.  

  visit which requires a temporary crown be made to help shape the gum and then a definitive crown is made to conform to the soft tissue out come from the temporary phase . </comparator>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In this study, we are using split-mouth design. The advantage is the need for smaller sample size as compared to normal design as the much of inter-subject variability is removed because each patient acts as his/her own control(left side as compared to left side of Jaw). This results in increased study power or a decrease in the number of participants required compared with a study in which patients receive only one intervention. Sample size depends also on the similarity of the sites within patients and it is estimated that the sample size may be further reduced compared with a parallel trial as the within-participant correlation increases. As the coefficient of correlation gets closer to one, the required sample size may be dramatically reduced. As our method is a new approach, there is no available data of mean and SD for the sample size calculation. Therefore we are using this number based on the literature in which there are mostly 12-15 patients needed to participate in the trials that use split-month design.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The evaluation of the soft tissue level outcome of implants placed and restored in the anterior premolar regions using a one abutment one crown at one time concept  compared to the traditional protocol of multiple abutments and crowns (temporary and permanent). The soft tissue parameters will be evaluated using the papilla score, pink esthetic score, plaque and bleeding on probing upto 1 year after the placement of the definitive/ permanent restoration.
Research hypothesis
The soft tissue formation and stabilization around single dental implants in the esthetic zone is achieved in a faster and more predictable way when the one abutment, one crown at one time protocol is used.
