  <interventions>
    <interventions>The overall aim of this 1-year randomised controlled trial is to investigate whether diet and physical activity behaviours can be improved with a tailored intervention in an overweight population recruited through the LiveLighter social marketing campaign in Perth, Western Australia. 

Individuals who sign up to the LiveLighter website will be invited to participate in the study and if eligible will be randomised to one of three groups (200 per group): 
Arm 1: tailored feedback intervention group (TF) for six months, followed by six months maintenance;
Arm 2: active control (AC) who receive no feedback on diet or physical activity behaviours but undertake the same assessments as the TF group;
Arm 3:  on-line control (OC) who will complete online assessments only.  

TF and AC will attend two face-to-face data collection visits at baseline, 6-months and again at one year, where they will be instructed on how to complete a 4-day mobile food record (mFR) using an investigator designed App running on a mobile device (iPhone or Android telephone) and record their physical activity for seven days by wearing an activity monitor. They will also have their height, weight and waist circumference measured. At the second face-to-face visit they will be interviewed to clarify the content of their food record and return their activity monitor. The same assessments will be repeated at six and 12 months. In addition, all groups will complete additional on-line assessments (demographic, psychosocial variables, food frequency questionnaire and physical activity behaviours) at baseline, six and 12 months. All groups will have access to the LiveLighter website materials throughout the intervention. 

The intervention content for diet and physical activity will be evidence-based (for example: the Clinical guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in Australia, the Australian Dietary Guidelines and Australia's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines). Formative focus group studies in consumers and health professionals were conducted prior to the intervention to inform the intervention features and content. The behaviour change strategies to inform the intervention will be based on the behavioural intervention technology (BIT) framework. These include self-monitoring, goal setting, motivation enhancement and feedback. Motivation enhancements (increases the likelihood of engagement) will include positive reinforcement (in the tailoring communications) and incentives. 

The intervention group (TF) will be provided with a fitness tracker to monitor their daily steps for the study duration and have a mobile food record app installed on their smartphone for monitoring diet and physical activity. The intervention group (TF) will receive tailored feedback on their diet and physical activity behaviours commencing within one week of their baseline visit. Tailored dietary feedback will be based on food group analysis of 4-day mobile food record and formulated by the research dietitian. Feedback on physical activity will be from the accelerometer and fitness tracker data and formulated by the research exercise physiologist. The tailored feedback, delivered as 12 emails one week apart, will focus on key messages around their healthy eating  (for example: fruits, vegetables, sugary-drinks, junk food, alcohol, portion sizes) and physical activity (for example: number of steps, sitting time, exercise intensity). Standard email templates for each topic will be developed with the dietary and physical activity feedback content personalised for each participant. The email content will be consistent with the communications for the LiveLighter campaign and will address each participants personal barriers to changing their diet and physical activity behaviours, reinforce motivation and develop skills through the meal and activity planner and healthy recipes. At 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks intervention group participants will be prompted by the mobile food record app, to complete a 1-day food mobile record and answer daily questions on number of steps and time spent sitting in the previous day, for seven days. They will be sent re-tailored feedback, with comparison against their previous record. Other components used in tailoring will include preference for autonomy support, intention, motivation, confidence informed by self-determination theory and motivational interviewing. A process evaluation will assess to what extent the intervention reached the target audiences. A brief questionnaire will be used to evaluate the participants perception of the computer-tailored feedback and to comment on features they like/dislike about the program. The TF and AC groups will also provide feedback on the usability of the mobile food record app. Impact evaluation will be assessed by exit interview surveys at 14-months by telephone with the target group to assess the impact of the intervention as well as assess perceptions of the various strategies and materials.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The study will be advertised on the LiveLighter website and participants directed to a weblink to an online screening survey. After completing the screening survey, eligible participants who consent online, will be randomised to either the control group (n=200) or invited to attend a face-to-face data collection session (n=400). A statistician, not involved in the data collection, will use a two staged, block randomisation to ensure a similar number of men and women are included in each arm of the study. This will also ensure adequate allocation concealment from the research team involved in recruitment and data collection. Allocation will be concealed by the use of sealed opaque envelopes. Once face-to-face data has been collected, a second randomisation will occur at the second face-to-face visit, with participants randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) tailored feedback (TF) or 2) active control (AC) who receive no feedback but undertake the same assessments as the TF group. Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind participants or researchers to their intervention group once allocation has occurred. </concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation will be conducted by a biostatistician not involved in the implementation of the trial on site (therefore not in contact with the study participants) using a randomisation table created by computer software. The electronic file will be kept in a secure password protected server by the statistician.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome variables measured at baseline and at 1-year, will be the energy-dense nutrient-poor foods, daily  moderate/vigorous physical activity and body weight / BMI. Secondary outcome variables: sedentary behaviours, serves of fruits and vegetables. The data on the change of these outcome variables in each of the two groups will be compared using analysis of covariance. Assumptions of the analyses will be assessed by examining the residuals from the analyses. Data will be transformed if the assumptions of the analyses are not satisfied. Possible covariates considered include age, gender and baseline value of the variable analysed. P-values &lt; 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. The effect size of the differences between treatment and control will be expressed as the adjusted mean difference and the associated 95% confidence intervals reported. The data on the change in the number of serves post intervention and follow-up time point will also be converted into binary categorical variables, greater than 0.5 serves and less than 0.5 serves. These categorical outcome variables will be analysed using multiple logistic regression and generalised estimating equations. Odds-ratio and associated 95% confidence intervals will be reported. The analyses will identify the characteristics of participants who are least likely to change their consumption of energy-dense nutrient-poor foods and physical activity identifying target groups for future health promotion.

A sample size of 600 participants (200 per group) will be required to detect a change in the primary outcome variable of at least 0.6 median serves/day of energy-dense nutrient poor (EDNP) food serves or discretionary foods (or equivalent to a 360 kJ/day reduction) between groups at 90% power and 5% level of significance. Based on our previous data, the distributions of EDNP food serves are expected to be skewed and hence a non-parametric adjustment to the sample size calculation using the Mann-Whitney test was used. Assuming a drop-out rate of about 20%, a total of 600 subjects will be recruited with equal numbers of males and females.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Excess weight is a major risk factor for chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. In Australia over 60% of adults are overweight or obese. Lack of exercise, overconsuming foods high in fat and sugars and not enough fruits and vegetables are recognised as key lifestyle factors leading to obesity in the population. Therefore new cost-effective approaches to improving the diet and physical activity of the population are needed. Self-monitoring is recognised as effective strategy in helping people improve their diet and physical activity. As people may not always know what changes to make, the addition of personalised feedback which provides specific recommendations may assist in weight maintenance. LiveLighter, is a public health education program to encourage people to eat well, be physically active and maintain a healthy weight. The aim of this study is to investigate in an overweight population whether diet and physical activity can be improved with personalised feedback. Volunteers will be invited from those who enrol in the LiveLighter Campaign. There will be three groups of 200 people (total 600 people). To record their diet, people will use an app designed by the investigators, known as a mobile Food Record for four days. They will also wear an activity monitor for 7 days. After recording details of their diet and physical activity, one group will receive frequent personalised feedback on their diet and physical activity for six months and provided with fitness tracker. Another group will record details of their diet and physical activity. A third group will only fill out only on-line surveys with questions about their diet and physical activity. All groups will be followed up again at one year. This will make it possible to determine if the addition of personalised feedback has any added benefit and if it helps people improve their diet and physical activity, as well as being able to achieve a healthy weight.  Details of all costings will be collected making it possible to work out how cost effective the program is. If successful and cost-effective, expansion for use in large scale state-wide and national interventions will be highly feasible.</summary>
