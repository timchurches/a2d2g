  <interventions>
    <interventions>Experimental subjects will receive 4g beta-alanine capsules (oral capsules) once daily for 28 days.  

An incremental treadmill test supervised by a PhD-level accredited exercise physiologist will be carried out at baseline and at 28 days (4 weeks). We will employ a ramp protocol (ACSM Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, 8th edition, pg 114) for which we are assessing exercise endurance.  The test will be terminated when the participant has reached at least 85% age-predicted max heart rate or s/he requests to stop.  We will also use an ECG to assess for any potential abnormal cardiac responses (i.e., ST segment depression, ventricular arrythmias, etc as per ACSM guidelines).  HR and BP will be assessed to monitor for abnormal haemodynamic responses. Pre and post-exercise blood glucose will be assessed to ensure participants are normoglycaemic.  

The protocol will be as follows:

kmh     % grade
0.8		0
1.6		0
2.4		0
3.2		0
4.0		0
4.8		0
4.8		1
4.8		2
4.8		3

Protocol will continue at 4.8 kmh plus 1% each minute until termination criteria have been achieved.   
</interventions>
    <comparator>Control subjects will receive 4g of maltodextrin placebo (oral capsules) once daily for 28 days.  An incremental treadmill test will be performed pre- and post-intervention at four weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is evidence that exercise capacity is reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes.  Beta-alanine has been shown to increase exercise capacity in younger, apparently healthy individuals and in elderly subjects.  To date, no previous exercise trials have evaluated the effects of B-alanine supplementation on exercise capacity in a cohort of patients with T2DM.  An improvement in exercise capacity in this population is valuable in that it may translate to an improvement in GLUT4 translocation and, consequently, an increase in glucose uptake.  Further increases in exercise capacity secondary to B-alanine supplementation may yield significant improvements in insulin sensitivity, resulting in an overall improvement blood glucose management (HbA1c) and possibly a reduction in diabetes medications or dosages.</summary>
