  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised into one of three conditions which are outlined below:

Arm 1: Mobile mindfulness meditation app 1. Participants assigned to this condition will be guided through mindfulness meditation practice using an app once daily for 10 minutes for 10 days. Participants will receive push notifications to encourage them to practice mindfulness. Participants will set daily reminders to complete daily mindfulness practice. Daily self-reports of adherence occur over the 10 day trial.
 

Arm 2. Mobile mindfulness meditation app 2. Participants assigned to this condition will  be guided through mindfulness meditation practice using an app once daily for 10 minutes for 10 days. Participants will set daily reminders to complete daily mindfulness practice. Daily self-reports of adherence occur over the 10 day trial.

Arm 3: Control condition. Participants assigned to this condition will use an app-based organisational tool to complete a neutral task once daily for 10 minutes for 10 days. Daily self-reports of adherence occur over the 10 day trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo - participants will use an app-based organisational tool to complete a neutral task (e.g. creating an outline of what the individual did on this day last week) once daily for 10 minutes for 10 days using the note taking function of the app. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study is a brief 10-day intervention to evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness of two mobile mindfulness meditation tools at improving wellness and mindfulness capabilities in users. 

The proposed project will involve innovative assessment and intervention delivery methods utilizing mobile phone technology to increase positive psychological wellbeing in naturalistic environments over time.

Participants mood, health and daily activities will be tracked during a 10-day trial of their assigned mobile wellness tool using web surveys accessed via their web-enabled mobile phones.  

We hypothesise that implementing mindfulness techniques will increase psychological wellbeing even over a brief 10-day period and that continued use of mindfulness techniques will result in long-term positive effects on wellbeing.
