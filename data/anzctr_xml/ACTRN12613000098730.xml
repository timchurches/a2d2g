  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both groups will receive seven sessions of care, once a week for six weeks administered one-on-one with a physical therapist.  The first session is one hour in length and the 2-7th sessions are 45 mins in length.  The experimental group (a) is prescribed 6-8 lumbopelvic-femoral exercises only that they do 5 reps held for 4 breaths each and done 2-3 times/day.  These are prescribed in a particular order based on whether they have pain on the left side, right side, or bilateral.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The traditional/comparison group (b) will wear a sacroiliac joint belt during waking hours every day, and perform transverse abdominus exercises in four positions:  supine hooklying, sitting, sit-tostand-to-sit, and standing, 5-10 reps with a 3 second hold each,  2-3 times/day, and additionally during each session: 10 mins of low back massage, 15 mins of electrical stimulation and heat.  Sessions will be administered one-on-one with a physical therapist.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible participants will be screened initially via phone for duration and location of pain, and prior treatment history by one of two investigators.  If initial inclusion criteria are met, the participant is scheduled for an appointment for one hour.   The PT then completes the special tests to see if the inclusion criteria are met.  Informed consent will be obtained by one of two physical therapists/investigators prior to treatment allocation.   Once eligibility is determined and informed consent received, an office worker will hand a sealed envelope to the treating physical therapist (concealed allocation) to reveal the participant's group assignment. </concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental group A:  thoraco-lumbopelvic-femoral exercises or the control group B:  using a random-sequence generator (random.com).  A research assistant has numbered envelopes and placed an index card indicating treatment group allocation to group A if an even number or group B if an odd number.  As participants enter the study the envelopes are opened beginning with envelope one and progressing until the study is complete.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Demographic indicators (age, sex, which side was affected, symptom duration) were collected at baseline. Primary outcomes included  oswestry disability index, and secondary outcomes included patient specific functional scale and numeric pain scale and were collected at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months.
To assess baseline differences between intervention and control groups on demographic information and outcomes, we will conduct independent samples' t-test for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. 
Repeated measures ANOVA with three time points for within and between group differences for outcome measures will be conducted to assess impact of the intervention.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of two different interventions for low back pain (specifically sacroiliac joint pain) and to compare the effects between intervention groups.  The hypothesis is that both groups will result in improvement in pain and function and that the experimental group (unique exercises only) will result in greater improvement than the comparison group (traditional exercises, belt, heat, massage and electrical stimulation).</summary>
