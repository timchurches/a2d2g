  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the the Phase 1 of cardiac rehabilitation, the treated group (TG) was carry out  cardiovascular physioterapy protocol (CPP)daily during 6 days, which included periods of rest in supine position, respiratory exercises and dynamic physical exercises performed in different positions (i.e., supine, sitting and standing). The progression of TG in CPP protocol was done based on the daily clinical evaluation of each patient.  The patients of TG were always instructed to rest quietly, breath spontaneously and remain awake during the resting conditions.  On the other hand, the exercise content of each day differed in body position, duration and intensity. Hereafter, in the 3rd stage, walking was gradually included and carried out at a constant rhythm. The walking intensity was set at 20 beats per minute above the standing resting heart rate. All experimental procedures were performed over 6 days in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) (two days) and the ward (four days) of the local Hospital. They were initiated 22 hours after the CCU admission. The study had the duration of six years (01/11/04 to 01/12/10)</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group (CG) daily protocol included 10 min of rest in supine position that was followed by 4 min of respiratory exercises. During the resting, the patients were always instructed to rest quietly, breath spontaneously and remain awake. The respiratory exercises were done in supine position and included diaphragmatic pattern and inspiration fractioned in three times. These respiratory exercises were only performed to avoid pulmonary complication that could appear due to bed rest and hospitalization. All experimental procedures were performed daily over 6 days in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) (two days) and the ward (four days) of the local Hospital. They were initiated 22 hours after the CCU admission.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effects of cardivascular physiotherapy phase I on heart rate variability (HRV) of post-AMI inpatients. The tools used by measure HRV were linear analysis (time and frequency domain) and non linear analysis ( detrend fluctuation analysis (DFA), power law scaling and  DFA spectral)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The mesurements of HRV were obtained daily for 6 days.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare linear and non linear analysis of HRV</outcome>
      <timepoint>The measurements of HRV for linear and nonlinear analysis were performed daily for 6 days during the supine resting before the begining of CPP.</timepoint>
