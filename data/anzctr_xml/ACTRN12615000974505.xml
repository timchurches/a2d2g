    <designfeatures>All women recruited will have an OGTT
Women with GDM will be randomised to referral or 'not for referral to GDM clinic' 
women without GDM will also receive the advice 'not for referral to GDM clinic' 
The delayed treatment group will therefore be hidden among normal 'decoys'
All women who have not been referred to the GDM clinic will have an OGTT at 24-28 weeks</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study.

Analyses will be by intention to treat with a per protocol sensitivity analysis.  Data analysis will involve computations of Fishers exact tests (for dichotomous outcome measures), Chi-square tests (for categorical data with &gt;2 levels) and ANOVA (for continuous measures).   Data will be described using 95% confidence intervals.   The SAP will include a priori protocols for withdrawal, distributional transformations, outliers, methods for handling drop outs, any model assumptions including incorporation of covariates into analyses and handling of multiple comparisons.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence that treating gestational diabetes (GDM) prior to 24-28 weeks gestation benefits babies or their mothers, and there is potential for harm through fetal undernutrition, inappropriately medicalising some pregnancies, and increasing overall clinical workload.  We are planning an RCT testing whether GDM treatment from &lt;20 weeks gestation (booking GDM) is associated with benefit or harm.  This pilot study aims to have midwives and women with GDM risk factors review the study plan and to pilot the study procedures.  The pilot is a full RCT of 100 women, 20 of whom are expected to have GDM.
