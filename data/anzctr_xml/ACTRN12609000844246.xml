  <interventions>
    <interventions>Carbon dioxide insufflation of the pericardial field intraoperatively which involves blowing carbon dioxide gas into the chest cavity only during the cardiac surgery operation via a tube. It will be continuously insufflated at 10 Litre/minute from the opening of the cardiac chamber until the closure of the cardiac chamber. This tube is connected to a device called CarbonAid gas diffuser device (K052125)</interventions>
    <comparator>The standard treatment for removing air from the cardiac chambers is mechanical deairing manouevres performed only during the operation. These manouvres are performed continuously before the aortic cross clamp is removed and may take 5 to 10 minutes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Neurocognitive impairment
-defined by scores on a battery of neurocognitive tests including Rey auditory verbal learning test, Trail-making A, Trail-making B and Grooved pegboard test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>-Once preoperatively
-Once postoperatively at 2 to 3 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Transoesophagel Echocardiography (TOE)
- intraoperative assessment of resdiual intracardiac air and gaseous emboli using an ultrasound probe which is routinely passed through the oesophagus during cardiac surgery operations to look at the heart</outcome>
      <timepoint>-Intraoperative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>S100B blood tests
- postulated surrogate marker for neurocognitive impairment
- 10mls sample of blood taken with routine blood tests after an operation which will be analysed in a pathology laboratory assay</outcome>
      <timepoint>-Preoperative
-Postoperative within 24 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>P300 Auditory Evoked Potential
- postulated surrogate marker for neurocognitive impairment
- similar to a EEG (Electroencephalogram) where brain waves are monitored to determine the latency of a P300 wave</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once preoperatively, once prior to discharge, and once 2 to 3 months postoperatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
