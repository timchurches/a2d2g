    <interventions>Doctors Working Well is an online program designed to target occupational stress and burnout. The intervention will consist of 6 online modules (each of approximately 30-45 minutes duration) that focus on stress management techniques, emotion monitoring and regulation techniques, and self-care. Participants will have access to one module per week over a six week period. At the start of each module they will also be asked to answer a small number of questions relating to their mood and engagement with skills learnt in the previous module.

Each module contains a mixture of didactic and interactive learning activities, such as readings, quizzes, videos, and personal reflections. Development of the program was led by a clinical psychologist with six years treatment experience, with input also received from two other research team members, who are both also psychologists. Intervention adherence will not be assessed as the program content will be delivered consistently across participants, due to the electronic format of the intervention. Participant adherence to the intervention will be assessed through examination of number of log ins, time spent using program, modules completed, and activities completed within each module. As a strategy to increase participant adherence, individuals will receive an automated email upon completion of each module, commending effort and completion. Participants will also be sent an automated reminder email if a module hasn't been completed within 2 days of it becoming available on the weekly cycle. </interventions>
    <comparator>An active control condition will be utilized, in which participants will be given one hour per week of protected individual study time, for the six week study period. After completing the three month follow up assessment, those participants allocated to the control condition will then receive access to the online program.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Multilevel statistical modelling will be used to analyse the data. The multilevel models will be fitted with the MIXED procedure in SPSS and alpha criterion set at .05. As such, data from all randomised participants will be used in analyses. Time (two levels, pre- and post-) will be entered with each outcome variable and the interaction term of each outcome variable x time. A similar set of analyses using multilevel modelling will be conducted to assess maintenance of treatment gains between post and follow up time points. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants will be randomly allocated to either treatment or control conditions. All participants will be asked to complete a number of pre-treatment questionnaires. These questionnaires will measure stress, burnout, resilience, mood, and related factors. Those participants allocated to the treatment condition will then be provided with access to the online intervention. The intervention will consist of 6 online modules (each of approximately 30-45 minutes duration) that focus on stress management techniques, emotion monitoring and regulation techniques, and selfcare.

Participants will have access to one module per week over a six week period. At the start of each module they will also be asked to answer a small number of questions relating to their mood and engagement with skills learnt in the previous module. Participants allocated to the control condition will not be given access to the intervention, but rather, will be given the equivalent amount of time each week as protected study time. At the end of the six week intervention period, and again three months following the intervention, participants will be asked to complete a small number of questionnaires measuring the same constructs as at pre-intervention, with the addition of a small
number of questions relating to satisfaction and experience with the program.</summary>
