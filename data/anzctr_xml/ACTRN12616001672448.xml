  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both control and experimental subjects will receive the standard pain management protocol (paracetamol 15 mg/kg QID, ibuprofen 5 mg/kg QID). In addition, the patients
will be provided with sucralfate (or placebo). The sucralfate solution will be made up to 2 grams in 50 mL of a 1:1 combination of ORA-Sweet and ORA-Plus (a proprietary drug suspension solution) while the placebo will consist of a 1:1 combination of ORA Sweet and ORA-Plus with no further additives.

After each set of doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol (four times a day), 5 mL of the study mixture will be gargled and swallowed by the child for the first seven days post-operatively.

Parents will be asked to report frequency of provision of each drug.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sucralfate has some weak evidence of being effective in the management of posttonsillectomy pain in paediatric populations. However, the current literature is limited.

For this trial, 170 children will be recruited preoperatively and randomised to either receive sucralfate or placebo solution. This will be in addition to the standard Monash Health posttonsillectomy analgaesia protocol. The children will gargle and swallow 5 mLs of the study mixture four times a day. Parents will be provided with a set of questionnaires to complete for each postoperative day, consisting of the parents postoperative pain measure, the functional limitation scale and the FACES pain scale  revised. They will also be asked about their childs quality of sleep, how much analgaesia the child has received, any contact with medical practitioners required, whether their child tolerates the study mixture and any side effects they notice.</summary>
