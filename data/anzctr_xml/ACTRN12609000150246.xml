  <interventions>
    <interventions>Resistance exercise at home 3 times per week (3 sets of 10-15 reps for each major muscle group) and 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week (eg, swimming, cycling, walking, or exercise step), usually 30 minutes per day over 5 days during the 12-week treatment phase.</interventions>
    <comparator>General Practitioners (GPs) in the control group will continue to treat patients with depression to the best of their knowledge and capacity. This will include, but not be limited to, use of antidepressants and counseling.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A project information and screening questionnaire pack will be posted to a random electoral sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 50 years and older residing in the Perth-metropolitan region. Those meeting criteria for a depressive illness will be invited to participate in the study and a medical consultation will be arranged with their GP to initiate treatment - allocation to either usual medical care (control) or medical care and physical activity (intervention) will be based on the randomisation of older people with depression by an independent researcher not involved with the study - research staff in contact with participants will be blind to the computerised central randomisation of participants' allocated treatment group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Permuted block randomisation will be used to allocate participants to the intervention (health promotion program of physical activity) or control group (usual care) by an independent academic. Blocks will vary in size from 4 to 10 participants.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and affects 5-15% of adults over the age of 65 years. Several currently available treatments for depression have proven efficacy, but up to 40% of people with depression fail to recover after a course of appropriate treatment. This, in turn, leads to increased long term morbidity and mortality, greater use of health services, and increased costs to the person with depression, his or her family and the community. Various sources of observational data and a few trials indicate that physical activity improves mood and promotes the remission of symptoms in older people with depression. We designed the present study to determine if a general practitioner mediated physical activity intervention for older adults with depression improves treatment response to usual antidepressant treatment and decreases the prevalence of depression over a 1-year period. The intervention has been designed for delivery to a large number of older people by being inexpensive, home based, and delivered via easily distributed and understood media for self management and monitoring. If successful, the intervention has the potential to influence how health promotion interventions are delivered through a general practice setting.</summary>
