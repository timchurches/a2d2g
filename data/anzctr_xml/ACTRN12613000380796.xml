  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm B is intervention: abdominal wall block by bolus administration of the local anaesthetic agent ropivacaine 0.2% every 6 hours until block is removed.
Boluses are 20mls of 0.2% ropivacaine through each catheter for bilateral catheters, and 40mls of 0.2% ropivacaine for unilateral catheters.

A maximum dose of 0.2% ropivacaine for intervention arm is 3mg/kg for each bolus dose.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm A is control, abdominal wall block by infusion of local anaesthetic.
Infusion is given via controlled infusion pump, using 0.2% ropivacaine at 5ml/hr for bilateral catheters through each catheter, and 0.2% ropivacaine at 10ml/hr for unilateral catheters. Infusionmay last up to 5 days post-operatively.

- Patient has received an epidural, spinal or other neuroaxial anaesthetic 
- Patient is under 18 years of age, or 
- Patient receives an operation that involves extra incisions outside the abdominal wall (such as abdomino-perineal resections), or 
- Patient has a known allergy or adverse drug reaction to local anaesthetic agents or morphine or fentanyl, or 
- Patient has a history of arrhythmia or long QT syndrome associated with the drugs used in this trial, or

    <statisticalmethods>Based on data from a randomised controlled trial just published looking at wound infusions for postoperative pain management in colorectal surgery patients which reported an FEV1  standard deviation of 0.5707 , it has been calculated that 50 subjects per group are required in order to detect what is perceived as a clinically relevant difference in FEV1 of 400ml per group (90% power, p&lt;0.05)
Assuming 20% dropout to follow up, recruitment is aimed at 120 patients to allow for a lost to follow-up or consent withdrawals.

Data analysis on the all data will consist of Chi Square and Fishers exact tests to compare categorical data. Continuous data conforming to a normal distribution will be compared using Student's T test.
Data that does not conform to a normal distribution will be analysed with the Mann-Whitney U-test for non-parametric data.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The study is trying to find out which is the best way to deliver a medication for pain relief called a local anaesthetic (a drug that helps to numb areas of the body e.g. the skin) to the abdominal wall in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery in order to help reduce the post-operative pain.</summary>
