    <interventions>Phase 1 study in healthy female volunteers involving 5 Cohorts 
ABI-1968
Single dose topical cream delivered topically to the cervix by intra-vaginal application via a single-use graduated applicator which delivers an approximate 2g dose.
Cohort 1: 0.01%,  Cohort 2: 0.03%, Cohort 3: 0.1%, Cohort 4: 0.3%, Cohort 5: 1.0% - by weight 
The study drug (or placebo) will be administered as a topical cream to the cervix by intra-vaginal application by the Gynecologist. 
This study is a dose escalation study meaning that the first cohort will receive the lowest dose of study drug. The dose of study drug will increase with each subsequent cohort. Results will be reviewed by a safety monitoring committee after each dose strength has been tested to make sure that it is safe to continue with testing in the next cohort. The next cohort will not be enrolled until the safety monitoring committee have confirmed it is safe to do so. The study can be stopped at any time, based on evaluation of the side effects of the study drug.
During this study, it is possible that the strengths may
be reduced, repeated or increased; however, 1.0 % is the highest dose that will be given.
Participants will not have a choice as to which cohort or dose level they are assigned (randomised) to,
with each cohort enrolled on a rst eligible basis. The participant and the study sta will not know if the
they are assigned to receive the active study drug or the placebo, although in an emergency the study staff can find out. The first cohort will have 2 sentinel volunteers; one will receive the active drug, the other the placebo. These individuals will receive the study drug (or placebo) approximately 24 hours before the rest of the cohort. Participants will be told if they are assigned to the sentinel cohort.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo topical cream containing Carbopol 974, Tefose 63, propylene glycol, light mineral oil, EDTA, methyl parabens, propyl parabens, sodium hydroxide and water, will be administered intra-vaginally by a designated Gynaecologist.   </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability will be measured by the frequency and severity of Adverse events, relationship of Adverse events to study drug, safety laboratory, vital signs and physical abnormalities and other safety parameters. 

In studies performed in rats and rabbits, multiple doses of topical cream at high dose strength caused inflammation and tissue irritation in the vagina and cervix.
In humans, irritation could possibly include vaginal itch, vaginal discharge, pain during or after intercourse, or pain on passing urine. 
In studies where ABI-1968 was administered systemically at levels multiple logs higher than what should be achieved after topical administration, high concentrations of ABI-1968 resulted in some genotoxicity (damage to the genetic information within a cell causing a mutation). It is expected that the genotoxicity profile of topically applied ABI-1968 to be comparable to metronidazole, a vaginal gel used to treat vaginal bacterial infections.

Participants will be monitored for genitourinary signs and symptoms, including evidence of vaginal and/or cervical irritation, erythema and oedema.  Adverse events and concomitant medications and information regarding coital history and any local adverse reactions in her partner will be collected.  Vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis results will be obtained periodically.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma concentrations of ABI-1968 will be determined at various intervals following ABI-1968 dosing, and PK parameters will be calculated, if measured concentrations allow.
Individual ABI-1968 concentration data will be listed and summarized by treatment group with descriptive statistics. 
Plasma ABI-1968 parameters will be determined using a non-compartmental analysis (NCA) approach.
The PK parameters time to maximum observed drug concentration (tmax), maximum observed drug concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC) from time zero to last measurable concentration (AUC0-last), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC8), apparent elimination half-life (t1/2), apparent terminal elimination rate constant (Kel), apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution at the terminal phase (Vz/F) (where data are sufficient for parameter determination) will be determined.
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be listed for each participant and summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of variation [CV%], median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and geometric CV%).
Additional statistical analysis will be performed if deemed appropriate. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study is testing the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (looking at the amount of drug in your blood to evaluate the way the body processes the drug) of ABI-1968 Topical cream delivered to the cervix by intra-vaginal application. 
In this study, a total of 40 participants will be enrolled over 5 dosing groups/cohorts with each cohort consisting of 8 people  6 will receive the active drug, and 2 will get placebo. Participants  will be randomly assigned to receive either the active drug or placebo (a dummy topical cream that looks identical, but contains no active drug). Participants will have a 75% chance of receiving study drug and 25% chance of receiving placebo. The study drug (or placebo) will be administered as a topical cream to the cervix by intra-vaginal application by the Gynecologist. No participant will be a member of more than one cohort.  
This study is a dose escalation study meaning that the first cohort will receive the lowest dose of study drug. The dose of study drug will increase with each subsequent cohort. Results will be reviewed by a safety monitoring committee after each dose strength has been tested to make sure that it is safe to continue with testing in the next cohort. The next cohort will not be enrolled until the safety monitoring committee have confirmed it is safe to do so. The study can be stopped at any time, based on evaluation of the side effects of the study drug.  The five different dose strengths planned for this study are 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 % by weight, applied as a topical cream via a single-use graduated applicator which delivers an approximate 2g dose. During this study, it is possible that the strengths may be reduced, repeated or increased; however, 1.0 % is the highest dose that will be given. 
Participants will not have a choice as to which cohort or dose level they are assigned (randomised) to, with each cohort enrolled on a first eligible basis. The participant and the study staff will not know if the they are assigned to receive the active study drug or the placebo, although in an emergency the study staff can find out. The first cohort will have 2 sentinel volunteers; one will receive the active drug, the other the placebo. These individuals will receive the study drug (or placebo) approximately 24 hours before the rest of the cohort. Participants will be told if they are assigned to the sentinel cohort.
