    <statisticalmethods>A power calculation was carried out with the assistance of a University of Otago statistician, Professor Peter Herbison.  Based on a 80% power and an a of 0.05, we need to recruit 22 women per group to be able to detect a difference of 15 mm in uterine cavity length between the groups.

Groups will be compared using a chi2 to establish:

1. A difference between cavity length in  breastfeeding versus non-breastfeeding women

2. A difference between cavity length in postpartum women and non-postpartum women  

3. A difference between fundal myometrial thickness in  breastfeeding versus non-breastfeeding women

4. A difference between  fundal myometrial thickness in postpartum women and non-postpartum women

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postpartum breastfeeding women have a higher risk of uterine perforation with insertion of an intrauterine contraception device (IUD). The mechanism for this is unknown, we hypothesize that a reduction in uterine cavity length is responsible for the increased perforation rate. Perforation is a serious complication, which requires surgery to remove the perforated IUD, resulting in a significant cost to the woman and the health service. Our objective is to compare uterine cavity length in exclusively breastfeeding women with non-breastfeeding women. A smaller sized cavity may explain the increased risk of perforation in breastfeeding women, leading to a change in practice. </summary>
