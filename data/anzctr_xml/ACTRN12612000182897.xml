  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated falciparum. The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) in Pursat, Kratie and Preah Vihear, and artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) in Pailin for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The WHO 42-day in vivo protocol was used. Patients with uncomplicated P.f malaria who met the study inclusion criteria were enrolled and treated on site with DP or ASMQ and monitored weekly for 42 days for P.f cases. The follow-up consists of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these assessments, the patients were classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the follow-up period were used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis were used to distinguish between a true recrudescence or reinfection. The results of this study are being used to assist the Ministry of Health of Cambodia in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.</summary>
