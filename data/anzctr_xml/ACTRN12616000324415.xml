    <interventions>Participants: Undergraduate students and Staff teaching in the EDUC2058 (Invasion Games) Phase 1 and EDUC2514 (Kinetics 1) Phase 2 courses in the BT(HPE / Primary)(Hons) program at the University of Newcastle will be recruited to participate (approximately 50 students Phase 1 and 100 students Phase 2). Those students with informed signed consent will complete assessments but all students in the course will complete the mandatory coursework in EDUC2058 and Educ2514.

Design: Quasi-experimental (Phase 1), GroupRandomised Controlled Trial (Phase 2)

PDA Program Phase 1:: EDUC2058 Invasion Games is a compulsory course in the BTHPE (Hons) program at the UoN and runs for 1 Semester  12 weeks (3 hours per week). During the first 8 weeks students will participate in a range of theoretical and practical tasks relating to the teaching of invasions games conducted by the usual University tutors (3 hours per week for one 12 week semester).. Students will be introduced to the concept of Peer Dialogue Assessment within tutorials and will be given the opportunity to develop their skills in stimulating dialogue to provide feedback on teaching performance throughout the course (ie learn to stimulate verbal discussion around the observed performance). The exposure to PDA will be embedded within 1-2 tutorial activities each week over the first 8 weeks of semester (approximately 15min per week). For example, the tutor will conduct a practical class activity and at the completion of the activity the tutor and students will discuss how they would conduct PDA and how to stimulate useful discussion for learning. In the final 4 weeks of the course, the students will be teaching invasion games in a local secondary school for 1.5 hours per week.. They will work in teams to teach and observe, and will be required to use PDA (all student are expected to complete approximately 10min) at the completion of each session to provide feedback to their team.

PDA Program Phase 2: This study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in EDUC2514 (Kinetics 1) at the University of Newcastle. This means that undergraduate students completing EDUC2514 will be randomized to the treatment condition (peer dialogue assessment (PDA)) or to the control condition (Written feedback (WF)). Participants in both treatment conditions will complete identical course work, learning activities and assessment tasks (as per the approved course outline) for one 12 week semester delivered by University tutors. Participants assigned to the PDA group will also be introduced to the concept of PDA within 1-2 teaching activities each week for the first 8 weeks, and will be given the opportunity to develop their skills in stimulating dialogue to provide feedback on teaching performance throughout the course. 
In the final 4 weeks of the course, participants will teach sport in a local primary school as a mandatory component of the EDUC2514 course. They will work in teams to teach and observe, and will be required to use either PDA or WF at the completion of each session to provide feedback to their team (all students will be expected to provide approximately 10min of PDA or written comments each week). Adherence will be monitored through the audio recordings and collected written documents.

Measures:
A purpose designed questionnaire will be completed by participants at baseline and at
3months. The A questionnaire will be designed based on previously published scales
(adapted to suit the teaching of PE and Invasion games) to determine participants:
1. Competence to Teach PE (Morgan &amp; Bourke, 2008)
2. Confidence to Teach Invasion Games (Hand, 2014)
3. Self-efficacy to teach (Tschannen-Moran &amp; Woolfolk Hoy, 2001)
Participants will be asked to audio record their peer dialogue sessions.
Participants will also be asked to provide feedback regarding PDA as an assessment tool for use in the undergraduate HPE and Primary programs. 

Participation in this research is entirely the student's choice and only a student who has given her or his explicit written consent will be included in the study. If a student does not agree to participate, they will complete the EDUC2058 or educ2514 course as usual but will not complete any of the assessments associated with this study (questionnaires). Participants may also withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason. A decision not to participate or discontinuation of involvement in the study will not jeopardise their relationship with the University of Newcastle or impact in any way on the progress in the course. Students will be given a face-to-face information session and a written information sheet explaining all of the details of the study (as per Newcastle University Ethics requirements)

</interventions>
    <comparator>Phase 1: No control group
Phase 2: Control Group (the control group will receive written feedback on their teaching performance from peers - written feedback will be in the form of qualitative comments based on the organisation and delivery of the teaching session)
Students in the course educ2514 will be randomised by class into either the intervention or control. The control group will complete the course as set in the University of Newcastle course outline.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of feedback has been shown to be important for learning. However, the feedback literature increasingly reports dissatisfaction among learners. University students are not only reporting that they do not receive feedback that is helpful for their learning but educators report the burden of giving feedback (that is often not used to improve performance). The use of Peer Dialogue Assessment (PDA) has been presented as a method of providing feedback for learners in the tertiary setting and has the potential to be a useful learning tool when used in teacher education programs. Peer Dialogue Assessment positions learners as active in seeking, generating and using feedback to improve or change their task performance. This method uses peers to initiate feedback in the form of 2-way dialogue (or discussion) after a performance and may serve to be a sustainable assessment for learning tool for use in teacher education programs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using PDA for improving pre-service teacher's perceived confidence and competence to teach physical education.The following questions will be addressed:
1. What experience do undergraduate students in the BT (HPE / Primary)(Hons) programs have with assessment of teaching performance at the UoN?
2. What impact does PDA have on student's perceived competence to teach physical
education?
3. What impact does PDA have on student's confidence to PE and Sport?
4. What impact does PDA have on student's self-efficacy to teach?
5. Did staff and students find the introduction of PDA in a pre-service physical education
course useful as a learning tool and for improving teaching performance?
It is hypothesised that confidence and competence of undergraduate students in the BT (HPE/ Primary)(Hons) will improve as a result of completing an undergraduate course with PDA embedded.
