  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the CBT condition receive 15 sessions of the Reasoning and Rehabilitation Programme for youth and adults with ADHD (R&amp;R2ADHD) twice weekly, each lasting 90 minutes. R&amp;R2ADHD is a structured, manualised programme that aims to decrease impairment of core ADHD symptoms and improve social, problem solving, and organizational skills.  It consists of five treatment modules (1) neurocognitive, e.g. learning strategies to improve attentional control, memory, impulse control and planning, (2) problem solving, e.g. developing skilled thinking, problem identification, consequential thinking, managing conflict and making choices, (3) emotional control, e.g. managing feelings of anger and anxiety, (4) pro-social skills, e.g. recognition of the thoughts and feeling of others, empathy, negotiation skills and conflict resolution, and (5) critical reasoning, e.g. evaluating options and effective behavioural skills.The program is run in small groups by two psychologist who have extensive experience in CBT and have been trained in the R&amp;R2ADHD program.  Additionally the participants will meet with specific coaches once a week during the 2 month intervention period for 30 minutes to review sessions and to support participants to transfer skills learned in the group into their daily lives. Assessment will be at baseline, at the end of treatment in about two months and at three month follow-up.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treament as usual control group (TAU).  The TAU condition will continue their medication treatment but other treatment will not be controlled for.  The TAU condition will not be asked to refrain from engaging in other interventions during the study period.  They will be assessed at baseline, at the end of treatment phase in about two months and at three month follow-up.  They will receive treatment after the follow-up (five months after baseline assessment).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous studies on psychological treatments for adults with ADHD show promise, especially regarding ADHD symptoms.  Information on treatment effectiveness for comorbid problems are mixed.  This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the R&amp;R2 ADHD cognitive behavioural group treatment which has been developed to treat ADHD symptoms and common comorbid problems. It is hypothesised that this treatment will show significant improvements in reducing ADHD symptoms and comorbid problems above medication treatment alone. It is also hypothesised that this effect will be maintained at follow-up.</summary>
