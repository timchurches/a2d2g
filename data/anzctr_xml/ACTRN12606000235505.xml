  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatment interventions aimed at improving ability to walk safely outdoors following stroke. This project is a pilot study that will compare the effectiveness of two physiotherapy interventions for regaining the ability to walk outdoors. The structured task practice is an evidence based approach focusing on repeated practice of the different tasks involved in walking outdoors, such as walking on slopes and crossing gutters. The alternative interventions are based on the Bobath Concept, a treatment approach that focuses on the development of postural stability to improve balance and walking function. Participants for the pilot study will be sought from patients who are currently undergoing rehabilitation (either inpatient or outpatient) following stroke and who have recently achieved the ability to walk with supervision indoors. Thirty participants will be recruited for the pilot study. Participants will have baseline assessments including the adapted six minute walk test, their walking velocity (over the central 6 metres of a 10 metre track), the time taken to ascend and descend a flight of stairs and scores on the Berg Balance Scale (an ordinal scale assessing ability to perform 14 balance tasks) by a blind assessor.  Participants will be randomised to either of the two interventions. Patients are blinded to which group they have been randomised.  Both interventions will require the participant to attend six one hour physiotherapy sessions over a two week period. In the structured task practice intervention, participants will practice activities such as walking on slopes, going up and down a single step, and walking on uneven ground. In the Bobath Concept intervention, the postural stability of the participant will be assessed and individualised treatment programs established, aimed at improving postural stability. These sessions will include activities in standing and walking to enhance standing balance, patterns of muscle activation and postural responses. The sessions will incorporate some task practice to a maximum of 1/6 of the treatment time. The baseline assessments will be repeated following the intervention stage.Analysis of the pilot data will enable accurate power calculations for a larger multi centre trial.</summary>
