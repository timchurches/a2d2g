  <interventions>
    <interventions>This prospective, double-blind, randomized, multi-center, and placebo-controlled, 2 parallel group phase II trial is to investigate the anti-angina effect of T89 at 187.5 mg, administered orally every 12 hours (daily dose 375 mg) for 8 weeks, while all other concurrent medications for angina pectoris are discontinued except short-acting nitrates (taken as required by patient), beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, in its ability to enhance exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Exercise Tolerance Tests (ETTs), Safety checks and frequency of Angina.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to determine the anti-angina effect of T89 in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris measured by the prolongation of Total Exercise Duration in ETT seen when performing a Standard Bruce Protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The change of Total Exercise Duration (TED) during ETT using the Standard Bruce Protocol, from baseline, at the time of trough drug levels on weeks 4 and 8, compared to placebo.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of T89 in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Change in TED during Exercise Tolerance Tests (ETT) at peak drug levels, using Standard Bruce Protocol, from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 compared to placebo. 

2. Change in time to onset of angina during ETT using Standard Bruce Protocol, from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 compared to placebo.

3. Change in time to 0.1 mV ST depression during ETT using Standard Bruce Protocol, from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 compared to placebo.

4. Change in frequency of weekly angina episodes, from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 compared to placebo.
 
5. Change in weekly on-demand short-acting nitroglycerin consumption, from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 compared to placebo.

6. Change in Quality of Life (QoL) assessment scores using Seattle Angina Questionnaire, from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 compared to placebo.

Specific angina and general medical history will be assessed and recorded for the following body systems: Skin; Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat; Respiratory; Cardiovascular; Genitourinary/Renal; Gastrointestinal; Endocrine/Metabolic; Neurological; Haematopoietic and Lymphopoietic; Hepatic/Bilary; Musculoskeletal; Psychiatric; Allergies; any other relevant history. Medical History will be recorded up until the first dose of study drug.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
On days -14, -7, 0, 7, 14, 28, 56, a thorough physical examination including vital signs (Blood Pressure and Heart Rate) will be carried out covering the following Body systems: General Appearance; Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat; Lungs/Chest; Heart; Abdomen; Musculoskeletal and Extremities; Neurologic; Vascular/Lymphatic; Skin; Genitourinary; Endocrine and Metabolic, any other relevant findings will be included. After the treatment has started, any new or changed physical examination finding will be noted as an AE on the appropriate CRF page(s). Whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in lieu of abnormal physical examination findings. Such abnormalities will be closely monitored to their resolution.
DIARY CARD RECORDING
History of number of weekly angina episodes and nitroglycerin consumption will be obtained on Days -14. Once patient has signed informed consent form and been issued the diary card at Day -14, the number of weekly angina episodes and nitroglycerin consumption will be obtained during the study on days -7, 0, 14, 28 and 56.
Also recorded in the patient diary card will be any Adverse Events experienced by the patient, any concomitant medications taken as well as confirmation of each study drug dose received.
ETT
The ETT will be completed according to the Standard Bruce Protocol. The Standard Bruce Protocol is as follows (Appendix 1): Six 3-minute stages starting at 1.7 miles/hour and 10% gradient, increasing to 2.5 miles/hour and 12% gradient, 3.4 miles/hour and 14% gradient, 4.2 miles/hour and 16% gradient, 5.0 miles/hour and 18% gradient and 6 miles/hour and 20% gradient. 
The study personnel will be instructed to refrain from communicating exercise times to the participating patients, for all examinations.
A supine standard 12 ?lead ECG will be obtained before each ETT, and standing ECGs will be monitored throughout the ETT.
VITAL SIGNS
Vital signs will be measured every 3 minutes during ETT and will include blood pressure and the heart rate. The HR will be recorded from the ECG recordings. Vital signs measurements will be obtained at days -14, -7, 0, 7, 14, 28, 29, 56 and 57. After the treatment start, any vital sign measurement determined by the investigator to be clinically significant will be noted as an AE on the appropriate CRF page(s). Whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in lieu of abnormal vital signs measurements. Such abnormalities will be closely monitored to their resolution.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
The 12-lead ECGs will include a diagnostic impression as well as measurement of heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc interval.  ECG will be performed at every visit.
SEATTLE ANGINA QUESTIONNAIRE
The Seattle Angina Questionnaire will be completed on days 0, 28 and 56. Patients will complete the questionnaire on a patient worksheet printed on NCR (No carbon required) paper. The top copy of the NCR paper will be part of the CRF, and the second copy will be left in the medical record.</timepoint>
