  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire Composite Score (OHQ) - The OHQ is the average of two sub-scales, the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment Scale (OHSA) and the Orthostatic Hypotension Daily Activities Scale (OHDAS). Each asks the patient to rate their symptoms or disease impact over the past week. The OHSA sub-scale is the average of six items: 1) Dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint or feeling like you might black out; 2) Problems with vision; 3) Weakness; 4) Fatigue; 5) Trouble concentrating; and 6) Head/neck discomfort. The OHDAS sub-scale is the average of four items: 1) Standing for a short time; 2) Standing for a long time; 3) Walking for a short time; and 4) Walking for a long time. Each item is scored on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe.
In this withdrawal design, a positive score indicates worsening during the double-blind randomized phase relative to value at randomization (on open-label drug). All patients are on open-label droxidopa for 3 months prior to randomization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Orthostatic Hypotension Daily Activities (OHDAS) Score - The OHDAS scale is the average of four items: 1) Standing for a short time; 2) Standing for a long time; 3) Walking for a short time; and 4) Walking for a long time. Each asks the patient to rate their disease impact over the past week. Each item is scored on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe.
Change: score at end of randomization minus score at randomization. In this withdrawal design, a positive score indicates worsening during the double-blind randomized phase relative to value at randomization (on open-label drug).</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Measurements 3 Minutes Post Standing - Change: standing systolic blood pressure at end of study minus standing systolic blood pressure at randomization.

      <outcome>Clinician Recorded Clinical Global Impression - Severity - The CGI-S is a 7 point scale ranging from a score of 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (severe symptoms). Patients were grouped according to OH severity at the end of the randomization period as follows;
Normal-Borderline OH (CGI-S 1-2),

      <outcome>Patient Reported Clinical Global Impression - Improvement - The CGI-I is a 7 point scale ranging from a score of 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), with no change in the middle, and assesses the improvement in relation to the baseline evaluation.
Patients will be grouped according change in disease as follows;
Very Much Improved to Slightly Improved (CGI-I 1-3),
No Change (CGI-I 4),
Slightly Worse to Very Much Worse (CGI-I 5-7).</outcome>
