  <interventions>
    <interventions>Collection of non-identified data from burn survivors. Data sets include:
1. Demographic data 
2. Injury/hospitalisation data including TBSA, length of stay, need for surgery
3. Mental health/trauma symptoms including post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, coping
4. Measurement of quality of life post-injury

Screening will be done at 2-4 weeks post injury and then every 3 months in the first year and then annualy for 5 years. Each screening visit on average takes between 30 minutes to 1 hour.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mental health sequelae following severe burns injury (PTSD, Depression &amp; Anxiety)

First measurement point will be from thr routine psychiatric assesment of each individual patient, which is part of standard care.

Measurements to be used:
1.	Demographic and medical details: A questionnaire that updates demographic details, records pain levels, drug and alcohol use and current health care utilisation. This form is completed by members of the research team utilising data linkage to participants medical records.

2.	Mental health disorders screening form: The Consultation Liaison psychiatry team screens burns patients and this information on current absence/presence and type of mental health disorder is recorded

3. ABCDSelf Report, revised (ABCD-SRR): A short self-report scale that identifies an adults attachment style hat predicts aspects of outcome and can help formulate treatment. It was revised to be shortened on the basis of results from the groups Adjustment to Burns study.

4. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Schedule (DASS): a valid and reliable self-report measure for symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. As depression is often a sequel of trauma and post-traumatic symptoms, we wish to track these symptoms in our cohort as well as anxiety and a measure of subjective stress. This is self reported by the participants.

5.Impact of Event Scale (IES): This  15-item widely used self-report questionnaire is a reliable measure of subjective posttraumatic stress to a traumatic or stressful life event . This is self reported by the participant.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 months in the first year post injury and then annually for 5 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Coping and adjustment to Severe Burns Injury

Measurements to be used:
1. COPE :a valid and reliable self-report questionnaire measure of coping style. As coping style impacts on recovery from burns and avoidant strategies markedly impact on recovery,we wish to track this and other coping strategies that  may impact on the recovery of our cohort.

2. DS-16: A self-report questionnaire that identifies a type of personality style with high negative affect and reduced use of social coping. This is included for the recognition of an at risk group, suggested in our recent work.
	
3. Relationships Questionnaire (RQ): This questionnaire describes how patients feel in close relationships and predicts aspects of psychosocial symptoms as confirmed in our recent work.
4. Measure of Alcohol use (AUDIT) ie to measure alcohol use as a way of 'coping'</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 months in the first year and then annually for 5 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life after a severe burn injury.
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B), which measures quality of life post burns will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Quality of life will be assessed at one single timepoint between 12-18 months post injury. Some flexibility of time will be required, given the varrying timepoints participanst return at this time post injury. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Return to work  
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B), which looks at return to work and adjustment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Return to work will be assessed at one single timepoint between 12-18 months post injury. Some flexibility of time will be required, given the varrying timepoints participanst return at this time post injury.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>We will aim to analyse the data set and data cohorts over time looking at predictors of post-traumatic symptoms, depression, anxiety and quality of life parameters, using regression and logistic regression models. We aim to recruit the majority of SBIU patients and follow them longitudinally. In terms of recruitment, we are aiming for close to full screening of target group, which is all patients admitted to the Severe Burns Injury Unit at Royal North Shore Hospital. Historically this is an average of 200 patients a year. We plan to recruit all patients admitted, in the first year 200, in the second year 400 and the third year 600. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to measure and track the psychosocial consequences of a severe burn injury in terms of its impact of patients mental health.

Screening all severe burns injury patients admitted to the Severe Burns Injury Unit will offer all patients the opportunity for outcome tracking and collect the necessary extensive  cohort data on which to base future treatment, policy and advocacy as well as a targeted study on early intervention for PTSD. 

Burn patients are at risk of developing this disorder, which is associated with increased rates of medical morbidity, poor health-related quality of life, and functional impairment. It is important to note that primary care, rather than specialty mental health services, has been  the point of contact with the health care system for the majority of individuals with PTSD.

Improving detection of PTSD, adverse coping styles and depression are important steps in addressing the health and mental health burden experienced by these patients.
