  <interventions>
    <interventions>The exercise training  will be individualised for each participant based upon the cardiopulmonary exercise testing and three-repetition maximum test. Each participant will complete two supervised exercise sessions by an accredited exercise physiologist (4+ years experience sports medicine/oncology) for 60 minutes and one unsupervised home-based exercise each week for approximately 100 minutes. Participants will perform the exercise training at Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute Specialist Clinic gymnasium and will be instructed to perform the aerobic exercise training program (32 minutes) and the resistance training program (28 minutes).  The aerobic training program consists of interval stationary cycling beginning at 70% of their peak oxygen consumption (as determined by the cardiopulmonary exercise testing) measured in workload (watts) and progressed each week for 12 weeks. The resistance training program will consist of 4-5 exercises, 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions with a 30 second recovery in between each set. The load (kilograms) and intensity will start at 60-70% of one-repetition maximum and increase by 10 percentage each week. Both programs will follow a periodisation method that accounts for chemotherapy related fatigue, sickness and illness, specifically during the week of chemotherapy administration. 
At home, participants will complete continuous walking at a moderate intensity (55%-70% of VO2peak) for 100 minutes. 


Adherence will be monitored. The accredited exercise physiologist completes clinical notes after each session (exercise training sheet, exercise diary). Each participant will complete a total of 24 sessions (supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist) and 12 unsupervised sessions)

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: We recently used exercise CMR to demonstrate that peak-exercise EF% reduced 7.1% in 14 athletes after an endurance sporting event (p&lt;0.0001) whilst resting EF% was unchanged. In moderate-sized cohorts (n=49) of breast cancer patients resting EF% may be reduced post anthracycline therapy but we anticipate that exercise CMR is more sensitive. Anticipating a reduction in peak exercise EF% of 7% and a 50% attenuation of this effect with the exercise intervention (ie. EF reduced by 3.5% during exercise) would be identified with 95% power with 12 subjects in the intervention and control groups. Accounting for the possibility of 15% attrition we will increase this sample to 30; 15 exercisers and 15 controls. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the effect of exercise training on heart function in breast cancer patients undergoing Anthracycline based chemotherapy and to evaluate the use of exercise Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, a novel imaging technique.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are between the ages 18 and 70 years old, have been diagnosed with breast cancer and are scheduled for Anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

Study details
Participants can chose which group they wish to join.
Participants can select the intervention group where they will follow a personalised exercise program 2 times per week for 60minutes at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes institute and one home based (unsupervised) session for 100min for the duration of their Anthracycline chemotherapy. Whilst participants who elect to be in the control group will not follow an exercise program but are encouraged to exercise at their discretion. All participants will undergo an echocardiogram, VO2 max test and exercise Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) at baseline and 3 weeks after the last anthracycline treatment cycle. The exercise CMR is a novel technique hypothesized to aid in earlier diagnosis of heart failure. Participants will pedal a specially adapted cycle while lying in the narrow tube of the MRI machine.
