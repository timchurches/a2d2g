  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of Lens Fit Characteristics - At the screening visit, the following baseline measurements will be taken of the subject's habitual contact lenses (Control):
Visual Acuity (logMar)
Over-refraction with Visual Acuity
Fit acceptability (acceptable/non-acceptable)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 40 minutes of wear time</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of Inter-Changeability - In a bilateral fashion, the subject will wear Test/Control lens according to a pre-designed randomization schedule. Immediately upon insertion, the following variables will be assessed:
Ease of handling of the lenses- by Investigator
Comfort on insertion
After 30-40 minutes of settling time the following variables will be collected:
Subjective comfort after settling
Visual Acuity (logMar)
Corneal coverage (Y/N)
Post-blink movement (mm)
Version Lag (mm)
Tightness on push-up (0-100 scale)
Overall fit acceptance (0-5 scale)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 40 minutes of wear time</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of fit or Vision Differences - In a bilateral fashion, the subject will wear Test/Control lens according to a pre-designed randomization schedule. Immediately upon insertion, the following variables will be assessed:
Ease of handling of the lenses- by Investigator
Comfort on insertion
After 30-40 minutes of settling time the following variables will be collected:
