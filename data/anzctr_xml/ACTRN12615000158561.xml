  <interventions>
    <interventions>We plan to enrol 60 patients (30 treated with normal saline and 30 treated with plasmalyte) and to use base excess during the first four days of intensive care admission as the primary outcome.

Eligible patients will be aged 18 years or greater, admitted to the intensive care unit and require fluid resuscitation.

Patients will then receieve either the study fluid either (a)  intravenous normal saline 0.9% or (b) intravenous plasmalyte 148) from the time of enrollment in the intensive care unit until discharge from the intensive care unit.  All other clinical care decisions and management decisions will be those of the patient's treating clinical team.

    <comparator>Patients are their own controls and will receive only 0.9% normal saline or Plasmalyte 148 as a blinded study fluid.  Both study fluids are considered standard care in Australian intensive care units.</comparator>

    <concealment>Once the clinician decides that fluid resuscitation is needed, the sealed envelope will be opened and the treatment fluid number will be made available to the treating team. 

The team will then obtain the bag of blinded study fluid with the corresponding number from a 10 litre batch of fluid with the same study number.  Thereafter, all fluid resuscitation and all crystalloid fluid therapy will be performed with such blinded fluid until discharge from ICU. 

If more than 10 litres of fluid are given, the patient will be allocated by the research co-ordinator to a second batch of fluid containing the same type of fluid thus maintaining blinding of treating doctors, nurses and of patient.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be conducted using a computer-based randomisation program and sealed envelopes.  A member of the research office, not involved in the study will be responsible for performing the randomisation and creating the opaque sealed envelopes.

Randomization will be in permuted blocks. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: normal saline or Plasmalyte. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Our hypothesis is that the acid-base effects of saline are greater than Plasmalyte and that the base excess will be different between the two groups with greater metabolic acidosis (more negative base excess) with saline therapy. 
Using data from previous studies, we estimate that a sample size of 27 patients in each group, will have a statistical power &gt; 0.9 at an alpha of 0.05, if we assume a standard deviation of 2 mmol/L base-excess for each group. We plan to include 30 patients in each arm to allow for any errors in randomization or other factors that might invalidate inclusion. 

Analysis will be on intention-to-treat.

Adjusted analyses will be performed using Poisson regression for binary outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes.  Baseline covariates will include presence or absence of trauma (based on APACHE-III admission diagnosis), age, ICU admission source, APACHE-III score, and baseline serum creatinine level.  Survival times will be compared using log-rank tests and presented as Kaplan-Meier curves

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The administration of intravenous fluid is a common intervention in acutely unwell patients.  Although normal saline has been the dominant crystalloid fluid worldwide for more than century, at present, intensive care specialists in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) broadly regard all intravenous crystalloid solutions, including normal saline and plasmalyte as equivalent. They will administer one of these two fluids for resuscitation or rehydration according to personal preference or clinical judgment in the absence of evidence that one is superior to the other in terms of clinical outcomes.  

Before definitive multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trials can be performed, pilot studies are necessary to guide their optimal execution. Such pilot work makes it possible to assess the following crucial aspects of trial execution: feasibility of study design, degree of biochemical and physiological separation achieved with study interventions, safety of study approach, likely recruitment rate, likely effects, likely amounts of fluids used per patient, and power calculations. 

Accordingly, we propose to perform a pilot multicenter randomized double-blind controlled trial to compare the feasibility, safety, biochemical and physiological effects of treating patients requiring fluid resuscitation with either normal saline or plasmalyte. On the basis of previous comparative data, we plan to study 60 patients (30 treated with saline vs. 30 treated with plasmalyte) and to use base excess during the first 4 days (when most of fluid administration takes place) in ICU as the primary outcome measure.
