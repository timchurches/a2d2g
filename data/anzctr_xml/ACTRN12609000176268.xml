  <interventions>
    <interventions>Chronic , randomised, parallel study where twenty six overweight and obese middle-aged women were randomized into the control group or the pedometer group.At baseline, both groups were then given the National Australian Physical Activity Guidelines. At baseline, information from these guidelines such as intensity, duration, prompts for exercise (ie, stairs or elevators) and relapse prevention etc were reviewed with the subjects in both groups. The pedometer group was also encouraged to reach a daily step goal of 10,000 steps/day for 12 weeks. The pedometer group was allowed free acess to their pedometers to record and observe their steps on a daiy basis.   No step goals were set for the control group for 12 weeks.  The control group wore sealed pedometers and did not have access to their pedometers on a daily basis for 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group was not able to record their steps on a daily basis, whilst the pedometer group, were asked to record the number of steps on a daily basis for 12 weeks. The control group wore a sealed pedometer for 12 weeks and therefore had no knowledge of their record of steps/day. Total steps were recorded on a weekly basis (steps/week) on a calendar.At baseline, the control group were then given the National Australian Physical Activity Guidelines. At baseline, information from these guidelines such as intensity, duration, prompts for exercise (ie, stairs or elevators) and relapse prevention etc were reviewed with the subjects.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcomes was to measure ncreased physical activity in the form of pedometer steps.The pedometer group wore an unsealed pedometer. Hence they were able to open, observe and record their number of steps performed throughout the day. Participants in the pedometer group were instructed to record accumulated steps/day on a calendar and to reset the pedometer to zero each day. The control group wore a sealed pedometer for 12 weeks and therefore had no knowledge of their record of steps/day. Control groups was asked to record their total steps on a weekly basis (steps/week) on a calendar. The control group were then asked to reset the pedometer to zero each week and seal the pedometer with tape.</outcome>
