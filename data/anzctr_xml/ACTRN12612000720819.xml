  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients and support persons randomly allocated to the experimental group will be provided with access to a web-based program designed to provide effective communication, decisional support and adjustment. The website provides tailored information on a range of topics including information about diagnosis, treatment options, what is involved in each treatment, side effects, self-management strategies, impact of cancer on day to day life, available support, complementary and alternative therapies. Patients will be able to access the website at their own discretion using iPads provided by the research team.  The intervention will also include access to a telephone helpline staffed by an experienced cancer nurse. Participants will be able to call the helpline during work hours and may leave a voicemail message after hours. The intervention will be available to experimental group participants for a period of 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients and significant others allocated to the usual care group will receive care normally provided by their health care team. This may vary across hospitals, however will generally involve discussion of treatment options between the clinician and patient and the provision of written information booklets.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patient sample: Eligible patients will be: aged 18 years or older; English speaking; and newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Burkitt lymphoma, Lymphoblastic lymphoma (B or T cell), Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, potentially making a decision regarding treatment; have a life expectancy of 2 months or more as judged by their clinician; and able to provide informed consent. Support person sample: Eligible support persons will be aged 18 or older, able to provide informed consent, and considered by the patient to be an important source of support in relation to the demands of their cancer diagnosis and treatment. It is very likely that most support persons will be healthy participants however the physical health status of support persons will not be directly assessed and is not the focus of the present research.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Non-English speaking participants, participants under the age of 18, and people with an intellectual or mental impairment have been specifically excluded from the research. Participants under the age of 18 have been excluded as they are unable to give informed consent. While it would be of interest to include non-English speaking participants, they have been excluded due to anticipated difficulties in responding to the written survey and using the website intervention which will be produced in English only. Given informed consent is required as well as completing surveys and accessing web-based information (for the intervention group), people with an intellectual or mental impairment have also been excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Recruitment will be carried out by clinicians during their first consultation with newly diagnosed patients. Clinicians will be asked to inform patients about the study, provide an information statement and seek informed written consent. 

For consenting patients, their participant ID, contact details and date of enrolment into the study will be recorded. Data about non-consenters will also be recorded (Record age, gender, type of cancer and time since diagnosis).

Randomisation to experimental groups: Patients and SPs who agree to participate will be block randomised by week by the clinician during their first consultation. To assist with this process a calendar outlining which weeks correspond to each condition will be provided to the clinician. Allocation is not concealed.

For patients allocated to the experimental condition, clinicians will complete a brief online form to create a user ID for the patient and support person to access the web program, and provide the patient with printed information about how to access the web program. Consenting patients will also be given an information sheet and consent form to give to their SP.

Support persons will be formally enrolled into the study and their information recorded when their completed consent form has been received by the researchers via post (a self-addressed reply paid envelope is provided to support persons along with the study information). Consenting support persons are allocated to the same study arm as the patient they are supporting.</concealment>
    <sequence>Consenting participants will be block randomised, with week as the unit of analysis. Randomisation will occur as a consequence of a computer-generated random list.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Key challenges faced by patients with cancer and their families include coping with a potentially life threatening disease, making decisions about cancer treatment, and managing the side effects of cancer and its treatment. In particular, those diagnosed with haematological cancers may be at high risk for psychosocial distress. Communicating treatment options, the likely impact of treatments, preparing patients for cancer treatments and providing them with information about how to manage side effects of treatment are likely to be key to helping patients and their families cope with a diagnosis of cancer. The purpose of this study is to examine whether an integrated approach (including access to a web-based program and nurse-delivered telephone support) to helping haematological patients with key psychosocial challenges is effective in reducing depression, anxiety, and unmet information needs among patients and their support persons. Participants will be assigned to either a 12-week period of accessing a web-based program designed to provide effective communication, decisional support and adjustment via research staff-provided iPads, or your usual standard of care normally provided by your care team. Who is it for? 10 tertiary referral hospitals that treat at least 15 patients per year will be invited to participate. In order to be eligible for this trial, you will need to be aged 18 years or older; English speaking; newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Burkitt lymphoma, Lymphoblastic lymphoma (B or T cell), Diffuse large b cell lymphoma, potentially making a decision regarding treatment; have a life expectancy of 2 months or more as judged by their clinician; and be able to provide informed consent. This study will also include participation by a sample of support persons, where each patient will be asked to nominate a designated support person. Eligible support persons will be aged 18 or older, able to provide informed consent, and considered by the patient to be an important source of support in relation to the demands of their cancer diagnosis and treatment. Trial Details Consenting eligible patients will be consented into the study by the clinician in their first consultation. Each patient will be given an information statement and consent form to pass onto their nominated support person. Patients and support persons will then be block randomised by week to either the experimental or usual care group. Experimental group: Patients and support persons randomly allocated to the experimental group will be provided with access to a web-based program designed to provide effective communication, decisional support and adjustment. The website provides tailored information on a range of topics including information about diagnosis, treatment options, what is involved in each treatment, side effects, self-management strategies, impact of cancer on day to day life, available support, complementary and alternative therapies. Patients will be able to access the website through iPads provided by the research team. The intervention will also include access to a telephone helpline staffed by an experienced cancer nurse. Usual care: Patients and significant others allocated to the usual care group will receive care normally provided by their care team. Follow-up: Patient and support person follow-up surveys will be completed at approximately 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-recruitment into the study.</summary>
