  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - RAD001(Everolimus)

Experimental: Everolimus with 5-azacitidine - Everolimus increasing oral doses days 5-21 each cycle 5-azacitidine 75mg sub cutaneously 7 doses in 21 days


Treatment: drugs: RAD001(Everolimus)
In this study, 5-azacitidine will be administered sc for 7 doses over 9 days in a 28 day cycle. Everolimus will be administered orally with the first dose starting on day 5 (first Friday) of each cycle and continued until day 21 of each cycle. Patients will be treated with combined azacitidine + Everolimus for a minimum of 6 cycles and until at least 2 cycles after documentation of CR. Upon cessation of azacitidine, the patient will be permitted to take Everolimus maintenance therapy until progression at the investigator's discretion.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main goal of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RAD001 in combination
      with low-dose cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy.
      The secondary goals are to investigate the likely causes of drug response or failure.</summary>
