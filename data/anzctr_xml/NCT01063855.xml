Experimental: Dapoxetine + PDE5I - Dapoxetine 30 mg to 60 mg tablets 1 to 3 hours before sexual activity prn (as needed) not to be taken more than once every 24 hours for 12 weeks + a PDE5I (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor) prescribed prior to study entry for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo + PDE5I - Placebo tablets identical in appearance to dapoxetine taken 1 to 3 hours before sexual activity prn (as needed) not to be taken more than once every 24 hours for 12 weeks + a PDE5I (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor) prescribed prior to study entry for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.


Treatment: drugs: Placebo

Treatment: drugs: Dapoxetine
30 mg to 60 mg tablets 1 to 3 hours before sexual activity prn (as needed) not to be taken more than once every 24 hours for 12 weeks.

Treatment: drugs: PDE5I (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor)
Patients were to be using a stable regimen of a PDE5-I (i.e., sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil), as reported by the patient for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) for at least 3 months before screening and up to 12 weeks during treatment in the study.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Average Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time (IELT) at Week 12 - The intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) is the time it takes for a man to ejaculate during sexual intercourse (as measured by stopwatch). The data below show the average IELT measured in minutes at Baseline (before treatment) to Endpoint (after 12 weeks of treatment). In this study, patients took placebo or dapoxetine along with a stable dose of a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5I) prescribed prior to study entry for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Patients Reporting At Least a 2-category Increase in Control Over Ejaculation - The Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP), a patient-reported outcome measure was used to rate the patient's control over ejaculation on a 5-point scale from "Very poor, Poor, Fair, Good, to Very Good." The percentage of patients who reported at least a 2-category increase in control over ejaculation is provided in the table below.</outcome>

      <outcome>The Percentage of Patients Who Achieved 1-category or Greater Decrease (Improvement) in Personal Distress Related to Ejaculation - The Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP), a patient-reported outcome measure was used to rate the patient's level of distress related to the speed of ejaculation on a 5-point scale from "Very poor, Poor, Fair, Good, to Very Good." The percentage of patients who achieved 1-category or greater decrease (improvement) in personal distress related to the speed of ejaculation is provided in the table below.</outcome>

      <outcome>The Percentage of Patients Reporting At Least a "Better" Response to Treatment - The "Clinical Global Impression of Change" (CGIC) was used to assess the degree of improvement the patient experienced with premature ejaculation (PE) since initiating treatment with study drug on a 7-point scale from "Much worse, Worse, Slightly worse, No change, Slightly better, Better, to Much better". The percentage of patients who reported improvement in PE of at least "better" at Endpoint (after 12 weeks of treatment) is provided in the table below.</outcome>
