    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Shockwave Coronary Rx Lithoplasty® System

Experimental: Lithoplasty System - Shockwave Coronary Rx Lithoplasty® System is a lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilation of calcified, stenotic de novo coronary arteries prior to stent placement


Treatment: devices: Shockwave Coronary Rx Lithoplasty® System
The Shockwave Coronary Rx Lithoplasty® System is a proprietary balloon catheter system designed to deliver localized, lithotripsy-enhanced, balloon dilatation of calcified, stenotic, de novo coronary arteries. Energizing the lithotripsy electrodes will generate pulsatile mechanical energy within the target treatment site and will disrupt calcium within the lesion and allow subsequent dilatation of a coronary artery stenosis using low balloon pressure. The system consists of a rapid exchange balloon catheter with integrated, internal lithotripsy electrodes and a Shockwave generator.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety - Frequency of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 30 days of the procedure. - MACE defined as:
Cardiac death
MI - defined as a CK-MB level &gt; 3 times the upper limit of lab normal (ULN) value with or without new pathologic Q wave
