  <interventions>
    <interventions>TinT is a group parenting program  held weekly for two hours per week over a period of 6 weeks (total of six sessions). Using a structured manual, the program was delivered by two of the program authors (Ann Harley and Christiane Kehoe). Co-leaders were volunteers who were mental health professionals or psychology graduates and were trained in the Tuning in to Kids program (Havighurst &amp; Harley, 2007). Parents  of Grade six children learned skills in emotional competence and were taught how to respond to their children's negative emotions. Parents also learned how to respond with empathy and how to manage rejection and facilitate their child's emotional autonomy.  The method used included psycho education, mindfulness techniques, emotion awareness and regulation strategies, and role plays. Parents and their Grade six children completed questionnaires pre and post intervention, and the following year when the child was in their first year of secondary school (Term 2, Grade 7).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group took part in a questionnaire study on the transition to high school. Parents and their Grade six child completed identical questionnaires to the intervention group. Questionnaires were collected when the child was in Grade six and again, the following year when the child was in their first year of secondary school (Term 2, Grade 7). The control group did not receive an intervention.</comparator>
