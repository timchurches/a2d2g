    <summary>This is a Phase 1 Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and
      Pharmacodynamics of AMG 596 in Subjects with Glioblastoma Expressing Mutant Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor Variant III (EGFRvIII). This is a first in human (FIH), open-label,
      sequential-dose-escalation study in subjects with EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma. This study
      will enroll 2 groups of subjects according to disease stage, recurrent disease (Group 1) and
      maintenance treatment after SoC in newly diagnosed disease (Group 2).</summary>
