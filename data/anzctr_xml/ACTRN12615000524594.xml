  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be assigned to Arm 1 or Arm 2 depending on their clinical diagnosis and then randomised to the control or intervention group.

Arm 1: clozapine-treated people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).
Intervention group: once weekly exenatide subcutaneous injection (2mg) delivered by a mental health or trial nurse for 24 weeks. Exenatide will be administered in addition to current glucose lowering agents. Note: For participants in the intervention group who are already on a sulfonylurea (SU) and have a HbA1c equal to or below 7.5%,  their SU will be ceased to avoid hypoglycaemia.  If the participant's HbA1c is between 7.5% and 8.5%, the dosage of the SU will be halved to avoid hypoglycemia. For participants in the intervention group who are on a SU and have a HbA1c of &gt;8.5% the dose of the SU will be maintained.
Control group: treatment as usual; no placebo

Arm 2: clozapine-treated obese people (BMI greater than or equal to 30kg/m2) without diabetes.
Intervention group: once weekly exenatide subcutaneous injection (2mg) delivered by a mental health or trial nurse for 24 weeks. Exenatide will be administered in addition to current glucose lowering agents.
Control group: treatment as usual; no placebo</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Schizophrenia has a lifetime risk of 7.2 per 1000 persons with 25-50% of people with schizophrenia failing to respond to typical and atypical antipsychotics. For these people clozapine is the gold standard treatment, however, clozapine greatly increases the risk of weight gain and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) which contribute to cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. Current interventions against antipsychotic-associated metabolic dysregulation are limited and insufficient. The mechanism of action for metabolic abnormalities associated with clz is not completely understood; however, recent pre-clinical models have shown that clozapine causes acute deficits in glucose metabolism. This occurred via suppression of glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels and these defects could be overcome by treatment with a GLP-1 agonist. Exenatide, a GLP-1 agonist, is available in a once weekly injectable formulation which is practical for this population with poor adherence. Therefore, in consideration of the promising preclinical data, the use of exenatide, which is already known to improve glycaemic control and reduce body weight in subjects with and without T2DM, may represent an effective therapeutic intervention for clozapine-associated obesity and T2DM. 

Therefore, the present study is a 24-week investigator-initiated, parallel group, randomised, open-label pilot study designed to evaluate the acceptability of exenatide weekly and determine the preliminary clinical efficacy and tolerability of exenatide for weight loss and glycaemic control in clozapine-associated obesity and T2DM. This study also has exploratory objectives to examine the feasibility of recruitment, retention, assessment methods and implementation of this intervention for subsequent larger scale, multicenter studies.
