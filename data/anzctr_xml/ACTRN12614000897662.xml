      <outcome>Comparing different foot complaints of high heeled shoe wearers and non high heeled shoe wearers. Biomechanical assessment via :The Manchester Hallux Valgus grading system is a simple 4-level grading system of the first metatarsophalangeal joint for hallux valgus, first acknowledged by Garrow et al. This 4 Grade (A-D) system proved to be valid with a high inter-rater repeatability and kappa-type 0.86. This Manchester Scale is highly regarded due to its convenience in application, with no specific measurement instrument requirement or radiography: The Ankle Lunge test has been used to assess ankle dorsiflexion in a weight bearing position. The Lunge test proved to have excellent intra rater intra class correlation coefficients (ICC) ranging from 0.97-0.98 with inter rater ICC as high as 0.97 for both distance and angle measurements. :Jacks Test is a clinical assessment tool of the flatfoot deformity, specifically assessing the break at the naviculo-cuneiform joint which commonly occurs in flat footed individuals. Also referred to as toe-raising test, the great toe is maximally dorsiflexed when the patient weight bears on both feet.
EMED Plantar Pressure measurements. The EMED system is an in-floor pressure measurement platform which subjects walk over. :Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index to identify various types of pain and prevalence of pain in the elderly population. Manchester Foot Pain and Disability index (MFPDI) is a 17-question survey assessing the foot health, functional limitation and pain.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aims to identify the prevalence of foot pathologies in a female population of persistent high heel footwear users compared to those who do not regularly wear high heel footwear. We seek to identify if there is a correlation between the persistency of high heel footwear use  (how many years, how many hours per day) against the severity and number of foot pathologies versus those who use non high heel footwear. 


We hypothesize that the prevalence of foot pathologies (such as hallux valgus, metatarsalgia, hyperkeratosis, neuroma, digital deformity) in a female population who are habitual high-heel wearers will be significantly higher compared to non-high heel wearers.</summary>
