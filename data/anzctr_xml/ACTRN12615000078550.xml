  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Bioequivalence study conducted in healthy volunteers comparing two formulations of ibuprofen with no health condition or problem studied. 

Although this study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the condition to which the medicine is used, ibuprofen belongs to a class of medicines called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). It is used to relieve pain and inflammation in conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis of the spine, swollen joints, frozen shoulder, bursitis, tendinitis, tenosynovitis, lower back pain, sprains and strains. It can also be used to treat other painful conditions such as toothache, pain after operations, period paid and headache, including migraine.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multiple dose, crossover over study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of ibuprofen (1 x 800 mg) on five occasions and the innovator formulation of ibuprofen (1 x 800 mg) on five occasions with each dose seperated by a 10 day washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of ibuprofen.

On study days 1-5 subjects will receive 5 daily doses of one formulation (either the test or innovator) and on study days 15-19 they will receive 5 daily doses of the other formulation (either the innovator or test). 

Each dose (1 x 800 mg) will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.

Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose.

On study days 1 to 4 and 15 to 18 subjects will report to Zenith Technology for dosing and the provision of one blood sample. They will then be given a light breakfast to consume following each dose at home.

On study day 5 and 19 no water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose) and are required to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance can be monitored and for 24 hours after dosing.

    <comparator>Mulitple dose, crossover over study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of ibuprofen (1 x 800 mg sustained release) on five occasions and the innovator formulation of ibuprofen (1 x 800 mg sustained release) on five occasion with each dose seperated by a 10 day washout period. The comparator/control for this trial is the innovator formulation of ibuprofen.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of ibuprofen (as summarised by AUC0-t(ss), Cmax(ss) and Cmin(ss)) for the two formulations. All plasma samples will be assayed for ibuprofen using a fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-dose samples on study days 1 to 4 and 15 and 18 and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5,  9.0, 9.5,  10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 20.0 and 24.0 hours on study days 5 and 19</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) and the elimination half life (t1/2). Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points. T1/2 = 0.693/Kel where kel is the terminal elimination rate constant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-dose samples on study days 1 to 4 and 15 and 18 and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5,  9.0, 9.5,  10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 20.0 and 24.0 hours on study days 5 and 19</timepoint>
