  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthma outcomes are poor, despite effective medications. Patients are often satisfied with their asthma despite poor control; this satisfaction with their level of control is reported to their GP, and therefore there is often no driver towards an increase in medication. 
Asthma control assessment by GPs is currently subjective; GPs are more likely to recognise the need to change treatment if they use an objective measure
The Asthma Control Test (ACT) score is a simple, objective measure of asthma control, not commonly used by New Zealand GPs 
ACT scores of less than or equal to 19 reflect poorly controlled asthma and scores greater than or equal to 20 reflect controlled asthma.

The aim of the study is to see if a simple asthma "Step-Up" regime based on the objective ACT Score improves asthma outcomes</summary>
