  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Fixed Flexion - Total fixed flexion is defined as the sum of the fixed flexion contractures of the two joints receiving treatment. Change in fixed-flexion contracture is measured in degrees where a decrease of 100% would correspond to a reduction in contracture to 0 degrees</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Total Range of Motion - The total range of motion is the sum of the range of motion measurements of the two treated joints. Range of motion is defined as difference between full flexion angle and full extension angle expressed in degrees.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subject Satisfaction With Treatment - At the Day 60 follow-up visit, each subject will be asked to rate his/her satisfaction with treatment as follows:
Very Satisfied
Quite Satisfied
Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied
Quite Dissatisfied
Very Dissatisfied</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Investigator Assessment of Improvement With Treatment - At the Day 60 follow-up visit, the investigator will determine the degree of improvement in the severity of the subject's treated finger(s) compared with screening as follows:
Very Much Improved
Much improved
Minimally Improved
No Change
Minimally Worse
Much Worse
Very Much Worse</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Success by Joint Type - Clinical success is defined as a reduction in fixed flexion contracture to 5° or less 30 days after injection of AA4500.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days after injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

          6. Not have any clinically significant medical history or condition(s) that would, in the
             opinion of the investigator, substantially increase the risk associated with the

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Received surgery (fasciectomy or surgical fasciotomy) and/or needle
             aponeurotomy/fasciotomy on the selected joints to be treated within 90 days before the
             first injection of AA4500

          2. Has a chronic muscular, neurological, or neuromuscular disorder that affects the hands

          3. Has a known systemic allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of AA4500

          4. Has received any collagenase treatments (eg, Santyl® ointment and/or XIAFLEX/XIAPEX)
             within 30 days before injection of AA4500

          5. Is currently receiving or plans to receive anticoagulant medication or has received
             anticoagulant medication (except for = 150 mg aspirin daily and over-the-counter
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) within 7 days before injection of
             AA4500)

          6. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other medical condition, which in
             the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the
             study

          7. Is known to be immunocompromised or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

          8. Has a history of illicit drug abuse or alcoholism within the year before injection of
             AA4500

         11. Has any clinically significant medical history or condition(s), including conditions
             that affect the hands, that would, in the opinion of the investigator, substantially
             increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in the protocol or
             compromise the scientific objectives of the study
