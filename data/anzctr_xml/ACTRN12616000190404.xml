  <interventions>
    <interventions>three different techniques were used for circumcision:
Group 1: Bone Cutter with Thermal Cautery... the technique started by holding the skin by two hemostat was done to elevate the foreskin then application of the bone cutting forceps at the level of skin to be removed for circumcision. Cutting the excess foreskin was done using the heated thermal cautery. the skin was retracted proximally after cutting the excess foreskin to expose the glans. it usually takes 3-5 minutes.
Group 2: will be circumcised using Gomco clamp. the procedure involves placement of special metal device formed of 2 parts; the first one cover the glans to protect it and the second one applied pressure at the line of supposed to be incised then removal of the excess skin was done. it usually takes 5-10 minutes.
Group 3: will be circumcised using Plastibell device. its use involves the placement of a clear plastic ring over the glans, followed by trimming of the excess skin during a surgical procedure, and the device falls off within 3 to 7 days.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>postoperative pain:
Postoperative analgesia (Acetaminophen 40 mg/kg/dose) was prescribed only on demand if the baby was continuously crying and refusing feeds.
parents were told to record how many times they gave analgesic each day for the first three days separately, and then, if there was still need for analgesia after these three days until the first postoperative clinic visit 1 week later. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>cosmetic outcome
will be done by a blinded peer assessment by evaluating 4 items
1- Glans ulceration or injury	(Absent	or Present)
2- Length of mucosal cuff	     (3  5 mm or	&lt; 3mm  or  &gt; 5mm)
3- Length of penile shaft skin	(Appropriate	or Excess skin or under skin)
4- Peno-scrotal &amp; peno-pubic angles	(Preserved or not preserved)

</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>postoperative complications e.g. bleeding, infection, urinary retention 
by reviewing the medical records </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>parent satisfaction
it will be assessed by asking the parent to give a score from 0 to 4
Parent satisfaction score Interpretation:
0	Unacceptable
1	Bad
2	Fair
3	Good
4	Excellent
  </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>intraoperative details; operative time in minutes, intraoperative bleeding, glans injury (composite secondary outcome)
assessment was done by reviewing the records of the operative notes.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>this prospective randomized trial was conducted on 150 babies presented for routine circumcision. They were randomized and equally allocated into 3 groups; babies circumcised using the bone cutter forceps with thermal cautery (Group I), Gomco clamp 'Registered Trademark' (Group II) and the Plastibell device 'Registered Trademark' (Group III). Intraoperative details, postoperative pain and complications, cosmetic outcome, and parent satisfaction were recorded</summary>
