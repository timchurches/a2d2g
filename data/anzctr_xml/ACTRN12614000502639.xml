  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 2 - Local infiltration analgesia and placebo femoral nerve block.
Arm 3 - Combined femoral nerve block and local infiltration analgesia.

Local Infiltration Analgesia:
The drugs infiltrated into the joint will comprise: 150ml 0.2% ropivacaine (Arm 2), 130ml 0.2% ropivacaine plus 20ml normal saline (Arm 3). 1ml 1:1000 adrenaline (Arm 2 and 3). 30mg ketorolac (Arm 2 and 3). 

Prior to implantation of the components, the posterior capsule will be infiltrated with the mixture. The synovium over the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in the notch as well as the medial and lateral collateral areas will be infiltrated. Following implantation of the new joint further injection into the capsule and over the anterior aspect will be conducted. The fat pad, which is richly innervated, will also be injected. Further infiltration will be carried out subcutaneously prior to skin closure, followed by injection into the joint as a bolus of any residual mixture.

Femoral Nerve Block:
Performed post induction of anaesthesia with the aid of ultrasound identification of the femoral nerve.
Injection of 20ml normal saline (Arm 2), or 20ml 0.2% ropivacaine (Arm 3) around the nerve, with a pool of drug/placebo administered immediately adjacent to either the posterolateral or anterior aspects.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be identified by a clinical nurse consultant (orthopaedics) as being eligible for the study, around the time of their operating theatre booking, based on the set inclusion and exclusion criteria.
A cover letter from the Principal Investigator will express an invitation to participate in the trial and will refer the patients to the Patient Information and Consent Form (PICF). This letter and PICF will be mailed in the same pack as the standard letter/information pack relating to the surgery itself. 

Patients will be given time to consider the information (1-2 weeks), after which they will be contacted by the Principal or Associate Investigator or a trained research assistant doctor by telephone to discuss all aspects of the trial and answer any questions. Informed verbal consent would be gained at that point. Informed written consent will be gained upon admission to hospital for the TKR, by either the Principal or Associate Investigator.
Once consented, patient’s names are placed on a randomization sheet and are allocated to group A,B or C, which correspond to the three study arms. Based on their allocation, the non-investigator clinical nursing staff will prepare the drug pack for the patient’s TKR prior to the operation. The pack will be left in the theatre medication fridge with the patient’s name, date of birth, address and UR number on it. The pack will then be retrieved by the anaesthetist immediately prior to the operation. The drug packs for the three arms will appear identical, ensuring blinding of the study. Once all data for the study has been collected, the un-blinding form which has been held by the Operating Theatre Nurse Unit Manager will be sent to statistician appointed to analyse the data.

    <sequence>Randomisation will be by a blocked permuted randomisation method, producing codes for participants, and selection based on the randomisation sequence. Randomisation will be performed by an independent statistician.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed using a propriety statistical package (STATA version 12.0). Data will be organised and trends reported using standard descriptive statistics e.g. mean (SD), median (IRQ) and/or proportions. More detailed inferential analysis will be done using either standard comparative (Mann-Whitney) or regression techniques that take into account the non-normal and/or categorical nature of data. All data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis. Where appropriate, the level of significance will be set at P&lt;0.05.

A minimum sample size per group of 21 was calculated using a student T test with a two tailed hypothesis. This was based on an intention to detect differences between groups of 1 point on the numerical pain score, with a standard deviation of 1.1, a statistical power level of 0.8 and a p-value of 0.05. Previous studies have suggested that a change in pain score of 1 is significant. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Total knee replacements (TKRs) are one of the most painful orthopaedic procedures and are associated with a protracted recovery period. 

Multiple techniques are utilised for pain relief and these include femoral nerve blocks (FNBs) and high volume local infiltration analgesia (LIA), the superiority of either is largely contentious. 

This study aims to assess the differences in several outcomes for patients undergoing total knee replacement using single shot FNBs and LIA. This is a prospective, blinded, single centre randomised controlled trial at Nambour General Hospital, in Queensland, Australia. 

Ninety (90) patients having TKRs will be sought during their visit to the Pre-Anaesthetic Evaluation Unit (PAEU) and assessed against the eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria are patients who consent to participate in the study; ability to comprehend pain scoring and ability to use PCA machine; elective primary unilateral TKR performed at NGH; American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status I-III; and patients aged 18-85 years. The exclusion Criteria are patients who lack capacity, or are unwilling, to consent to the study; patients with pre-existing chronic pain syndromes; patients with opioid tolerance (opioid consumption &gt;30mg oral morphine or equivalent per day; chronic gabapentin or pregabalin analgesic therapy; patients with known contraindication, allergy, intolerance or previous reaction to any of the drugs being administered; inability to walk independently prior to TKR; Body Mass Index &gt;40 kg/m2; patients &lt;18 years of age; patients who are pregnant; and patients who have dementia.

Participants will be randomly selected using a blocked permuted randomisation method for Arm 1  Single Shot FNB and placebo LIA, Arm 2  LIA and placebo FNB, or Arm 3  Single Shot FNB and LIA. The trial will be double-blinded. 

The trial looks to determine how explanatory variables (FNB, LIA) relate to total opiate consumption and highest pain scores in the immediate post-operative recovery period and at 4/12/24/48 hours (4/24/48 hours for pain scores) post-operatively and at hospital discharge, time to Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and hospital discharge, and time to mobilisation (outcome variables).
