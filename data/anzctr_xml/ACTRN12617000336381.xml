  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of OSA will undergo overnight sleep study (polysomnography, PSG) with simultaneous high density EEG recordings of brain activity before and after 3 months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. CPAP is the current gold-standard treatment for OSA. Participants will follow the routine clinical care pathway: this includes 1) mask fitting and CPAP education session in the afternoon followed by an overnight in-lab CPAP titration study that night, then follow up care with the CPAP Educator to monitor adherence either in person or over the phone during the treatment period approximately at weeks 2, 6 and 12 weeks after initiating treatment . 
No parameters of the treatment are determined based on participation in this study. Study participants undergo CPAP treatment as prescribed by their treating physician .</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate changes in neurophysiological, clinical, cognitive and physiological outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea following 3 months of standard clinical treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 
 
We aim to evaluate differences pre-to-post treatment for the following outcome variables:

i) Changes in electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power and waveform features (e.g. sleep spindles, K complexes, slow waves) as measured by high-density EEG recording equipment. Quantitative EEG analysis techniques will be applied to all sleep and wake recordings after identification and exclusion of artefacts. Sleep stage specific power spectra, SWA, sleep spindle characteristics and scaling exponents from detrended fluctuation analysis will be quantified. Regional analysis of high density EEG data will be performed through EGI Netstation software, PhiTools PRANA and MATLAB software. 


ii) Sleep macroarchitecture (e.g. total sleep time, sleep efficiency, arousals, apnea hypopnea index, etc.) as measured by polysomnography (PSG). All PSG variables will be scored by an experienced sleep technician using PhiTools PRANA software.

iii) Performance on neurocognitive measures of memory, attention, working memory and executive functioning. Raw scores and standardized z-scores based on age and education normative data will be calculated.

iv) Heart rate variability analysis will be conducted using PRANA using an all-night ECG signal recorded during overnight PSG
 
v) Subjective ratings of mood and sleep as measured by self-report questionnaires. 

Data entry will be performed by suitably qualified staff, supervised by the study manager. Statistical tests will be paired t-tests to examine at pre and post treatment changes in outcomes measures. Associations between sleep physiological measures and cognitive/mood outcomes will also be explored with correlational analyses.
 
Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS.

This is a small pilot study. It is not a clinical trial. We aim to recruit 12 participants for pilot data and feasibility in order to inform potential larger trials.

    <summary>This research study which will investigate the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on brain wave activity recorded using high density electroencephalography (EEG) in patients diagnosed with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The study will examine changes in sleep and wake brain activity profiles and how these may relate to neurobehavioural function including memory following CPAP treatment.</summary>
