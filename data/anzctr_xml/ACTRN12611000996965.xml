  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a major public health problem in Australia. The incidence increases with age and an estimated 10-25% of men and women over the age of 55 years are affected.  The ageing Australian population will see an increase in the prevalence of PAD and consequently the national annual health expenditure on cardiovascular disease is likely to increase, greatly exceeding the 5.4 billion dollars spent in 2000-01. PAD is preceded by endothelial dysfunction, show an increase in inflammatory markers and failing of the circulation in affected limbs. EPA and DHA have been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory effects within the blood vessel wall thus reducing the amount of potent inflammatory markers produced. They also exert anti-thrombotic effects thus increasing the flow of blood within vessels. Dietary supplementation with fish oil rich in n-3 PUFA has been shown to positively impact on vascular function in the setting of atherosclerosis. It is known that there is a heritable basis to PAD, however, little is known whether improvements in endothelial function can be achieved in asymptomatic children of those with established PAD using n-3 PUFA. Early detection and intervention using a non-invasive, readily available, affordable and acceptable supplement such as fish oil has the potential to improve clinical management and prevent or delay the onset of those at high risk of developing symptomatic PAD.

The aim of this study is to implement a 12 week, moderate dose fish oil intervention (10ml/day containing ~1.5g EPA and ~1g DHA), that will result in clinically and statistically significant improvements in terms of:
a)	Endothelial function; 
b)	Inflammation; 
c)	Lipid status (Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, TG); and 
d)	Omega 3 Fatty Acid levels.</summary>
