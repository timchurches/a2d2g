  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve attending and completing a 3 - 5 night residential admission to an early parenting centre with a baby between 3 - 5 months old.  This is an observational study of an ongoing intervention and will involve follow-up assessments of participants at 6 and 12 months postpartum.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be existing standard primary care available to all families with infants.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participation in the intervention compared to the control will be associated with a reduction from 25% to 10% in prevalence of maternal depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders at 12 months postpartum.  This will be assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) administered at 12 months postpartum with prevalence comparisons made between the intervention and the control arms of the study.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The controlled before-and-after study of 284 mother-infant dyads will test the effectiveness of residential early parenting services to reduce postpartum maternal depression and improve infant behaviour.  Mothers scoring 10 or above on the EPDS, a screening instrument for depression and reporting behaviour disturbance in their infants will be recruited from immunization clinics for the control and from residential early parenting centres for the intervention groups.  Maternal mood and infant behaviour will be re-assessed using standardized psychometric measures at infant age 6 months and again when the baby is aged one year.  It is hypothesized that the treated group will have lower one year postpartum rates of maternal depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders and infant behaviour disturbance than the control group receiving routine care.</summary>
