  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Early treatment failure - danger signs or severe malaria on day 1, 2 or 3 in the presence of parasitaemia; parasitaemia on day 2 higher than on day 0, irrespective of axillary temperature; parasitaemia on day 3 with axillary temperature great than or equal to37.5 degrees celsius; parasitaemia on day 3 greater than or equal to 25 percent of count on day 0.  
Late treatment failure: danger signs or severe malaria in the presence of parasitaemia on any day between day 4 and day 28 /42 in patients who did not previously meet any of the criteria of early treatment failure; presence of parasitaemia on any day between day 4 and day 28/42 with axillary temperature  greater than or equal to 37.5 degrees celcius  (or history of fever) in patients who did not previously meet any of the criteria of early treatment failure. 
Late parasitological failure: presence of parasitaemia on any day between day 7 and day 28/42 with axillary temperature 
great than 37.5 degrees celsius in patients who did not previously meet any of the criteria of early treatment failure or late clinical failure
The day a patient is enrolled and receives the first dose of medicine is designated day 0. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made twice a day (12 hourly) until parasite clearance, and then on day 7, and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28. Clinical reassessment will be sufficiently thorough to ensure patient safety and will include assessment not only for potential treatment failure but also for potential adverse reactions to the medicine. Additionally, blood films will be obtained whenever parasitological reassessment is requested by the clinical staff.</outcome>
