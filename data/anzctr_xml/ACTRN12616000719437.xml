    <interventions>Ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane blocks will be performed in pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section with spinal anesthesia. Total of 60 women between 18 and 45 years of age with an ASA risk status of I-II and undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia will include in this study. Patients will divide into two groups as follows: those who receive postoperative TAPB under ultrasound guidance (Group TAPB, 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine administered on each side, bilaterally, total dose: 40 ml) by consultant anesthetist, and those who do not receive postoperative TAPB (Group C). Also, all patients will provide patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol at first 24 hours(loading dose of 20 mg, with a lock-out time of 10 minutes and basal infusion rate of 20 mg/hour) </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After obtainment of ethics committee approval and written informed consent from patients, a total of 60 women between 18 and 45 years of age with an ASA risk status of I-II and undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia will include in this study. Patients will divide into two groups as follows: those who receive postoperative TAPB under ultrasound guidance (Group TAPB, 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine administere bilaterally), and those who will not receive postoperative TAPB (Group C). Also, all patients will provide patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol (loading dose of 20 mg, with a lock-out time of 10 minutes and basal infusion rate of 20 mg/hour). In order to assess the level of postoperative analgesia, VAS scores will record with 5-minute intervals after entry into the recovery room and at postoperative 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Also record will the tramadol doses at recovery and at postoperative 24 hours. Patient satisfaction will asses postoperatively at 24 hours. </summary>
