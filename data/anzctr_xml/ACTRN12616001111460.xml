  <interventions>
    <interventions>The proposed intervention is a computerized attention training program called 'The Training Attention and Learning Initiative' (TALI). TALI was designed to develop core attentional processes. The program consists of four activities that target the core attentional processes; such as selective attention, sustained attention, and executive attention/attentional control. TALI is colourful, interactive, and has the capacity to automatically adjust task difficulty to cater for the learning of each child. The TALI software monitors each participant's use by regularly and automatically uploading each participants' deidentified scores. 

In the proposed research, TALI is to be used by children on an electronic 'touch' tablet for 20 minutes a day, 5 times a week, over a 5 week period. The program is to be used by children in the school classroom environment. </interventions>
    <comparator>The proposed research will involve participants being randomly allocated to either the intervention condition, an active control, or a passive teach as usual control group. The two control conditions are described below:

1.	Active control condition
Participants randomly allocated to this condition will complete an active control condition whereby they will be required to use an alternative software package. The alternate software uses the same interactive guides and inbuilt rewards as TALI but was developed to involve minimal attention skills and is non-adaptive. 

2.	Teach as Usual condition
Participants randomly allocated to this condition will not undergo any form of intervention and will continue to have classes continue as usual.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Primary measure is proposed to be the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch; Manly, Robertson, Anderson, &amp; Nimmo-Smith, 1998).  The TEA-Ch assesses the ability of children to selectively attend, sustain their attention, divide their attention between two tasks, switch attention from one task to another, and withhold (inhibit) verbal and motor responses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Attention will be assessed at the baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 6 months post-intervention time points.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Working Memory abilities will be assessed using four subtests from the Automated Working Memory Assessment (AWMA: Alloway 2007),  a standardised, reliable and valid PC-based assessment designed for ages 4-22 years. Verbal working memory will be estimated by two subtests: (i) Digit Recall, which requires the child to immediately repeat progressively longer sequences of digits presented verbally and (ii) Backward Digit Recall, which requires the child to recall progressively longer sequences of digits in the reverse order to that presented. Visuospatial working memory will be estimated by two subtests: (iii) Dot Matrix, which requires the child to repeat progressively sequences of dots appearing on a 4 x 4 grid and (iv) Mister X, which requires the child to remember and mentally manipulate progressively longer sequences of visually presented information (a cartoon person holding a ball in one of eight compass points). This will show whether cognitive training transfers to improvement on non-trained working memory tasks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Working Memory will be assessed at the baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 6 months post-intervention time points.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Vocabulary will be assessed using The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test  fourth edition (PPVT- 4; Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007) was used to assess receptive vocabulary skills.   Children are presented with a series of pictures and asked to identify a word specified by the examiner by pointing to the corresponding image, from a choice of four pictures.  Participants responses were recorded and the experimenter progressed through each trial until discontinue criteria was met (8 or more incorrect errors in a set of 12 trials).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Vocabulary will be assessed at the baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 6 months post-intervention time points.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mathematical abilities will be assessed using The Test of Early Mathematics Ability III (TEMA-III; Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 2003) was used to assess a wide range of mathematical abilities, such as numbering skills, counting, number comparisons, calculation skills and understanding concepts.  This measure contains 72 items and the experimenter progressed through these items until discontinue criteria was met (5 consecutive incorrect responses).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Mathematical abilities will be assessed at the baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 6 months post-intervention time points.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>General cognitive ability will be estimated using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test - Second Edition (KBIT-2: Kaufman &amp; Kaufman 2004), a standardised, reliable and valid assessment designed for 4-90 years. Two subtests yield a Verbal Scale: (i) Verbal Knowledge, which requires the child to point to the picture that best illustrates a word or answer to a general knowledge questions about the world that becomes increasingly difficult and (ii) Riddles, which requires the child to listen to riddles that become increasingly and point to the picture from a set of options that answers the riddle. One subtest yields a Nonverbal Scale: (iii) Matrices, which requires the child to look at a picture or design with a piece missing and point to the piece from a set of options that would complete the picture. An IQ score is calculated based on the Verbal and Nonverbal Scales.</outcome>
      <timepoint>General cognitive ability will be estimated at the baseline time point only.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parents and the class teachers of participants will be administered the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD symptoms and Normal behaviour (SWAN). The SWAN is a measure of inattention and hyperactivity. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Behavioural Parent and Teacher measures of attention will be assessed at the baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 6 months post-intervention time points.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Outcome data will be screened, cleaned and analysed to determine if children who received the TALI program showed significantly greater improvements in cognitive and academic skills compared to children who received the control program or no program. Performance on each of the outcome measures will be assessed across each of the three time points and across each of the three groups using regression analysis. This type of analysis allows us to assess if childrens performance improves over time but also if a particular group has significantly greater improvements over time. 

A priori power analysis using G*Power indicated that there was a 83% chance of detecting a medium effect size on our outcomes measures with a total sample of 36 children (n=12 in each of the groups) and a  80% chance of detecting a small effect size with a total sample of 201 children (n=67 in each of the groups).  Based on these calculations and the feasibility of recruiting children to be involved in the trial, a total sample of 120 children (n=40 in each group) was deemed adequate to detect small to medium effects on the outcome measures.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ability to concentrate and stay focused on a task, to switch attention between tasks, to inhibit impulsive responding, and to mentally hold and use information are critical skills for learning and academic outcomes.  The development of these skills is especially important in early childhood. In Australia around 10% of children (approx 400, 000) have attention difficulties. As of 2011 approximately 11% of children worldwide (6.4 million) have been diagnosed with clinical attention deficits. Attention difficulties are particularly prevalent in children with developmental disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Currently the primary treatment for attention deficits is stimulant medication such as Ritalin. There is an urgent need for effective non-pharmacological interventions for young children.

We propose a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a computerized attention intervention in boosting core attentional skills, academic outcomes and behaviour in young typically developing children and children with ASD.  The intervention is a computerized training program (TALI Train) developed at Monash University by Dr Kirk and Prof Cornish.  TALI has been shown to improve attention and numeracy skills in a randomised controlled trial including young children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  The proposed trial will provide information on the potential of this program for broader populations and will also assess the feasibility of embedding this intervention into the classroom.  

Aim 1: To investigate if the TALI Train program is effective in promoting short term improvements in trained skills such as attention in young children with and without autism spectrum disorders (4 to 8years, IQ&gt;75).

Aim 2: To investigate if the TALI Train program is effective in promoting short term improvements in untrained skills such as executive functions (e.g. working memory), academic skills and behaviour in young children with and without autism spectrum disorders (4 to 8years, IQ&gt;75).

Aim 3: To evaluate whether any improvements in trained or untrained skills are maintained 6 months after the intervention.

It is hypothesized that children will a) show improvements in trained skills such as attention immediately after training and b) show improvements in both trained and untrained skills, in particular academic skills, at the 6 month follow up.
