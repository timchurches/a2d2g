  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in insulin sensitivity measured by euglycaemic glucose clamp - The clamp will be used to measure insulin sensitivity. The clamp is initiated by an intravenous bolus injection of insulin (9milliUnit/kg). Insulin is then constantly infused at a rate of 40 milliUnit.m-2.min-1 for 120 min into an arm vein, whilst glucose is variably infused to maintain euglycaemia. Plasma glucose values will be monitored every 5 minutes during the clamp and the variable infusion rate of glucose is adjusted to maintain blood glucose at a constant value of 5mmol/L.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in markers of endothelial dysfunction - This is done using non-invasive peripheral arterial tomography (PAT; endothelium-dependent digital pulse amplitude testing (EndoPAT), Itamar Medical Ltd, Israel), which records continuous plethysmo¬graphic signals of the finger arterial pulse wave. Finger plethysmographic probes are placed on each index finger; and after a 5 min equilib¬ration period, a blood pressure cuff on the non-dominant arm is inflated to 60 mmHg above systolic for 5 min and then deflated to induce reactive hyperaemia. Measurements of post-occlusion changes (reactive hyperaemia PAT: RH-PAT) are continued for 10 min. Results are normalised to the non-occluded arm, compensating for potential systemic changes (RH-PAT ratio).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Acute Insulin Secretory Response - Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test - This will be measured in response to 25g intravenous glucose and calculated as the average incremental plasma insulin level from the third to the fifth minute after the glucose bolus.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure - Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured using an automated oscillometric measurement system (Dinamap, USA) after a 30 minute rest.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 14 weeks</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether carnosine supplementation in overweight/obese
      individuals can improve insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance by decreasing sub
      clinical inflammation.

      The investigators hypothesise that carnosine supplementation will reduce type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular risk factors by lowering chronic low-grade inflammation (CLI), oxidative
      stress, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and advanced lipoxidation end products
      (ALEs).

      Aim :To determine the capacity of carnosine supplementation to decrease major risk factors
      for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and identify metabolic pathways involved,
      specifically by:

        1. Reducing diabetes risk (insulin sensitivity; secretory function and glucose tolerance)

        2. Improving cardiovascular risk factors (lipids; arterial (aortic) stiffness; central
           blood pressure (cBP); endothelial function).

        3. Decreasing the CLI, oxidative stress, AGEs, and ALEs, and increase detoxification of
           reactive carbonyl species (RCSs).</summary>
