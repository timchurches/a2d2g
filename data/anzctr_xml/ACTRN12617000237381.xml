  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of the trial is to demonstrate the feasibility to evaluate Deep Inhalation Breath Hold (DIBH) countrywide as demonstrated in patient compliance and reproducibility of set-up.

The trial is a two-arm study assessing the feasibility of DIBH during Radiotherapy treatment: the intervention group corresponds to left-sided breast cancer patients whereas the control group corresponds to right sided breast cancer patients. 

Left sided breast cancer patients who do not proceed to treatment with DIBH will be included in the assessment. A control group is included to compare the reproducibility of set-up between participants treated with/without DIBH and compare resource requirements. 

 Patients will undergo DIBH (provided they are able to hold their breath in a reproducible and consistent manner for a long enough period, which is approximately 10 to 15 seconds). Participants with left-sided breast cancer will undergo breathing training if applicable. 

There is no prescribed breathing training for participating centres as we would like to capture clinical practice. Breathing training will also depend on the equipment used to guide DIBH. The type of breathing training that is provided by the site will be captured prior to the commencement of the trial. 

Most centres would provide training and according to informal discussions, this is between 20min and one hour. The training is most likely performed by radiation therapists who also oversee and conduct the planning CT scans for the patient. RTs are a registered profession. It is also common that patients undergo a practice session prior to the CT scan where they take breaths under observation in the same way as during treatment but without either imaging or treatment delivery.

When performing the DIBH, patients are asked to take a deep breath prior to radiation delivery. This is likely to move the heart away from the high dose region aimed at breast tissue (or chest wall) thereby reducing dose to the heart. Patients will perform DIBH at every radiation delivered over the five weeks. 

Each participant will complete and anxiety assessment before receiving standard of care radiotherapy treatment as per their institution's guidelines. All participants will have daily electronic portal imaging (EPI) taken during the first week of treatment and then weekly EPI for 5 weeks. During the 3rd week of radiotherapy treatment, the participants with left-sided breast cancer will complete another anxiety assessment.

As part of the trial, patients will have two planning CT scans: Free breathing and DIBH. The scheduling of the two scans is left to department practice. Patients in the control group will only have the standard CT scan used for treatment planning.

Patient follow-up will be as per institution's practice.</interventions>

      <outcome>Primary Outcome - Feasibility of DIBH

Feasibility will be determined by three factors:
1. Favourable DIBH plan: The difference in the geometric relation between heart and target volume in free breathing and DIBH which will be assessed in the direct comparison of treatment plans developed for the two CT scans acquired for the trial. DIBH plan will be considered favourable if the target volume DVH parameters can be assumed to be clinically non-inferior, the lung DVH is better or clinically unchanged and the mean heart dose is reduced.

2. The ability of patients to hold their breath
3. Acceptable reproducibility defined as standard deviation of the mid lung distance assessed from electronic portal images acquired in the first week of treatment

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Magnitude of the potential impact of DIBH on cardiac dose in patients undergoing radiotherapy for left-sided breast cancer

Magnitude of the potential impact of DIBH will be assessed by looking at the mean dose to the heart using DIBH RT plan and the dose to the heart using free breathing plan. The software used to develop the RT plans will measure/capture the mean dose to the heart.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dosimetric differences for other organs such as lung and contralateral breast between conventional and DIBH treatment

This will be assessed by using the RT planning software to look at the dose volume parameters for the ipsilateral lung, left anterior descending artery, contralateral breast, and oesophagus using DIBH and free breathing plans.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether deep inhalation breath hold (DIBH) is feasible and effective for reducing the radiation dose to the heart during radiotherapy for cancer of the left breast.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with breast cancer (left or right breast) for which radiotherapy treatment is planned following breast conserving surgery or mastectomy.

Study details
There will be two groups enrolled in this trial. The first group of participants with left breast cancer who have demonstrated that they can successfully complete the DIBH for 15 secs (2 repeats) will complete the DIBH procedure at every radiotherapy delivery for 5 weeks. DIBH involves taking a deep breath in and holding that breath whilst the radiotherapy dose is delivered over approximately 10 to 15 seconds. Any left breast cancer participants who are not able to complete DIBH, plus right breast cancer participants will undergo standard radiotherapy treatment with no breath holding intervention.

It is hoped that the results of this trial will provide information on whether DIBH is feasible for patients undergoing radiotherapy, and initial information on whether the technique is effective for reducing the dose of radiation delivered to the heart.</summary>
