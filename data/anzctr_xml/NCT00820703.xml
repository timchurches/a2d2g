  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetic foot ulcers are sores on the feet that occur in 15% of diabetic patients some time
      during their lifetime. Once an ulcer develops, the risk of lower-extremity amputation is
      increased 8-fold in people with diabetes. New treatments that improve the number of ulcers
      that heal and/or speed up healing are urgently needed. Initial studies with a new drug called
      Nexagon® (developed by CoDa Therapeutics, Inc.) support the concept that healing of diabetic
      foot ulcers can be improved with topical application of Nexagon®. Further research will be
      undertaken to assess the safety and activity of Nexagon® when applied to diabetic foot ulcers
      at various doses. A proposed randomized controlled trial will randomly allocate (e.g., by the
      toss of a coin) 24 people with diabetic foot ulcers to Nexagon® (one of three different
      doses) or vehicle (substance containing no medication) to be applied to their ulcer three
      times over four weeks. Participants will be followed over four weeks to monitor their
      response to the treatment, specifically with regards to the amount of healing that occurs.</summary>
