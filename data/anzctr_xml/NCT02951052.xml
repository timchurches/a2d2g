             Participants with untreated syphilis infection, defined as a positive RPR without
             clear documentation of treatment, are excluded. Participants with a positive RPR test
             who have not been treated may be rescreened at least 30 days after completion of
             antibiotic treatment for syphilis.

          -  Participants who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a significant suicide risk.
             Participant's recent history of suicidal behavior and/or suicidal ideation should be
             considered when evaluating for suicide risk

          -  The participant has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the gluteus
             region which may interfere with interpretation of injection site reactions.

          -  Evidence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection based on the results of testing at
             Screening for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core antibody
             (anti-HBc), Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and HBV DNA as follows:
             Participants positive for HBsAg are excluded; Participants negative for anti-HBs but
             positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for HBV DNA are excluded.
             Note: Participants positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for
             anti-HBs (past and/or current evidence) are immune to HBV and are not excluded.

          -  Asymptomatic individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will not be
             excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV
             infection is required; participants who are anticipated to require HCV treatment
             within 12 months must be excluded (HCV treatment on study may be permitted post Week
             48, following consultation with the medical monitor).

          -  Participants with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into phase 3 studies if:
             Liver enzymes meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, and
             is not advanced,and will not require treatment prior to the Week 48 visit. Additional
             information (where available) on participants with HCV co-infection at screening
             should include results from any liver biopsy, Fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis
             evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior
             treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment. In the event that recent biopsy or
             imaging data is not available or inconclusive, the Fib-4 score will be used to verify
             eligibility. Fib 4 score &gt;3.25 is exclusionary; Fib 4 scores 1.45-3.25 requires
             Medical Monitor consultation. Fibrosis 4 Score Formula: ( Age x AST )/(platelets x
             square root of ALT).

          -  Unstable liver disease (as defined by any of the following: presence of ascites,
             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or
             persistent jaundice or cirrhosis), known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of
             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment).

          -  History of liver cirrhosis with or without hepatitis viral co-infection.

          -  Ongoing or clinically relevant pancreatitis.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, as defined by history/evidence of
             congestive heart failure, symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery
             bypass grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
             (PTCA) or any clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  Ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or
             resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia; other localized malignancies require agreement between the Investigator and
             the Study medical monitor for inclusion of the participant prior to randomization.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drugs or render the
             participant unable to receive study medication.

          -  History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components
             or drugs of their class. In addition, if heparin is used during PK sampling,
             participants with a history of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced
             thrombocytopenia must not be enrolled.

          -  Current or anticipated need for chronic anti-coagulation with the exception of the use
             of low dose acetylsalicylic acid (=&lt;325mg).

             non-nucloside reverese transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance-associated
             mutation, except for K103N, by any historical resistance test result.

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. A single repeat test is allowed during
             the Screening phase to verify a result.

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the participant's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound.

          -  Participant has estimated creatine clearance &lt;50 mL/min per 1.73 square meter (m^2)
             via Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Method.

          -  Exposure to an experimental drug or experimental vaccine within either 30 days, 5
             half-lives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             test agent, whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 of this study.

             inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids are eligible for enrollment.

          -  Treatment with an HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening.

          -  Treatment with any agent, except recognized ART as allowed above, with documented

             of three half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose and any other
             prohibited medications should be discontinued for a minimum of two weeks or a minimum

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Antiretroviral Therapy as Long Acting Suppression (ATLAS) study is being conducted to
      establish if human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants with
      current viral suppression on a regimen with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs) plus a third agent, remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug intramuscular (IM)
      long-acting (LA) regimen of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). This is a Phase 3,
      multi-phase, randomized, open label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group,
      non-inferiority study in HIV-1, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-adult participants who are
      stably suppressed on a current antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. This study is designed to
      demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to a two drug CAB LA 400 mg +
      RPV LA 600 mg regimen every 4 weeks (Q4W: monthly) compared with maintenance of current ARV
      regimen containing 2 NRTIs plus an INI, NNRTI, or a PI. Eligible participants will be
      randomized (1:1) into the Maintenance Phase at Day 1 to either continue current ART or switch
      to initiate oral therapy with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for 4 Weeks followed by Q4
      weekly (monthly) CAB LA + RPV LA injections. Following the Maintenance phase at Week 52,
      participants who were randomized to continue their current ART regimen will be given an
      option to switch to CAB LA + RPV LA injections. Those participants would transition to LA
      dosing, beginning with 4 weeks oral CAB + RPV therapy at Week 52, and receive the first IM
      CAB LA + RPV LA injections at Week 56.</summary>
