  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be a single session of chiropractic care for the intervention group.  The chiropractic session will approximately take 10 minutes. The entire spine and both sacroiliac joints will be assessed for segmental dysfunction, and treated where deemed necessary by a registered chiropractor. The peripheral joints will also be assessed and adjusted when necessary. The clinical indicators that will be used to assess joint function prior to and after each intervention include assessing for tenderness to palpation of the relevant joints, manually palpating for restricted range of motion, assessing for palpable asymmetric muscle tension, and any abnormal or blocked joint play and end-­-feel of the joints. All of these biomechanical characteristics are used by the chiropractors as clinical indicators of joint dysfunction (Kockum &amp; Heijne, 2014). All of the manipulations carried out in this study will be high-­-velocity, low-­-amplitude thrusts to the appropriate joints. This is a standard manipulation technique used by chiropractors, and is also referred to as spinal or peripheral joint adjustments. The mechanical properties of this intervention have been investigated; and although the actual force applied to the subject's spine depends on the therapist, the patient, and the spinal location of the manipulation, the general shape of the force-­-time history of spinal manipulations is very consistent (Hessell, Herzog, Conway, &amp; McEwen, 1990) and the duration of the thrust is always less than 200 milliseconds (Herzog, 1996). The high-­-velocity type of manipulation is chosen specifically because previous research has shown that reflex electromyographic activation observed after manipulations only occurred after high-­- velocity, low-­-amplitude manipulations (as compared with lower-­-velocity mobilizations) (Herzog, Conway, Zhang, Gal, &amp; Guimaraes, 1995). This manipulation technique has also been previously used in studies that have investigated the neurophysiological effects of spinal manipulation (Haavik &amp; Murphy, 2012). The washout period for this project is 1 week.</interventions>
    <comparator>The subjects head and/or spine and peripheral joints will be moved in ways that include passive and active movements, similar to what is done by the chiropractor that provide actual chiropractic treatment during the spinal manipulation intervention. Thus, this control intervention involves the subjects being moved into the manipulation setup positions similar to how the chiropractor would normally setup a subject prior to applying the thrust to the spine to achieve the manipulations. Loading a joint, as is done prior to spinal manipulation has been shown to alter paraspinal proprioceptive firing in anesthetized cats (Pickar &amp; Wheeler, 2011) and therefore will be carefully avoided by ending the movement prior to end-­-range-­-of-­-motion when passively moving the subjects. No spinal manipulation will be performed during any control intervention. This control intervention is intended to act as a sham treatment session as well as to act as a physiological control for possible changes occurring due to the cutaneous, muscular or vestibular input that would occur with the type of passive and active movements involved in preparing a subject/patient for a manipulation.

    <inclusivecriteria>15 subjects will be recruited via advertising within the New Zealand College of Chiropractic community. Participants may include students, staff, faculty, and previous patients of the Colleges chiropractic centre and also family, friends and acquaintances of the New Zealand College of Chiropractic community. The experimental protocol will be advertised inviting volunteers that have experienced more than one ankle sprain and have signs of perceived ankle instability. Inclusion criteria will be history of ankle sprain with a score of below 27 on the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) questionnaire (Hiller et al., 2006). Further, subjects must be English speaking and aged 18-50. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria will be recent osteomioligamentar injury (within the last month) and/or vestibular dysfunction. Subjects will also be ineligible to participate if they exhibit no evidence of vertebral subluxations, have absolute contraindications to spinal adjustment, have experienced previous significant adverse reactions to chiropractic care, or they are suffering from a current lower limb disorder/dysfunction that would make them unable to carry out data recording sessions (e.g. severe sprain/strain/fracture).  </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>A Split plot analysis (Mixed design) and a multifactorial repeated measures ANOVA will be used to assess for within and between group differences. TIME (pre and post intervention measures) and INTERVENTION (Chiro vs. Control) will be used as factors. A priori pairwise comparisons of the pre and post intervention data will be carried out when an interactive effect is significant. Significance will be set at P = .05

Allocation of participants will be carried out using an online randomisation programme. The randomisation sequence will created using Minimizer (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) with a 1:1 allocation to control and experimental groups. Allocation will remain concealed until after the baseline assessment has taken place. Participants and the chiropractors providing care during the study will not be blinded to group allocation. Outcomes assessors and data analysts will remain blinded to group allocation throughout the study period.

Sample size calculations  are  based  on detecting a difference in a continuous response variable from independent control and experimental participants with one control per experimental participant. Calculations are made based on the changes observed in our previous studies that investigated the effect of chiropractic care on proprioception (Haavik &amp; Murphy, 2011; Holt, 2014). If the true difference in outcomes between the experimental session and the control session has an effect size of 0.5 we will need 11 participants to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with the test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. To allow for attrition during the trial and relative uncertainty relating to power outcomes we will enroll 15 participants in this trial.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lateral ankle sprains are one of the most frequent injuries occurring within active populations. The initial lateral ankle sprain commonly results from excessive plantar flexion, adduction and supination of the ankle joint complex. This motion overloads joint structures and may cause dysfunction (hypermobility or hypomobility) of one or more joints in the ankle complex (Denegar and Miller, 2002).
While it seems intuitive to understand the joint hypermobility and instability as results of damage to the joint structures, the role of hypomobility in producing ankle instability must be considered. Limited dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) is an important risk factor for recurrence of ankle sprains (Martin et al, 2013) and can predispose to injuries (Mason-Macaya et al., 2015). Chiropractic care can improve sensorimotor function and enhance proprioception of the ankle joint (Holt, 2014).Increased sensory feedback contributes to enhanced proprioception and neuromuscular control.In order to further understand the potential role of chiropractic care in the restoration of ankle function in subjects with perceived ankle instability, it is crucial to investigate the effects of chiropractic care on functional tasks involving load absorption. Therefore, the aim of this project is to investigate the effects of chiropractic care on ankle  joint function in subjects with perceived ankle joint instability. </summary>
