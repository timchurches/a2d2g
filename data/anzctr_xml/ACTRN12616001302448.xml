  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prolonged exposure (PE) is the gold standard evidence based treatment for PTSD. It involves helping the person address the traumatic memories and avoided situations in a supportive, controlled and safe environment, in order to reduce the associated fear and modify interpretations of the event that are impeding recovery. 

Standard PE (SPE) requires weekly treatment for 10 weeks, which can pose a barrier to treatment uptake for some military personnel (for whom 10-week windows of availability between training activities, deployments and postings may be rare), as well as for veterans and other civilian populations (for whom life demands and stressors may make attendance difficult). 

Intensive PE (IPE) delivers the same intervention over 10 working days within a two week period, rather than weekly over 10 weeks. 

In this study we seek to test whether IPE is as effective as the 10-week SPE model. 

Both IPE and SPE sessions will be conducted individually with participants by psychologists. SPE consists of 10 weekly sessions of 90 minute, face-to-face manualised standard PE therapy with the therapist, and associated homework tasks. The IPE intervention is identical to SPE but delivered intensively over the course of two weeks, with a 90 minute session with the psychologist each morning, followed by homework tasks each afternoon. Homework is of approximately 2 hours duration, with tasks including gradually engaging in avoided situations, in imagination and in real-life. Participants do this in a gradual manner, while learning to manage the associated anxiety. Therapists will keep a session attendance log for each individual participant. Participants will keep a homework log which will be reviewed with their therapist at the beginning of each session. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size is determined for detecting non-inferiority of the primary endpoint, CAPS score, where non-inferiority is to be declared if the upper endpoint of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean change scores from baseline to 12 months between IPE and SPE (adjusted for baseline) is less than 7 CAPS points. The margin of 7 CAPS points is determined as being the maximum non-clinically significant change. With a between-subject SD of 15.6 points and a baseline-to-12 month correlation in CAPS scores of 0.32, a total of 172 patients are required to detect non-inferiority with 80% power when IPE is truly non-inferior. The false positive error rate (i.e. falsely declaring non-inferiority) with this design is at most 2.5%. Allowing for 10-15% loss to follow up at 12 months, the sample size increases to 200 patients.

Analyses will follow the intention to treat principle. Baseline characteristics of the IPE and SPE groups will be tabulated using appropriate summary statistics. Analyses of the (quantitative) outcome measures at each of the follow up time points will be performed using linear regression with change from baseline as the dependent variable, treatment group as the covariate of interest, and adjusting for the baseline value of the outcome measure and the stratification variables used in the randomisation. Results will be presented as adjusted differences in mean change from baseline in each outcome measure compared between IPE and SPE groups, together with 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Data from patients lost to follow up will be imputed using multiple imputation methods using as much post-baseline auxiliary information as available in the imputation models. Supplementary as treated and per protocol analyses will be performed to account for lack of treatment adherence.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the most effective treatments for PTSD is prolonged exposure (PE). In this treatment, the person is helped to gradually address the difficult memories and avoided situations in a supportive and controlled fashion. PE is delivered by qualified therapists in sessions that are held once a week for 10 weeks. For some people, this can pose a barrier  it may be difficult to get time off work or to make other arrangements for family commitments. Allocating 10 weeks for treatment can also be difficult for serving members. There is now some early evidence that we may be able to get equivalent results by providing the same number of sessions on a daily basis in just two weeks. In this study we seek to test whether the intensive approach is as effective as the 10-week model. If so, it has the potential to increase how accessible and acceptable this evidence based treatment is to veterans, serving members, civilians and their families. Using a randomised controlled trial design, we will therefore compare the effectiveness of the standard and intensive versions of PE in the treatment of PTSD in veterans and serving members.

Eligible veterans and currently serving Defence members who meet criteria for PTSD will be randomly allocated to either standard PE (SPE; 10 weekly 90-minute sessions or intensive PE (IPE; 10 daily 90-minute sessions). Participants will be assess pre-treatment and at 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 12 months post-treatment commencement. We hypothesise that IPE will be as effective as SPE in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms at post-treatment and 12 month follow-up.</summary>
