  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single use of a Paclitaxel-coated Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty Balloon Catheter with a dose density of 2.0 micrograms/mm^2 used in the Superficial Femoral or Popliteal Arteries.  

A needle will be used to gain access to the blood vessel, then a narrow tube with the balloon inside of it will be moved to the area in the artery where the doctor needs the balloon to be positioned.  The doctor will then inflate the balloon and deflate the balloon as necessary. The balloon will then be removed along with any tubes used to access the blood vessel. The procedure should take between 30 and 60 minutes to complete.</interventions>
