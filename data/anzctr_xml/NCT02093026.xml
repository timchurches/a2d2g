    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Rituximab
Treatment: drugs - Methotrexate
Treatment: drugs - Methylprednisolone
Treatment: drugs - Folic Acid

Experimental: Rituximab - Participants will receive rituximab 1 gram intravenously (IV) on Days 1 and 15 of each course of retreatment. In addition, participants will receive methotrexate 10-25 milligrams per week (mg/week) orally or parenterally, methylprednisolone 100 mg IV 30 minutes prior to both rituximab infusions, and a stable dose of folic acid greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 5 mg/week or equivalent. Participants will receive retreatment (next course of rituximab repeat treatment) within 2 weeks of meeting the retreatment criteria as defined in the protocol (minimum of 24 weeks after the first [Day 1] infusion of the last course of rituximab). Repeat treatment will be based on the investigator's decision of prior clinical response to rituximab, clinical need and evidence of active disease (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints &gt;=2.6). Retreatment with rituximab will be continued until withdrawal of consent or study treatment completion on 31 December 2011, whichever is sooner.

      <outcome>American College of Rheumatology Index of Improvement (ACRn) Response - The ACRn is calculated for each participant by taking the lowest percentage improvement in (1) SJC or (2) TJC or (3) the median of the remaining 5 components of the ACR response (patient's assessment of disease activity; patient's global assessment of pain; physician's assessment of disease activity; participant's assessment of physical function; an acute phase reactant value [either CRP or ESR]). The index of improvement in RA, where 0 indicates no improvement and 100 indicates a 100% improvement across all signs and symptoms of RA. ACRn scores were calculated considering the original baseline in the precursor studies WA16291 or WA17043.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks after first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh course of rituximab (median duration of 26, 90.9, 162.9, 232, 297.3, 354.4, and 406.7 weeks, respectively)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Low Disease Activity and Clinical Remission Based on DAS28-ESR - DAS28-ESR was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, ESR (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]), and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity). DAS28-ESR = 0.56*square root (sqrt)(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. Total score range: 0-10, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-ESR &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity (LDA) and DAS28-ESR &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks after first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh course of rituximab (median duration of 26, 90.9, 162.9, 232, 297.3, 354.4, and 406.7 weeks, respectively)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response of 'Good' or 'Moderate' - DAS28-ESR was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, ESR (mm/hour), and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity). DAS28-ESR = 0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*ln(ESR) + 0.014*Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. The DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of change from baseline and the level of disease activity reached. Good responders had a change from baseline greater than (&gt;) 1.2 with a DAS28 score less than or equal to (=) 3.2; moderate responders had a change from baseline &gt;1.2 with a DAS28 score &gt;3.2 to less than or equal to (=) 5.1 or a change from baseline &gt;0.6 to =1.2 with a DAS28 score =5.1.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at 24 Weeks Following Each Course - The HAQ-DI is a questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis and consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. Participants completed the questionnaire by answering the 20 questions on a scale of 0 (without difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The total score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). A negative change score indicates improvement.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will assess the long-term safety and efficacy of repeat treatment courses of
      rituximab, in combination with methotrexate in a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug
      (DMARD) inadequate responder population of participants who were previously randomized into
      studies WA16291 (NCT02693210) or WA17043/U2644g (NCT00074438). The study permits multiple
      re-treatments until the protocol-defined end-of-treatment date (31 December 2011).
      Participants will then enter a safety follow-up (SFU) period of at least 48 weeks. This will
      provide at least 7 years follow-up data on all participants initially randomized into WA16291
      or WA17043/U2644g. Approximately 600 participants will potentially be eligible to enter this
      open label extension study from their respective feeder studies.</summary>
