  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers (AD) and Parkinsons (PD) disease are expected to rise in the next 30 years as a result of Australias ageing population.
However, conclusive diagnostic tests and impact of dietary status for neurodegenerative disease risk are not clearly defined. Therefore, it is important to identify potential genome damage biomarkers and micronutrients associated with these diseases that may aid in the design of potential preventative measures. The hypothesis is mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimers disease, and Parkinsons disease exhibit increases in genome damage and cell death biomarkers relative to each other, and to healthy age matched controls.</summary>
