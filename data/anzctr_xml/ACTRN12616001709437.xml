  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of this prospective, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, controlled, clinical trial is to evaluate the activity of cytokines, growth factors and healing rates of pressure ulcers (PU) in people with central nervous system injures after 4 weeks of intervention involving standard wound care (SWC), SWC in conjunction with high voltage monophasic pulsed current (HVMPC) delivered by the cathode, and SWC combined with HVMPC delivered by the anode as the treatment electrodes. 

Demographic information on the patients will be compiled during standardized interviews and physical examinations, as well as from additional examinations of the patients and the documentation of their concomitant diseases. 

The patients physical and mental conditions, activity, mobility and incontinence will be assessed using the Norton scale (a score &lt; 14 indicated a high risk of PU development). To assess the possibility of friction and shear and wound moisture, as well as sensory perception of the patients, their physical activity and mobility the Braden Scale will be applied (a score &lt; 16 pointed to a high risk of PU development). Patients nutritional status will be identified by means of the Nutritional Risk Score (NRS-2002). 
Wound severity at enrolment will be assessed based on the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel criteria: Category II ulcers = partial-thickness loss of the dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough; Category III ulcers = full-thickness tissue loss; subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscle are not exposed; Category IV ulcers = full-thickness tissue loss with exposed tendon, muscle or bone. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Can include undermining and tunnelling.

SWC programme administered to both electrical stimulation groups. 
All patients will be treated to prevent the development of new PUs. Pressure-redistribution surfaces, devices and pillows will be applied as needed. A nurse or physiotherapist will reposition the immobile patients every 2 hours at the least. 
Blood tests will be carried out to screen for nutritional status markers and metabolic disorders such as anaemia (iron deficiency anaemia or anaemia of chronic disease), thyroid dysfunction, impaired glycaemic control, dehydration, protein deficit, hypoalbuminemia. 

Wounds will be regularly assessed by the attending physician over the period of the study to select topical treatments appropriately addressing moisture control, bacterial burden, and debridement needs; microbiological culture and sensitivity tests will also be performed. 

A team formed of a physician, a nurse, a physical therapist and a dietician will make comprehensive, interdisciplinary assessments of the patients to develop SWC programmes meeting their specific demands, for instance consisting of nutritional intervention, optimization of the wound dressing protocol, and incontinence management. The clinician caregivers will be blinded to participants group. 

Patients in both electrical stimulation groups will receive similar standard topical care, selected to address their individual needs and to promote moist interactive healing. 
All immobilized patients will receive low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) as a standard therapy. Patients with elevated leukocyte levels will be treated with antibiotics selected following microbiological culture and sensitivity testing of the PU swab.


Electrical stimulation with the cathode. 
In the cathode ES group, patients will be administered HVMPC in addition to SWC. 

The device for applying HVMPC will be the Intelect Advanced Combo (by Chattanooga, USA). 

The device generates a twin-peak monophasic pulse consisting of two 77- microsecond exponential pulses in rapid succession (the twin-peak pulse duration was 154 microseconds). Pulse frequency will be 100 pps. 

ES will not cause muscle contractions. Patients who retained the sensory function will only experience sensory effects. Amperage will be applied at a level of 0.36 A. If the sensory experience is too strong (patients with sensory function) the amperage will be reduced but not below 0.25 A. Accordingly, the electrodes will deliver an electrical charge of 250- 360 microcoulomb per second. 

This HVMPC protocol has been adopted following the positive results of earlier clinical trials on patients with PUs and venous leg ulcers..  

Each patient will have his or her own set of electrodes made of conductive carbon rubber. The treatment electrode (of a size matching the wound surface area) will be placed on an aseptic gauze pad saturated with physiological saline overlaying the wound site. The dispersive electrode (bigger than the treatment electrode) closing the electrical circuit will be positioned at least 20 cm from the PU. Before and after each ES procedure, the electrodes will be sterilized in a disinfectant solution. 

Over the period of the intervention, the negative electrode (cathode) will be used to treat PUs. The authors of some other clinical studies on PUs have also used cathodal stimulations. 

In the experiment, five 50-minute sessions will be held per week (one a day), following the approach adopted by other authors. 

PUs will be thoroughly cleansed with a 0.9% sodium chloride solution and covered with the earlier described dressings immediately after the ES procedure.


Electrical stimulation with the anode.

Patients in the anodal ES group will receive HVMPC in the same way as patients in the cathodal ES group, but the treatment electrode will be the anode. The authors of other clinical studies on PUs used anodal stimulation.

HVMPC with the cathode (in the cathode ES group) and with the anode (in the anode ES group) will be applied for a period of 4 weeks (total of 20 HVMPC sessions), during which wounds will be observed for healing progress.
</interventions>
    <comparator>SWC programme, the same as to the electrical stimulation groups, will be administered to In the control group (placebo ES group).    

In addition to standard wound care described above, the control group will also receive sham ES. The electrodes will be arranged in the same way as in the ES groups and all current parameters will also be displayed on the monitor, but the current itself will not be applied. Five 50-minute sessions of sham ES will be held per week (one a day).

Sham HVMPC will be applied for a period of 4 weeks (total of 20 sham HVMPC sessions), during which wounds will be observed for healing progress.

    <sequence>Patient allocation to groups will be independent of when and who will deliver the treatment.

The group allocation sequence will be concealed. Simple randomisation with numbered envelopes will be used.

An independent person will receive three batches of 15 pieces of paper, each marked with a letter indicating to which group the patient should go, i.e. A for the SWC+cathodal HVMPC group, B for the SWC+anodal HVMPC group and C for the SWC+sham ES group.. The person, unaware of what the symbols mean, will insert the pieces of paper into 45 envelopes randomly drawn by the computer. The sealed envelopes will be transferred to the main investigator in charge of patients’ allocation to groups. Before the treatment, the envelopes will be opened one-by-one in the presence of a physiotherapist and the patient concerned will be directed to the appropriate study group.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>To evaluate the changes, of concentration of growth factor, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines peripheral blood samples of 5 ml will be taken from the patients before ES therapy and then after 2 and 4 weeks into the treatment period. 

To evaluate the changes in gene expression for growth factors, pro-inflammatory, anti-iflammatory cytokines and their receptors, a granulation tissue specimen of 5 mm in diameter will be taken before ES therapy and then after 2 and 4 weeks into the treatment period. 

WSA will be determined using the same method that was already employed in several previous clinical trials. First wound contours will be copied onto transparent film sheets. The contours will be then measured with the planimeter to establish the surface area of each wound. The obtained data will be processed by a digitizer (Mutoh Kurta XGT, Altek, USA) connected to a personal computer (C-GEO v. 4.0 Nadowski, PL) which will be also used to store the results. 

Measurement errors caused by different shapes of the wounds may range from 2.7% (for PUs of 60 to 70 cm2 in size) to 37.9% (for PUs &lt; 1 cm2). The method with which measurement errors will be calculated can be found in our earlier study.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>If, as in other studies, an average increase in expression of the analysed factors between baseline and final examination is 30% at a standard deviation of 40%, the minimum size of the group will be 9 persons. For a larger standard deviation or a smaller average increase, the size of the group will be increased.

After the experiment, patients characteristics will be tested for normality of distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk W test. In the case of normal distributions, the parametric ANOVA test will be used, and in the case of non-normal distributions, the non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance for inter-group comparisons and Friedmans ANOVA for intragroup comparisons) will be used to establish statistical significance.

Patients characteristics will also be tested for skewness, kurtosis and modality of distributions. In the cases when skewness and kurtosis are smaller than 4 and the distributions are unimodal, arithmetic averages and standard deviations will be used as the measures of central value and dispersion.

The level of statistical significance in all tests will be p &lt; 0.05.

The statistical analysis will be performed using the Statistica software by StatSoft (licenced to the Medical University of Silesia).

All patients in the experiment will be assessed for the homogeneity of distribution of their characteristics. The mean percentage change in wound area (at week 4), the expression of cytokines and growth factors will be calculated (at week 2 and 4) in all groups and then an inter-group comparison will be performed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinical practice guidelines in Europe, the United States, and Australia recommend applying (ES) to chronic wounds. However, the exact rules for applying ES to wounds are still to be developed. It is though that the polarity of the treatment electrode used during ES procedures is significance for the healing process. 
The authors of in vitro studies report that anodal ES facilitates electrotaxis of macrophages and neutrophilis for autolysis and reactivation of the inflammatory phase of healing. 
Anodal ES promoted in vivo neoangiogenesis in the early stage of acute experimental wound healing in animals. 
Cathodal ES may promote the proliferative phase of healing. In vitro studies have demonstrated that human keratinocytes, fibroblasts and bovine corneal epithelial cells migrate directionally toward the cathode. Fibroblasts exposed to cathodal ES could significantly increase the rate of protein and DNA synthesis. In vivo study with rats revealed that cathodal ES increased the release of vascular endothelial growth factor in the skin.
Our experiment aims to expand the knowledge of how ES delivered by, respectively, the cathode and the anode as the treatment electrodes contributes to the healing of Category II - IV PUs in people with central nervous system injury at high risk of PU development. 
Our study is specifically designed to test the following hypotheses:
1.	Both electrical stimulations, with anode and cathode as treatment electrodes, increase gene expression of growth factors and their receptors in peripheral blood and in pressure ulcers.
2.	Both types of electrical stimulations using anode and cathode as the treatment electrodes decrease the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decrease the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood and within pressure ulcers. 
3.	Both cathodal and anodal HVMPC administrated as part of an interdisciplinary wound care programme help decrease wound area and improve the healing of Category II-IV PUs. </summary>
