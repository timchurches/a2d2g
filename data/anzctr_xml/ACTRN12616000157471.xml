  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is to participate in  individual computer gaming sessions with the use of a controller (called Orby) and laptop, which will be readily available over a three-week period. There is no set time period a participant must play each day, so they can choose how much they play, and which games they play over the three-week period. This will be used as an additional rehabilitation tool during standard inpatient rehabilitation  The games have been designed to be of broad appeal and easy to play (no experience required). The controller unit requires bimanual control whereby the impaired hand/arm is assisted to participate in the controller motion. The affected hand also receives task-relevant haptic (vibration) stimulation during the gaming with the intent of increasing self-perception of the affected hand. The gaming software will record all usage time of participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group also uses bimanually the Orby controller for games but does not receive the haptic input. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rehabilitation can be a long process for people after stroke, and needs to be intensive to drive functional recovery. Computer gaming is proposed as a way for people to increase their therapeutic time while engaged in enjoyable activities during their rehabilitation stay. This project will investigate if computing gaming, through the use of the OrbIT Gaming System, has benefits for people during their stroke rehabilitation. 
Particularly, we are interested in finding out if participation in computer gaming will improve movement and sensation in the affected upper limb following a stroke. The study will also ask participants and staff about their experiences using this system. This study is being conducted as part of a Physiotherapy student honours project.
Participants are allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Both groups will participate in the computer gaming activity using a novel controller and laptop, which will be readily available over a three-week period. The controller requires bimanual use  thus forcing the affected hand and arm to participate in directing motion of the unit. Further it is capable of delivering a haptic stimulation (vibration) to the affected hand only to theortically increase awareness of the affected hand. This will be used as an additional rehabilitation tool during each participant's stay at Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre, allowing as much use as possible. 
The games have been designed to be of broad appeal and easy to play (no experience required). Participants will also receive the usual rehabilitation ('standard care'). All participants (regardless of group) will be asked to undergo assessment at the beginning of the study and after the three-week period (1 hour for each assessment). All participants will be asked specific questions after the three-week intervention through a written questionnaire. This will enable us to compare the effects of computer gaming. </summary>
