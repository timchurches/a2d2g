  <interventions>
    <interventions>Approximately 16 participants with acne vulgaris will be enrolled and receive 3ml dose of BTX 1503 5% Solution twice daily. 
Participants will receive their initial application of study drug on Day 1 at the clinical sites administered by the clinical site staff. Participants will be instructed in how to apply study drug when not at the clinical site. Starting on the evening of Day 1, participants will apply their study drug at home. Each application of study drug will occur at approximately the same time in the morning with the second application 12 hours later. Participants will apply study drug twice daily through Day 27. Participants will apply study drug at the clinical site on the morning of Day 14 and on the morning of Day 28 (final dose). 
A diary will be maintained documenting compliance with application of the self-administered applications. Each dose of study drug will be applied to the entire face. Participants will be asked to apply the total amount of study drug per application evenly, as best as possible, to cover all the face.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BTX 1503 5% solution for 28 days administered as a single dose twice daily (BID) in participants with acne vulgaris. 
Assessed by: collection of vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and pulse), AEs, cutaneous tolerability assessments, and laboratory findings (CBC, chemistry, and urinalysis).  Urine drug tests will be conducted for drugs of abuse, including the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be monitored from time of consent through the end of study (35 days). Cutaneous tolerability (erythema, scaling, dryness, burning/stinging, and irritant/allergic contact dermatitis) will be collected at Baseline, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 35 and graded using the following scale: 0, None; 1, Slight; 2, Moderate; 3, Severe. Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, and pulse) will be obtained at Baseline, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 35. Complete blood count (CBC), chemistry, and urinalysis will be conducted at Baseline and at Day 28. Urine drug tests will be conducted at the Day 1, Day 28 and Day 35 Visits to evaluate for levels of THC. 
Blood levels of study drug will be measured.
Pregnancy testing will be conducted for women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) prior to treatment and at the Day 28 Visit.

    <designfeatures>This is an open-label, multi-centre, single-arm, Phase 1b study. All participants will receive 3 mL of study drug (BTX 1503 5% Solution) applied to the entire face. No escalation of dose will occur. There are no pre-planned dose adjustments, modifications, or delays. Participants will receive BID application of study drug for 27 days with a final application on the morning of Day 28 for a total of 55 doses. </designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. 
Safety Analyses
All participants who receive at least one confirmed dose of study drug, and have at least one post-baseline assessment will be included in the safety analyses.
All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring during the study will be recorded and classified based on MedDRA terminology. Treatment-emergent adverse events are those AEs with an onset on or after the first application of study medication. All reported TEAEs will be summarised by treatment group, the number of participants reporting events, system organ class, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness. When summarising events by causality and severity, each participant will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the event with the greatest relationship and highest severity within each classification.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarised by cohort, system organ class, preferred term, severity, outcome and relationship to study drug; and all SAEs will be listed by participant. In addition, a list of participants who prematurely discontinue from the study due to an AE and the reason for discontinuation will be provided.
Concomitant medication will be mapped to ATC Level 2 using the WHODrug dictionary. The number and percentage of participants reporting each medication will be summarised. Medications taken by each participant will be listed.
Cutaneous tolerability scores for each parameter (erythema, scaling, dryness, burning/stinging, and irritant/allergic contact dermatitis) will be summarised for each visit. In addition, the change from baseline in the mean scores will be summarised for each visit.
Exploratory Analyses:
Lesion counts will be collected by the clinical site along with photographs of the participants face. Inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts will be made separately. The IGA will be conducted by the study investigator at each site. Each participant will have the IGA done by the same investigator throughout the study. IGA will also be assessed by the central panel of reviewers.
Demographics will be summarised by age, gender, race, ethnicity height and weight. Summary statistics will be prepared for the change from baseline in lesion counts (inflammatory and non-inflammatory separate and combined) and IGA separately for the investigators and the central panel (IGA only). For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and range will be presented along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Categorical variables will be summarised by proportions along with the 95% CI.
Lesion counts, changes in lesion counts, and IGA scores will be presented by reviewer (clinical site or central panel [IGA Only]) and concurrence will be assessed.
The following exploratory analyses will be conducted.
 The absolute and percent change from Baseline in the inflammatory lesion count at Day 28 and Day 35
 The absolute and percent change from Baseline in the non-inflammatory lesion count at Day 28 and Day 35
 The absolute and percent change from Baseline in the total lesion count at Day 28 and Day 35
 The proportion of participants with an IGA score of clear or almost clear and at least a 2-grade reduction at Day 28 and Day 35
Participants assessment of the change in their acne from baseline to Day 28 using the PRO assessment will be summarized. 
Drug Levels:
Blood levels of study drug will be summarised by time point. The mean, SD, median and range will be presented.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose
The purpose of this study is to describe the safety of treatment with the study drug (BTX 1503 5% Solution) with twice daily dosing in subjects with acne vulgaris. The study drugs effect on acne vulgaris will be evaluated. 
Study participants
Patients with acne vulgaris aged between 18 and 65 years, inclusive, will participate.
Experimental Treatment
The study will investigate 3mL of BTX 1503 5% Solution applied twice daily to the face for 28 days.
The study consists of a screening visit (up to 14 days before receiving study treatment) and an enrolment visit initially. On Day 7, a call will be made to each participant to ensure that they continue with dosing per instructions. There is a visit on Day 14 during the 28 day dosing period. Participants will return to the clinic on Day 28 for safety assessments. There is a follow up visit on Day 35. 
The maximum study duration for any participant will be a total of up to 49 days; screening period (up to 14 days), 28 days of treatment, and 1 week of follow-up.
