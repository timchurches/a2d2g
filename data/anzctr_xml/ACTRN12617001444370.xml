  <interventions>
    <interventions>PXS-5338K has been developed to be an anti-fibrotic medication for once daily oral administration in patients for the treatment of NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) and other fibrosis based diseases.

Subjects will be randomised to receive PXS-5338K (active) or matching placebo in single ascending doses (SAD) or multiple ascending doses (MAD). 

PXS-5388K will be in a capsule form and will be administered orally followed by 200ml of water.

Dose levels for SAD will begin at 10 mg and increase to 400 mg over 6 Cohorts. Dose for each cohort are as follows:
Cohort 1  PXS-5338K = 10 mg
Cohort 2  PXS-5338K = 30 mg
Cohort 3  PXS-5338K = 60 mg
Cohort 4  PXS-5338K = 100 mg
Cohort 5  PXS-5338K = 200 mg
Cohort 6  PXS-5338K = 400 mg

The doses for the MAD phase will be chosen based on the safety/tolerability data collected from the SAD phase. 

Cohort 7, Cohort 8 and Cohort 9 of MAD study will be planned following consideration of safety, tolerability and PK assessment of preceding SAD and/or repeat dose cohorts. However the most likely doses for MAD study will be between 60 and 200 mg for 14 days once daily. 

For the SAD, there will be outpatient visits on Day 3 and 4. For the MAD Phase, follow up visits will be done on Day, 16, 17 and 18. The Exit Evaluation visit will be done at Day 5 for the SAD and Day 21 for the MAD.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Matching Placebo will be used as the comparator/control treatment for this study. The placebo will be in gelatin capsule containing mannitol and sodium stearate</comparator>
