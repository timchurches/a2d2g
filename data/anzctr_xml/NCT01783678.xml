Experimental: Genotype 2/3 treatment-experienced - Treatment-experienced (TE) participants with HIV-1 and genotype 2 or 3 HCV co-infection will receive sofosbuvir plus RBV for 24 weeks.

Experimental: Genotype 1/3/4 treatment-naive - Treatment naive (TN) participants with HIV-1 and genotype 1, 3, or 4 HCV co-infection will receive sofosbuvir plus RBV for 24 weeks.
