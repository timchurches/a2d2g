  <interventions>
    <interventions>preoperative combined positron emission tomography/computed tomograpy (PET/CT)
This involves the patient undergoing a combined imaging technique: the patient is required to lie on their back in a PET/CT machine for approximately 40-60 minutes following administration of intravenous contrast agent as is normally given with routine CT, and injection of radioactive marker fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)</interventions>
    <comparator>All patients will undergo PET/CT, and all will undergo surgical and histological staging as part of their management for Endometrial cancer. Surgical and histological findings are the comparator</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Diagnosis / Prognosis</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evidence of fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake corresponding with presence of primary lesion
Will Use regression techniques to examine the influence of prognostic variables on test characteristics. For each of the tests calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative values and compare the performance of the two tests with risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following surgery and review of histopathology: Baseline only</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evidence of FDG uptake corresponding with presence of distant disease including lymphatic spread

      <outcome>Strength of FDG uptake as objectively measured by standard uptake values
Will Use regression techniques to examine the influence of prognostic variables on test characteristics. For each of the tests calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative values and compare the performance of the two tests with risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline only</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Strength of FDG uptake as objectively measures by standard uptake values and its correspondance with cell type
Will Use regression techniques to examine the influence of prognostic variables on test characteristics. For each of the tests calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative values and compare the performance of the two tests with risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical impact of PET/CT
Will examine clinical prognostic features and assess these relative to test characteristics.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prospective study to be conducted at Monash Medical Centre Moorabbin Melbourne Victoria. The aim is to determine whether Positron Emission Tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) is able to predict the stage and spread of uterine (Endometrial) Cancer when performed preoperatively. A further aim is to determine whether its use is beneficial in guiding further treatment of the patient, With our hypothesis being that PET/CT is useful in ensuring appropriate management of the woman with uterine cancer</summary>
