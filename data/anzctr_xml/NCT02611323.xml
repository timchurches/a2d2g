    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Obinutuzumab
Treatment: drugs - Rituximab
Treatment: drugs - Polatuzumab Vedotin
Treatment: drugs - Venetoclax

Experimental: Dose-Escalation Cohort: FL - Participants with relapsed or refractory FL will receive 18 weeks of induction treatment with polatuzumab vedotin and venetoclax at escalating doses to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for polatuzumab vedotin and venetoclax when combined with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab. Those who achieve CR, PR, or SD at the EOI will be eligible to receive a 24-month maintenance regimen consisting of 8 months of venetoclax and 24 months of obinutuzumab.

Experimental: Dose-Escalation Cohort: DLBCL - Participants with relapsed or refractory DLBCL will receive 18 weeks of induction treatment. Venetoclax will be administered at escalating doses to identify the RP2D of venetoclax when combined with fixed doses of polatuzumab vedotin and rituximab. Those who achieve CR or PR at the EOI will be eligible to receive an 8-month consolidation regimen consisting of venetoclax and rituximab.

Experimental: Expansion Cohort: FL - Participants with relapsed or refractory FL will receive 18 weeks of induction treatment with polatuzumab vedotin and venetoclax at the RP2D identified during the dose-escalation phase, in addition to obinutuzumab. Those who achieve CR, PR, or SD at the EOI will be eligible to receive a 24-month maintenance regimen consisting of 8 months of venetoclax and 24 months of obinutuzumab.

Experimental: Expansion Cohort: DLBCL - Participants with relapsed or refractory DLBCL will receive 18 weeks of induction treatment. Venetoclax will be administered at the RP2D identified during the dose-escalation phase, in addition to polatuzumab vedotin and rituximab. Those who achieve CR or PR at the EOI will be eligible to receive an 8-month consolidation regimen consisting of venetoclax and rituximab.


Treatment: drugs: Obinutuzumab
Participants will receive a fixed dose of obinutuzumab, 1000 mg via intravenous (IV) infusion to be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6. Cycle length will be 21 days. For eligible participants, post-induction treatment may be given at a dose of 1000 mg via IV infusion on Day 1 of every other month (starting from Month 2) for up to 24 months, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Treatment: drugs: Rituximab
Participants will receive a fixed dose of rituximab, 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) via IV infusion to be given on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 6. Cycle length will be 21 days. For eligible participants, post-induction treatment may be given at a dose of 375 mg/m^2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of every other month (starting from Month 2) for up to 8 months, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Treatment: drugs: Polatuzumab Vedotin
Participants will receive polatuzumab vedotin via IV infusion at doses of 1.4 or 1.8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) (for FL), and 1.8 mg/kg (for DLBCL) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 18 weeks during induction treatment. Polatuzumab vedotin will not be given during the post-induction period.

Treatment: drugs: Venetoclax
Participants will receive venetoclax film-coated tablets at doses of 200, 400, 600, or 800 mg (for FL), and 400, 600, or 800 mg (for DLBCL) on Days 1 to 21 of each 21-day cycle. Post-induction venetoclax may continue for up to 8 months, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of induction treatment
      with obinutuzumab, polatuzumab vedotin, and venetoclax in participants with relapsed or
      refractory FL, and with rituximab, polatuzumab vedotin, and venetoclax in participants with
      DLBCL. Participants with FL who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or
      stable disease (SD) at the end of induction therapy will receive post-induction treatment
      with obinutuzumab and venetoclax, and participants with DLBCL who achieve CR or PR at the end
      of induction (EOI) will receive post-induction treatment with rituximab and venetoclax.</summary>
