    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will respond to advertisements and/or respond to flyers displayed in health clinics. Participants will then be briefly interviewed to assess eligibility and if meeting eligibility criteria a formal mental health assessment will be conducted (MINI International Neuropsychiatric interview). If the participant meet all eligibility criteria, he/she will be randomly allocated into a placebo or curcumin treatment group. Group allocation will be conducted in a double-blind, randomised fashion.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated into placebo and treatment groups. These groups are named group 1 and group 2 and the primary investigator and participants will be unaware of which treatment these groups represent. Each participant will be allocated a participant number (1 to 60) based on order of inclusion in the study. A computer-generated software will randomly assign the numbers 1 to 60 into either group 1 or 2.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a double-blind, placebo controlled study assessing the antidepressant, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin in 60 adults suffering from major depression (mild to moderate severity). Participants will be randomly allocated into either a curcumin (BCM-95 'Registered Trademark' -  500mg twice daily) or placebo group and changes in depression, anxiety and general health will be measured over an 8-week period. The aim of this study is also to investigate potential mechanisms of action of curcumin so urine, saliva and blood samples will be collected at the beginning and completion of the study. Levels of cortisol, kynurenine pathway metabolites (measure of inflammation) and oxidative stress markers will be assessed over time.</summary>
