  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>one major complication of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the potential for temporary mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Memantine (a NMDA antagonist agent) has a beneficial effect on cognition in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer s disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Memantine 5mg/d in the prevention of cognitive impairments during ECT treatment.
A prospective, double blind, placebo controlled trial included 40 patients underwent ECT will be done. Patients will randomly select to receive either memantine 5 mg/d or a placebo. Drug or placebo started the day before doing ECT and continue throughout the fourth course of ECT. An objective measure of cognitive function is Modified Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and will be performed pre-ECT and post-ECT. Finally score of MMSE before and after ECT will be compare.</summary>
