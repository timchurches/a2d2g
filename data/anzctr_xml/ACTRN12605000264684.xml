    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Computerised generated random number allocation. Assignment took place after GPs sent back their consent form. The sequence was not concealed from the research coordinator who needed to operationalise the intervention for doctors in the intervention group. It was also not possible to conceal the treatment allocation from the GPs. Patients, general practice office staff who recruited the patients, data collectors (outcome assessors), and data managers were unaware of treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A statistician from another location within the university wrote a computer random-number generator in SAS. Cluster randomisation at practice level.</sequence>
