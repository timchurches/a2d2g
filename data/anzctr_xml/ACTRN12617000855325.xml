  <interventions>
    <interventions>Olaparib is the study intervention in this trial. Olaparib (LynparzaTM) is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. The inactive ingredients are copovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, mannitol, sodium stearyl fumarate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hypromellose), macrogol 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow and iron oxide black.
It is provided as tablets each containing 100mg or 150mg olaparib for oral administration. administered as 300 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Each bottle contains 32 tablets. Patients will be asked to return unused drug and empty drug containers at each return visit for adherence.
Olaparib should be commenced within 7 days after registration and will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the activity of olaparib in each tumour cohort (TNBC and HGSOC), as measured by the objective tumour response rate according to RECIST v1.1 (confirmed partial or complete response).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 6 months of registration.
Objective Tumour Response Rate is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients with confirmed Complete or Partial Response according to RECIST v1.1 in each tumour cohort (TNBC and HGSOC).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine progression free survival (PFS) in each tumour cohort (TNBC and HGSOC).
Disease progression is defined according to RECIST v1.1</outcome>
      <timepoint>PFS is defined as the interval from date of registration to the date of first evidence of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Participants will be followed up for a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 5 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine response rate according to cause of HR pathway deficiency (methylation vs other) in each tumour cohort (TNBC and HGSOC).
Response Rate according to HR deficiency defined as the proportion of evaluable patients with confirmed Complete or Partial Response by RECIST v1.1 according to cause of HR pathway deficiency (methylation vs other).</outcome>
      <timepoint>In individuals this would be best response at any time point, though it would usually be expected that any responses occur with 6 months of registration.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the side effect profile according to reported  adverse events.
Participants will have blood tests collected at every study visit for review of potential side effects such as kidney function and an increase in size of red blood cells. Your doctor will monitor these results during the study and refer you for further tests if they are required. If possible side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting occur, you will be offered
medication to control these symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A safety assessment should be performed 30 - 42 days after the last dose of study treatment and must include any adverse events occurring within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the activity of olaparib in the HGSOC cohort as determined by the CA125 response according to GCIG criteria. </outcome>
      <timepoint>CA125 response is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients with confirmed CA125 response according to GCIG criteria in the HGSOC tumour cohort. This assessment will occur approximately 6 - 12 months after the objective tumour response rate is assessed.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>A two-stage Simon design will be used for enrolment of patients in each cohort (10 in stage 1 and 20 in stage 2). This sample size of 30 patients per cohort (60 total) will give 80% power and 95% confidence to exclude response rates of 10% to 15% in favour of an informative rate of 30% to 35% for the breast and ovarian cohorts respectively.
The primary analysis will be a calculation of the Objective Tumour Response Rate (OTRR) in each tumour cohort according to RECIST v1.1 (proportion of evaluable patients with confirmed Complete or Partial Response).

    <summary>This study is testing olaparib, in Homologous recombination (HR) deficient metastatic breast and relapsed ovarian cancer in patients who do not have hereditary mutations in BReast CAncer susceptibility gene 1 and gene 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2). 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and are either: a) men or women with confirmed evidence of metastatic triple negative breast cancer OR b) women with confirmed evidence of relapsed high grade serous ovarian cancer or high grade endometrioid ovarian cancer

Study details
All study participants will take olaparib 300 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Assessments for safety and efficacy will be followed up for a minimum of 6 months

Olaparib, has been approved overseas and in Australia in women shown to have inherited changes in their BRCA1 or 2 genes. There is strong evidence to show that olaparib will also work in people who do not have any changes in their genes. The purpose of this study is to assess whether the olaparib is effective in treating these tumours.
