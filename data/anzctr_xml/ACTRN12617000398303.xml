  <interventions>
    <interventions>Irrespective of which group the neonate will be randomised to, all study subjects will have access to systemic opioid analgesia by titratable intravenous infusion as per the current unit policy. 
INTRA-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF BOTH GROUPS:
Anaesthesia will be conducted according to current standards of care at the Children's Hospital at Westmead with several provisos. Anaesthesia induction will be either gaseous (oxygen and sevoflurane with or without nitrous oxide) or intravenously at the discretion of the consultant anaesthetist. Muscle relaxation (vecuronium or cis-atracurium), ventilation and intra-operative opioid analgesia will similarly be at the discretion of the anaesthetist. Intra-venous paracetamol will be administered regularly (10mg/Kg/dose qid for 72hours) and may commence intra-operatively. Adjunct analgesic agents such as  IV NSAIDs, ketamine, dexmeditomidine and clonidine will not be used. At the conclusion of surgery and before wound closure, a multi-hole wound catheter (appropriate to the size of the wound) will be inserted under direct vision in babies randomised to treatment group (see below). A bolus dose of local anaesthetic agent (0.3mL/Kg 0.25% Bupivacaine) will be injected through the catheter after wound closure. The catheter will then be capped until return to the Grace Centre of Newborn Care. The decision to extubate the baby at the conclusion of the surgery will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist.
When the incision is closed, the transversus abdominis muscle with/without the peritoneum is closed first. The multi-orifice 19-gauge wound catheter of length 2.5 or 6.5 cm according to the length of the surgical incision is placed superficial to this layer but deep to the internal oblique so that the local anaesthetic/normal saline delivered can come in close contact with the cutaneous nerves which is embedded between the transversus and internal oblique muscle. The internal oblique and external oblique muscles are closed in one layer on top of the wound catheter. A transparent dressing will be applied on the skin. Immediately after skin closure, following a negative aspiration test to confirm that the tip of the catheter is not inserted intravenously, a bolus dose of bupivacaine will be administered through the wound catheter in babies who were randomised to treatment group.
TREATMENT GROUP:
Treatment group will have their wound catheters connected to a continuous infusion of bupivacaine (0.125%) after four hours from the surgery. The infusions will run at 0.16mL/kg/hr for 72 hours.
CONTROL GROUP:
Management of postoperative pain will be as per the current unit protocol. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Management of postoperative pain will be as per the current unit protocol which includes  continuous intravenous infusion of morphine or fentanyl, intermittent boluses of morphine and/or IV paracetamol</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The cumulative amount of intravenous opioid dose per patient per kg of body weight during the first 72 hours following the surgery. This will be a sum of continuous infusion and the intermittent boluses of morphine. The dose of morphine given by continuous infusion will be calculated at the end of IV morphine infusion by multiplying the time (to the closest 15 min) and dose (microgram/kg/hr). If the baby receives fentanyl infusion and/or intermittent boluses, they will be converted to an equivalent dose of morphine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>72 hours from the closure of the abdominal wound in the theatre.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain scores: The pain is assessed by the nurse looking after the baby using the Pain Assessment Tool (PAT). Pain scores will be recorded every 2 hours for first 24hours starting from the closure of laparotomy wound and then 4 hourly for the next seven days or until discharge home.  If the baby is transferred to another hospital or ward, they will be provided with the information sheet about scoring the pain and recording.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>All the continuous variables will be reported as mean (standard deviation) if they are normally distributed or median (interquartile range) if not. Differences between the groups will be examined by student's t-test for continuous variables or appropriate non-parametric alternative and relative risk for categorical outcomes. The pain scores will be analysed by comparing the maximum / minimum pain scores between the groups over the 72hours following the surgery. The statistical analysis will be intention to treat' i.e. all the study participants are included in the analysis as part of their original group to which they were randomised regardless of whether they complete the study or not or whether they took the intended treatment or not. The R software for statistical computing' will be used for all statistical analyses and construction of graphs.
If there are any losses to follow up or where three year outcomes are not possible to be ascertained, we will perform sensitivity analysis. This is done by assigning the worst outcomes to treatment group and best outcomes to the control group. </statisticalmethods>
