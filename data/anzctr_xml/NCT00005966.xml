  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells. Thalidomide
      may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known if
      interferon alfa-2b is more effective with or without thalidomide in treating kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b with
      or without thalidomide in treating patients who have previously untreated metastatic or
      unresectable kidney cancer.</summary>
