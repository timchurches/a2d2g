  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will participate in a 10-week exercise program, FIT for PLAY.  The program will include 2x45 minute small group sessions per week (n=6) of Fundamental Integrative Training.  Sessions will include a 10-minute warm-up of dynamic stretches and a fun game; followed by 25 minutes of activities designed to develop participants strength, aerobic fitness and fundamental movement skills.  Aerobic activities will be moderate to high intensity (minimum 12 RPE). A 10-15-minute game-play activity e.g. modified basketball, soccer etc. will also be completed.  This will be used to apply the skills developed throughout the session, as well as rule following and team work skills. Finally a 5 minute cool down of stretching will be performed.  Education around physical activity, and its importance will be woven into each session to assist children to have a sound knowledge of physical activity upon program completion. These sessions will be completed at the Pathways centre, Shenton Park, under the supervision of a Sports Science graduate and Occupational Therapist. 
 
Participants will also participate in one 30 minute exercise challenge each week, comprising of aerobic, strength, and fundamental movement skill development activities.  The physical challenge will be prescribed by the research team (including exercise physiologists and occupational therapists, specialising in paediatrics), designed specifically to target individuals physical activity based goals.  Participants will be encouraged to complete it in their own time, using any facilities available to them with the help of a parent/guardian.  The purpose of this challenge is to encourage self-motivation to participate in physical activity.  

FIT for PLAY will be implemented into a pre-existing 10-week therapeutic day program (Pathways) for children with severe internalising and externalising behaviours.  Children attend the therapeutic day program twice a week.  FIT for PLAY will be implemented into the Pathways timetable so will be completed twice a week for the duration of the 10-week program.  Attendance at the Pathways program twice a week for 10-weeks is compulsory, therefore it is anticipated that unless children are unable to attend Pathways due to illness or otherwise, there will be no problems with program adherence. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will not receive an exercise intervention.  They will continue to participate in the therapeutic day program that they are enrolled in, adhering to the current timetable that does not involve FIT for PLAY.  Contact time will be kept constant between the experimental groups. </comparator>

    <inclusivecriteria>Children must have a mental health disorder and be enrolled in the Pathways therapeutic day program - a specialised unit conducted by the Western Australian Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service - within the research time frame.  
Before entering the program, children participate in a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment including psychiatric, educational, psychological, occupational therapy and speech pathology evaluation.

    <statisticalmethods>Physical Activity levels and physical literacy outcomes will be compared between the intervention and control groups using a mixed model to allow within and between group comparisons over the four time points. Time will be entered into the mixed model as a categorical/dummy variable. In addition, baseline and potential confounders will be entered into this model. 
On account of the heterogeneous nature of the participants, the baseline characteristics of the outcomes in each group will be compared to ensure clinical comparability. In the case that model fit and assumptions are not met and transformations are not successful then non-parametric methods may be utilised.
Due to limited research being conducted on exercise and physical activity for children (6-12yrs) with mental health disorders, it has not yet been possible to determine a detectable effect size for this project and thus conduct a power calculation.  Alternatively, an ad hoc sample size calculation based on the first two groups of participants will be conducted.  The current sample size of 96 allows for the inclusion of all children attending the Pathways therapeutic day program throughout the recruitment period. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A mental health disorder (MHD) affects how a person thinks, behaves and interacts with others.  People diagnosed with MHDs have poorer health than the general population, which is concerning as MHDs affect approximately one in seven children/adolescents each year. 

Physical activity (PA) participation is fundamental to good health, with benefits including increases in strength, plus improved bone, heart and mental health. Developing good PA habits throughout childhood is important, as active children are more likely to become active adults.  This project therefore aims to develop, implement and evaluate an exercise program designed to improve the PA levels of children with a MHD through developing their physical literacy.  

Physical literacy is a concept surrounding the motivation, confidence, physical ability, knowledge, and understanding required to value PA and take individual responsibility for PA throughout life. Physically literate individuals are more likely to be physically active because they enjoy movement, and have a positive attitude towards PA.  Children diagnosed with a MHD often have many barriers to being physically active including poor movement skills, and low strength and fitness compared to their peers.  These barriers can negatively impact PA therefore, improving a childs physical literacy, may assist them in becoming more physically active, resulting in a positive effect on their overall health.

This exercise intervention, will be implemented into the Pathways therapeutic day program, a specialist unit within the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS).  The Pathways day program is for primary school-aged students with anxiety, behavioural and mood MHDs.  Children will be allocated to one of two groups; Group 1 will continue the normal Pathways program; and Group 2 will participate in a 10-week exercise intervention in addition to their normal Pathways program.  The exercise intervention will include 20 group sessions, with a focus on physical competence, knowledge, understanding and motivation for PA.  Family involvement will be encouraged through education sessions and homework exercise sessions.  

The primary outcomes include PA levels and physical literacy (physical competence; motivation and confidence for PA; knowledge and understanding).  Using a knowledge translation plan the outcomes of this research will be implemented into clinical practice across CAMHS. Project partners (patients/families, the public, clinicians, policy makers, mangers) will be engaged through all stages of the research process.  The outcomes of this study will assist in improving the PA levels of children with MHDs.    </summary>
