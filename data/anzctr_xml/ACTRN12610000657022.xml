  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised crossover trial involves three consecutive days (total duration=21 hours) of prolonged sitting with intermittent light-intensity activity breaks. Participants will remain seated for the initial 80mins (steady-state) period, after which they will complete a 2 min bout of light-intensity walking activity on a treadmill (level, firm surface, slow pace - 3.2km/hr). Participants will then return to the seated position. The light-intensity walking breaks will be repeated on another 16 occasions every 20 mins during a 7 hour period (total walking time=34mins).
There is a 7 day 'wash-out' period between the intervention and comparator condition.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Interested volunteers will receive written information about the study in lay terms and a full description of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent and background information, the potential participants will be screened to confirm eligibility. Once a potential subject has been deemed eligible, the subject will be randomised to the order of experimental conditions. The method for allocation concealment is closed envelopes. The allocation information will be placed in numbered envelopes (1 allocation per envelope) by an independent researcher. After a subject has been enrolled in the study, the study co-ordinators will contact an independent staff member to ask for the sequence of experimental conditions. The independent staff member will keep a log of the date and time the envelope was opened, the envelope number, the initials and gender of the participant and the order of experimental conditions. The study co-ordinator will also keep a record of this information.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation allocation sequence will be generated using computer â€“generated random numbers in a Latin-square experimental design.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is emerging evidence that people who break up their sitting time with activity breaks (such as light walking) may have better blood glucose and blood fat levels than people who sit for prolonged periods without activity breaks. This study aims to test the cumulative effects of three consecutive seven hour days of prolonged sitting on blood glucose and blood fat levels with and without intermittent breaks of light-intensity activity.</summary>
