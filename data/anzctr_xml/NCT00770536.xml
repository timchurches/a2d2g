    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - A1: AMG 386 10 mg/kg + Liposomal doxorubicin

Treatment: drugs - B1: AMG 386 10 mg/kg + Topotecan
Treatment: drugs - B3: AMG 386 15mg/kg + Topotecan

Experimental: Part 1 - In part 1, six subjects will be assigned to each cohort A or B. This is a dose escalation/de escalation study with a 6 + 3 design based on the incidence of DLTs (dose limiting toxicities) during the first 4 weeks of combined therapy [(cohort A: AMG 386 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) or (cohort B: AMG 386 and topotecan)].

Experimental: Part 2 - The decision on declaration of a safe and tolerable dose during part 1 will lead to part 2 (cohort A: liposomal doxorubicin + AMG 386 MTD (max tolerated dose) of part 1, cohort B: Topotecan + AMG 386 MTD (max tolerated dose) of part 1

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a 2 part, 2 cohort, open-label, dose escalation/de escalation study of AMG 386
      in combination with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan in subjects with
      recurrent ovarian cancer. Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled to receive AMG 386 in
      combination with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin every 4 weeks (cohort A) or topotecan
      weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day dosing schedule (cohort B). Subject enrollment and
      assignment to either cohort will be based on eligibility and the investigator's discretion.

      It is hypothesized that AMG 386, in combination with each of the chemotherapy regimens:
      either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan will be safe and well tolerated in
      subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer.</summary>
