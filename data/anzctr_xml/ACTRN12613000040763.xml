  <interventions>
    <interventions>There is no intervention for this study as it is a microbiological audit of the drugs administered during anaesthesia. We propose to incorporate a 0.2micron filter unit into the drug administration line while the patient is in the operating theatre. This involves a small change in current practice which we believe is benign. Twenty participant anaesthetists will manage up to 20 surgical cases each until 300 cases in total have been completed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The detection, identification and enumeration of microorganisms from IV drugs administered during anaesthesia. 
A commercial sterile 0.2micron filter unit will be incorporated into the IV line; all drugs except antibiotics and propofol (due to its pharmaceutical characteristics) will be administered through this filter unit. At the conclusion of the case the filter unit will be disconnected from the IV and removed for further analysis. In the laboratory the filter unit will be back-flushed with a test solution and the eluate examined for contamination. This method has been validated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The filter unit will be inserted into the IV administration line at the beginning of the case (just after the patient is transported into theatre) and removed at the end (as the patient is revived). The laboratory testing will commence after this time.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Contamination can come from a number of sources within an OT; one potentially significant source is the airborne environment. In order to monitor this contamination a blood agar plate will be placed on top of the medication trolley and opened prior to the start of each case. At the conclusion of the case the blood agar plate will be closed and transported to the laboratory for incubation at 37oC for 48 hours. Any growth will be examined to identify the micro-organisms present. This method is consistent with our previous research. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The blood agar plate will be opened at the start of each surgical case (at induction) and closed at the end (as the patient is revived).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The detection and identification of microbiological contamination of syringes and needles used to prepare and administer IV drugs during anaesthesia. Syringes (with residual volume greater than 0.5mL) and needles used to prepare and administer drugs to patients during each case will be analysed. Any that are closed with a syringe cap or needle and cap by the participants will be labelled as such. Those that are uncapped will be capped by researchers. Loose needles will not be collected as it is assumed these will not be used again. The articles collected will be kept refrigerated until analysed. This method has used in previous research.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Syringes and needles used to prepare and administer drugs to patients during each case (from patient induction to revival) will be analysed.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study follows on from previous research carried out in the Advanced Clinical Skills Centre simulation centre at Mercy Hospital in Auckland. We found bacterial growth in 13.1% (n=5/38) of empty sterile IV bags used to collect all administered medications from ten surgical scenarios. In the current study we aim to detect and quantify the microbiological contamination of drugs prepared and administered to patients during clinical anaesthesia in theatre. We aim to test the hypothesis that the microbiological contamination rate of IV drugs administered during anaesthesia occurs sufficiently often to be detected at least once in ten cases.
This previous body of research was a substudy of a larger study "Validating Anaesthesia Simulation-based
Error Research (the VASER study)" ACTRN12609000530224
