    <interventions>Leadership Training (Year 10 Girls)

Over a 6 hour period, Year 10 girls will receive leadership training by an experienced physical educator that will enable them to successfully implement the GLAMA program.

The leadership training will be administerd during classtime in an informal lecture environment with discussion, activities to reinforce concepts and feedback provided. Leaders have their own manual to work through.

The leadership training focuses on the following topics: communication, leadership skills, dealing with groups, problem solving, decision making, motivation, and the GLAMA activities.


The leadership training will be followed by supported implementation of the GLAMA program within two Year 7 Physical Education (PE) classes with the same Year 7 girls on each occasion. The ratio is one leader to 4-5 Year 7 girls.

There will be follow-up leader only focus groups after the implementation in the PE classes. An important element of the leadership program is to provide the Year 10 girls with the skills to implement the GLAMA program independently over three lunchtimes.  The focus groups will be once weekly after the implementation of the activities. 

GLAMA program (Year 7 Girls)
Year 7 girls will be provided with the GLAMA program by the Year 10 girls during their regular timetabled physical education classtime for 2 weeks. The total duration is 1 x physical education class (120minutes) per week for two weeks. They will be supported by an experienced physical educator and their normal PE staff.

A further three lunchtime GLAMA sessions will be provided by the Year 10 girls. These lunchtime sessions will go for a total of 30 minutes, once a week for 3 weeks.

The activities are a combination of physical, cognitive and team building activities based on amazing race and adventure racing concepts.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The GLAMA study is a pilot program to evaluate the provision of leadership training to Year 10 girls so they can implement physical activities during Physical Education with Year 7 students and then independently during lunchtimes. The activities have been designed to provide opportunities for thinking, team work and physical activity to promote positive attitudes to physical activity.</summary>
