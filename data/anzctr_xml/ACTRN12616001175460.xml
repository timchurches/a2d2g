  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo an extended oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at their annual scheduled OGTT. This study will measure insulin and glucose at 30 minutes and 3 hours in addition to routine fasting, 1-hour and 2-hour measurements. Blood samples will also be collected at each of the 5 timepoints to measure additional hormones including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory protein (GIP). </interventions>
    <comparator>Controls will be pre-transplant, non-liver disease patients at the RPA CF clinic who have normal glucose tolerance, have not had hypoglycaemia on previous OGTT or reported symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to identify the prevalence of hypoglycaemia during extended OGTTs and associations with biochemical parameters relevant to glucose metabolism. In particular, this study will explore the role of glucagon and the incretins GLP-1 and GIP in reactive hypoglycaemia during OGTTs. </summary>
