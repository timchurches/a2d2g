  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention is provided through a clinical assessment for diabetic retinopathy at the Sutherland Hospital ophthalmology department in the form of a face-to-face consult with an attending ophthalmologist. The assessment will consist of standard clinical care including, but not limited to, patient history, VA assessment, pupil assessment, slit lamp examination, tonometry, pupil dilation, Optomap imaging, retinal photography, or optical coherence tomography as clinically appropriate. Time of the intervention will vary, but is expected to take 1-2 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient time ratio
Patient time ratio (PTR), defined as ratio between the complete patient appointment time (time from arrival of the patient to check-out) in relation to patient consultation time (time spent with a clinician) will be obtained from data recorded in collection form B during each examination and compared between control and intervention cohort as a measure of efficiency of service provision. Results will further be visualized through process mapping in either arm of the clinical trial. Clinical data collected in data form C will be used to assess whether service provision is dependent on patient or disease associated variables.

    <statisticalmethods>Paired t-test will be applied to calculate differences between the intervention and control groups. Multivariate analysis will be applied to PTR and time since last eye exam to quantify the effect of diabetes type, risk factors, known complications, presence and stage of diabetic retiopathy, blood test results, patients age and ethnicity on clinical services and access. Descriptive statistics will be applied to investigate patient satisfaction at either side using results from obtained survey data.
False positive and negative rates will be calculated for all potentially vision threatening or severe conditions that require ophthalmological review either immediately or within up to one week.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vision related problems, commonly associated with increasing age and chronic disease burden, amount to $16 billion annual costs in Australia and challenge the provision of cost-effective, accessible, and timely care for patients with chronic disorders. Visual impairment and blindness as a consequence of diabetes have increased by 64% and 27% respectively worldwide between 1990 and 2010. In Australia, diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in working-age people. Referral refinement schemes and shared-care models have recently been implemented internationally to manage patients with glaucoma, [3-7] and alternative care pathways for other conditions have been investigated. [8-10] These models integrate optometrists in the care of patients with chronic stable conditions, or in need of long-term at-risk disease monitoring, thus effectively focusing specialist and hospital care for patients with urgent or complicated conditions. 

TSH provides care to a large cohort of patients with diabetes, typically under the care of an endocrinologist, many currently do not receive appropriate levels of eye care. Patients also have access to an integrated care unit (HealthOne), which provides diabetes education, health and legal advice. In collaboration with CFEH, TSH recently established the first hospital-based optometry clinic in Australia as part of this multidisciplinary team to make eye health care available to all patients with diabetes and support the development of integrated patient management between general practitioners, specialists and allied health professionals. 

This study will investigate the first hospital-based model of integrating optometry into a multidisciplinary approach to prevent vision related complications in patients suffering from diabetes. Successful implementation of this model would not only reduce the incidence of diabetic retinopathy in Australia, but provide a foundation for the provision of sustainable, accessible, and efficient eye health care for patients with diabetes. To investigate the potential of this model within the current setting as well as its potential for implementation in other hospitals, we will assess:
	suitability of patients for shared cared; 
	clinical status of patient cohorts; 
	patient satisfaction and quality of life;
	cost analysis of the new model.
