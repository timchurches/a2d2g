    <interventions>Placement of Supraglottic Airway Devices - either I-gel or Proseal LMA under anaesthesia. Pre and Post operative strobolaryngoscopy and phonetic analysis of voice
I-gel is a newly introduced supraglottic airway device, classified as a cuff less pharyngeal sealer. After administration of general anesthesia and muscle relaxation, airway is placed in oropharynx with tip resting in the upper esophageal sphincter. Square wave capon gram and effective chest raise confirms satisfactory placement.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control- Proseal LMA
Proseal LMA is among the most commonly used supraglottic  airway devices during anesthesia, classified as a cuffed peri laryngeal sealer with directional sealing and drain tube for stomach. After administration of general anesthesia and muscle relaxation, airway is placed in oropharynx with tip resting in the upper esophageal sphincter. After cuff inflation and ventilation, square wave capon gram and effective chest raise confirms satisfactory placement.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postopertive pharyngolaryngeal morbidity including phonatory changes
Phonatory changes are assessed perceptively by speech pathologist by classifying the voice into normal, rough, breathy and asthenia patterns. Phonetic analysis of voice is performed and jitter, shimmer and Harmonic to Noise ratio are analysed as indicators of micro instability of vocal cords</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Vocal cord dysfunction
Phonetic analysis of voice is done by using PRAAT software. Jitter, Shimmer and Harmonic to Noise ratio are analysed which are found to correlate with micro instability of vocal cords</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Nerve palsies with Proseal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) are attributed to nerve compression by the inflated cuff. Cuffless anatomically pre-shaped sealers like Igel airway (IGA) may minimize nerve compression. 
Materials and methods: Ninety ASA1 adults scheduled for surgeries lasting up to 60 to 120 min were included in the study. Participants were randomly allocated to group PLMA (n=43) and group IGA (n=43). Vocal cord function was evaluated by strobolaryngoscopy, perceptive and phonetic analysis of voice (Jitter, Shimmer and Harmonic to Noise Ratio) preoperatively and 24 hours after surgery. Voice of patients with pharyngolaryngeal complaints was categorized into rough, breathy, asthenic, strain or normal pattern.
Results: Jitter (p&lt;0.002), Shimmer (p&lt;0.000) and Harmonic to noise ratio deteriorated significantly in both groups albeit the change being similar in both groups. Incidence of pharyngolaryngeal complaints was 20% and 22.5% in group PLMA and IGA respectively. 10% patients in group PLMA and 12.5% in group IGA developed breathy voice and demonstrated significant deterioration in all phonetic variables. Vocal fold anomalies on stroboscopy were detected in 2 patients in each group. 
Conclusion: PLMA and IGA both produce significant deterioration in phonetic variables suggesting vocal cord dysfunction after 1  2 hours of anaesthesia.
