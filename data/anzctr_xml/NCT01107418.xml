    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) - Confirmed best overall response was defined as having best objective response as CR or PR, as assessed by investigator and confirmed at least 28 days after initial response. Tumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) were required to demonstrate a reduction to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 millimeters [mm]). PR was defined as a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum diameter. Percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed CR or PR are reported.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label study will assess the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of RO5185426
      administered as 240mg tablets in previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma.
      Patients will be randomized to receive one of four dose-levels of RO5185426 [RG7204;
      PLEXXIKON; PLX4032] orally twice daily on days 1 to 15 (morning dose). Starting on day 22,
      treatment with RO5185426 may be resumed at a dose of 960 mg twice daily and continued until
      disease progression. Target sample size is &lt;100 patients.</summary>
