  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers will consume a 1500mg dose of Avena sativa extract (Neuravena 'registered trade mark') daily for 12 weeks. This supplement will be delivered orally in capsule form. Subjects will have three separate visits to the Nutritional Physiology Research Centre (of 2 hours duration each). Following a baseline visit they will be randomised to consume a placebo or a 1500mg dose of Neuravena 'registered trade mark' for 12 weeks, after which they will cross over to the alternate treatment. The visits will 12 weeks apart. The time between the final measurement on the first supplement and first measurement after the crossover will be 12 weeks, this will serve as the washout period. At each visit resting supine clinic blood pressure will be measured following internationally recognised guidelines. This will be followed by measurement of cerebral blood flow during a carbon dioxide (CO2) challenge. Participants will then perform tests of attention, concentration, the ability to ignore distraction and to inhibit task-irrelevant information, namely the Stroop test, the Letter Cancellation task, the Rule Shift task, the Trail-Making test, the Dual Span Memory Task, and a multitasking Computerised Battery. Current mood will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scales, the mood states include: relaxed, alert, jittery, tired, tense, headache, mental fatigue and overall mood. These measures will be repeated at each visit.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo capsules (control treatment) are identical in appearance to the active capsules but contain an inert filler consisting of Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) of various particle sizes including Prosolv 50 and talcum powder (hydrated magnesium silicate). This supplement will be delivered orally in capsule form. Subjects will have three separate visits to the Nutritional Physiology Research Centre (of 2 hours duration each). Following a baseline visit they will be randomised to consume the control treatment or a 1500mg dose of Neuravena 'registered trade mark' for 12 weeks, after which they will cross over to the alternate treatment. The visits will be 12 weeks apart. At each visit resting supine clinic blood pressure will be measured following internationally recognised guidelines. This will be followed by measurement of cerebral blood flow during a carbon dioxide (CO2) challenge. Participants will then perform tests of attention, concentration, the ability to ignore distraction and to inhibit task-irrelevant information, namely the Stroop test, the Letter Cancellation task, the Rule Shift task, the Trail-Making test, the Dual Span Memory Task, and a multitasking Computerised Battery.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Stroop test.

This test requires participants to read the names of colours and then name the colours in which incongruent colour names are printed. The ratio between time taken to name colours compared with reading colour names reflects the degree of interference afforded by suppressing the habit of reading words in order to name colours. Uncorrected errors during the colour naming trial reflect failures of inhibition. Blood pressure responses to the Stroop test will be measured continuously using a Finapres 'registered trade mark' blood pressure monitor.</outcome>

Volunteers will be screened via questionnaire to assess their eligibility for the trial. Eligibility will be determined by the study coordinator.

Volunteers will be required to consume each supplement (active or placebo) daily for 12 weeks, then crossed over to alternate dose, the order will be determined by a random number generator. Doses will be allocated a letter A or B for identification.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Avena sativa (oats), in its various forms and extracts, has been traditionally known for its physical and psychological fortifying properties. Proposed beneficial effects include: reduced risk of heart disease, raised energy levels, increased ability to cope with stress, reduced anxiety and depression, and increased physical and cognitive performance.

The mechanism of effect is currently unknown. However, it has been suggested that some ingredient(s) found in green oats have clinically significant inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), effects which may improve cerebral vasodilatation. As enhancement of cerebral blood flow by vasoactive nutrients has been hypothesised to improve cognitive function, this may be the mechanism by which oat extract could improve cognitive performance and stress response.

The aim of this study is to examine the effect of daily consumption of Neuravena for 12 weeks on the ability to cope with stressful cognitive tasks, cognitive performance and on psychological well-being (mood) and whether these effects are mediated by changes in cerebral blood flow.</summary>
