  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to discover if giving patients with severe kidney failure ascorbate (vitamin C) reduces symptoms that are common to both renal failure and ascorbate deficiency.  It is known that low ascorbate levels are common in patients with severe kidney failure, and that symptoms of scurvy (ascorbate deficiency) and of kidney failure (uraemic syndrome) overlap.  There is however no consensus on whether ascorbate supplementation is beneficial in patients with severe kidney disease and there are concerns that supplementation may cause adverse effects.  This study would significantly improve clinical care, by examining the benefits and adverse outcomes of supplementation.</summary>
