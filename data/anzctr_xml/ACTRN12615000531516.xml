    <exclusivecriteria>1.	Women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding

2.	Clinically significant laboratory findings showing evidence of organ   dysfunction, any clinically significant deviation from the normal range, or clinically significant physical exam abnormalities at screening, as evaluated by the Investigator

3.	Any ongoing co-morbidity or dermatological condition (e.g., psoriasis, eczema, severe acne requiring treatment) that in the opinion of the Investigator will interfere with the evaluation and participation in the trial

4.	The presence of tattoos on the forearm, chest, or abdominal region that could interfere with the evaluation of safety and study endpoints in the trial

5.	Any medical condition that could put the patient at increased risk with exposure to an anti-CGRP antibody such as pre-existing cardiovascular (hypertension, ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or Raynauds disease

6.	Use of any concomitant medications within 14 days of dosing, unless authorized by the Sponsor and/or PI

7.	Onset of a new exercise routine or major change to a previous exercise routine within 2 weeks prior to screening visit. Subjects must be willing to refrain from unusually strenuous exercise for the duration of the trial

8.	12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt; 450 msec at Screening. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTcF values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility

9.	Hospitalization for any reason within 30 days of the screening visit

10.	History of or positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and/or Hepatitis C antibody (HCV) at screening
