    <interventions>This study is investigating whether the use of inversion therapy may reduce pain in chronic LBP patients, where it is thought that the pain is associated with the intervertebral disc (i.e. discogenic pain),  According to a heuristic assessment protocol of a prominent Musculoskeletal Pain Specialist with many years experience of using Inversion therapy for LBP.
In this study inversion therapy will be performed using the Teeter tilt-table.
We are looking to test whether four weeks of at-home inversion therapy is beneficial for people who have had LBP for more than six months, either with or without leg symptoms, which is suspected to involve the disc, and which has not settled with conventional therapy.  
If participants are randomised into the inversion group (and have tolerated the inversion at the initial appointment and prior to randomisation), a tilt-table inversion machine will be delivered to their home for the four weeks of the trial.  They may also continue with their usual care, as directed by the specialist.  They will be expected to complete the inversion to 45 degrees, for 3 sets of 2 minutes (with 1 minute rest - in the upright position - between the 3 sets), twice (2 times) a day.  So this would require 20 minutes a day.  Also to encourage fidelity amongst the inversion group we will be asking them to complete a daily inversion diary.

It is well accepted, with respect to LBP, that the research, the current assessment and management knowledge is lmited, consequently it is difficult to be confident in the definition and diagnosis of LBP.  We are basing our assessment of likely discogenic LBP on the work of Waddell (1987, 2005), Chou et al., (2007), and Chanda et al., (2011) concerning the diagnositic triage; as well as the work of Bogduk (2009) on referred pain; and researchers who have undertaken studies to help rule out hip (Brown et al., 2004), and SIJ disorders (Laslett et al., 2003; Szadek et al., 2009).
So the heuristic assessment protocol (detailed within the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria with respect to discogenic LBP) that we are testing (as well as the effect of inversion on this particular presentation of LBP) is based upon these sources.  It is not 'newly developed' per se, as it is used in clinical practice but, in itself, has not been previously studied or validated;

</interventions>
    <comparator>If participants are randomised into the usual care group, then they will continue with their usual care, as directed by the specialist.  Usual care is to include advice and continuation with usual treatment that the participant is undertaking and in consultation with relevant referers such as GPs,  physiotherapy, osteopathy, acupuncture etc.  Because the participants have chronic pain on more than 50% of days over at least 6 months duration, and failed conservative treatment, it is expected that their current usual care has been ineffectual.

    <statisticalmethods>120 participants in total (60 to each group) will be necessary for any statistically significant results to be obtained in our primary outcome measure, the NPRS (an 11-point scale that rates pain from 0 to 10).  This is based on the study on inversion by Prasad et al., (2012), using the standard deviation of 2.7 points, with a power of 90%, and looking for a difference of two points or a reduction of approximately 30% to represent a minimal clinical important difference that exceeds the bounds of measurement error in the NPRS (Childs et al., 2005; Farrar et al., 2001; Ostelo et al., 2008).  It also allows for around a 10% drop out rate. 
We will analyse the results as intention-to-treat and also per-protocol.
The NPRS (analysed separately for back and leg), ODI and PROMIS-29  (T-scores as analysed by the Assessment Center Scoring System as recommended by PROMIS from our inputed raw scores from the seven individual profile domains) will be compared with a mixed model analysis of covariance with terms from group (intervention or control), patient with group, time (4 or 12 weeks), group x time interaction, and baseline pain score as the covariate.  Pain Medication will be analysed with a ordinal logistic regression. This does not assume equal spacing but equal odds ratios of going from one level to the next (this assumption can be checked). The method would be a mixed ordinal logistic regression with terms from group (intervention or control), patient with group, time (4 or 12 weeks), group x time interaction, and baseline pain meds score. The GPE will be compared with a mixed model analysis of variance (no baseline - so no covariate).  The statistical analysis will utilise the SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 
So we will be looking for any statistical significant and clinically significant differences between the inversion and control group in the baseline adjusted values at 4 and 12 weeks.
Also are those differences (4 and 12 week baseline adjusted group differences) statistically significant and clinically significantly different. I.e. is the effect of the inversion different at 4 and 12 weeks.
We are expecting to describe the continuous variables with means and SD and 95%CI for their differences. If the they are not close to a normal distribution then we would use medians.
We are assuming normally distributed data, but may make an alteration if this assumption seem unreasonable.

The Open Qualitative question given to the Inversion group will be analysed utilising the qualitative description (QD) method as it can openly borrow from other qualitative designs (Neergaard, Olesen, Andersen, &amp; Sondergaard, 2009; Sandelowski, 2000), within a descriptive thematic approach framework, to identify the common themes associated with each patients experience of inversion.</statisticalmethods>
