    <interventions>1. High intensity interval stationary cycle exercise training at 95% of maximum exercise capacity for 15-20 minutes (although patients will be required to be rpesent for 45-50 minutes to assess and prepare then and conduct warm-up/cool-down)them, thrice weekly for an overall duration of the training program of 6 months.
This gorup will exercise for 4 minutes and rest for 1 minute and then repeat this exercise;rest pattern 3-4 more times. Interval exercise with be preceded by a 5-10 minute warm-up and 5-10 minute cool down.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to build on the work by Wisoff 2007 published in circulation that showed superior benefits of high intensity interval training over moderate intensity continuous training in heart failure patients. It is hoped that with a larger sample size and longer follow up and intervention period the primary outcome, mortality will be significantly improved.</summary>
