  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is limited information on the long-term effects of treating patients with MPS VI with
      NaglazymeÂ® and limited data on the natural history of treated and untreated MPS VI patients.
      The Re-survey Study ASB-00-03 will assist in understanding the effects of long-term Naglazyme
      treatment and the natural history of the MPS VI patient population.</summary>
