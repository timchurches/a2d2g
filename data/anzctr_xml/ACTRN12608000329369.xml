  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparison of on-eye performance of marketed contact lenses to establish compatibility with commercially available lens care products (solutions). The comparison will involve evaluation of ocular health, lens performance on-eye and subjective responses with these lenses when used up to 3 months on a daily wear or extended wear and disposal schedule.
A range of 19 different contact lens brands (O2OPTIX [Trade mark], NIGHT &amp; DAY, DAILIES AquaComfort Plus [Registered trade mark], ACUVUE ADVANCE [Trade mark], ACUVUE OASYS [Trade mark], ACUVUE 2 [Registered trade mark],1-DAY ACUVUE, 1-DAY ACUVUE. MOIST [Trade mark], Biofinity, Proclear, SofLens One Day, Biomedics One Day, Day by Day, Clear 1 Day, Gelflex 1 Day, PureVision [Trade mark], Avaira [Trade mark], AIR OPTIX [Trade mark], Aqua, AIR OPTIX Individual [Registered trade mark]),will each be combined with one of six different contact lens solutions (AOSept Plus, AQuify, ReNu MultiPlus, OPTI-FREE EXPRESS, OPTI-FREE RepleniSH, COMPLETE Multi-Purpose Solution Easy Rub [Trade mark] Formula). Each contact lens/solution combination will be administered to a minimum of 40 subjects who are involved in a trial for a period of 3 months. Within this 3 month period, each subject will be wearing only one contact lens brand and solution combination. There can be up to 50 different contact lens/solution combinations trialled over a 5 year period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: To evaluate the on-eye performance and response of marketed contact lenses and contact lens solutions. The primary outcome will be measured by the evaluation of comfort of lenses on-eye and determination of physiological response to contact lens and contact lens solution combinations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months and 3 months of contact lens wear</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 1: To evaluate which combinations of marketed contact lenses and contact lens solutions perform best with each other. This is measured by observing ocular variables including redness, corneal and conjunctival staining.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months and 3 months of contact lens wear</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants enrolled in the trial must:
- be able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent;
- be at least 18 years old;
- be willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator;
- have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses;
- have vision correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses on a standard Bailey-Lovie logMAR distance letter chart (For a person to see 6/12 or better, this person needs to be able to distinguish clearly an object at 6 metres away that the 'average' person can distinguish at 12 metres away, 20/40 is the equivalent measurement in feet);
- may be experienced or inexperienced at wearing contact lenses.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Participants enrolled in the trial must NOT have:
- Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
- Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosis. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
- A need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication up to 12 weeks prior to and during the trial;
- Any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner;
N.B. Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial;  
- Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
- Previous corneal refractive surgery;
- Contraindications to contact lens wear;
- Known allergy to ingredients in contact lens solutions;
- Currently enrolled in another clinical trial;
- Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks or participation in an inhouse clinical trial within the previous 48 hours;
- Be pregnant* 
- Allergy or intolerance to topical anaesthetics 

The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, exclude anyone else who they believe may not be able to fulfil the study requirements, or if it is believed to be in the participants best interests.

*Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient.</exclusivecriteria>
