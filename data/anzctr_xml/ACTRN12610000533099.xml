  <interventions>
    <interventions>To investigate the benefits of a 12-week intervention involving 10 weekly treatment sessions delivered by a physiotherapist on a one-to-one basis.
This is a 12 week intervention because prior to meeting the physiotherapist at week 1 and week 12 the participant will attend the university for laboratory assesssment and we will request that the participant wear a pedometer for 7 days straight and record the number of steps they have taken on a data collection sheet during both periods. They will see the physiotherapist from weeks 2-11.

The study will examine the effectiveness of a combined exercise and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) intervention compared to each intervention (CBT or Exercise) alone. All interventions will be delivered by a sole health care professional - specially trained physiotherapists. This means that the exercise and CBT components can be integrated and delivered in the same session. 

Intervention Groups:

i) Exercise Alone - 25 minute treatment sessions X 10 sessions

This component is comprised of:
-quadraceps strengthening
-sitting knee extension
-hip abductor strengthening
-partial wall squats
-sit to stand exercise
-hamstring strengthening
-step up and step down exercise

ii) CBT Alone - 45 minute treatment sessions X 10 sessions

This component is comprised of:
-explanation of the gate control theory 
-progressive muscle relaxation
-relaxation training and and explanation of its benefits
-identifying and challenging negative thoughts
-problem solving
-pleasant imagery and counting backwards

iii) CBT plus Exercise - 70 minute treatment sessions X 10 sessions

This component is comprised of a combination of i) &amp; ii) above.</interventions>
    <comparator>The groups are comprised of either CBT Alone, Exercise Alone or CBT &amp; Exercise Combined.

This device was devised to provide a robust approach to isometric strength assessment of the quadriceps and hamstrings, ie superior than what can be achieved with instrumented hand-held dynamometry, but not so complex that it required extensive user training, elaborate apparatus, computer data collection, etc. The device is designed to be attached to a common style of office chair.</outcome>

    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the benefits of a 12-week intervention involving 10 weekly treatment sessions delivered by a physiotherapist on a one-to-one basis. The study will examine the effectiveness of a combined exercise and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) intervention compared to each intervention (CBT or Exercise) alone.

Hypothesis: A 12-week intervention that combines exercise with CBT will be more effective in improving pain (visual analogue scale) and physical function (WOMAC subscale) than either a 12-week intervention of exercise alone or CBT alone in individuals with painful radiographic knee OA.</summary>
