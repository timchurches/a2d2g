  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist of participants enrolled in the intervention arm of the study participating in a lifestyle intervention known as the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) for 12 weeks. Thereafter, participants will be contacted for the purpose of providing motivation and support on a monthly basis for an additional 9 months. This opportunity will be used to provide ongoing encouragement and support for lifestyle change, to answer questions, and to provide additional information as required or requested by the participants. Participants will also be invited to attend Club CHIP events, if and when available in their local area. Club CHIP is an optional support and continuing education group usually established and run by CHIP graduates. Club CHIP is not a requirement and therefore it is not available in all locations. There is one Club CHIP in operation which is geographically accessible to participants who may enroll in the study.

The CHIP intervention consists of 18 education sessions, each of 90 minutes duration. The 18 sessions are run over a 12 week period according to group availability The following pattern is mostly adopted. 3 sessions per week for the first 2 weeks, then 2 sessions a week for the next 2 weeks and then 1 session a week for another 8 weeks. Approximately half of each session is devoted to viewing pre-recorded visual material while interactive group discussions and activities, including food preparation and exercise demonstrations, make up the remaining time. An outline of the topics covered over the 18 sessions can be viewed below.
1	The rise of chronic disease
2	Lifestyle as medicine
3	The common denominator of chronic disease
4	The optimal lifestyle
5	Eat more, weigh less
6	Fibre, your new best friend
7	Disarming Diabetes
8	The heart of the matter  heart healthy
9	Controlling blood pressure and discovering protein
10	Bone health essentials
11	Cancer prevention
12	Understanding your results and taking action
13	Become what you believe. Your DNA is not your destiny
14	Practicing forgiveness
15	Re-engineering your environment
16	Stress relieving strategies
17	Fix how you feel
18	From surviving to thriving
	
Sessions 1 to 11 provides information on the aetiology, risk factors and pathological mechanism responsible for lifestyle related chronic disease. Emphasis is placed on the links between obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular disease. Participants are provided with information relating to how lifestyle changes, particularly in diet and levels of physical activity, can positively alter the risk factors for as well as the course of chronic diseases. Specifically, the adoption of a plant-based, restricted sugar and salt diet is encouraged as well as daily physical activity involving a combination of aerobic and strengthening exercise most days of the week. Sessions 12 to 18 provide information related to other important lifestyle behaviors like substance use, rest, and sleep and stress management. Participants are provided with strategies that will assist them in assuming a position of control of their health, to overcome barriers, to manage and maintain behavior change and to cope with environmental pressures and stressors. 
Each participant receives a CHIP kit containing a textbook, workbook, recipe book, water bottle and pedometer.
The intervention is run by voluntary facilitators who have been specifically trained to run the intervention. The intervention was designed, written and recorded by a team of health professionals and is under license from Sanitarium Health and Well Being. The intervention will be run in community halls on the central coast of NSW. The additional follow up will be conducted by the researcher who is a trained facilitator via telephone.
A record of participants attendance will be kept. 
The workbook contains a page where participants may keep records of their own goals and adherence. These pages will not be assessed as part of the research. participants will complete the Active Q survey and questions relating to their eating pattern on commencement, at 12 weeks and again at 12 months as described in the outcomes section

The study is sufficiently powered at 80% to detect a 3.5% reduction in fasting glucose, with significance determined to be &lt; 0.05 (95% confidence interval). The sample size was calculated to be 75 in both the control and intervention, allowing for a 10% drop out rate of participants during the study. 

Statistical Analysis
All data collected will be coded and entered into IBM® SPSS® version 22 for Windows® (SPSS Inc, 2013) prior to analysis.

Analysis for primary outcomes 1 and 2 and secondary outcomes.
Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse demographic data, anthropometric measurement data, blood results and activity levels on commencement of the program and also at the described re-evaluation intervals. Descriptive statistics will include frequencies, percentage distribution, means and medians as well as standard deviation from the mean. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to determine normal distribution in order to decide on whether to use parametric or non-parametric testing for correlations and variance analysis. A paired sample t-test (dependent t-test) will be used to compare pre intervention data with post intervention (12 weeks) and pre intervention data with post intervention (12 months) data. An independent t-test will be used to compare data between intervention and control groups. Pearsons correlation will be used to explore relationships between continuous variables. The dietary inventory, health survey, and quality of life survey will be independently scored and the results between groups compared using linear regression. The level of significance is set at p&lt;0.05

Analysis for primary outcome 3.
To determine the cost benefit of the intervention, a cost-benefit analysis will be undertaken. The cost benefit analysis will involve assessment of beneficial effects of the intervention.  The analysis will include benefits and costs attributed to the project and indirect costs. Therefore, where B represents all the benefits and C represents all the costs, the project will be considered beneficial if B-C &gt; 0. A cost benefit ratio will also be calculated. Costs included in the analysis will include opportunity costs. Costs from published literature and from government agencies will be used wherever possible, for example, the Medical Benefits Scheme and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well recognised that rates of T2DM are increasing at dramatic rates in Australia. A number of interrelated factors are associated with increased risk of developing the condition, however, much of the cause can be attributed to obesity as a result of high energy, high fat and high animal protein diets along with a lack of regular physical activity. Currently, there is no known medical cure for the condition. However, studies conducted on participants enrolled in a number of lifestyle modification programs suggest that the symptoms of T2DM are reversible where energy intake is reduced resulting in improved body weight and Body Mass Index. Previous studies conducted on individuals with abnormal blood glucose levels also indicate that the adoption of the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) lifestyle intervention significantly reduced blood sugar levels in compliant individuals. 
This study will investigate: 
The effect of the CHIP intervention on obesity, blood sugar and medication levels of a group of participants with established T2DM.
It will also examine the cost benefit of such an intervention. 
This will be done by evaluating the following:
The blood sugar, HBA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure readings in those participating in the CHIP intervention delivered over a period of 12 weeks with additional monthly follow up for another nine months compared to a control group receiving their usual diabetes care.
The levels of compliance over a 12-month period in those participating in the CHIP intervention delivered over a period of 12 weeks with an additional follow up for another nine months compared to a control group receiving their usual diabetes care.
The cost benefit (over a 12-month period) of implementing the CHIP intervention delivered over a period of 12 weeks with an additional follow up for another nine months compared to a control group receiving their usual diabetes care.
The outcomes of this study have the potential to inform decisions about patient treatment and potentially provide an incentive for the provision of funded lifestyle based preventive and restorative programs for patients diagnosed with T2DM.</summary>
