  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia(CBT-I; with problem-solving training component) Therapy involves six weekly treatment sessions (1-2hrs/week) comprised of one initial group session (groups of 4-5 people) then approximately 5 individual sessions. Therapy will be administered by a clinical research student/intern psychologist under the supervision of a fully qualified clinical psychology staff member (Dr Richard O'Kearney) as part of the Doctor of Psychology clinical program at the Australian National University to form a research thesis. Group sessions will involve sleep education, relaxation training and stimulus control (behavioural intervention) - all participants in the treatment study (50 in total) take part in the same group treatment, after which they are randomly allocated to one of two individual interventions (25 to each). Individual sessions will involve problem-solving training (a discussion-based therapy with homework sheets and sleep diary focused on improving problem-solving skills). Additionally, there is an Insomnia Thought Study involving the comparison of 10 normal sleepers to 50 people with insomnia. The study will involve the completion of survey forms and a thought diary during one week (prior to treatment for the insomnia participants and forming part of their sleep diary assessment) which will take 1-2hrs in total. Participants in the thought study may be reimbursed $10-15 for their participation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study has two main parts:
1) An exploration and comparison of the primary thoughts occuring in people with healthy sleep compared to those with insomnia. This may contribute to future treatment planning and the understanding of insomnia in Australia.
2) A comparison of two psychological treatment components for insomnia (cognitive therapy and problem-solving training) with the purpose of determining the effectiveness of these components for treating insomnia and improving psychological wellbeing. This may contribute to additional treatment options for people with insomnia in the future.</summary>
