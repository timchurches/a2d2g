  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with diabetes and atherogenic dyslipidaemia who are treated with statin medication may still be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and may require combination lipid regulating therapy to further reduce their risk. Endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness are present in early diabetic vascular disease and may be useful surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular risk. This 30 week, randomised double-blinded crossover study in 25 participants with diabetes who have endothelial dysfunction despite optimal statin therapy, aims to investigate whether combination therapy with micronised fenofibrate 145mg with no-food-effect orally once daily compared to matching placebo improves endothelial dysfunction.</summary>
