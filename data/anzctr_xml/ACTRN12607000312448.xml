  <interventions>
    <interventions>he Intervention Condition - Students in this condition recieve Alcohol and cannabis prevention through the CLIMATE Schools program. This program entails 12 lessons on Alcohol and Cannabis knowledge, use, harms and attitudes. These lessons are taught in year 8 as part of the PDHPE curriculum, replacing existing drug and alcohol preventinon. Each lesson is made up of two parts; the first being reading of cartoons where the students view a group of friends their age experimenting with alcohol and cannabis and learning drug refusal skills. The first part is done via the internet where students logon with individual logins and view the cartoons. The second part of each lesson is run by the teacher and involves class, individual or group activities provided in the manual we give schools.  </interventions>
