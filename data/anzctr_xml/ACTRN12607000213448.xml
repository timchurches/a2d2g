  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 3 treatment groups in the first 12 weeks of weight loss intervention: 
1) Metformin (1500mg Diabex XR oral tablet daily)

3) Internet-based lifestyle program  
In the following 36 weeks of weight maintenance, all participants will be placed on the lifestyle program (as described).
The Internet-based lifestyle program will include a high protein diet (30% protein,40% carbohydrate, 30% fat), aerobic and resistance exercise, online support (diet information, exercise information, lifestyle counselling).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an internet-based lifestyle modification (high protein diet) program, tailored for overweight/obese young women (age 18 to 35 years), against metformin or placebo treatments in achieving and maintaining weight loss. We also want to assess the effects of different methods of weight loss on reproductive function, metabolic health, and nutritional status. Information on psychological well-being and general health will also be collected.</summary>
