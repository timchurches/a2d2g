  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fluid bolus responsiveness - Fluid responsiveness will be determined by any increase in cardiac output (continuous outcome) or by a 10-15% increase in cardiac output (dichotomous outcome) following bolus volume expansion</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Volume management responsiveness - Responders will be defined as patients with an improvement (change towards normal physiological values) following cumulative volume expansion in any variable(s) used to assess oxygen delivery/consumption balance</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 6 hours</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Morbidity - Use and extent of measures to support organ function such as mechanical ventilation, mechanical and pharmacological cardiovascular interventions, renal replacement therapy whilst admitted to ICU as well as length of admission to ICU.</outcome>

    <summary>Study Design: Prospective observational study

      Study Location: Liverpool Hospital Intensive Care Unit, South Western Sydney Local Health
      District, Sydney, Australia.

      Target study size: 100 patients

      Ethics: Approved by the local Human Research and Ethics Council (HREC) at Liverpool Hospital
      (LPOOL) as a Low Negligible Risk (LNR) project [HREC/LNR/14/LPOOL/295, HREC/LNR/15/LPOOL47,
      HREC/LNR/14/LPOOL/150]

      Participants: Post cardiac surgical patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit between
      March-October 2016

      Aims:

        1. to determine the descriptive and predictive value of variables (outlined below) related
           to oxygen delivery/consumption in regards to the effects of intravascular volume
           expansion

        2. to assess correlations between central and peripheral variables (outlined below)
           relevant to oxygen delivery/consumption

        3. to assess correlations between a set of variables (outline below) and patient centred
           outcomes in ICU and in hospital

      Main variables collected:

        1. Tissue oxygen saturation by peripheral Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)

        2. Common carotid arterial Doppler

        3. Arterial/mixed venous/central venous blood gas analyses

        4. Haemodynamic parameters

        5. Organ support measures

      Data collection time points:

        1. ICU admission (within 30 minutes)

        2. Before administration of a fluid bolus

        3. After administration of a fluid bolus

        4. 6 hours after ICU admission

        5. Morning of first postoperative day (12-24 hours)

      Outcome measures:

        1. the response to intravascular volume expansion

        2. ICU mortality, morbidity and length of stay and hospital mortality and length of stay

      Data analysis:

        1. Clinical data are collected bedside using an electronic case record form

        2. Descriptive statistics

        3. Paired and unpaired comparative

        4. Correlative and predictive statistics</summary>
