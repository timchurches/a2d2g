  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this current study is to establish whether a web-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention is effective in treating amphetamine use and its associated harms. Participants will be asked to complete one 30-minute session per week for five weeks. Sessions include components such as motivational interviewing, goal setting, thought monitoring, cognitive restructuring, pleasant activity scheduling, and relapse prevention. Adherence will be monitored via the website, which will provide information about when sessions were accessed and which pages were viewed.

Of particular interest is the potential role that contingency management may have on treatment success. Another aim of this research is to identify predictors of treatment outcome for amphetamine users (self-efficacy and impulsivity). </interventions>
    <comparator>A waitlist control group will receive no treatment during the trial but they will be provided with access to the intervention after a five-week waiting period. They will receive minimal intervention (psychoeducation about amphetamines and harm reduction) upon consenting and logging in to the treatment program.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this current study is to establish whether a web-based CBT intervention is effective in treating amphetamine use and its associated harms.  Of particular interest is the potential role that contingency management may have on treatment success. Another aim of this research is to identify predictors of treatment outcome for amphetamine users (self-efficacy and impulsivity).

It is hypothesised that i) participants who undertake the Internet-delivered CBT intervention in combination with contingency management (monetary incentives for remaining in treatment) will show greater reductions in their use of amphetamines as well as reductions in harms associated with use, higher rates of abstinence and will remain in treatment longer in comparison to the waitlist control group, ii) treatment retention and outcomes will be influenced by self-efficacy and an impulsive temperament.  </summary>
