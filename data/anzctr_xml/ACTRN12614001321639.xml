  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants performance on executive function and driving assessments will be assessed under euglycaemic and hyperglycaemic conditions. These will be compared to determine how blood glucose levels affect executive function and high level driving skills.

The order of the assessment sessions will be randomised. One assessment will be when the participant has a blood glucose level between 4 mmol/L  9.4 mmol/L (euglycaemic) and the second when the participant has a blood glucose level above 15 mmol/L (hyperglycaemic).  Each assessment will take approximately two hours.  There will be a break of approximately two weeks between assessment sessions.

To increase a participants blood glucose to the hyperglycaemic range they will be given a standardised carbohydrate snack. Participants will be administered an insulin dose based on their Insulin Sensitivity Factor calculation to lower their blood glucose level to the euglycaemic range.

During both assessments, participants will complete objective executive functioning tasks and computer based driving tasks. Assessment of general cognitive ability, subjective ratings of executive functioning and driving behaviour will be completed when participants BGL is within the euglycaemic range

At the completion of the Hyperglycaemic session, the participants will be administered an insulin dose to lower blood glucose level to euglycaemic range using the participants Insulin Sensitivity Factor calculation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate the effect of hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose levels) on executive functioning, and higher-level driving skills in young people with Type 1 diabetes. 
We hypothesise that acute hyperglycaemia will have a negative effect on participants performance on tests of executive functions and safe driving skills in young people with Type 1 diabetes compared to performance when  blood glucose level is within the target range.
