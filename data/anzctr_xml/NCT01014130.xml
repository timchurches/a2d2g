  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether radiotherapy given as three large doses
      over a period of two weeks (hypofractionated radiotherapy) is more effective than standard
      radiotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has not spread beyond the
      lung. Although surgery is the most effective treatment for early lung cancer, many patients
      are not fit enough for an operation. The alternative treatment to surgery is standard
      radiotherapy which is normally 'fractionated' that is, given as a number of small doses over
      a period of weeks. Experience has shown that many small treatments are safer than using a few
      large doses (hypofractionation) because there is less risk of damage to normal tissues.

      Recent advances in technology have however resulted in greater accuracy and with it a
      reduction in the amount of normal tissue affected by the radiation, so the risks of
      hypo-fractionation damaging normal tissue are of less concern. Initial results obtained with
      hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer indicate that it
      may be more effective in controlling the cancer. However, it has never been compared directly
      with standard fractionation in a randomised trial, so this study aims to determine if
      hypo-fractionation is more effective, results in longer life expectancy and if it is just as
      safe as standard fractionation.</summary>
