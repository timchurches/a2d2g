  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial intended to evaluate if the use of Vaalia yogurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG), Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 (Bb-12) and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 (La-5) compared to pasteurised yogurt reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance in children aged between 1-12 who are on oral antibiotics.  Children will be given 100g of Vaalia yogurt 2/day commencing the same day that they start their antibiotic treatment and continuing for the duration of their antibiotic treatment.
The antibiotics will be limited to broad-spectrum antibiotics as prescribed by the participants GP.</interventions>
    <comparator>The same type of yogurt that has been given to the intervention group will be heat treated so that is pasteurized and then administered in the same fashion as the intervention group i.e. 100g 2/day commencing at the time of antibiotic therapy and ceasing when antibiotic therapy ceases.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients presenting to General Practices and pharmacies in the Launceston area. General Practitioners and pharmacists will approach parents who present with children aged 1 year to 12 years old whom have been prescribed oral antibiotics. Parents who elect to participate are randomised to a blinded dose of Vaalia Yogurt containing LGG, BB12 and LA5 or a pasteurized yogurt. To ensure allocation concealment, an independent subject will prepare the randomization schedule and oversee the packaging and labeling of trial treatments. All investigators, participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to the assigned treatment throughout the study. Patients presenting to pharmacies in the Launceston area will also be recruited</concealment>
    <sequence>Investigators at the University of Tasmania will generate independent allocation sequences and randomization lists for each study site. To avoid a disproportionate number of patients in the experimental or placebo group, randomization at each site will be performed in blocks of six (three received placebo and three, active treatment).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Using Koning et als study (The effect of a multispecies probiotic on the intestinal microbiota and bowel movements in healthy volunteers taking the antibiotic amoxycillin. The American journal of gastroenterology 2008;103(1):178-89.), a t-test (1.5 stools/day, SD .5/day) with a 30% relative reduction in frequency, and power of 80% gave a sample size of 58.  As it was planned to use ordinal logistical regression the biostatistician advised a sample size of 70.  On review of the data it was decided that poisson analysis, fishers exact, hazard reduction ratios and kaplan meir curves were the most appropriate method of analysis.</statisticalmethods>
