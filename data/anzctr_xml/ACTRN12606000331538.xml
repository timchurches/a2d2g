  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a one-year randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study designed to evaluate the effects of ergocalciferol and calcium supplementation compared to calcium alone on fall risk and bone structure in elderly women with a plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D level below 60 nmol/L and a history of falling in the past 12 months. Subjects were randomised by personnel having no contact with study subjects. The study subjects and the study staff remained blinded to the treatment codes during the 1 year study.</summary>
