    <interventions>INTERVENTION
The positive psychology intervention will involve the serial completion of activities (known as positive activities) over a period of eight weeks; one activity per week. The positive activities to be performed are: Week 1 - "What Went Well"?; Week 2: Gratitude Letter; Week 3 - Acts of Kindness; Week 4 - Best Possible Future Self; Week 5 - Nurturing Social Relationships; Week 6 - Get Active; Week 7- Committing to Your Goals; and Week 8 - Increasing 'Flow' Experiences. The activities take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete and only needed to be completed once during the week. Adherence will be monitored through bi-weekly phone calls to the participant to check activity completion. Participants will also be required to keep a diary recording activity completion. This will be collected by the study investigators at the end of the intervention phase. Activities will be administered using a handbook (hard copy or electronic PDF).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability - Number and percentage of participants initially enrolled who go on to complete the entire 8-week intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>[Time Frame: End of the intervention period]</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participation Rate - The number and percentage of individuals who consent to participating in the study as a total of the number of presenters to the emergency department who meet eligibility criteria and are invited to participate in the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>[Time Frame: End of the intervention period]</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Logicalness and Credibility/Expectancy Scores - participant ratings on logicalness, usefulness, success of intervention, and how confident the participant would be in recommending intervention to others. A series of four 9-point scales will be used to assess these variables higher points on the scale indicating greater logicalness, usefulness, expectations of success, more likely to recommend to others.</outcome>
      <timepoint>[Time Frame: End of 8 week intervention period]</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Activity Completion - Number of activities completed during the intervention period. This will be recorded by the participant either in a hard copy diary or an online questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>[Time Frame: End of the 8 week intervention period]</timepoint>
