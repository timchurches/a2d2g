    <interventions>The Older Persons ENablement And Rehabilitation for Complex Health conditions (OPEN ARCH) model of care intervention extends the Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) model of care and enables a direct path from General Practitioners (GP) to a community based geriatrician for comprehensive interdisciplinary assessment and care management.  OPEN ARCH then facilitates timely access to the most appropriate care in the community that if provided early, could enable the older persons health to be supported such that they can remain living in the community and not require hospital attendance or admission. 

The OPEN ARCH intervention have two components: 
1) fast track specialist geriatric assessment via a community based referral to a geriatrician in local GP practices; and, 
2) an enablement service offering the coordination and implementation of health and social care services customised to patient need in the community.

General Practitioners (GPs; n=10) within general practices in the Cairns hospital area will be approached to participate in the study.  All GPs will be invited to recruit a total of 120 patients participants, to the intervention (n=60) and standard care/control (n=60) groups, within three months of the study commencement.  GPs that have shown less interest in research will initially be approached for recruitment of eligible participants to the standard care/control arm, however after the study period, i.e. 12 months, all patients and GPs will be offered the intervention.  This cross-over will not be followed as part of the analysis. 

Patients who are eligible by GP screening evaluation and met no exclusionary criterion will be administered informed consent.  Those who agreed to participate will be fast-tracked, within 1-2 weeks, for a consultation with a specialist geriatrician within their local GP practice.  During the first interview and assessment, the geriatrician will provide an in-depth, standardised, comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) covering physical, cognitive, social and psychological ability and make recommendations that will form a customised care plan.  The interview and assessment can take up to 2-3 hours to complete, depending on the complexity of the patient's health needs.  Each care-plan will be tailored for each individuals needs according to the best clinical practice.  The type and number of referrals to primary allied health care professionals will be determined by individual clinical needs and delivered in the community (GP or allied health practice) or at home.  Examples of allied health services that will be offered include:  occupational therapy home assessments-- to reduce falls risk, routine physiotherapy-- for strength maintenance exercises, nutritional assessmentsto support changes in nutritional demand due to aging. 

Following the interview and assessment by the specialist geriatrician, a care coordinator will take over the care-plan coordination and implementation.  They will convey the CGA recommendations to the patients GP and provide assistance with managing the care delivery, ensuring the timely access to health support services, as well as, patients adherence with the recommendations.  Patients may be offered the CGA review every six months at the discretion of the specialist geriatrician based on the needs of the individual participant. All consecutive reviews will be up to 1-2 hours long, depending on the complexity of the patient's health needs.

It is envisaged that this preventative health model will pre-empt health decline and increase the capacity of community led health care professionals to monitor and manage community-dwelling complex older patients for longer within the community and reduce the likelihood of the cascade of events that lead to (often avoidable) hospitalisation, and eventual loss of independence upon hospital discharge.

The professional team comprises: 1) a project manager, who will facilitate GP engagement, patient recruitment and consent, data collection, data management and reporting. 2) A geriatric registrar or consultant - as provided in-kind by the hospital service for geriatric assessments at the GPs rooms. 3) Two community based care coordinators, who will provide facilitated access to health care services and self-management education.  

All practitioners are registered nationally and their qualifications are nationally recognised (AHPRA).  They are employees of Queensland Health and as such are governed by their policies and Clinical Quality guidelines.  Any new recruits or junior staff will be supervised by senior staff at all times.

Study period: Two years, to enable adequate community consultation, recruitment of staff and patients, analysis of findings and dissemination of outcomes.

Outcome measurement: Multi-model follow up review at Day 0, 90, 180 and after three months follow up; review of hospital records, Medicare data and community clinical charts; cost-utility analysis.

    <statisticalmethods>Evaluation data will include numeric (counts) comparisons of ED presentations, hospital admissions and bed days, descriptive, explanatory (pre-post quantitative) surveys, longitudinal health care utilisation data and costs.  Continuous data that are approximately normally distributed will be summarised in terms of the mean and standard deviation.  Skewed data will be presented in terms of the median, lower and upper quartiles.  Categorical data will be summarised in terms of frequency counts and percentages.
The primary analysis will be based on the intention to treat principle, and will compare the primary outcome between the two groups.  As most of the data outputs are counts, we will apply a Poisson model regression adjusting for age, gender, identified personal carer stratified by GP centre.  The intervention effect parameter will be presented as an estimate with 95% confidence interval.  All continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models, while logistic regression and Poisson regression models will be used for dichotomous and count data, respectively.  All statistical tests will be two-sided and performed using a 5% significance level with no adjustment for multiplicity.  
Where extreme outliers are identified during model checking, sensitivity analyses will be carried out including and excluding the extreme outliers in order to test the robustness of the findings.  Data analysis will be performed using STATA version 14 and Microsoft Excel 2010.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Community dwelling older persons with complex care needs may deteriorate rapidly and face hospitalisation if their conditions are poorly supported and coordinated in the community.  This proof of concept study aims to assess acceptability, impact and cost-effectiveness of a community based model of care (intervention), offering a comprehensive, multidimensional geriatric assessment with care coordination. The intervention is designed to reduce avoidable hospitalisations by supporting and coordinating patient care in the community.

Design: Multicentre, non-randomised, controlled trial.

Settings: A sample of 60 persons with complex care needs (70 years or older for non-Indigenous and 50 years or older for Indigenous) in the intervention arm from five participating General Practices will be compared with 60 similar patients recruited from five different General Practices to the standard care (control) arm of the study.
Study period: Two years, to enable adequate community consultation, recruitment of staff and patients, analysis of findings and dissemination of outcomes.

This study will test two research hypotheses:
1.	The increased access to a comprehensive, multidimensional geriatric assessment and community based care co-ordination model of care (intervention) reduces functional decline and dependency, enabling patients to remain living in the community for longer. 
2.	The intervention group provides better value for money in terms of incremental cost per QALYs compared to standard care.

The results will have direct implications for the design and wider implementation of the model of care, as well as, contribute to the evidence base on acceptability, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of the intervention for this high-risk group of older people.
