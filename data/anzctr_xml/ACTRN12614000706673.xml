    <interventions>Group exercise and education program

Participants in the group exercise and education program are to receive a single 1 hour assessment session followed by an 8 week group exercise program that is both graded and progressed, supervised by an exercise provider (registered physiotherapist). The sessions will be conducted once per week and will run for one hour. The program will run at a ratio of between 4 - 10 participants per physiotherapist. The program will also include one-on-one time with the physiotherapist to facilitate the commencement of a home exercise program (HEP) which will build upon the exercise conducted within the sessions and enable continuance of exercises once the supervised group exercise program has been completed. The participants will be provided with a single 30 minute HEP session specifically for addressing any barriers to exercise associated with the home exercise program. This HEP session will occur between group sessions three and five.
The exercises / activities implemented as a part of this intervention will focus on four key areas of exercise training identified by the American College of Sports Medicine (cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility and neuromotor). All participants will be directed to meet the American College of Sports Medicines guidelines for cardiorespiratory exercise with specific resistance, flexibility and neuromotor components implemented according to areas of deficit identified in the initial assessment. The progression of the program will conform to the American College of Sports Medicines position statement.

Assessment Session
The purpose of the assessment session is to enable the exercise provider to determine the appropriate level (quantity, intensity and type) of exercises and general activity most suitable for the participant. Time will also be set aside for the implementation of the HEP.

Group Sessions
Exercises conducted in the group sessions will be focused on increasing strength, endurance and coordination of the trunk musculature. Specific exercises in the program may focus on a single area or include aspects from two or more areas above and will emphasise performance of functional everyday activities. Exercise providers will work with participants to provide an individualised and graded exercise program that reflects the participants physical capacity and the nature of the work, household, social and sporting activities the participant is involved in. All exercises will be conducted using the participants current level of fitness and ability as a starting point, and progress using the position statement on Quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuromotor fitness in apparently healthy adults: guidance for prescribing exercise as a guide. Exercise providers will use their clinical judgement to determine what aspects of exercise (cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility and neuromotor) to concentrate on in the group sessions. Attendance at group sessions will be recorded.

Educational component
The educational component includes education on basic anatomy and kinesiology, posture and movement, causes and management of low back pain and the benefits of exercise. The delivery of these educational components will be integrated with the provision of exercises such that as the participant is learning to perform the exercise they are also learning the theory behind what they are doing and why it is important to them. This will help in retaining the key principles of both the exercise and the education and assist in self-identification of any possible deconditioning that may occur after the exercise program has been completed.

Home exercise program
Participants will be given two opportunities to discuss their home exercise program one-on-one with their exercise provider: The first will be during the initial assessment; the second will be at the separate HEP session. The aim of the HEP is to have a program in place that will enable participants to continue exercising beyond the duration of the group exercise program. Compliance with the HEP will be measured using a participant exercise diary.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive the Guide to Positively Managing Back Pain booklet and a single half-hour appointment one-on-one with the exercise provider where they will be taken through the booklet and have it explained to them. Included in this time will be opportunity for the participant to ask any questions they might have about the booklet or its contents. Participants will have the opportunity to contact the exercise provider by phone one time after the end of the session to clarify the information contained in the booklet or ask further questions. In order to maintain the minimalist nature of this intervention exercise providers conducting the intervention are not to volunteer information that goes beyond the scope of the booklet.

The Guide to Positively Managing Back Pain booklet has been developed by Bupa and is a publicly available resource. It includes advice on self-management and prevention of back pain as well as a brief overview of types of exercise

Physical activity will be objectively assessed with the Actigraph GT3X-Plus accelerometer at baseline and at 10 weeks. It records activity counts and steps taken, which are converted to time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity physical activity. The Actigraph is a non-invasive, small, lightweight device that is worn during waking hours for 7 consecutive days on the right hip.</outcome>

Non-specific low back pain is defined as pain in the area between the 12th rib and buttock crease not attributed to a specific diagnosis such as sciatica, ankylosing spondylitis, vertebral fracture etc. The date of recovery is defined as the 30th consecutive day with pain no greater than 1 on a 0-10 scale.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Participants will be randomly allocated to treatment group. Consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes will be used to conceal randomisation.
Allocation will occur immediately following the baseline assessment. At this time, the researcher conducting the baseline assessment will give the envelope containing the allocation to the exercise provider. The researcher will record the participant number, time and place of randomisation and then leave. The exercise provider will open the envelope and record both the randomisation number and treatment group. The exercise provider will organise for the provision of the prescribed intervention, either minimal intervention or group exercise. Participants will be considered to have entered the study at the time that the envelope is given to the exercise provider.
</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence will be generated by an independent investigator by means of a computer program using the simple randomisation method. There will be a single sequence generated and enough to allow for the recruitment of up to 40 participants.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will take 40 participants who have recently recovered from low back pain and randomly allocate them to either an 8 week comprehensive, supervised group exercise and education program or a minimal intervention consisting of one 30 minute education and advice session. Outcomes will be assessed at 10 weeks. The aims of the STOP Pilot are to: 1) Test feasibility of recruitment and enrolment procedures; 2) Test acceptability and adherence to the intervention; and 3) Test our processes and procedures for collecting outcome data.
