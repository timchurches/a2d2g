  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a Phase I study of CX-5461, an RNA polymerase I inhibitor. 40 patients with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory advanced haematologic malignancies, who have progressed following at least one prior treatment regimen, will be enrolled in the study. CX-5461 will be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour every 21 days. Seven dose levels are planned: 25 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2, 100 mg/m2, 170 mg/m2, 250 mg/m2, 330 mg/m2and 450 mg/m2 per dose.  Patients will be assigned to a dose level in the order of study entry.  Patients may continue to receive an infusion of CX-5461 every 3 weeks until disease progression, occurance of unacceptable toxicities, or the decision of the patient and/or Investigator.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of intravenously administered CX-5461 when used intravenously in haematologic cancers. DLTs will be assessed by physical exam and clinical laboratory blood tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed during the first cycle only, on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15 and at the end of the 3 week cycle.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish the safety profile of CX-5461 at the MTD. Adverse events (e.g. fatigue, infections and bleeding) are graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4. Comparison of vital sign measurements, physical examination assessments, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance assessments, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests for haematology, coagulation and biochemistry from baseline to study completion. Possible side effects may vary depending on the dose received but are expected to be reversible. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be monitored for the duration of study (Cycle 1 will be assessed at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15 and end of cycle; subsequent cycles will be assessed at day 1 of each cycle and at the end of study treatment)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CX-5461. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis on Days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the 1st treatment cycle.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To observe patients for preliminary antitumor activity of CX-5461. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Response will be measured on D14 to D18 of Cycle 2, and alternate cycles therafter, using clinical assessments, imaging and laboratory tests for the duration of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the mechanism of action of CX-5461 in haematologic cancers and to identify predictive biomarkers of efficacy in human haematologic cancers.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood and tissue samples will be collected at scheduled timepoints for the duration of the study. The scheduled timepoints are D1 and D2 of Cycle 1, D1 of Cycle 2 and each subsequent cycle, during week 3 of Cycle 2 and every subsequent alternate cycle.</timepoint>

    <summary>The study is evaluating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) by understanding the safety profile during incremental dosage escalation.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years with any histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory advanced haematologic malignancies for which no effective standard therapies are available, and have progressed following at least one prior treatment regimen. As every blood cancer patient has a unique disease and treatment history, it is highly suggested that you discuss the trial with your haematologist or oncologist who can also contact Peter Mac to determine whether this trial may be suitable for you.
