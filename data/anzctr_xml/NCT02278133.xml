  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and anti-tumor activity of the triple
      combination of WNT974, LGX818 and cetuximab in BRAFV600-mutant mCRC with RNF43 mutations or
      RSPO fusions.

      The design of this study is based upon the translational and pre-clinical data that suggest
      that Wnt pathway signals, increased due to RNF43 mutations or RSPO fusions, cooperate with
      the EGFR and BRAF signals to maintain the growth of BRAFV600 CRCs. Inhibition of these
      signals with the triple combination of WNT974, LGX818 and cetuximab may result in anti-tumor
      activity.</summary>
