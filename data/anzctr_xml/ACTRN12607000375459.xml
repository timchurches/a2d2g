  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: UQDRIVE (University of Queensland Driver Retirement Initiative) Intensive Group Program.
The group intervention was developed by the research team for older people in the decision and post-cessation phases of driving cessation. It runs for one session of three to four hours per week over six weeks for approximately 12-15 participants. The program has seven modules and incorporates information-giving, discussion, guest speakers, a participant workbook and practical exercises including use of transport information services, group outings using alternative transport, pedestrian safety audits of the local area and advocacy regarding transport needs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: Current treatment available  ie no intervention. The control group will be a waitlist control group and will undertake the UQDRIVE group program after the trial is complete.</comparator>

    <concealment>Once 24-30 eligible participants in one of the trial location consent to participate, they will be assessed at baseline 2 weeks before the intervention commences (time 1). They will then be matched into pairs by research team member not involved in the intervention or data collection, according to age (within 5 year intervals), gender and self-rated health status (5 point scale from poor to excellent). Matching will occur to ensure that the intervention effect is not confounded by variables previously linked to the dependent variables or adjustment after driving cessation. Matching is particularly useful for reducing extraneous variance in comparisons between treatment and control groups where the number of participants is relatively small. Each member of the matched pair will be randomly allocated to either treatment or control groups according to a computer-generated schedule concealed in opaque envelopes. Individuals eligible for participation in the study, but unable to be matched, will be randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As a result of age-related changes, chronic medical conditions, the side-effects of medication or a combination of these, many older people decide or are required to give up driving. Driving is a highly valued role and skill, associated with freedom, independence and convenience. Because of this, the transition to driving cessation can be traumatic and associated with depression, social isolation and compromised well-being. Despite the frequent reporting of poor outcomes for older people after driving cessation, limited attention has been given to developing and evaluating methods to help older people prepare for and cope with this transition. This study will evaluate
the effect of a group intervention on older people's episodes away from home, use of alternative transport modes, life satisfaction, depression, and self-rated performance of and satisfaction with up to five lifestyle goals related to transport. This study will contribute to evidence for the effectiveness of a group intervention versus usual practice (which is to say, no intervention) to help older people maintain their well-being and stay engaged in valued roles, activities and the community after retiring from driving. It will also contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of
adjustment after undergoing the transition to retired driver.</summary>
