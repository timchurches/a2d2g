  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a computerized task. Participants are either trained to interpret ambiguous tasks as painful or happy; and are either trained implicitly or explicitly. So, there are four arms: Arm 1: An implicit task where ambiguous faces are followed by a target that appears where the target was previously replaced by the painful face. Arm 2: An implicit task where ambiguous faces are followed by a target that appears where the target was previously replaced by the happy face. Arm 3: An explicit task where participants are asked to indicate if they consider the ambiguous face to be happy or painful and are given feedback that they are incorrect if they choose happy and correct if they choose painful. and Arm 4:An explicit task where participants are asked to indicate if they consider the ambiguous face to be happy or painful and are given feedback that they are incorrect if they choose painful and correct if they choose  happy. Each of the four arms administers a single one-off computerized training that lasts 20-30 minutes and the cold pressor is the outcome not part of the intervention. </interventions>
    <comparator>The two interventions are compared to each other. One trains people to interpret ambiguous stimuli as painful and the other as happy.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We will analyse data using a 2 x 2 ANOVA. We will also assess interpretation bias and determine with the use of regression analyses whether implicit or explicit interpretation biases analyses mediate the relationship between group allocation and outcome. Power analyses indicated that we needed a total sample of 104 to achieve 80% power, p = 0.05 given an effect size of 0.28 (achieved in previous studies). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effect of modifying interpretations of ambiguous faces on performance of a painful task. Specifically, we will compare how effective training participants to interpret an ambiguous facial expression as happy compared to painful. We are interested to know whether this training is more effective when instructions are explicit versus implicit.</summary>
