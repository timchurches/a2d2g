    <statisticalmethods>Baseline data will be compared using descriptive statistics, Student t tests for normally distributed continuous variables, Mann-Whitney test for skewed variables and Pearsons chi-square statistic for categorical variables. Analyses will be based on completers and intention-to-treat. The primary hypothesis (difference in the proportion of participants who develop delirium) will be tested using intention-to-treat analysis of panel data (xtlogit). This approach to the analysis of the data allows for the inclusion of all available information and for the investigation of interactions between terms (such as intervention and time). A similar approach will be used to analyse other binary outcomes (e.g., use of psychotropic medication). We will use multilevel mixed models to investigate changes in scores of the MDAS and TICS (continuous variables). All probability tests will be two-tailed and will be declared as significant when p&lt;0.05. 

We based our sample size on a previous trial (Al-Aama et al. 2011) that reported a 15.6% absolute reduction (19.2% versus 3.6%, p&lt;0.02) in the incidence of delirium in their sample. Assuming a 15.6% absolute risk reduction in our patients with a conservative 25% incidence of delirium in the control group and an incidence of 9.4% in the intervention group, we will require 91 participants per group (182 participants in total) to detect a difference of this magnitude with a power of 80% and a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Allowing for a drop out rate of around 15%, we plan to recruit 210 participants.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Delirium is common in patients recovering from surgical procedures, particularly those involving major cardiac surgery. It is associated with numerous adverse consequences, including increased patient suffering, longer hospital stays, increased postoperative complications, increased mortality and poorer cognitive outcomes. Current strategies are only modestly effective in treating delirium and the cornerstone of management is prevention, however even best practice multifactorial interventions only result in a modest reduction in delirium incidence. Melatonin is a naturally occurring compound that is important in the regulation of sleep. Melatonin metabolism dysregulation has been implicated in the development of delirium, although only sparse evidence about its possible role in delirium prevention exists. 

The main aim of this randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial is to determine if 3mg melatonin can reduce the incidence, severity and complications of delirium following cardiac surgery.  

We plan to enrol 210 participants due to undergo elective cardiac surgery. Participants will be randomly allocated to melatonin 3mg or matching placebo for 7 days beginning two nights prior to the scheduled surgery. We are primarily interested in whether those given melatonin have a lower rate of new-onset delirium but will also be interested to see if they experience less delirious symptoms, less depression and anxiety, less cognitive impairment, require less medications during their admission (especially sedative medications) and have shorter stays in hospital and ICU. 

Melatonin is safe, inexpensive and readily available and thus offers a potentially simple, cost effective intervention suitable for use in routine clinical practice.
