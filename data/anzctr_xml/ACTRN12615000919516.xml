  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1- residents:
- detailed assessment of cognitive abilities, sensory preferences and life and trauma history. Cognitive abilities assessed with Large Allens Cognitive Level Screen (LACLS); sensory preferences and life and trauma history by questionnaire. 
- tailored care planning using the information from above assessments, with the objective of providing strategies for staff to use to prevent and manage behavioural and psychological symptoms during activities of daily living. 
- duration of intervention: 4 months.
- mode of administration: one-on-one consultation. 
- person administering intervention: occupational therapist.

Arm 2- paid caregivers:
- education program which aims to increase their understanding of functional cognition according to the Allens Cognitive Disability Model; sensory modulation principles and interventions; and how to adjust caregiving according to individual residents life and trauma experiences.
- weekly micro training sessions where information from resident assessments is shared and strategies developed for issues in care. The objective of this is to provide strategies for staff to use to prevent and manage behavioural and psychological symptoms during activities of daily living. 
- duration of intervention: 4 months.
- mode of administration: one-on-one consultation. 
- person administering intervention: occupational therapist.

Only staff intervention will require monitoring for adherence. Descriptive counts will be kept of the training sessions, durations, and topics covered, and staff attendance at training. Staff will be invited to participate in group interviews and a care file audit will also be conducted to explore other behaviour changes and the frequency and type of interventions offered by staff to residents.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be entered in Excel and then imported into SPSS for analysis. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to examine resident and staff outcomes after the 4 months intervention compared to baseline. The hypothesis for the study in relation to the resident sample is that there will be a significant reduction in NPI-NH scores from pre- to post- implementation for the subscales of agitation, anxiety, irritability, apathy and occupational disruptiveness. The hypothesis for the study in relation to the care staff sample is that there will be a significant increase in self-reported knowledge from pre- to post- implementation.
The power analysis for one sided t test using a sample size of 109 residents indicates the study will be powered at .92 (alpha = .05, effect size = 0.3). Power analyses conducted using Gpower10 suggest 93% power for a repeated measures ANOVA with alpha set at 0.05, an effect size of 0.2 and a correlation between repeated measures of 0.3.

Care staff focus groups will be recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis will be conducted using NVIVO focusing on barriers and reported changes in staff attitudes and behaviours and impact on residents. Care file audits data will also be qualitatively analysed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims:
- To determine whether the Integrated Cognitive &amp; Sensory Program (ICSP) can reduce behavioural and psychological symptoms experienced by residents living in a nursing home.
- To explore care staffs experience during the program, including changes in knowledge and behaviour used to address behavioural and psychological symptoms of residents.

Hypotheses:

For residents:
1. The ICSP will reduce the levels of agitation, anxiety, irritability, apathy and occupational disruptiveness.
2. The ICSP will reduce the levels of total behavioural and psychological symptoms.
These will be demonstrated by the change in mean scores of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version completed before and after intervention.

For care staff:
1. Care staff will demonstrate an increase in knowledge of the cognitive, sensory and trauma-related needs of residents.
2. Care staff will demonstrate positive changes in their ability to identify, anticipate and address resident's behavioural and psychological symptoms.
These will be demonstrated by a pre and post intervention knowledge questionnaire, as well as group interviews/ focus groups and auditing care files. </summary>
