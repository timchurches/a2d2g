  <interventions>
    <interventions>The evaluation will be conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), whereby parents will be randomly allocated to one of four groups: Group A, B, C or D. 
Arm 1:
For Group A, parents will receive a copy of the CBCC resource and attend a 2hr, manualised, group information session hosted by the research team and facilitated by trained personnel.
Arm 2:
For Group B, parents will be mailed a copy of the CBCC resource. They will not be required to attend an information session. The resource includes the A5 70 page Parent Booklet, The Extended Family Booklet, the CBCC website (confidentbody.net), a Do/Don'ts quick reference poster and a children's storybook called "Shapesville". The CBCC resources are evidence-based and design to promote parenting strategies that are protective against, and reduce parenting strategies that are risk factors for, the development of disordered eating, body dissatisfaction and overweight in children.
Arm 3:
For Group C, parents will be mailed a copy of a standard nutrition information resource 'Happy Healthy Kids for Life'. It is a 23-page A5 booklet for parents developed by dieticians at a community health centre in Melbourne, Australia, and is based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines. It contains information about the nutritional components of child healthy eating and some guidance on parental feeding practices, such as avoiding using food as a reward (instrumental feeding). It does not contain any information about child body image, or how teaching children about healthy eating may impact on the development of body satisfaction.
Arm 4:
For Group D, parents will only be asked to complete questionnaires.

All participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and at three follow-up time points (6 weeks, 6-months and 12-months)


To measure fidelity, at 6-week follow-up participants will be asked how much of the resource they read (0-100% sliding scale), whether they used any of the exercises or information in the resource, if they changed their behaviours or attitudes as a result of reading the resource, and what they have done with the resource now (i.e. kept it, thrown it away,  lent it to a friend).</interventions>
    <comparator>Two control treatments will be included: (1) Group C will be an active control group, who will receive the standard nutrition resource 'Happy Healthy Kids for Life';

(2) Group D will be a delayed intervention group, who will only complete questionnaires throughout the trial and will receive all of the resources after completing the 12month follow-up questionnaire.

    <concealment>The research study will be advertised through a range of public forums where parents of young children frequent. Upon expressing interest in participating, parents will be sent detailed information about the study and asked to complete an enrolment form, including personal contact information to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>As part of their enrolment, participants will be asked if they would be able to make themselves available for a face to face information session. Parents who respond 'yes' will be randomly assigned to one of four groups (A, B, C, or D). Parents who respond 'no' will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (B, C, or D). SPSS random sequence generator function will be used to create a random sequence of ABCD. As participants enrol in the study, they will be placed next to one letter in the sequence, indicating their allocation to group. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Given this is a four-arm RCT, it was determined that 80 participants would be required in each group (n = 320) to provide 80% power to detect a small-medium (d=.02) effect size.
ANCOVA and MMRM will be used to assess how groups change over time and whether they are significantly different from each other at each time point, taking into account differences at baseline and missing data at follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project involves evaluating the effectiveness of a new parenting resource, Confident Body, Confident Child (CBCC). Parents who receive CBCC will be compared with parents who do not receive CBCC on attitudes, behaviours, and knowledge about body image and healthy eating patterns at pre-intervention, and at three post-intervention time points.</summary>
