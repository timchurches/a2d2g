  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 month randomised dietary intervention trial where all subjects receive weight reduction (energy restriction) advice.  The advice is delivered by an Accredited Practising Dietitian in an individual consultation at commencement of the study.  The dietitian will also review the participant at one and two months at a further face to face consultation.                                                Intervention patients receive identical advice and the same products but enriched with beta-glucan.  The intervention participants are in two groups - moderate (4-5 g beta-glucan/day) and high (7-8 g beta-glucan/day). All subjects are blinded to their control/intervention group status.</interventions>

The advice is delivered by an Accredited Practising Dietitian in an individual consultation at commencement of the study.  The dietitian will also review the participant at one and two months at a further face to face consultation.  Control patients receive advice on an energy-restricted diet plus low kilojoule breakfast cereals and cereal based snack bars with negligible beta-glucan (placebo). </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is hypothesized that soluble fibre from oats will increase satiety, when consumed as part of an energy-controlled diet.  The increased satiety will allow improved compliance with dietary regimens and result in increased weight loss in overweight individuals compared with control subjects on energy restriction alone.</summary>
