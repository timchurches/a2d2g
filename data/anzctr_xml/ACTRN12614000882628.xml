    <interventions>Robotic-assisted middle pancreatectomy
Robot-assisted laparoscopy is the most advanced minimally invasive surgery technique characteristic of a magnified three-dimensional visualization and endowrist instruments with greater range of motion.Middle Pancreatectomy (MP) is a major surgical operation for borderline or benign tumor of pancreatic neck and body.
Approximate duration required to complete robotic-assisted
MP is about 200minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Open middle pancreatectomy
Open middle Pancreatectomy (MP) is a major traditional surgical operation for borderline or benign tumor of pancreatic neck and body.
Approximate duration required to complete open MP is about 180minutes.</comparator>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint was the overall length of hospital stay (LOS), are calculated by subtracting day of admission from day of discharge. For the primary endpoint, estimates for standard deviation (SD) and minimal clinically relevant difference were derived from the existing literature. For the sample size calculation, a postulated time saving of 6 days was considered clinically relevant. The SD for postoperative hospital stay is known to be about 9 days. Calculations were based on a power of 80% and an a error of 5%, a number of at least 40 patients for each group was necessary. Anticipating a dropout rate of 10% and intended using nonparametric statistics, we increased the sample size to 50 patients per arm.The statistical software SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. Continuous data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range, IQR). Normally distributed variables were compared using the two independent samples Student t test. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical data were expressed as n (%) and compared using the chi-square test or Fishers exact test. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for primary endpoint and pancreatic fistula, which were expressed as odd ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>
