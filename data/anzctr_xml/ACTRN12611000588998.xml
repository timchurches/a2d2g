  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Definite bite by a red-bellied black snake:

a.Expert identification of the snake or snake brought in and identified by a photograph sent to the investigators; OR
b.Characteristic description of a RBBS (black snake with red sides and cream/yellow ventral surface) AND detection of black snake (or black snake/tiger snake) on a snake venom detection kit.

2. Early evidence of envenoming (any of):
a. Non-specific systemic effects including two of nausea/vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea
b. Anticoagulant coagulopathy defined as an activated partial thromboplastin time above the normal range for the local laboratory

    <concealment>Enrolment will be triggered by a variety of complementary methods proven to be highly effective with the Australian snakebite project. These include regular staff education regarding trial processes, emergency department triage triggers and signs on antivenom containers in drug refrigerators. Enrolment will require contacting the 1800 676 944 phone number diverted to one of the chief investigators or research data manager. The on-call investigator/data manager will keep a list of all study packs at each hospital. Brief demographic and clinical data will be faxed, and after informed consent is confirmed, the randomisation will be done by a secure online website. The website will contain a database of all treatment packs at each hospital and provide the study code for the treatment pack that is required. The treating team will simply find the treatment pack with the corresponding study code.</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomisation will be used with random block-sizes which will then be organised into packs of 4 treatments for each site. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Muscle damage can result from snake bite which is irreversible and there is no specific treatment for except
antivenom. Redbellied black snake bite provides a unique opportunity to study antivenom use in muscle damage in snake bite because this snake occurs across large population areas of NSW and Queensland. The study will
determine if antivenom is effective and safe in red bellied black snake bite and whether it is therefore useful for other important snakes that cause muscle damage worldwide. </summary>
