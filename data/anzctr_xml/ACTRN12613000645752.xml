    <interventions>Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is an inexpensive, non-invasive method of measuring the blood flow in the small vessels of the skin. In allergic patients, following skin testing the small blood vessels in the skin open and blood flow increases.  This can be detected by LDF in a manner that is more objective.

The laser used in LDF is a Moor FLPI-2.  It is classified as a class 1 laser.  The product information states it is safe to use without eye protection.  The Monash University OHS website states that class 1 lasers are safe under most circumstances and are incapable of damaging the eyes or skin because of either engineered design or inherently low power output.

The study will involve testing concurrently, at the same site, conventional skin testing and LDF testing. 

Conventional skin testing will be undertaken to the drugs that the patient was exposed to perioperatively that could have been potential causal agents for allergy. Therefore the drugs tested will be specific to each individual case and we cannot predict what drugs will be skin tested as that depends on what drugs were administered during the anaesthetic.

Our testing involves intradermal administration of all the drugs that were given. Intradermal testing involves giving 0.02ml of dilute drug into the dermis of the skin. The dilutions vary depending on the drug from 1:100 to 1:100 000. That equates to about one millionth of the dose of the drug that was administered in the anaesthetic. We also do a positive control - that is a skin prick test (much &lt;0.02mL) of 8mg/ml histamine.

One clinician will inject all the drugs to be tested into the skin at the same time as per conventional skin testing protocols.  At 20 minutes after skin injection, a second clinician will assess the patients test site, again, using conventional skin testing protocols. The LDF testing will be recorded by the first clinician and stored on a password protected, specifically assigned computer.

At another time (to allow blinding) the second clinician will assess the LDF results.  

The conclusions made using both assessment methods will be compared.

    <comparator>LDF is compared to conventional skin prick testing which is the gold standard test for identification of anaesthetic agents that a patient is allergic to. This currently involves injecting diluted drug into the skin and measuring the swelling (wheal) and redness (flare) that has developed after 20 minutes.  The clinician makes these measurements with a device such as a ruler or callipers</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims / Objectives
To compare the results from a Laser Doppler Flowmetry -based test against the current gold standard protocols for skin testing in patients suspected of severe allergic reaction.

Hypothesis
LDF-based testing is as accurate as conventional skin testing protocols in assessing anaesthetic allergy.

Significance of project
LDF-based testing is objective, inexpensive and non-invasive. This may prove to be a valid alternative to conventional skin testing and may facilitate the identification of an allergic agent in patients that have proven to be difficult using previous testing protocols. It may present a faster, more efficient and reliable method of undertaking skin testing with the potential to discriminate between two main causes of serious allergic reaction (currently indistinguishable); Anaphylactic (IgE mediated allergy) versus anaphylactoid (direct histamine amplification).</summary>
