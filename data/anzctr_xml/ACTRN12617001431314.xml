    <interventions>The Principal Investigator developed the pamphlet two phases. 
Phase 1:  
An exploratory qualitative study to identify knowledge gaps and determine factors that influence parents help-seeking intentions for ocular symptoms in young children was undertaken. With Human Research Ethics Approval, 18 parents participated in 5 focus groups using photographic prompts of different eye diseases/problems in children. These included: conjunctivitis, swollen eye, white pupil [leukocoria] and turned/crossed-eye [strabismus].  

Using an inductive thematic analysis approach [Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006], data from the focus groups were then analysed to inform and guide the content of the paediatric eye-health awareness pamphlet for parents. The development of this pamphlet was grounded in an evidence-based approach to develop health promotion materials - Information-Motivation-Behavioural skills (IMB) model. {Abraham &amp; Kools, 2012] This theoretical framework specifies that effective health promotion material needs to: address information gaps [information]; provide arguments that motivate behaviour [motivation]; and provide instruction and explanation to perform behaviour [behaviour skills]. Key messages included in the pamphlet addressed the deficits in their knowledge that were identified, messages to motivate action and messages to inform behavioural skills to bring about a change in behaviour.

Phase 2:
Seventeen cognitive interviews were conducted with women who were either pregnant, had children or were of child-bearing age to review the pamphlet and provide feedback on content, design, layout and comprehension. Following this process, the pamphlet was modified accordingly. 

The intervention is provided once only for participants randomised to the intervention group at Baseline. Following un-blinding at the conclusion of the study, participants allocated to the control group at Baseline will be provided with the pamphlet to maintain clinical equipoise.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is a very brief information pamphlet which provides information to the participant about  playing with a baby. There is no content referring to signs of paediatric eye disease. This pamphlet is currently available to parents via the Department of Education and Training Maternal and Child Health Information website and is provided to all parents when their child is born.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat method i.e. regardless of whether those in the intervention group read the leaflet or not. Response of the two groups of parents (intervention and control) will be compared initially using non-parametric tests given the ordinal nature of the data (such as Mann-Whitney test). Rasch analysis will be performed on appropriate outcome assessment to ensure that study-specific assessment tools are psychometrically sound. Confounding variables such as age, English as a second language and educational status will be explored and adjusted for, as appropriate in multiple logistic regression analysis. Additionally, all available participant information will be used to screen for factors that could moderate the outcome of the intervention i.e. does the intervention only have an effect in those with higher levels of education?</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Retinoblastoma is the most commonly occurring paediatric eye cancer. The earliest signs of disease include leukocoria (white pupil) and strabismus (crossed eye). Untreated, retinoblastoma results in loss of sight, eye or life. Common strabismus occurs in up to 2-4% of children resulting in poor vision when diagnosed and treated late. Unfortunately, white pupil or strabismus are often ignored as there is a lack of information and misinformation regarding the importance of these signs. 
Currently, no systematic information is provided to parents in Victoria regarding leukocoria or strabismus. Raising parental awareness of these signs could reduce delays in diagnosis and result in earlier treatment with the potential for improved outcomes. 
This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate an evidence-based, theory-informed information pamphlet that has been developed for parents. It is hypothesized that parents who receive the pamphlet would be more alert to these early signs and have heightened help-seeking intentions.
