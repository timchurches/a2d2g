  <interventions>
    <interventions>A group based circuit exercise training program (EX) (without changes to dietary intake), supervised by an exercise physiologist, involving one hour of training three times per week for six months. The circuit training consists of 15 resistance exercises with training intensity fixed at 50% of one repetition maximum (1-RM), reassessed monthly. The 1-RM test involves the participant lifting the heaviest weight possible whereby they can perform only 1 repetition. This weight is then halved and set as the weight used for the training session. This assessment is individualised for each muscle group and repeated monthly so that any increases in strength (1-RM) during the program are accounted for and the intensity remains stable at 50% 1-RM relative to improving strength.</interventions>
    <comparator>diet-induced (DI) energy restriction (without changes to physical activity) with the aim of 5-10% body weight loss over 4 months and maintenance of weight for a further two months. The Dietary group will be prescribed an individualised 500kCal/day energy deficit diet by an accredited practicing Dietitian for the first 2 months with an aim to decrease weight by 0.5kg per week. The dietary composition aims to provide 45% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 20% protein. Participants have weekly appointments with the Dietitian for the first 4 months, followed by fortnightly appointments for 2 months whereby energy prescription is adjusted to ensure maintenance of weight loss. Diet diaries and diet histories are taken to assess food intake.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Liver Histology: A liver biopsy will be performed at baseline and at 6 months to assess steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis. The histological features of disease will be used in a validated scoring system (NAFLD activity score). Change in individual features and scores will be monitored.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hepatic and Peripheral Insulin resistance: Sites and severity of insulin resistance will be assessed using a euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique with stable glucose tracer infusion to detect both liver and muscle insulin resistance. The clamp assessment requires infusion of insulin and labelled glucose and blood draws every 5-10 mins for 2 hours until steady state infusions are reached.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>NAFLD is a common liver disease associated with obesity and insulin resistance. There is no drug therapy and while there is general consensus that lifestyle intervention is effective at reducing steatosis our understanding of the distinct roles of diet and exercise on liver injury remains unclear. This study assesses the histological and metabolic effects of 6 months circuit exercise training compared with diet-induced weight loss in overweight patients with NAFLD.</summary>
