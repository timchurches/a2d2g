  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Overall Preference for Nasal Spray Assessed by Preference Questionnaire. - An overall preference questionnaire (OPQ) was used to evaluate participants' preference for nasal spray therapy for the given treatments. OPQ allows the responder three options, based on products attributes, i.e. preference for product 1; preference for product 2 and no preference. The OPQ was completed by each participant approximately 4 minutes after administration of the second treatment in Period 2. Overall participant preferences were analyzed using Prescott's test, as approximated by a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusted for country and symptomatology. All preference p-values were also adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg's method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately four minutes after the administration of the second treatment</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Male or female subjects who are between 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive at the time
             of signing the informed consent.

          -  Severity of disease: Subjects who meet the below criteria and who may also have
             vasomotor rhinitis are eligible for the study. A positive skin test to perennial (for
             example, but not limited to, animal dander, house dust mites, cockroach, mould) and /
             or seasonal (for example, but not limited to, grass, tree, weed, ragweed) allergen
             within 12 months prior to Screening. If a subject has not been tested in the 12 months
             prior to Screening, a positive skin test (by prick method) is required at Screening. A
             positive skin test is defined as a wheal &gt;=3 millimeters (mm) larger than the diluent
             control for prick testing. In vitro tests for specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) [such as
             radioallergosorbent test (RAST), paper radioimmunosorbent test (PRIST)] will not be
             allowed as a diagnosis of AR.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant [as confirmed by a
             negative urine (preferred) or serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test], not
             lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: (a) Non-reproductive
             potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or
             documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of
             bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented bilateral oophorectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their
             HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. (b) Reproductive potential and agrees
             to follow one of the options listed below in the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) modified list
             of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of reproductive
             potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication
             and until at least 4 days after the last dose of study medication. The GSK modified
             list of highly effective methods includes: contraceptive subdermal implant that meets
             the standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of
             failure per year, as stated in the product label; Intrauterine device or intrauterine

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to provide information on whether subjects with allergic
      rhinitis (AR) prefer the administration of fluticasone furoate (FF) nasal spray or mometasone
      furoate (MF) nasal spray based on how the products feel to the subjects when administered.

      This Phase IV interventional study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, single-dose,
      cross-over subject preference study to evaluate and compare patient preference for FF [(total
      dose of 110 microgram (mcg)] and MF (total dose of 200 mcg) nasal sprays in subjects with
      allergic rhinitis. These two commonly used nasal sprays use different actuation systems (FF
      nasal spray is side-actuated; MF nasal spray is top-actuated) and this study will evaluate
      whether this difference is reflected in the patient-assessed attributes of the two nasal
      sprays. The attributes or properties which are being assessed by the subjects for these nasal
      sprays include smell, taste &amp; aftertaste, drip down the throat, run out of the nose, urge to
      sneeze, and irritation.

      The single-day study per subject comprises screening and all treatments and procedures.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a cross-over treatment schedule so that all
      subjects receive both products. One group of subjects will have two sprays of FF administered
      in each nostril whilst a second group will have two sprays of MF administered into each
      nostril. At 30 (± 5) minutes after the first study medication treatment, the two groups will
      switch. The first group will then have two sprays of MF administered into each nostril and
      the second group will then have two sprays of FF administered into each nostril. After each
      treatment the subject will complete two sets of attributes questionnaires ('immediate' and
      'delayed'). A subject-rated 'immediate' attributes questionnaire will be completed
      immediately following each treatment and a subject-rated 'delayed' attributes questionnaire
      will be completed approximately 2 minutes after each treatment. Upon completion of the second
      set of these two attributes questionnaires (immediate and delayed), a preference
      questionnaire will be completed by the subject. In the preference questionnaire, the subject
      states their preferred treatment, if any, for each of the product attributes, and finally
      states their overall preferred treatment, if any.

      There will be follow-up contact with the subject 24 (± 4) and 96 (± 4) hours after
      administration of the last treatment. The study is planned to enroll about 300 subjects.</summary>
