  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is the Better OutcOmes &amp; Successful Transitions for Autism (BOOST-A). The BOOST-A is an online protocol that will guide adolescents with high functioning autism/Asperger's Syndrome (HFA/AS) to plan their transition from school to employment. This will be done with the adolescent's 'transition team', which includes their parents/carers, relevant school staff, and any other professionals involved in their transition planning. The protocol has a strengths and interests based assessment, which will provide guidance on potential job pathways for the adolescent. It also assists with goal setting to promote engagement in activities to increase the likelihood that the adolescent will be successful in obtaining employment post-school. The protocol was developed based on a literature review of best-practice in transition planning, as well as a survey and interviews of adolescents with HFA/AS, their parents/carers and professionals about the ideal transition planning process.

The protocol involves a number of phases:
Phase 1 and 2: Preparation and Assessment. Duration is 1-2 hours. Completed online with the adolescent and the parent. 
Phase 3: Goal setting. Done with the team at a meeting that would run for about 1 hour. 
Phase 4: Review. Done with the team at a recurring meeting that will run for 0.5-1 hour. 

Time frame:
Overall duration of intervention: Roughly 3-4 years (from Year 9 to Year 12). The current RCT will monitor 1 year of this process.
Phase 1 &amp; 2: Over a period of 2 weeks.
Phase 3: Within 1 month of completing Phase 1 &amp; 2 (by Week 6).
Phase 4: The meetings are held once a term, or every 3 months, for the period of roughly 3 years.

Strategies used to monitor adherence to the intervention include monitoring participant's usage of the online program (which stored data in a central database). Participants will also be asked to report on how often they've used the protocol and with whom.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control/comparator group is the 'Treatment As Usual' Group. This group will engage in the standard transition planning practice for adolescents with HFA/AS, which is typically initiated by parents or the school staff. This may include: academic skill development, preparation for higher education, engagement in vocational education or training or work experience.</comparator>

This is a questionnaire developed by the researchers.

    <concealment>A cluster RCT will be undertaken. Each local government area will be allocated to the protocol or control group. The area that the participant's school is in will determine whether they are in the protocol or control group. Participants will be asked to provide their school name when expressing interest in participating in the study, and at this point they will be randomised. 

Allocation is not concealed (as it is done by postcode).</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation will be used to generate the sequence in which each local government area will be allocated to either protocol or control group. This will involve computerised sequence generation.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Group equivalence at baseline will be determined based on gender, socioeconomic status and ASD symptoms. The sample size allows for detection of a Cohens d (standardized difference) of 0.6 or larger with a beta-level of 0.2 and an a-level of 0.05. Outcomes will be analysed using a t-test and/or Mann-Whitney U depending on whether they outcomes use scale or ordinal variables. ANOVA will be used to analyse the difference; within individuals, within groups and between the groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently there are low rates of employment amongst people with high functioning autism/Asperger's Syndrome (HFA/AS). This project aims to develop a protocol to assist adolescents with HFA/AS in planning what they will do when they leave school. We anticipate this will result in more individuals with HFA/AS in successful long term employment. The results from this study will inform vocational rehabilitation approaches, education practices, occupational therapy practice and employment related interventions for adolescents with HFA/AS.</summary>
