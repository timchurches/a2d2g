  <interventions>
    <interventions>A home based intervention is designed  to compare the effect of an intensive, home-based early intervention for first-time mothers of newborn babies, versus usual care, on child and family eating patterns, television viewing, opportunities for physical activity and anthropometric measures.

 

First-time mothers with a newborn are eligible for enrolment in the study and will receive the following intervention:

·                        Intensive Home-Based Early Intervention delivered by a specially trained nurse over the first two years of life, promoting healthy feeding and physical activity and enhanced parent-child interaction;

·                       

The intervention comprises eight home visits from a specially trained community nurse delivering the staged intervention which includes one home visit before child's birth between gestation age of 24 and 36 weeks, and  seven home visits after child's birth at 1, 3, 5, 9, 12, 15 and 24 months together with pro-active telephone support between the visits. The number of telephone calls needed will be determined by the nurses</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the importance of preventing overweight and obesity in children, few primary prevention interventions have been shown to be effective. We propose a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an original community-based home visiting intervention designed to improve family and behavioural risk factors for childhood overweight and obesity for first-time mothers in the most socially and economically disadvantaged areas of Sydney. It addresses the key research question:

Will an intensive home-based early intervention over the first two years of life increase healthy feeding and physical activity, enhance parent-child interaction and lead to reduced levels of overweight and obesity among children aged 3 years?</summary>
