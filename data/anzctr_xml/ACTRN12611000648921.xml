  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Psoriasis is a common, non-infectious inflammatory disease of the skin for which there is no known cure.  This condition can have a profound negative effect on quality of life, both physically and psychologically.  All existing treatments have significant drawbacks, including increased risk of infection and cancers.  Many of the known functions of vitamin D oppose the symptoms of psoriasis, including reducing inflammation, cell overgrowth and immune response.  In addition, vitamin D is the most likely therapeutic agent in some topical creams and UVB light therapy.  We propose that supplementation of vitamin D in psoriasis patients will increase and maintain vitamin D levels and consequently reduce psoriasis symptoms in a similar manner to UVB and topical treatments, but without the risks, side effects or inconvenience.  One hundred men and women with psoriasis will be recruited for a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Subjects will be matched for severity and randomised into active and placebo groups.  They will attend five appointments over a one year period, during which they will take vitamin D or placebo, and be assessed for vitamin D status, levels of other relevant biomarkers, change in extent of psoriasis, body composition, and quality of life. We will also investigate whether there are any interactions between different vitamin D receptor genes and response to vitamin D.  It is hypothesised that those taking vitamin D will show an improvement in psoriasis alongside an increase in vitamin D levels compared to those on the placebo, and that there will be a relationship between at least one vitamin D receptor genetic variation and response to vitamin D.</summary>
