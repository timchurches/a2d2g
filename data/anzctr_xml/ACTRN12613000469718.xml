  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Vitamin C in patients with cancer pain.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have pain related to cancer or its treatment, for which you are receiving regular daily opioids (painkillers). 

Trial details
All participants in this trial will take two 1 gram tablets of vitamin C daily for 3 consecutive days in addition to your normal pain medications. You will be asked to complete some forms regarding pain medication use and pain relief over this 3 day period. 

This will enable us to determine whether there is any benefit in pain relief and/or your need to take extra or breakthrough pain medications.
