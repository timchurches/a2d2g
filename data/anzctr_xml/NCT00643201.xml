    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Adjudicated Composite of Symptomatic, Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or VTE-Related Death During 6 Months of Treatment - VTE: nonfatal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE). All events were adjudicated by an ICAC blinded to treatment. DVT assessed by compression ultrasound and/or venography; PE assessed by spiral computed tomography scanning, pulmonary angiography, and/or ventilation/perfusion lung scan. Event rate (proportion of participants): n/N (n=number of participants with observation; N=total number of efficacy evaluable participants). Intended treatment period: longer of the dosing period plus 2 days (completed treatment) or 355 days (discontinued early). Composite endpoint: events at any time from randomization until end of intended treatment, regardless whether drug treatment was received. All randomized participants with a non-missing primary endpoint were summarized. Missing endpoint = outcomes which could not be documented on or after study Day 154. Participants were categorized to the assigned group regardless of the treatment actually received (intent-to-treat).</outcome>
