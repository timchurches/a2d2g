  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab
Treatment: drugs - MTIG7192A

Experimental: Phase Ia Dose-Escalation Stage: MTIG7192A - Cohorts of at least 3 participants each will be treated with escalating doses of MTIG7192A to determine the MTD or maximum administered dose (MAD).

Experimental: Phase Ia Expansion Stage: MTIG7192A - Approximately 20 to 40 participants will be enrolled in the expansion stage to better characterize the safety, tolerability, PK variability, and preliminary efficacy of MTIG7192A in different cancer types.

Experimental: Phase Ib Dose-Escalation Stage: MTIG7192A+Atezolizumab - Cohorts of at least 3 participants each will be treated with escalating doses of MTIG7192A in combination with a fixed dose of atezolizumab to determine the MTD or MAD.

Experimental: Phase Ib Expansion Stage: MTIG7192A+Atezolizumab - At least approximately 160 participants will be enrolled in the expansion stage to better characterize the safety, tolerability, PK variability, and preliminary efficacy of MTIG7192A in combination with atezolizumab in different cancer types.


Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab
Atezolizumab will be given as 1200 mg via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle in combination with MTIG7192A. Combination treatment may continue until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit.

Treatment: drugs: MTIG7192A
Several dose levels will be evaluated for MTIG7192A administered as a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab. MTIG7192A will be given via intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit. Those who discontinue treatment with single-agent MTIG7192A may receive combination treatment with MTIG7192A plus atezolizumab. Combination treatment may continue until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit.
