  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive a web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) course comprised of six online sessions, once per week, delivered by an animated personal therapist (avatar), with automated web and email support developed by Sleepio limited (see www.sleepio.com/research). Each session has a minimum duration of 20 minutes. In this web-based program, underlying algorithms feed the delivery of information, support, and advice in a personally tailored manner. The CBT content is consistent with the literature and covers behavioural (eg sleep restriction, stimulus control) and cognitive (eg thought re-structuring, imagery, articulatory suppression, paradoxical intention, mindfulness) strategies. It also includes additional relaxation strategies and advice on lifestyle and bedroom factors (sleep hygiene). Participants will have access to a video library/back catalogue of session content and Wikipedia style articles. Online CBT users will also be able to participate in a moderated social network/community of users. 

All web-based interactions from the participants in the web-based CBT course will be electronically stored and participation activity will be assessed. We will record the following information: diary entries, session activities, engagement with the community, adherence to tasks. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group will be also given a web-based education program delivered by email. Participants will receive a weekly email, during 6 weeks period (to match the CBT-group), containing material with information regarding sleeping, mainly extracted from the Sleepio library. The participants in this group will receive one email per week. The number of participants that have read each email will be recorded. This intervention was chosen for the control group because there is insufficient evidence that sleep hygiene alone is effective in the treatment of chronic insomnia. </comparator>

      <outcome>Sleep efficiency: data obtained from the sleep diary. 

Sleep efficiency is the ratio of time spent asleep (total sleep time) to the amount of time spent in bed. Specifically, the following questions will be asked: What time did you get into bed?, What time did you try to go sleep?, How long did it take you to fall asleep?, How many times did you wake up during the night?, In total, how long did these awakenings last?, What time was your final awakening?, What time did you get out of bed for the day?.

Participants in the intervention group will be required to answer these questions daily while those on the control group will answer at baseline and follow-ups.

      <outcome>Recruitment rate
Throughout the recruitment process, records will be kept regarding the number of twins screened for entry to the trial. If the twins are not admitted to the trial, the reason why they were ineligible for inclusion will be recorded. Similarly, if eligible, the reasons declining participation in the trial will be noted.</outcome>

      <outcome>Diffusion or imitation of interventions

Despite all the advantages in conducting a radomised co-twin trial, diffusion of interventions between twins in a pair could be a threat to the methodological quality of the trial.

      <outcome>Intervention credibility

      <outcome>Twins opinion regarding the intervention

A phone interview will be used to investigate the twins' opinion regarding the intervention and study. The interview will be conducted with twins that have concluded the study and also with those who have dropout. The phone interview will be recorded. They will be required to answer questions regarding:
i) their experience with the intervention, 
ii) what they liked and what they did not like about it, 
iii) how difficult was to follow the protocol, to answer the questionnaires and to receive a complete web-based intervention,
iv) what should be changed for the intervention to be more pleasant (in their opinion),
v) opinion regarding the efficacy of the intervention for their sleep and/or low back pain problems, 
vi) would they recommend this intervention to someone else,
vii) barriers experienced during the trial period.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Twins registered with the ATR will be invited to participate in this study based on the answers to a previous health and lifestyle questionnaire that has been designed by the ATR (ATR Health &amp; Lifestyle 2014-002 study). Twins will be invited to answer a screening questionnaire. The ATR will send to the researcher the details of the twins who met the inclusion criteria based on the answers of the screening questionnaire. Once both twins in a pair meet these inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study, we will randomise them into two groups. Allocation to the two intervention groups will be blinded and performed using a computer-generated random allocation schedule operated by a remote researcher and concealed from the main assessor of the study. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be stored in spreadsheets and transferred to appropriate statistical software for analysis by an investigator blinded to group allocation. Spreadsheets will be regularly scrutinised for omissions and errors. 

Separate analyses will be conducted to determine the effects of intervention at the different follow ups. Analysis will be by intention-to-treat, with data being analysed for all randomized subjects for whom follow-up data will be available. No attempt will be made to impute values for missing data. Cases with missing data at a particular follow-up will be dropped from analyses. The emphasis in the analysis will be on estimation of the effects of intervention rather than hypothesis testing. To maximize precision we will use analysis of covariance. For each analysis the only covariate, chosen a priori, will be the baseline value of the outcome.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this pilot study is to investigate the value of a sleep quality program in people with low back pain and insomnia. This study will help us to understand the effects of a 6-week online sleep program in people suffering with insomnia and low back pain. The secondary aims are to: 1) determine the rate of recruitment of adult twins registered at the Australian Twin Registry (ATR) with low back pain and insomnia to participate in the trial, 2) determine the attendance at web-based sessions and adherence to the intervention protocol, 3) determine follow-up rate, 4) investigate diffusion or imitation of interventions between twins in a pair, 5) determine the twins opinion regarding the intervention, 6) identify possible difficulties that could be experienced during the trial, such as technical problems. </summary>
