  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.	An initial brief psychosocial assessment and intervention  based on a semi-structured interview and recorded in the form of an Eco-map. This involves a face to face session with one of our researchers (a social work student) exploring current concerns in patients' lives that may be impacting on their cancer diagnosis, guided by a questionnaire. 
The intervention is administered when the patient is admitted to hospital, if they are undergoing surgery, or at a chemotherapy appointment, if they are undergoing chemotherapy. 
2.	Six follow up phone calls, occurring at weekly intervals. This is administered by the same researcher who conducts the face-to-face interviews to see how patients are adjusting at home after their time in hospital, and how they have been dealing with any psychosocial stressors. They can last 5-10 minutes. 
3.	Two additional eco-maps, occurring with the third and last phone calls
4.	At the time of the final telephone call, the Patient Experience questionnaire and follow up SF-36 will be administered

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the impact of supportive care screening and follow up on patients being treated at the Royal Womens Hospital for gynaecological cancer. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or above who has a new diagnosis of gynaecological cancer for which you are undergoing treatment at the Royal Womens Hospital. 

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive the standard hospital supportive care screening tools. Participants in the other group will receive an 'enhanced model of supportive care screening'. This incorporates a single supportive care intervention where the participant has a face-to-face conversation with one of our researchers regarding psychosocial stressors that may be impacting on the patient's cancer diagnosis and what can be done to alleviate some of those stressors. 

All participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires between 3-6 months post enrolment in order to evaluate their patient experience and quality of life. The study will also audit the process of the patient treatment pathway and review modifiable and non-modifiable factors in the patient commencing in, remaining in, and completing treatment, and describe any complexities arising from this process. Furthermore, it is hoped that this project will provide evidence to inform future psychosocial practices and evidence based guidelines within gynaecological cancer care.</summary>
