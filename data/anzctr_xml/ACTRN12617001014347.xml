  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a modified Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction programme delivered by a Mindfulness trainer, Marlies Dorrestein. The programme will comprise weekly, individualised 45-minute sessions over six weeks, with brief, daily homework exercises to be completed between sessions. There will be one top-up session at 4 weeks post-completion of the initial six week programme. Top-up or booster sessions have been shown to be important for discussing any barriers encountered in implementing the intervention in everyday life and to facilitate long term outcomes. The sessions will be based on standard MT approaches but will emphasise simple, brief mindfulness exercises to minimise potential difficulties due to reduced executive function, impaired concentration or fatigue. Participants will be provided with examples of ways they can incorporate and apply these exercises into their daily life. Sessions will include education about stroke as well as mindfulness. Homework tasks will involve 5-10 minute, guided (i.e. DVD) mindfulness exercises that gradually increase the dose over the duration of the programme. Handouts will be provided to participants as reminders of the techniques they have learnt and they will be supplied with a book (Mindfulness for Health) and accompanying DVD to guide their home-based practice. Grant Rix of the Mindfulness  Education Group https://mindfulnesseducation.nz/about/ will meet with Marlies for one hour a week initially and then fortnightly by Skype for a maximum of 40 1 hour sessions to provide professional supervision and mentoring.

The study will be monitored to ensure data quality and to facilitate entry of participants into the study and subsequent adherence.  The Study coordinator will set up and maintain a tracking sheet outlining date and outcome of contact with participants, and dates of completion of MT sessions to ensure documentation of outcome for all participants.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our primary outcome measure is the Beck Depression Inventory 2nd Edition - BDI-II, an internationally used measure of depression severity validated with neurological samples.  The  BDI-II  has a Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of 5.8. Participants must score above 14 on the BDI-II to participate in this study (i.e.  score in the 'mild depression' range or above).

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants must be 17 years of age or older and have experienced a stroke more than six months and less than five years ago.  They will be experiencing low mood (as measured by having a Beck Depression Inventory-II score greater than 14), and are able to give informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

    <designfeatures>Twenty participants who are stroke survivors will be recruited for this single centre, single arm trial. There will be no control group, as the purpose of this study is to address the feasibility issues that may affect the viability of a full study including the study protocols, recruitment and retention rates rather than determine if the intervention is effective.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics (mean, sd, frequencies) for all pre- and post-intervention assessment measures (questionnaires) will be calculated and the correlations between pre- and post-scores calculated. This is a feasibility study and the data on the Beck Depression Inventory - II, our primary outcome measure,  will be used to complete a power calculation prior to a full trial. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in New Zealand with long-lasting effects on quality of life including depression, anxiety and fatigue.  Mindfulness training (MT) is a safe, easily-learned technique for reducing depression and anxiety and improving coping skills.  This feasibility study aims to explore a number of practical issues in providing MT to people with stroke as well as addressing identified feasibility issues.  Clarifying these issues will allow us to conduct a clinical trial to test whether MT is an effective method for improving the quality of life in people after a stroke.</summary>
