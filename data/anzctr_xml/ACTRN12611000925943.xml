    <interventions>The intervention is a five-minute educational DVD designed to inform problem gamblers requesting self-exclusion of the nature and responsibilities of the self-exclusion order, and to enhance motivation (reflected in increased take-up rates) to seek treatment interventions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Self-excluding problem gamblers completing current standard self-exclusion procedures. The standard procedure is for a problem gamblers seeking to self exclude to approach the responsible gambling manager, be informed of the conditions and requirements of self-exclusion, complete a self-exclusion order, and then he/she is refused entry into the casino if subsequently detected attempting to enter.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of a 5-minute intervention DVD on (1) increased compliance with self-exclusion orders, (2) increased uptake of concurrent mental health treatments, self-help resources and groups, and counseling, and (3) reduction in gambling related-harms and severity of problem gambling.  The design will include a randomized controlled trial (an intervention group (DVD) and a control group receiving current standard procedures) in which the DVD will be provided to a sample of self-excluders and outcomes compared to a sample receiving treatment as usual that is, the standard self-exclusion information package and procedure. 

Specific hypotheses:
1.	That a 5-minute intervention DVD informing self-excluders of the nature and requirements of the program and utilizing motivational interviewing principles guiding self-evaluation and appraisal coupled with benefits of accessing complementary treatment interventions will:
a.	Increase the proportion of self-excluders taking up referrals to appropriate mental health treatment interventions
b.	Increase compliance with self-exclusion requirements as assessed by reduced number of detected and self-reported breaches
c.	Reduced severity of gambling behaviour and harms as assessed by scores on the PGSI of the CPGI, DSM-IV, patterns of self-reported behaviour and expenditure, improved relationships and psychological well being, and measures of gambling-related harms, in addition to event history (timing of breaches relative to initiating self-exclusion).</summary>
