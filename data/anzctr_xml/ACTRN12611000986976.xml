  <interventions>
    <interventions>Muscle power training of the leg extensors, knee flexors, hip flexors and hip abductors twice a week for 3 months. These exercises will be performed on Keiser pneumatic variable resistance equipment (Fresno, CA), specifically on the seated leg press, seated leg curl and standing hip machines. The training will comprise 3 sets of 8 repetitions, with training loads of 40% 1RM for the 1st set, 50% 1RM for the 2nd set and 60% 1RM for the 3rd set. When participants are able to perform 10 repetitions of the final set, their training load will be increased by 5% for the next training session. Participants will perform the concentric component of each exercise as fast as possible.  Participants will train in pairs under full supervision of a physiotherapist in a university laboratory. Participants will take turns to complete each set, providing encouragement for their training partner while physically resting in order to maximise the benefits of observational learning. The entire session will last approximately 1 hour, commencing with a warm-up of 4 slow repetitions at 20% 1RM for each exercise, and cooling down by marching on the spot for up to 30 seconds after each exercise.</interventions>
    <comparator>Homebased flexibility exercises for the leg flexors and extensors, hip abductors, trunk flexors and trunk rotators. Participants will receive a home visit from a physiotherapist to set them up with their exercises, and subsequently they will perform the exercises twice a week on their own for 3 months. Participants will keep a written record of exercises completed and will be telephoned once a fortnight to monitor progress and provide encouragement. The home exercises will comprise 2 sets of each exercise, with 8 repetitions per set for the 1st month, 10 repetitions per set for the 2nd month, and 12 repetitions per set for the 3rd month.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Muscle power is reduced in people with Parkinsons disease and is associated with reduced walking speed and falls. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to determine whether the benefits of muscle power training on walking speed and balance demonstrated in the older general population can be gained by people with Parkinsons disease. Muscle power training deliberately targets the fundamental problem of slowness of movement, making evaluation of the effect of this training an urgent research priority with potential to improve walking and balance in people with Parkinson's disease as well as provide insights into mechanisms underlying effects.</summary>
