  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group (Lipopolysaccharide adsorption group) will receive Alteco Lipopolysaccharide adsorber in addition to standard medical therapy.   Patient will have hemodialysis catheter insertion over femoral vein or internal jugular vein for blood access.  Hemoperfusion (a technique involves passing large volumes of blood over an adsorbent substance) using Alteco Lipopolysaccharide adsorber at blood flow rate of 120-150ml/h will be conducted as soon as possible after randomization.  Each patient will have two 2-hourly sessions of Lipopolysaccharide adsorption 24hrs apart.  In between, renal replacement therapy will be provided if clinically indicated based on usual practice</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will have standard medical therapy for septic shock namely: control of septic sources, antibiotic, fluid challenge, vasopressor and stress dose steroid.  Renal replacement therapy will be provided as indicated.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Severe sepsis / septic shock are common in ICU setting which carry very high mortality (30-50%) despite optimal treatment.  Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), one of the principle components on the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria, is considered relevant to their pathogenesis.  Sorbent can effectively bind endotoxin and potentially interrupt the biological cascade of sepsis.  Based on published data, LPS adsorption could improve blood pressure, oxygenation and mortality (absolute risk reduction 21%).  
This study aimed to investigate the mortality/ morbidity benefit of Alteco LPS adsorber, one of the LPS adsorption devices currently available in market, in patient with septic shock due to intra-abdominal sepsis.</summary>
