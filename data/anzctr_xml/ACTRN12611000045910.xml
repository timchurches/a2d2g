  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Incremental effort test conducted on treadmill to determine the intensity considered level 13 of Borg's perceived effort scale by each  volunteer. This test was undertaken 48h before the continuous aerobic exercise.
2. Performing of 30min of continuous aerobic exercise running on treadmill at level 13 of Borg's scale. 
3. Recording of heart beats  after exercise for heart rate variability analysis</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group was accompanied by us in another study conducted during one year, so we already knew these volunteers. In this present study the data also were collected during one year. The volunteers of this group were non-obese and sedentary pre-adolescents.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed by Polar S810 and analyzed by the software Polar Precision Performance. The data were analyzed by time and frequency domain. The frequency domain was obtained with the use Fast Fourier Transformed (FFT). 
All data were submitted to a filter (very strong) to avoid the artefacts and were obtained in stable conditions (rest and continuous dynamic exercise).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The heart beats were recorded for HRV analysis during the 10 to 20min following 30 minutes of aerobic exercise.</timepoint>
