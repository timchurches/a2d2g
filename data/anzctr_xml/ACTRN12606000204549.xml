  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study tests an expressive writing intervention.  Expressive writing is the writing of deep thoughts and feelings about a cancer diagnosis and treatment.  Participants engage in 4 writing sessions of 30 minutes duration each, spaced one week apart.  Participants are allocated to one of two groups: Intervention group or Waitlist control group.                                                       The Intervention group participates in the intervention up to 4 weeks post their final cancer treatment session.                                                                                                                        The intervention is carried out individually by participants in their own homes, with phone assistance from a research assistant.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will test an expressive writing intervention with bowel cancer patients to determine whether participation in the intervention leads to improved physical functioning, lessened psychological distress and increased personal growth, compared to those who do not participate in the intervention. Expressive writing is the writing of deep thoughts and feelings connected to a person's cancer diagnosis and treatment experiences. Participants in the intervention group will write in a journal for 30 minutes, 4 times, over 3 weeks. Participants will fill out questionnaires before and after the intervention as well as 2 months later, to determine whether they experience positive change, and changes over time.</summary>
