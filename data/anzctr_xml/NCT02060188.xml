    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine if Nivolumab by itself, or Nivolumab in combination
      with other anti-cancer drugs, will result in meaningful tumor size reduction, in patients
      with colon cancer that has come back or has spread, and who have a specific biomarker in
      their tumors.</summary>
