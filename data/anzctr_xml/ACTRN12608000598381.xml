  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to evaluate the potential for supplementation with long-chain omega-3 fatty acids to relieve depressive symptoms and improve health status in cardiac patients suffering from depression. The study will explore potential mechanisms mediating these benefits, with a particular focus on the role of serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms and changes in cerebral blood flow. It is anticipated that depressive symptoms will be greatest in people who have reduced cerebral blood flow and a particular form of serotonin transporter gene.  However, it is expected that omega-3 supplementation will increase serotonin receptor expression and cerebral blood flow, thereby improving depressive symptoms, but that these improvements will be less in people who carry the 5HTT-S gene. It is also expected that omega-3 supplementation will improve peripheral blood vessel function, which will be associated with improvements in depressive symptoms and angina scores.</summary>
