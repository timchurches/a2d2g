  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle Na+,K+ ATPase transport protein content. Measured using radioactive labelled ouabain binding site content for total functional Na+,K+ ATPase content, and western blotting for indivividual isoform content.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately before the commencement of ACL reconstructive surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle function (strength and balance). Isometric strength measured using a portable force transducer strapped to a chair at 90 degree knee flexion.

Balance will be assessed using a force platform which can calculate the average velocity of the participant's centre of pressure. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 1-2 weeks before ACL reconstructive surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF alpha). This will be assessed using a Multiplex suspension array system (Bio-Rad). </outcome>

    <concealment>No randomization or blinding of participants as those with ACL injury are undergoing a process to obtain a muscle sample in order to characterize biochemical effects on muscle due to ACL injury. Not a treatment intervention.

ACL injured group: Participants are approached by the researcher after they have set a date for ACL reconstructive surgery and asked if they would be interested in voluntary research investigating the muscular effects of ACL injury.

Controls: Asmyptomatic controls recruited from the student population at Victoria University.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Strength, balance, and factors investigated in skeletal muscle will be compared via mixed linear modelling. This allows comparison between injured and uninjured legs, as well as between ACL injury and control participants. Pearson's correlation will be used to test association between strength and balance with muscle biochemical factors such as Na+/K+ ATPase.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Damage to the Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), a ligament vital for the stability of the knee joint, affects the ability to
perform daily activities and physical exercise. The reduced physical activity caused by knee injury can cause changes in
the muscle of the leg, causing decreased muscle strength, size and endurance.

This study proposes to test the effect of ACL injury (knee injury) on muscle on a microscopic or molecular level, and
investigate how such molecular changes in the muscle can affect knee function. A second aim of the study is to investigate the role of inflammation in the knee joint and how it affects leg strength and physical activity levels. This will be achieved by measuring strength, balance, physical activity levels, and muscle samples in patients undergoing ACL reconstructive surgery compared to a matched control group. 

It is hypothesized that after acute ACL trauma, functional changes in quality of life and muscle function of the injured limb will be associated with adverse changes in knee extensor muscle contractility on a biochemical level. </summary>
