  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be eligible for recruitment any time during the ECMO run. Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained as per the protocol when a new antibiotc ,sedative or analgesic drug is commenced or when an existing sedative or analgesic agent is discontinued by the treating clinician.

Sedative and analgesic drugs:
Sedative and analgesic drugs will be administered according to local policies at each ICU. As a guide, intravenous Infusions and boluses of morphine (10-30 mg/hr) and midazolam (10-30 mg/hr) titrated to a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) of -3 to -4 and a bispectral index (BIS) of 40-45. Patient ventilator interactions may also be used as a guide to titrate sedation especially in patients on venovenous ECMO. Therapeutic paralysis is at the discretion of the treating clinician and will be guided by neuromuscular monitoring.

Additional intravenous sedation if required may be provided with one of the following agents:

1. Propofol (10-200 mg/hr) 
2. Dexmeditomedine (1 mcg/kg bolus and 0.1 -1.5 mcg/kg/min) 
3. Fentanyl (50-300 mcg/hour) if morphine is discontinued for clinical reasons.
4. Thiopentone ( 100-200 mg/hour)*

* Note- Thiopentone is uncommonly used as an ultimate rescue sedative in some patients on ECMO

Antibiotics:
Antibiotic drug selection and dosing will be at the discretion of the clinician, based on the clinical context and unit guidelines. Doses will be reconstituted in 10 ml of diluent and given as bolus infusion in 50 ml over 30 minutes (except ciprofloxacin and vancomycin  1-2 hour infusion), or as per local hospital protocols. 


Sample collection
Blood samples will be drawn from an existing arterial line and collected in 2 ml tubes with Lithium Heparin anticoagulant. It is recommended that a closed loop Venous Arterial blood Management Protection system (VAMP, Edward Life sciences, Canada Inc) be used to minimise blood loss during sampling. Minimum sample volume is 2 mls per time point. Another 0.5 mls of blood will be drawn for each additional drug studied. It is unlikely for a patient to be receiving more than 4 study drugs at a given time during PK sampling. Labels and collection tubes will be provided.

Sedatives and analgesics:

General PK sampling

Blood samples will be taken from an existing arterial line at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360 minutes on commencement or cessation of a new sedative drug infusion. Details of drugs, doses and rates of administration to be documented on the data sheet.


Antibiotics:

All patients will be sampled over a single dosing period during ECMO treatment. Where two or more antibiotics of interest are prescribed for one patient, collect data on timing of administration for both drugs accurately and sample according to the antibiotic with the longer dosing interval. For example vancomycin 1g q12h and piperacillin 4.5g q6h; sample according to the vancomycin 12-hourly dosing schedule.
	
1. Six-hourly dosing schedule  Blood will be sampled from an existing arterial line at the following time points 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 360 minutes. 

2. Eight or 12-hourly dosing schedule  Blood samples will be collected from an existing arterial line at the following time points 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 480 minutes. 


Urine specimens:

Creatinine clearance for patients not receiving renal replacement therapy: An 8- hour urinary creatinine clearance collection will be obtained and assayed by the local pathology service to determine glomerular filtration rate. For patients receiving RRT the type and dose of the treatment will be documented on the data sheet.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Develop population PK models for antibiotic, sedative, analgesic and drugs and their relevant metabolites in critically ill patients receiving ECMO.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following data anaylsis and interpretation- We have the power to detect relatively small changes within our small sample sizes because of the multiple observations per circuit/subject. Data from these studies will be analysed using non-linear mixed-effects models. This allows the estimation of typical population PK parameters and their inter- and intra-individual variability, plus the estimation of residual variability. We will fit random intercepts and slopes to allow for between patient differences in average responses and changes over time. Differential equations will be used to describe the population PK of study drugs and their metabolites expressed as PK parameters.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Develop guidelines to optimise the dosing of sedative, analgesic and antibiotic drugs during ECMO.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following data anaylsis and interpretation- The algorithms generated from PK analysis will form the basis for development of dosing guidelines that can be evaluated in later clinical studies. This knowledge is vitally important for optimising dosing schedules to maximise the opportunity for therapeutic success and minimise the risk for therapeutic failure. This will enable the clinicians to administer the " right dose of the right drug, at the right time during ECMO"</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improving sedation practices during ECMO</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following data anaylsis and interpretation-- The study will examine the uility of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and bispectral index (BIS) in guiding sedtive and alagesic prescription during ECMO. This may inform the clinicians about the appropriate level of sedation in the complex group of patients.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Developement of ECMO specific sedation protocols</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following data anaylsis and interpretation-Using the right sedative agent at an appropriate dose may minimise ICU morbidity related to risk of infections, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay, inotrope and vasopressor requirement, drug withdrawal, post traumatic stress etc. This not only has resource implications but significantly affects patient outcomes. Pharmacokinetic modelling of sedative and analgesic agents will identify drugs and thier doses that are most suitable for sedation during ECMO. This study will also examine the uitility of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring and clinical sedation scores  to objectively titrate sedation and analgesia during ECMO. This information will then be used to deveop ECMO specific sedation protocols.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Critically ill patients may be temporarily placed on extracorporeal memebrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines to allow the heart and lungs to rest while the disease is treated with drugs. ECMO, together with severe illness, affects the way drugs work. This research aims to understand the combined effects of the ECMO circuit and severe illness on drug treatment. The results will allow us to develop guidelines to assist doctors in administering the right dose of the right drug at the right time to patients on ECMO.</summary>
