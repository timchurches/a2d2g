  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention duration: 14 months. The staff in the intervention wards is supported by the mentor nurse and consulting geriatrician to find the underlying multiple interacting causes of each residents behaviour, and to provide individually tailored, comprehensive and multi-component intervention. The intervention is tailored on basis on care wards. Mentor nurse and geriatrician are available on daily basis but actual freqencies and times are based on needs of wards. Mentoring takes place on a one to one basis and in group meetings. Tailoring is the very important principle of intervention</interventions>
    <comparator>Two training sessions ( two afternoons, 4 hr each) with a neurology and a gerontologist nurse (not with the mentor) about BPSD are arranged to the staff in control wards. There were lectures regarding to diseases causing dementia and medical and nursing care of dementia</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Alleviation of BPSD among the residents with BPSD. The study nurse collects data with different methods at baseline, 6 months and 14 months by interviewing each resident's primary nurse. Method for BPSD is Neuropsychiatric Interventory- nursing home version (NPI-NH)</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 months (the end of the study period)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence and severity of BPSD in the study wards. Data of BPSD with NPI-NH are collected by the study at baseline and 14 months from all the residents in each ward.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 months (the end of the study period)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Use of medication
The study nurse collects the lists of medication of each reidents at baseline, 6 and 14 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 months (the end of the study period)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Well-being of residents with dementia is assessed by two proxy methods. Quality of Life in Late Stage Dementia (QUALID) is collected by the study nurse at baseline, 6 and 14 months. Furthermore, Quality of Life in Dementia Observation tool (ELO-D) is used by two trained ELO-D users during eight hours (10 am-6 pm) in one day, at baseline and 14 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 months (the end of the study period)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to determine if  a multicomponent support program coordinated by a mentor nurse is efficient in alleviating BPSD. The hypothesis is (1) that there are various kinds of triggering factors for BPSD and treatment solututions may be found by supporting personnel systematically and multiprofessionally to understand those triggering factors and (2) that care provided in these grounds alleviates BPSD</summary>
