      <outcome>Efficacy
25% reduction in total measured blood volume loss. Blood loss is currently measured by means of collection via suction catheter to collection bags and weighing of swabs. Estimation/ measurement of amniotic fluid noted. For study we aim for the process to be as accurate as possible. We plan to use obstetric specific bags for blood loss during delivery/ collection via suction collection/ weighing of swabs . To compare volume blood loss measured we will correlate volume loss by calculating starting haemoglobin, to post bleed haemoglobin and include fluid and blood and products administered. </outcome>

    <concealment>Postpartum haemorrhage is an unanticipated sudden complication of delivery and approaching women for informed consent for the first time when they develop PPH is unlikely to offer sufficient time to fully discuss the implications of the proposed intervention. We plan to provide written information sheets to women in the third trimester of pregnancy who are planning to deliver in the study sites when they attend routine antenatal visits. Woman booked with hospital LMC and private obstetricians and independent midwives will receive study information and will be eligible for enrolment. 
Written consent will be obtained from all women who would be willing to participate either during the third trimester or when the woman presents to the labour ward. 
 We anticipated that the majority of women will indicate consent in advance of labour but will be able to withdraw at any stage. The consent form will be filed in an easily accessibly place, in the front of the participantsâ€™ hospital antenatal notes. This method ensures that women will be given the necessary information and can therefore provide informed consent with full mental capacity prior to the Intervention development of a PPH. In case of PPH and after eligibility is confirmed, women will be allocated to either standard of care and placebo or treatment arm: 4mg of fibrinogen and standard of care. Allocation concealed by sealed opaque envelopes. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Severe bleeding after delivery is a worldwide cause of mothers dying during childbirth. We can identify some of those woman at risk but in most cases there is no indication that a woman may bleed. We suspect in those cases the severe bleeding that develop is due to a low level of a clotting factor called Fibrinogen in their blood. Studies have demonstrated that there is a link between low level of fibrinogen (that helps blood clot) and those woman that have severe bleeding after delivery. We hope that to correct the level of fibrinogen will prevent severe bleeding. </summary>
