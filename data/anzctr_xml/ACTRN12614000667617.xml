6 Subungual melanoma
7 Patient has already undergone a local flap reconstruction of the defect after excision of the primary and determination of an accurate excision margin is impossible.
8 History of previous or concurrent (i.e., second primary) invasive melanoma.
9 Melanoma located distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint, on the tip of the nose, the eyelids or on the ear, mucous membranes or internal viscera.
10 Physical, clinical, radiographic or pathologic evidence of satellite, in-transit, regional, or distant metastatic melanoma.
11 Patient has undergone surgery on a separate occasion to clear the lymph nodes of the probable draining lymphatic field, including sentinel lymph node biopsy, of the index melanoma.
12 Any additional solid tumour or hematologic malignancy during the past 5 years except T1 skin lesions of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or uterine/cervical cancer.
13 Melanoma-related operative procedures not corresponding to criteria described in the protocol.
14 Planned adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary melanoma site after Wide Local Excision is not permitted as part of the protocol and any patients given this treatment would be excluded from the study. 
15 History of organ transplantation. 
16 Oral or parenteral immunosuppressive agents (not topical or inhaled steroids) at any time during study participation or within 6 months prior to enrolment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine whether there is a difference in local recurrence rates and melanoma survival rates for patients treated with either a 1cm excision margin or 2cm margin for both intermediate &amp; high risk melanomas.  

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with a primary invasive cutaneous melanoma greater than 1mm in thickness. 

Study details: 
Whilst patients with a primary invasive melanoma are generally recommended to undergo excision of the primary lesion with a wide margin, there is evidence that less radical margins of excision may be just as safe. Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will undergo surgery with the 2cm excision margin, whilst participants in the other group will undergo surgery with a 1cm excision margin. 

Participants will be monitored for up to 120 months, in order to determine melanoma recurrence, survival rates and quality of life, and additionally, adverse events and health resource usage.</summary>
