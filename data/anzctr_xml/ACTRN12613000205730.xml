FLT is administerd for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for staging of mucosal head and neck cancer. We aim to compare FLT-PET staging with F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET which is the current best non-surgical staging modality. 
FLT is preferentially taken up by cells that undergo rapid proliferation. FDG is the standard tracer and is taken up by cells that utilise glucose. Cancer cells are rapidly dividing cells.
FLT is given via an injection, 60 minutes later the scan is commenced. A total of 2 FLT PET scans are performed. 1 at baseline, the other at radiotherapy week 3. 
Patients will be observed for a total of 5 years.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is an observational study investigating the use of new tracer for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This tracer is preferentially taken up by cells that undergo rapid proliferation. The study has two aims: to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger trial, and to assess the sensitivity and specificity of FLT PET. The target patient population is those with locoregionally advanced mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma undergoing definitive chemoradiation.  You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 and over, and have a previously untreated biopsy proven mucosal head and neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx - Stage III or IV (TNM staging). You must be suitable for definitive radiotherapy + concurrent systemic treatment. Further details on the inclusion criteria for this study can be found in the relevant section on this form. Trial details All participants in this trial will undergo their standard cancer treatment, but with the addition of 2 18Fluoro-L-Thymidine and Positron Emission Tomography (FLT-PET) scans at baseline and at week 3 of radiotherapy.  This will involve injection of FLT (study tracer) with scan commencing 60 minutes later. </summary>
