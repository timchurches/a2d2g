    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK2110183
Treatment: drugs - Bortezomib
Treatment: drugs - Dexamethasone

Experimental: Part 1-Dose Escalation - GSK2110183 is administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone until MTD is met.

Experimental: Part 2- Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamics Cohort - Once the MTD(s) has been determined, up to 9 subjects of the total enrolled in Part 2 will be entered in the Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Cohort. Subjects will be enrolled in this cohort to explore whether exposure to GSK2110183 at dose identified in Part 1 is similar when GSK2110183 is administered alone or in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. The same relationship will be explored for bortezomib and dexamethasone when the two drugs are give alone or in combination with GSK2110183.

Experimental: Part 2- Safety/Clinical Activity Cohort - Enrolment into the safety/clinical activity cohort in Part 2 will begin prior to enrollment in the PK/PD cohort. Subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who are either bortezomib sensitive or naive after failing one line of prior systemic therapy will be enrolled in the Safety/Clinical Activity cohort. "Bortezomib sensitive" is defined as having a response (PR or better) to the last bortezomib-containing therapy lasting at least 60 days beyond the end of therapy. A minimum of 15 subjects and a total of 40 subjects will be enrolled. This expansion cohort will further characterize the safety and clinical activity profile of GSK2110183 to inform the future development of this combination regimen.


Treatment: drugs: GSK2110183
The oral, once daily dose of GSK2110183 will be dependent on the cohort to which a subject is assigned. Subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 will receive 75 mg GSK2110183 once daily. Dose escalation in Schedule A and Schedule B will follow 25 mg increments in a 3+3 dose escalation procedure up to a maximum of 150mg daily or until MTD is reached, whichever comes first, for each schedule. GSK2110183 will continue at daily dosing until treatment discontinuation criteria is met.

Treatment: drugs: Bortezomib
Bortezomib (1.0 mg/m2) will be administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle for cohort 1 for up to 8 cycles. Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) will be administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles. Bortezomib (1.5 mg/m2) will be administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles.

Treatment: drugs: Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone will be given orally at a fixed dose of 20 mg only on days of bortezomib dosing in both Schedule A and Schedule B.

      <outcome>The recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule of GSK2110183, bortezomib and dexamethasone dosed in combination. - Dose and schedule determined using adverse events and changes in safety assessments (laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG parameters). Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) will be defined in Part 1.

             participation provided the following eligibility criteria are met:

             the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
