    <statisticalmethods>We will analyse our three end-points (primary endpoint, sepsis death: secondary endpoints; severe infection episodes and ICU admission due to sepsis) without Bonferroni correction using a survival time method and the proportional hazards assumption (which will be tested). We will adjust for a number of covariates including; diabetes, age at recruitment, malignancy, alcohol intake and smoking or chronic lung disease. This will allow for any imbalance of baseline variables and therefore increase the efficiency of the analysis. We will also perform an unadjusted log-rank test on the final results.


Available data in ICU patients show that there is an effect size on mortality from sepsis of the order of 40 to 80% associated with patients treated with aspirin prior to ICU admission. Using a hazard ratio of 0.63 to examine the sample size required to power our ANTISEPSIS study for the outcome of sepsis-related mortality is a conservative approach. The ASPREE trial will observe approximately 47500 patient years in each of the aspirin and non-aspirin group from Australian and US participants. Overall, the ASPREE study rate of death is estimated as being 17.6 per 1000 participant year. Approximately 4.75 years average follow-up time per participant will be available in an analysis of time to death. If we assume that 20% of the deaths in ASPREE participants will be contributed to by sepsis, this provides an event rate for the primary endpoint of ANTISEPSIS of 3.5 per 1000 participant years. With a minimum of 16,000 Australian ASPREE participants, 4.75 years average follow-up (accounting for expected drop-out), and an event rate of 3.5 per 1000 participant year, we would expect a total of 133 primary endpoint events (deaths) in the control group. With this number of sepsis-related deaths, we would have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.77 for aspirin users vs. non-users. If only 15% of ASPREE deaths are contributed to by sepsis, we would instead expect 100 primary end point events in the control group and still have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.74. Finally, if only 10% of ASPREE deaths are contributed to by sepsis, we would expect 66 ANTISEPSIS primary endpoint events in the control group and have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.68. In all of these scenarios, the ANTISEPSIS study is powered to detect an effect less than that measured in our study of sepsis mortality where the hazard ratio for mortality associated with aspirin administration was 0.63. The two secondary endpoints, admission to hospital for sepsis and admission to ICU for sepsis are more common than death due to sepsis, so they will also be adequately powered by the ASPREE sample.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ANTISEPSIS study will investigate whether the low doses of aspirin being trialled in the randomised controlled ASPREE study work to reduce the severity of infection in the patients who have been taking aspirin. There are numerous pieces of information from test tube and laboratory animal studies that show us that low dose aspirin helps to reduce inflammation which contributes to the disease caused by severe infection. If we can show that low dose aspirin safely reduces the severity of infection in elderly patients we will be able to recommend that it should be taken in all patients who are not at high risk of side effects of this drug.

We hypothesise that severe outcomes relating to sepsis in the elderly may be prevented by daily low-dose aspirin. We have the opportunity to test this hypothesis through a substudy of the ASPirin in Preventing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. ASPREE is a major, Australian/US randomised controlled primary prevention trial of low dose aspirin in the elderly. Our aims are to use the ASPREE randomised controlled trial (RCT) framework and extend data collection relating to sepsis events in its participants to assess our primary endpoint:
reduction of deaths contributed to by sepsis in participants receiving aspirin versus placebo.
We will also conduct an analysis of two secondary endpoints:
reduction of severe infection episodes requiring hospital admissions 
reduction of ICU admissions among patients hospitalised for severe sepsis 
The ASPREE study, which will provide a sufficient sample size to assess our primary outcome, represents an ideal chance to assess the impact of aspirin on outcomes of sepsis in the trial population of elderly participants.
