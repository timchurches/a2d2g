  <interventions>
    <interventions>Affect-regulated walking intervention: 8-week home-based walking intervention using affect-regulation to an intensity to feel 'fairly good' (using the Feeling Scale). The intervention dosage is aiming to achieve Australian physical activity guidelines of 30-60 minutes of walking on 5 or more days each week. Accelerometers will collect objectively measured physical activity levels during week 3, 6 and 8 of the intervention to monitor adherence, and the participants will complete a pen and paper walking diary as an additional adherence measure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual advise walking: 8-week home-based walking intervention. The intervention dosage is aiming to achieve Australian physical activity guidelines of 30-60 minutes of walking on 5 or more days each week. No specific advice or education will be provided regarding exercise intensity regulation. Accelerometers will collect objectively measured physical activity levels during week 3, 6 and 8 of the intervention to monitor adherence, and the participants will complete a pen and paper walking diary as an additional adherence measure.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The individual and community cost of chronic low back pain (CLBP) is staggering. Guidelines recommend physical activity (PA) as a management for CLBP. Adults with CLBP report unique barriers to PA which need to be overcome to facilitate long term PA behaviour change. Walking, regulated by an internal sense of emotion (affect-regulated), may provide an effective approach to increase PA in people with CLBP.  The primary hypothesis is that affect-regulated walking (ARW) will lead to improved disability status and increased PA levels compared with usual advice walking (UAW).</summary>
