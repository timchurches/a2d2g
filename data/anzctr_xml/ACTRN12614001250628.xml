    <summary>A pilot study of maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes, including significant maternal hypoglycaemia and lack of neonatal hypoglycaemia: the main hypothesis is that these will not differ when receiving treatment aimed at achieving very tight blood glucose targets, compared with treatment aimed at achieving tight blood glucose targets</summary>
