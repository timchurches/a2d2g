  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be allocated to one of four intervention groups for 8 weeks:

1: Soft drink
2: Diet soft drink
3: 100% Fruit Juice
4: Low-fat, flavoured milk

The volume of each intervention beverage provided to participants will be matched to each individual participant's habitual intakes of sugary beverages determined by four day diet record</interventions>

    <concealment>Advertising will take place in the local Dunedin community via flyers and word of mouth. Participants who are interested will contact researchers via email or telephone. Participants (in both cases) will be contacted by phone and screened for sugary beverage consumption to meet the study criteria (&gt;500mL/day) and will be explained the study procedures.  Participants, if still interested, will attend a screening visit where anthromopetric measurements, a fasting blood sample and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) will be taken.  Fasting blood will be analysed for fasting plasma insulin and triglycerides and results will be used to generate a McAuley score. Participants who meet eligibility criteria will have a score of &lt;8.01. FFQs will be analysed for sugar content. If daily consumption of sugar from beverage sources is &gt;50g/day (approximately equivalent to 500mL of sugary beverages) participants meet this eligibility criteria.  If participants meet both these criteria and are willing to commit to the study they are enrolled.  Eligible participants were randomly assigned an intervention group via sealed envelopes containing a computer-generated block randomisation sequence stratified by gender (male or female) and McAuley score (&lt;=7.0 or &gt;7.0). Neither participants nor investigators will be blinded to intervention groups as, given the nature of the intervention, it would be practically impossible to do so.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised, parallel-designed, controlled trial.  Participants with risk factors for the metabolic syndrome and high baseline sugary beverage consumption will be allocated to consume one of four beverages for eight weeks matched to their usual consumption by volume.  Metabolic risk factors will be measured at 0, 4, and 8 weeks.</summary>
