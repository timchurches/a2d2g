    <interventions>The aim of this project is to assess the vital sign monitoring app designed by SecuraHeath (Registered Trademark) to see if it can improve the care of patients receiving very myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. 

To do this we will compare the continuous vital sign monitor with the normal four times a day oral thermometer measurement (both measurements taken from the same patient).

The patient wears a patch (which they place on the chest wall) which relays a signal to the smart phone app continuously.  The smart phone app relays the message to a central database.  The central database is configured with limits which alarm when the data is out of a defined range.  The central database can be viewed by the health service.

The app is used to monitor the temperature during the period of neutropenia post chemotherapy (usually days 8-14 of the chemotherapy cycle). </interventions>

    <designfeatures>Feasibility will be tested in the first ten patients and a decision will be made on whether to continue the study for another 10 patients. Use of the device will deemed feasible if eight of ten patients can withstand the sensor during the day, there are no unresolved practical issues related to the patch (e.g. adhesive quality) and the monitor reflects the true body temperature. Patients will be interviewed to assess the acceptability of wearing the sensor device on the body during the day. The validity of the continuous measurements will be assessed by comparing pairs of simultaneously measured values (Securafone and oral thermometer) and calculating the correlation and regression between them.  If in the first ten patients there are no problems identified that prohibit extension of the study, another ten patients will be enrolled (i.e 20 patients in total).</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be collected by the patients, their carer or the Chemo@home nurses on a data collection form developed specifically for the project.  Variables include: Height, weight, gender, age, core body temperature (measured orally), ambient temperature, layers of clothing, full blood counts (when available), disease, chemotherapy regimen and perceived stress.
All temperature measurements will be recorded during the observation period.  Data will be entered into SPSS(Registered Trademark) for analysis. Correlation and regression analysis will be performed to assess the validity of the Securafone measurements relative to corresponding measurements from the oral thermometer (the gold standard in this study).   The effects of age, BMI, gender and any other variable that may affect differences in temperature reading between Securafone and oral thermometer will be determined by linear regression methods. We will also calculate the: (i) positive predictive value (PPV, the probability that Securafone identifies a true febrile episode (temperature greater than or equal 38 degrees c by oral thermometer) in patients recorded as febrile by the Securafone; and (ii) sensitivity (the probability that Securafone identifies a febrile episode in patients with true febrile episodes as identified by oral thermometer).  Sensitivity also provides a measure of the false negative proportion (1  Sensitivity). The sensitivity provides an indication of whether the Securafone is accurate enough to use in measuring temperature, whilst the PPV is the measure that will be useful to clinicians once it has been determined that the sensitivity is sufficiently high enough to use the test in clinical practice.

    <summary>This is a study to determine whether using a remote vital sign monitoring application improves the care in patients being treated with highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy at home.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 years or above and are being treated with highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

Study details
Participants in this study will be using the remote vital sign application device at home for during the time when their white cell count is low (usually day 8-14 of the chemotherapy cycle). The remote vital sign application will be attached to the skin by a patch adhesive and it will monitor vital signs such as body temperature and heart rate. During this time, oral thermometer measurements will also be taken manually and recorded on a data sheet. Information from the device and the manual oral measurements will be collated after the white cell count has recovered, and the patch is removed.
