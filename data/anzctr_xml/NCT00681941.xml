  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 45 hyperphosphatemic CKD patients not on dialysis will be entered into this
      study at approximately 20 sites within Europe and 5-10 in Australia. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed three times a day (TID) is an
      effective treatment for the control of serum phosphorous levels in hyperphosphatemic CKD
      patients not on dialysis. Total length of participation is approximately 14 weeks.</summary>
