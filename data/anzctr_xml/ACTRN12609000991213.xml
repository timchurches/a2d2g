  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Excess fat mass, associated with adolescent obesity, has been related to insulin resistance and inflammatory markers, which increase the risk of health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Exercise is an appropriate intervention for obesity and type 2 diabetes, but research has not investigated the benefits of resistance training for obese adolescents. The purpose of this study is to understand the benefits of resistance training on body composition, biochemical markers, aerobic fitness, and muscular strength in obese adolescents. The project will include a 16-week resistance training exercise program (3 sessions per week) with two testing sessions before and after.  The testing sessions will include a full body scan (to measure body composition), a blood sample (to measure biochemical markers), a VO2Max test (to measure aerobic fitness) and a strength test. This project will build a stronger foundation for more relevant recommendations for exercise in obese adolescents.</summary>
