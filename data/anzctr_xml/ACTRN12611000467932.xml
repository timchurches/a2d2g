  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised, controlled cross-over design trial will be conducted to investigate the acute effects of chlorogenic acid on metabolism of nitrogen oxides,as well as blood pressure and endothelial function.

Each participant will complete 2 visits (one treatment at each visit) one week apart in random order. The two treatments are:
1. No chlorogenic acid
2. Chlorogenic acid
Prior to each visit participants will be asked to consume a standard low flavonoid meal for breakfast.

Participants will then attend the School of Medicine and Pharmacology Research Unit at Royal Perth Hospital where they will be provided with 400 mg chlorogenic acid in 200 ml water.</interventions>

    <concealment>The treatment order for eligible individuals will be randomly assigned using computer generated random numbers. The treatment order allocation will be sealed in numbered envelopes. The envelopes will be used for randomisation by opening an envelope, in consecutive order, as participants are entered in the study. The envelopes will be held by an independent person within the University of Western Australia. The study coordinator will contact the independent person to obtain the next available envelope once an individual is deemed eligible. The envelope will be opened and the code will be recorded.</concealment>
