    <interventions>Treatment: devices - LEVER Acute Study System

Experimental: Acute Testing - Single-arm study - all subjects who meet the I&amp;E criteria, sign the consent form and have inducible VT within the protocol-specified criteria may be tested for VT conversion with the LEVER Acute Study System.


Treatment: devices: LEVER Acute Study System
The LEVER Acute Study System is an acute pacing and shock delivery system intended for investigational use only. The LEVER Acute Study System is intended for acute conversion testing of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia by one of three different VT conversion methods.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects with a history of ventricular tachycardia indicated for ventricular testing
             procedures that may include VT induction, such as VT testing, VT ablation, VT mapping,
             or VT risk stratification testing.

          -  Subjects age 18 or above, or of legal age to give written informed consent specific to
             local laws and requirements

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are suitable to be enrolled in a
             clinical study</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subjects with any comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             exclude them from standard of care VT testing

          -  Subjects with VT that is known to be focal in nature

          -  Subjects whom the investigator believes are not hemodynamically stable enough to
             tolerate testing

          -  Subjects of childbearing age who may be pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent.

          -  Subjects with any implanted device that emits electrical energy where either therapy
             cannot be temporarily disabled, or the subject cannot tolerate temporary disabling of
             therapy.</exclusivecriteria>
