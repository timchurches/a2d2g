  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will comprise of a 7-week targeted cognitive training program, aimed at improving aspects of cognition including attention, set-shifting, and processing speed in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients suffering from freezing of gait (FOG). The program will involve two 2-hour sessions per week where patients will engage in computer-based cognitive training in addition to taking part in group-based discussion. This will be conducted in a specifically designed computer-based cognitive training laboratory, based at the Brain &amp; Mind Research Centre.</interventions>
    <comparator>An active control group will be employed, matched for time investment, computer-based activity and clinician/researcher and social interaction. This group will watch educational videos relating to topics such as nature, geography and science, and answer corresponding questionnaires, in addition to taking part in group-based discussions.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>This study will recruit 100 PD patients with a clinical history of FOG. We aim to recruit participants based on information obtained from medical assessments (including subjective report of symptoms and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24 or greater) as well as self-report measures of freezing (e.g. a positive score on question 3 of the FOG Questionnaire) completed at the PD Research Clinic located at the Brain and Mind Centre.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be approached via telephone based on previous  medical and neuropsychological assessments at the PD Research Clinic to see if they are interested in taking part in the trial. Other participants may approach the clinic based on advertisement of the trial. Participants will then be sent out detailed information regarding the project in addition to consent forms. Participants will be allocated to groups using a blocked randomisation method conducted by a member of the clinical research team who is not in any way involved in the recruitment, assessment or training in the study. After baseline assessments, participants will receive a sealed envelope with a letter informing them about which group they have been allocated to. The envelopes are prepared by a person who is not involved in the assessment or training in the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised at the time of the baseline assessment using a randomly generated number sequence allocated by a blinded researcher not involved in trial recruitment, data gathering, assessments or training. Randomisation will be undertaken using permuted blocks and stratified by cognitive functioning, with strata defined by MOCA scores of 'less than 26' or 'equal or greater than 26'</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will evaluate whether a course of cognitive training can reduce symptoms of FOG in PD.  This study will randomize patients into either a 7-week program of cognitive training or a sham control condition.  Treatment response will be assessed by video recordings of specific walking tasks (TUG), taken before and after training.  In addition, functional brain imaging whilst patients perform a validated virtual reality gait paradigm will be used to determine the brain activation patterns associated with improvements in FOG.

This project will hopefully identify an effective novel treatment for FOG that does not involve pharmacological or surgical intervention.  The use of brain imaging will also allow us to see why patients might have differential responses to therapy.  Identifying the nature of these relationships will hopefully advance our understanding of freezing and lead to new directions for targeting therapy.</summary>
