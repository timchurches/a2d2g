  <interventions>
    <interventions>No intervention- retrospective data analysis of clinical trial data combined from two previously conducted clincial trials employing chemotherapy in patients with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).

Deidentified data will be collated from existing clincial trial databases and analysed using pred-determined statistical testing. This is expected to take approx. 6 months.

The two previous clincial trials are:
1) NHL7- Phase III randomised trial of high-dose CEOP + filgrastim versus standard dose CEOP in patients with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. Not registered. Accrual years- 1994-1999
2) NHL11- A phase-II study of a modified Hyper-CVAD frontline therapy for patients with poor prognosis diffuse large B-cell and peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma - Registered on ANZCTR, ACTRN12605000105640 Accrual years- 2005-2010</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our research has shown that patients with inflammatory symptoms (fevers, sweats and weight loss) and/or elevated inflammatory markers have slower clearance of chemotherapy and experience worse toxicity, as well as worse response and survival.  We recently confirmed that UK based lymphoma patients with inflammatory (also known as B) symptoms experienced worse chemotherapy related leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, however we were not able to explore whether this resulted in more neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, treatment related hospitalisation or deaths, because of gaps in the UK data set.  We plan to evaluate these issues in Australian lymphoma patients by re-evaluating stored de-identified data collected as part of several ALLG national lymphoma trials.  Using the same data, we will also evaluate the prognostic significance of a new inflammatory marker (the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR)) in lymphoma patients. We have shown this marker to be prognostic for survival in mesothelioma and colorectal and lung cancer patients.  To our knowledge, it has not been evaluated in patients with NHL.</summary>
