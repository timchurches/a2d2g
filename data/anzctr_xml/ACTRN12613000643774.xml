    <interventions>Intervention Groups: There will be two intervention groups, maternal dietary oral egg intake of "high egg" 4-6 eggs per week (Group 1, n=40) or "low egg" 1-3 eggs per week (Group 2, n=40) from randomisation between 36-39 weeks gestation until 6 weeks of lactation. The eggs can be prepared by any cooking method and includes egg as an ingredient in foods, for example quiche, egg custard.
Compliance will be assessed by a diary card, phone calls at 2 and 4 weeks of lactation and at an appointment at 6 weeks of lactation.

    <statisticalmethods>The expected rate of detection of egg protein in breast milk in women regularly consuming egg in their diet is at least 46%, compared to a detection rate of 6-7% in women following an egg free diet during lactation. This is based on our previous RCT studies of egg protein content of breast milk. To detect an increase in egg protein content of breast milk from 7% to 46%, absolute increase of 39%, relative increase of 85% (with 90% power, alpha-value 0.025 due to the three group design), we require 32 infants per group. To allow for any residual imbalance between the groups, even after randomisation, and to take into account of potential confounders (maternal age, dietary factors) in the analysis we have inflated our sample size by 20%, as well as a further 5% for loss to follow-up or withdrawal, hence we will recruit a total of 40 women per group into the trial.
Analysis Plan: We will perform between group comparisons for each primary and secondary outcome after the intervention period at 6 weeks of lactation, using Student t-tests or the Mann-Whitney U test if the data do not meet the assumptions for parametric tests and cannot be normalized by using logarithmic transformation. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used for the cytokine trajectory analysis. A significance threshold of 0.05 will be used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With increasing rates of food allergy in countries such as Australia, there is a growing need to understand the role and effects of early food allergen exposure in the development of tolerance to food allergens. Egg allergy is now the most common food allergy in babies in Australia, with almost 1 in 10 babies at 1 year of age in the community now having an egg allergy. Previous recommendations to prevent food allergy through early allergen avoidance of certain foods have failed and now have instead been associated with increased risk of allergy development. With rates of food allergies increasing in our young Australian children, prevention is therefore the key to reduce allergies and the associated burden on the individual, the family and the health care system. In recent studies we have found a significant number of babies to have food allergy reactions the first time they eat a solid food (for example, egg) at 4-6 months of age. This indicates that earlier strategies may be needed in some babies to prevent food allergy. 
To develop tolerance (and not have a food allergy reaction) to a food it is currently thought that regular eating of that food is needed. However the ideal age to eat the food and amount of the food is unknown. Foods proteins are known to pass from the breastfeeding mothers diet into breast milk. Current thinking is that the regular presence of food proteins in breast milk will help babies to develop tolerance and hence prevent allergies to foods.
The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a breastfeeding mothers dietary egg intake on egg levels in breast milk during the first six weeks of breastfeeding. We will recruit women with singleton pregnancies who have a history of allergic disease, and ask the women to eat "high egg" (4-6 eggs per week), "low egg" (1-3 eggs per week) or "egg-free" diet during the first 6 weeks of breastfeeding. Differences in egg levels in breast milk samples will be measured. The study will not interfere in any way with breastfeeding or the mothers or the babys nutrition. 
With expanding the research in this area, recommendations of what women should eat while breastfeeding can be more evidence based, especially with the goal to reduce the current rising problem of food allergy in Australia.
