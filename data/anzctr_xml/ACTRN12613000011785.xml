  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prospective observational non-inferiority study comparing the acute non-invasive ventilation services (NIV) at The Alfred, Royal Melbourne and Boxhill Hospital. All patients received their usual care. Usual care included all medications required to treat an exacerbation of COPD including controlled oxygen, steriods (either inhaled/ oral or Intra venously), current inhaled respiratory medications and antibiotics if required.
Inclusion criteria- Adult patients admitted with  Acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease (AECOPD) by standard criteria (GOLD) complicated by acute respiratory acidosis.
Exclusion criteria-  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients treated with non-invasive ventilation for weaning post mechanical ventilation.
The study duration was 14 months.</interventions>
