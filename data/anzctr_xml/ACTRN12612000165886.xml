  <interventions>
    <interventions>Use of the Mobile Lumbar Traction unit twice a day, for at least 20mins per session, for a total of 14 sessions per week for 6 weeks; in conjunction with standardised physiotherapy treatment protocol. 

The unit is a developmental prototype (provisional patent filed). Briefly, it consists of a upper and lower brace acting as anchors which the participant will wear in standing. Subsequently, the unit has a mechanical wheel crank which the participant will turn to increase the traction force applied on the lumbar region. On initial use, participants will be educated and supervised by the Principal Investigator on the correct use of the device. 

For every participant, X-ray of the lumbar spine (standing lateral view) will be taken to analyse for any observable difference in intervertebral space and interforaminal area. One x-ray would be taken of subjects standing with the device worn. Following this, the device will be switched on for 5 minutes, and a second X-ray will be taken of the lumbar spine.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standardised physiotherapy treatment protocol: once a week for 4 weeks.

Each session of approximately 30-45mins will consist of a review by a qualified physiotherapist and treatment will consists of conventional traction therapy, therapeutic exercise prescription, advice and education as well as any other adjunct therapt such as cryotherapy or electrotherapy as determined under the advice of the qualified physiotherapist.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine the effect of a mobile lumbar traction unit as an adjunct to standard physiotherapy to reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients with low back pain due to spinal stenosis. 
We hypothesize that there will be a difference in pain reduction or an improvement of quality of life in the use of MLT as an adjunct treatment group.</summary>
