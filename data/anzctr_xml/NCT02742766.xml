    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK3008356
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Part 1 - GSK3008356 single dose and multiple doses - Healthy subjects will receive GSK3008356 in morning as single dose or multiple doses of 5 milligrams (mg), 10 mg, 30 mg,45 mg, 75 mg, 90 mg, 125, 180 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg total daily dose or matching placebo in eleven sequential cohorts while receiving a standard fat meal. The initial dosing for the first cohort will be staggered so that 2 subjects will be dosed as sentinel subjects. Provided there are no safety concerns, the remainder of the subjects scheduled for the cohort may be dosed. Eight subjects will be enrolled in each cohort.

Experimental: Part 2 - GSK3008356 14 day repeat dose - Healthy subjects will receive GSK3008356 or matching placebo, as 14 daily doses in the three sequential cohorts. Subjects in cohort 1 will receive their daily dose in morning, while subjects in cohort 2 and cohort 3 will receive their daily dose in evening. In all the three cohorts, Day 1 and day 14 dosing will occur while receiving a standard fat meal in morning. Eight subjects will be enrolled in each cohort.

Experimental: Part 3 - GSK3008356 28 day repeat dose - Obese subjects will receive GSK3008356 or matching placebo, as 28 daily doses in the three parallel cohorts. Cohort 1 will evaluate 1 dose strength of GSK3008356 (or matching placebo) administered as morning doses. Cohorts 2 and 3 will evaluate 2 dose strengths (1 per cohort) of GSK3008356 (or matching placebo) administered in the evening. Ten subjects will be enrolled in each cohort.


Treatment: drugs: GSK3008356
This intervention is available as 0.5, 1, 5, and 25 mg white oral tablet. The formulation will be used to administer dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, 75 mg, 90 mg, 125 mg, 180 mg, 200 mg, and 250 mg total daily dose during the study.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
This intervention is available as white oral tablet. The formulation will be used as a matching placebo for GSK3008356 during the study.

          -  Subjects should refrain from consumption of red wine, Seville oranges, grapefruit or
             grapefruit juice and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit
             juices from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication until after the final
             dose.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 standard drinks. One standard drink is equivalent to 10
             grams of alcohol: 285 milliliter (mL) of beer, 100 mL of wine or 30 mL of 40% alcohol
             by volume distilled spirits.

          -  For Part 1 and Part 2, urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or
             regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior to
             screening.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. For
             potent immunosuppressive agents, subjects with presence of hepatitis B core antibody
             (HBcAb) should also be excluded.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 750 mL within 90 day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind (sponsor unblind),
      three part study. The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety, and
      tolerability of GSK3008356 single dose, 14 daily repeat doses in healthy subjects and 28
      daily repeat doses in obese subjects. The study has three parts. Part 1, will be a single and
      multiple-dose, dose-rising study in healthy subjects. Part 2, will be a 14-day, repeat-dose,
      dose-rising study in healthy subjects, and part 3 will be a 28-day, repeat-dose study in
      obese subjects. For Parts 1 and 2, data from prior doses cohorts will be available prior to
      escalation decisions. Data from Parts 1 and 2 will be available prior to initiation of the
      three parallel cohorts in Part 3. A dose escalation meeting will be held to review these data
      and document the decision to proceed as planned or make any alterations in dosing, if
      indicated. Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 study will have approximately 88, 24 and 30 subjects,
      respectively.</summary>
