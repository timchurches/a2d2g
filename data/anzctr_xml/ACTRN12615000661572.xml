    <statisticalmethods>Relationships between the outcomes will be evaluated using regression analysis. The number of participants required for this study is based on power calculations for the expected changes in nutritional status, muscle mass and functions. Hence, the target sample size is 200, with 15% expected dropout rate.

With 90% power and sample size of 170, the study will be able to detect correlations of 0.25 and above. For multiple linear regression analysis, a ratio of 15:1 for sample size to model degrees of freedom is recommended to ensure stability of the final model. Thus, 170 samples would allow for approximately 11 parameters in the model, allowing for control of baseline variables such as age, gender, cognitive impairment, functioning, co-morbidities and level of care.</statisticalmethods>
