  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.Induction 
Up to eight (8) cycles with 3-week treatment cycles: bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 as a single bolus IV on days 1, 4, 8, 11) and dexamethasone 20 mg PO once daily on the day of bortezomib injection and the day thereafter (days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12) followed by a 10 day break between doses of bortezomib (days 12 through 21). 
2.Consolidation 
Up to three (3) cycles with 5-week treatment cycles bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 as a single bolus IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22) and dexamethasone 20 mg PO once daily on the day of bortezomib injection and the day thereafter (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 21, 22) followed by a 13 day break between doses of bortezomib (days 23 through 35).
3.Maintenance 
Only patients with progressive disease will not be eligible for maintenance therapy.
Patients who achieve a maximum response to bortezomib of one of stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) will receive maintenance therapy. 
Patients with PR or SD will undergo the entire Induction/Consolidation treatment program outlined above and then move onto maintenance. Patients who achieve a CR must receive 2 further cycles of Induction therapy once CR is documented, and then they will move onto maintenance therapy.
Bortezomib 1.3g/m2 as a single dose every 2 weeks with dexamethasone 20 mg PO once daily on the day of bortezomib injection and the day thereafter (day 1,2).  This will continue until disease progression.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Velcade is a new drug, which is being developed for the treatment of patients with a variety of cancers.  In studies to date, it has been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with advanced multiple myeloma whose myeloma has progressed after standard drug treatment.  Approximately one third of them have had a response to treatment, which has lasted for approximately 12 months.  It has been associated with improvement in symptoms from the disease including improvements in blood counts, fewer blood transfusions and in a lessening of bone pain. There is some evidence that more patients respond to Velcade when it is given together with a steroid drug, Dexamethasone, which is commonly used in the treatment of Myeloma, and you may have received in the past.  Only a small number of patients have been treated with Velcade and Dexamethasone from the beginning of therapy. However, many more have had Dexamethasone added later if they have failed to respond to Velcade on its own.
Velcade is approved in the USA and Europe by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with myeloma. However, Velcade is not approved in Australia and therefore its use in this study is considered experimental.
This study has two main aims. The first is to assess whether Dexamethasone can increase the number of patients who respond to Velcade in the controlled setting of a clinical trial.  This study is specifically designed for patients who have received at least one kind of standard treatment in the past and are now in need of further therapy because their disease has relapsed. The second aim of this study is to see whether treating patients with Velcade and Dexamethasone for a longer period of time extends the time that the myeloma is under control. This is known as maintenance treatment.
Approximately 100 patients will participate around Australia.</summary>
