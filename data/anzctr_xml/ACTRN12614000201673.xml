    <statisticalmethods>The predicted rate of post-operative hypocalcaemia in a general population undergoing thyroidectomy is between 25 and 30%. As this study is using a more sensitive definition of hypocalcaemia, we can expect a slightly higher incidence and therefore have used 30% as the expected incidence for our control group. 
Assuming correction of deficiency between 50 and 75nmols/L, and using a conservative numbers based on prior studies we estimate an incidence on the treatment group of around 10%
Using these numbers, the required sample size to reach signifiacance (alpha 0.05 and beta 0.8) is 72 per arm. After allowing for a 10% dropout rate the sample size is 160 in total.
Categorical data will be analysed using a Chi square test and Fishers exact test. Continuous data will be analysed using the Students t-test. Furthermore, the treatment groups will be analysed in subgroups (quartiles) according to pre-treatment vitamin D level. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgical removal of the thyroid gland is a relatively safe procedure, but can be associated with a number of specific complications. The parathyroid glands are close to the thyroid gland and can be affected  by the surgery. These glands help to maintain calcium levels in the blood and damage to these glands from the surgery can result in low blood calcium levels. Low calcium levels can result in tingling, numbness and muscle cramps. The condition is usually treated with Vitamin D and calcium supplements after it occurs and may prolong the length of stay in hospital. 
Vitamin D is a very important vitamin that helps to control bone and calium metabolism in the body. This study wants to see if by giving Vitamin D before the surgery low calcium levels can be prevented.</summary>
