  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be a group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program for anxiety, which has been adapted for use with adults with intellectual disability. The group will run for 6 weeks, with weekly sessions approximately 1.5-2 hours long. Participants will be taught anxiety-management strategies such as cognitive challenging, and will be given home practice tasks to complete between sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be a wait-list control group. Participants in this group will receive the same pre and post measures as the intervention group, but will be placed on a 6-week waiting list while the intervention group receives the treatment. When the intervention group finishes treatment, the wait-list control group will then receive the same treatment. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on the only two other RCTs in the literature that have investigated psychological treatments for people with intellectual disability and mental health problems (i.e. depression; McCabe, McGillivray &amp; Newton, 2006, anger management problems;Taylor, Novaco, Gillmer, Robertson, &amp; Thorne, 2005), 15-20 participants per group is needed to detect a medium to large effect size, and this sample size was confirmed by sample size calculators (http://www.bu.edu/orccommittees/iacuc/policies-and-guidelines/sample-size-calculations/). 
Statistical analysis will be intention-to-treat.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Individuals with intellectual disability experience around twice the rate of mental health difficulties than typically-developing individuals. Anxiety is a common problem, however not only will the majority of people with intellectual disability not receive specialist psychological services, there is a paucity of research on evidence-based treatment approaches for this population. This study will adapt a well-validated psychological treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy; CBT) for use with adults with mild intellectual disability and anxiety. This new treatment program will be evaluated to investigate whether it is effective in treating anxiety in adults with mild intellectual disability. </summary>
