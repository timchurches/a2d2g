  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Signed and dated ethics committee approved study consent form prior to study related
             procedures

          2. Eighteen (18) years of age or older

          3. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class =II heart failure de-spite optimal
             medical therapy

          4. Clinically significant mitral regurgitation (moderate-to-severe or severe mitral
             regurgitation) confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and transthoracic
             echocardiography (TTE).

          5. Patient able to perform a six-minute walk test (6MWT).

          6. The primary regurgitant jet is non-commissural. If a secondary jet exists, it must be
             considered clinically insignificant.

          7. Mitral valve area (MVA) = 4.0 cmÂ² as measured by planimetry. If MVA by planimetry is
             not measurable, pressure half-time measurement is acceptable.

          8. Subject agrees to return for all required post-procedure follow-up visits</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. Patient in whom a TEE is contraindicated or screening TEE is unsuccessful

          2. Leaflet anatomy which may preclude PASCAL device implantation, proper device
             positioning on the leaflets, or sufficient reduction in mitral regurgitation.

          3. Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation

          4. Physical evidence of right sided congestive heart failure and echocardiographic
             evidence of severe right ventricular dysfunction

          5. Untreated significant coronary artery disease / stenosis, evidence of acute coronary
             syndrome, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or stroke within 30 days
             prior to intervention

          6. Any percutaneous cardiovascular intervention, carotid surgery, cardiovascular surgery
             or atrial fibrillation ablation within 90 days prior to intervention

          7. Any prior mitral valve surgery or transcatheter mitral valve procedure

          8. Contraindication to transseptal catheterization

          9. Active endocarditis or active infections requiring current antibiotic therapy or last
             antibiotic treatment was administered within 14 days prior to intervention

         10. Active rheumatic heart disease or rheumatic etiology for MR</exclusivecriteria>
