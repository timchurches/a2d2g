Experimental: DG2 positive relapsed or refractory solid tumors - The initial hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein (FP) dose will be 2 mg/m2 given intravenously over 4 hours, daily for 3 days. Five separate dose levels are scheduled: 2 mg/m²/dose (IV over 4 hours) x 3 days, 4 mg/m²/dose (IV over 4 hours) x 3 days, 6 mg/m²/dose (IV over 4 hours) x 3 days, 8 mg/m²/dose (IV over 4 hours) x 3 days, 10 mg/m²/dose (IV over 4 hours) x 3 days.
