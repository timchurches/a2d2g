  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive a 10-week, twice a week of a whole body dynamic exercise intervention program.The duration of each training session will be 60 minutes. Each class will begin on a chair with a gentle warm up sequence to move the trunk and upper extremities. This is followed by a series of fluid spinal motions which increase range of motion, and prepare the body to explore more complex movements with agility, and ease based on GYROKINESIS  'Registered Trademark' method. The exercise training will be delivered in a group format with a physiotherapist who is also a certified GYROKINESIS trainer. The mode of delivery is face to face and is in a group format. The location will be at local Community Activity Centers. An exercise log will be documented by the exercise physiotherapist. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive home exercise education sheets at the first visit and reviewed at the midterm (6-week) visit. The exercise sheets with general stretching exercises are developed specifically for this study. Participants instructed to exercise at their own discretion. An exercise log was given to participants in the control group to improve fidelity.</comparator>
