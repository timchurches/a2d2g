  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve showing the preoperative patient in the preoperative ward a 3 minute video which provides information about the anesthetic procedure that they will receive.  The video will be shown to the patient around 1 - 2 hours prior to the induction of anesthetic.  The video will incorporate techniques known to illicit an Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR).  The patients' anxiety will be assessed before and after the intervention.

ASMR is an alternative approach to relaxation and is currently very popular.  The technique itself involves incorporating visual and acoustic stimuli delivered via video to elicit a low-grade euphoric response. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control will involve having the patient watch a video providing information about the anesthetic procedure that they will be receiving.  The content of the video will be the same as the intervention video but will be delivered normally without any ASMR elements. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether a video designed to trigger the Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) will have an effect on preoperative anxiety.  Preoperative anxiety is a significant phenomenon that negatively impacts patients that are preparing to undergo a procedure.  

In this study, we will be showing preoperative patients an informational video that tells them about the anesthetic procedure that they will undergo.  This video will either be specially designed to trigger an ASMR, or a normal video with the same information.  ASMR is an alternative approach to relaxation and is currently very popular.  You-Tube channels dedicated to producing ASMR videos have large followings and achieves significant viewership.  Despite its rising popularity in society, only a few studies have been conducted to scientifically evaluate the effects of ASMR.

We will be measuring preoperative anxiety using standardized questionnaires what have been proven to be effective in many other studies.  The questionnaires that we have chosen are the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS).  We will compare the results from the patients that watched the ASMR video with the results from patients that watched a normal video. 

We aim to assess the effects of ASMR on preoperative anxiety and determine if it yields any clinically significant effects.
