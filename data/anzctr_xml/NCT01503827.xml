  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with brain metastases from melanoma are offered different treatment options after
      local treatment of their brain metastases via surgery or stereotactic irradiation. Depending
      on the treating institution and the clinician involved a patient may or may not be offered
      whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after their brain metastases are excised or treated with
      stereotactic irradiation. This trial seeks to determine if WBRT reduces the spread of brain
      metastases and lengthens the time to recurrence. The trial also examines the effect of WBRT
      on quality of life and brain functions such as memory, speech and concentration. Participants
      will be randomised after local treatment of their brain metastases to either WBRT or
      observation. 220 people will be recruited from sites in Australia, Norway, the UK, the US and
      other international sites.</summary>
