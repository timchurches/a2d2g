  <interventions>
    <interventions>Phase 1: Medial Branch nerve block of lumbar zygoapophyseal joints with local anaesthetic
Dose 0.5ml of bupivacaine 0.5% at each nerve block up to a maximum of 6 blocks equals 3ml in total. The number and location of blocks is decided by clinical and radiological correlation of pain area and pathological joints. A maximum of 2 joints bilaterally in the lumbar spine are to be blocked or 3 adjacent levels unilaterally. 
Duration : Single injection over 5 seconds
Mode : Injection with needle under image guidance in operating theatre
 Description of intervention
Participants attend hospital for clinical assessment and attend on a separate occasion for intervention.
Patient information sheet and consent forms are provided to the participants
Participants initially receive medial branch blocks in the lumbar spine by a pain management specialist. This is performed in an operating theatre and their skin is painted with antiseptic (chlorhexidine 2%)  The participants also receive a small dose of radio-opaque dye during the injection (Isovue 300 total 3mls) 

 If adequate pain relief is obtained ( 50% pain relief) they then proceed to Phase 2 after a minimum of 1 week. 
Duration of time between Phase 1 and Phase 2 -  1-4 weeks

Phase 2 
Radio frequency neurotomy of the lumbar zygoapophyseal joints.

Participants have a radio frequency lesion to the medial branch nerves supplying the zygo-apophyeseal  joints that have previously been blocked in phase 1 in hospital by the same medical team. 
Prior to this the participants discuss the procedure with the medical team. 
 Their baseline pain levels are assessed. The participants enter the operating theatre. An intravenous cannula is inserted. Sedation is administered intravenously with fentanyl up to 100 microgrammes and midazolam up to 5 milligrammes. Sterile technique is used and antiseptic (povidone Iodine) is applied to the skin. Local anaesthetic is administered ( lidocaine 1% up to 20mls ) with a small needle (25g) . Under image guidance with X ray a sterile procedure is performed with needles (20g and 10 m long) and a radio frequency generator to heat the nerves supplying sensation to the zygo-apophyseal joints that have been previously blocked in phase 1. (radio frequency neurotomy). Pain relief response to the radio frequency neurotomy is assessed by the research assistant and the nursing staff immediately post procedure and at regular time points after the procedure up to and including 3 months.</interventions>
    <comparator> In phase 1 , 80% participants receive a control injection with placebo (0.9% saline) and.  20 % receive a control injection of bupivacaine 0.5 % to control for expectation responses.
Phase 1: Control Arm - participants receive Medial Branch nerve block of lumbar zygoapophyseal joints with placebo or bupivacaine 0.5%
Dose 0.5ml of saline 0.9% or 0.5 ml of Bupivacaine 0.5% at each nerve block up to a maximum of 6 blocks equals 3ml in total.
This control arm may occur as the first or second injection and the subject will receive the active intervention at the other time point

Duration : Single injection over 5 seconds
Mode : Injection with needle under image guidance in operating theatre

Participants attend hospital for clinical assessment and attend on a separate occasion for intervention.
The duration between the injections is a minimum of 1 week and there is no maximum

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>120 Patients referred with chronic low back pain clinically arising from the facet joints were referred and assessed for suitability for diagnostic medial branch blocks. The patients had 2 blocks performed with either bupivacaine then saline or vice versa or bupivacaine on both occasions in a double blind randomly controlled prospective fashion. Any patient with 50% relief to any block was offered a radio frequency neurotomy and their analgesia and function and distress was measured post procedure for 3 months.</summary>
