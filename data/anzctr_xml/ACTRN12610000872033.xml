  <interventions>
    <interventions>a multi-level complex 'best prospects' intervention will be designed based on a review of the available literature (from all periods) as well as qualitative assessments. The intervention will be designed to redress health system, doctor and patient factors that affect outcomes in rural patients with cancer of the prostate, breast, colorectum or lung. It is expected that the development phase will take approx. 2 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project will consist of two intimately-linked phases over a five-year term: a development phase, which will identify health system, doctor and patient factors that affect outcomes in rural patients with cancer of the prostate, breast, colorectum or lung and assess their potential to be modified by a complex intervention; and an implementation/evaluation phase, in which the best prospects intervention will be rigorously evaluated by an experimental trial.</summary>
