  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Choose Health Program is a cognitive behavioural lifestyle intervention developed for the purpose of this study. Intervention was conducted on an individual basis and delivered by a clinician with a background in psychology. The treatment phase consisted of 12 one-hour face-to-face sessions and one phone call session. The first ten treatment sessions were conducted weekly. The remaining sessions were conducted fortnightly. The focus of each treatment phase session is listed below. 

1	Psycho-education	
2	Eating Behaviour	
3	Physical Activity	
4	Healthy Food Choices 
5	Physical Activity
6	Behaviour Charts and Barriers
7	Recognising Thoughts and Emotions
8	Helpful Thoughts and Emotions	
9	Assertive Communication	
10	Problem Solving and Planning	
11	Staying on Track	
Phonecall - Maintaining Change	
12	Maintenance and Closure	

Both parents and adolescents were required to attend the first six treatment sessions. Adolescents were then given the choice of attending the remaining sessions alone, or with the support of a parent. Participants received written information relating to each session with the opportunity for discussion, questions and practice of the strategies during the session. Participants were asked to record their use of these strategies between sessions. 

The nutritional component of the intervention aimed to promote eating habits consistent with the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. The physical activity component of the intervention aimed to promote physical activity habits consistent with the Australian Physical Activity Guidelines for Children and Young People.

Following the treatment phase families participated in the maintenance phase of intervention. This consisted of two 1-hour maintenance clinic sessions (conducted 3 and 6 months post-treatment) and seven 15-minute maintenance phone call sessions (conducted fortnightly and then monthly).</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-List Control: After receipt of consent and completion of pre-treatment assessments participants randomised to the control group did not receive any intervention until after the 6 month wait-list period. After 6 months they were asked to repeat assessments, and offered the opportunity to recieve treatment. Thus wait-list control data is not available at the 12-month.</comparator>

    <concealment>Information about the trial was circulated throughout the community and participants were asked to call to register their interest. Parents were then contacted by telephone and a brief intake questionnaire was completed to determine eligibility. Eligible families were asked to return the consent form to register for the study. Registered parent and adolescent participants completed an initial interview (the first 34 participants received a standard assessment interview, the remaining 29 participants a motivational interview) at which eligibility was confirmed. Participants then completed baseline assessments (self-report questionnaires, monitoring of eating and activity habits, physical assessments). After completion of all baseline assessments participants were randomly allocated to the treatment or wait-list control condition. Two-thirds of participants were allocated to the treatment condition, one-third to the wait-list condition. The assessor selected two of three numbers to indicate treatment condition allocation. Participants were asked to select a number and this was used to randomly allocate participants to the treatment or wait-list control condition. Allocation was clearly explained to participants. Eligibility assessment and random allocation were conducted by separate members of the research team. The person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>The assessor selected two of three numbers to indicate treatment condition allocation. After completion of all baseline assessments participants were asked to select a number and this was used to randomly allocate participants to the treatment or wait-list control condition.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>All participants completed baseline assessments prior to allocation to the treatment or wait-list control condition. Those allocated to the treatment condition commenced treatment immediately, those allocated to the wait-list control condition were told that they would be contacted in 6 months. All assessments were repeated after 6 months (post-treatment). The wait-list control group were then offered treatment. Those in the treatment group continued on to the maintenance phase of the intervention and repeated assessments at 12 months (post-maintenance). This allows for comparison between the treatment and wait-list control condition at post-treatment, and comparison of baseline, post-treatment and post-maintenance assessments for those receiving treatment.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study explored the efficacy of the Choose Health Program, a cognitive behavioural lifestyle program for overweight and obese adolescents. The program aims to increase participant's knowledge and skills so they are better able to make healthy lifestyle choices. It was delivered by a psychologist and conducted with individual  families with adolescents and their parents attending sessions together. It was predicted that participation in the program would result in improved body composition and cardiovascular fitness, healthier eating and physical activity behaviours, and improved psychosocial wellbeing.</summary>
