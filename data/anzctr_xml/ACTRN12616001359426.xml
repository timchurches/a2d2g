  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria after randomization are divided into two groups. The intervention will be administered by the treating physician. The study group includes patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss, admitted to the hospital. They receive intravenous steroids under tapering dose schedule (8mg Dexamethasone x3 for 3 days, 8mg x2 for 3 days and 8mgx1 for 3 days). They also undergo 15 daily sessions (Monday to Friday) of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a multiplace chamber at 2.2 ATA in the  urban Department of Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine. The sessions start 4 days after the onset of the steroid schedule and each one  includes 2 periods of 40 min of breathing 100% oxygen through an appropriate mask checked for leaks with a 5- minute air break between the two periods.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group includes patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss admitted to the hospital and treated only with intravenous steroids under tapering dose schedule (8mg Dexamethasone x3 for 3 days, 8mg x2 for 3 days and 8mgx1 for 3 days).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will enroll 50 patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The patients wil be randomly grouped into two groups of 25 patients each. The study group will receive intravenous steroids and 15 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen treatment simultaneously. The control group will receive intravenous steroids only. Pure-tone hearing average and specific thresholds will be obtained on determined days after the intervention. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an initial treatment for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss in addition to the standard therapy of systemic steroids.</summary>
