  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Therapist-Administered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy delivered via telemedicine. Arm 2: Self-Administered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy conducted by self-help manual. Therapist-Administered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is administered once-weekly over 8 weeks on an individual 60 minute basis. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy includes psychoeducation, exposure to trauma memories, and cognitive restructuring of themes related to traumatic experiences. The duration of the study for any participant will
conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 8 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Self-Administered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is
administered once-weekly over 8 weeks by participants reading through a manual that suggests completion of a module per week. The therapy includes psychoeducation, exposure to trauma memories, and cognitive restructuring of themes related to traumatic experiences. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 8 months.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The thrust of analyses will be using hierarchical linear models (HLM) to investigate the relative effects of the treatments. Analyses will be conducted using Mplus (version 7.11). The benefit of this approach is that it presumes intent-to-treat analyses as HLM allows the number of observations to vary between participants and effectively handles missing data by using the maximum likelihood estimator, which provides
the optimal estimates of model parameter values and standard errors. The Level 1 model will represent within-patient change over time, and the Level 2 model will predict variation in within-patient change over time and encompass between-patient variables (treatment condition, injury
characteristics, gender). Primary measures will comprise the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. We calculated effect size based on previous recommendations for multilevel models. Statistical power for this design is estimated to be 80%, entering the parameters of 60 per group, effect-size at .7. This effect size was based on a previous data set, which evaluated the relative effects of symptom reduction in comparable therapy modality of PTSD patients.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the study is to evaluate the benefits of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for reducing PTSD in journalists. This study compares the relative effectiveness of (a) Cognitive Behaviour Therapy provided by therapists via telemedicine to journalists compared to the same components which journalists read in manuals provided to them. </summary>
