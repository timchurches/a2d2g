    <interventions>Foot exercises with Archie biofeedback device

Materials:  The Archie is a device that has been developed to assist with practicing foot exercises. Archie device is a small platform with 3 peripheral sensors and a mid foot sensor. Data is sent from the foot sensors to a computer with a visual display of the foot placement  and mid foot movement to provide feedback of the foot activity.

Procedures: Over the course of one day, the Archie device will be tested for intra-rater, test re-test reliability of measuring foot arch movement, The device's output measures will be compared to other measures of foot strength or muscle size to determine its validity.  The feasibility of completing the foot exercise tasks while using the device will be ascertained by survey.

The intervention is a series of four foot exercise tasks: speed of foot arch lift and relax, gradual concentric arch lift, gradual eccentric arch lowering and endurance of arch lift. The participants will be directed to attempt each exercise task three consecutive times over a period of 20 minutes. Participants will repeat the four exercise tasks three times during the course of the three hour lab attendance,with a 40 minute rest between the three testing sessions.

The first survey will be completed after the second practice of the exercise tasks using the sensor component of the device, with the participant blinded to feedback from the screen. The second survey will be completed after the third practice of the exercise tasks with the additional use of the biofeedback screen.

The intervention will be delivered by one of the investigators who has developed the device and the foot tasks, who has research experience of a minimum of 10 years. The mode of delivery will be face to face and will be provided  individually.

    <comparator>Comparators to ascertain the validity of Archie device:
Foot muscle strength determined by maximum toe flexion force in standing measured with a pressure platform
Foot muscle size determined by calculating the scanned cross-sectional area of extensor digitorum brevis, abductor hallucis and flexor hallucis brevis muscles measured with Real-time Ultrasound </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Test re-test reliability of Archie device will be determined by the  Archie device change in pressure, as reported by Archie output on the biofeedback screen</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The validity of the Archie device, will be evaluated by comparing the devices' volumetric pressure  measures with measures of  muscle strength determined by toe flexor force using pedobarography,

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis of data will occur in SPSS version 22. Reliability will be assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (3, 1). Validity will be assessed with Pearsons or Spearmans correlations, depending on data distribution, to evaluate any associations between the devices pressure measures and toe flexion force or muscle size. Feasibility will be explored with descriptive statistics and thematic qualitative analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the reliability, validity and feasibility of using Archie, a foot biofeedback device to determine if mid arch movement and foot exercise practice can be measured and monitored in those with a range of foot types or foot problems associated with weak feet. Various physical measures, questionnaires and surveys will be collected from participants over the course of one day. The results of this study will be used to prepare for future randomised controlled trials on foot exercise for the treatment of a range of foot problems associated with weak feet.</summary>
