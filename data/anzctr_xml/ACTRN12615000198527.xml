  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the effects of instructing overweight/ obese individuals to take a hot or cold bath/shower (whichever is preferred) about 90-minutes prior to the time they wish to go to sleep, to determine whether this is effective in: (a) improving their sleep quality and increasing sleep times, and (b) as a consequence of going to bed earlier and sleeping a longer time, eat substantially less at night and therefore reduce their weight over time, relative to the control group participants. Based on the empirical studies where participants took a hot bath/shower as a modality of passive body heating (Allehe et al. 2013; Cynthia, 1996), the water temperature was 41-42 degrees Celsius. In our study, we will advise the participants who are taking a hot bath/shower to make it as hot as they feel comfortable with, which should be around this water temperature. However, it is important not to give too detailed instructions that are disparate in extent to the participants who instead seek to take a cold bath/show. The participants will also be asked to complete the study questionnaire  prior to being randomized to a study group, then they will participate in their groups activities for 3-months (i.e. reviewing and enacting the sleep hygiene information), and then completing the follow-up questionnaire. Finally, the intervention condition will involve the participants either taking a hot/cold bath or shower every night for 3-months, whichever is preferred), and completing the baseline and follow-up questionnaires.

Several strategies will be used to ensure that the study participants do  adhere to the instructions  they received. First, we will instruct them to complete the diary as accurately as they can and remind them that we are not testing them, but rather the effectiveness of a potential new weight loss program. Third, we will telephone all participants (including the control group participants) after 1-week and 1-month to check on their engagement in their group activities, and to remind them to complete the questionnaire at the end of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>The first control condition is a Normal bedtime protocol group . Participants who are randomised to this group will simply be asked to complete the same questionnaires that are being completed by the other two study groups. The second control condition involves the participants reading an information page about typical sleep hygiene training (i.e. ways in which they might improve their sleep, e.g. reduce caffeine intake after lunch, dont use too much bedding, etc.). This sheet is simply an instruction sheet designed for the study and attached with a daily diary sent to the participants via email after they will be randomised to the allocated group.  Reading the instructions and filling up the diary wont take 10 minutes. They will also be asked to complete the study questionnaire (detailed below) prior to being randomized to a study group, then they will participate in their groups activities for 3-months (i.e. reviewing and enacting the sleep hygiene information), and then completing the follow-up questionnaire. Finally, the intervention condition will involve the participants either taking a hot/cold bath or shower every night for 3-months, whichever is preferred), and completing the baseline and follow-up questionnaires</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>In regards to the justification of the sample size, and based on the small relevant studies of passive body heating on body temperature and sleep, the largest sample had 23 participants in each group, and the smallest subsample had 5 participants. Nonetheless, an a priori power analysis is provided separately for the planned between-groups analyses. In the between-groups analyses (i.e.1 experimental vs 2 control groups), this calculation was based on an estimated effect size of .25 (small to moderate), with alpha set at .05, power set at .9, and using up to 6 predictors, critical F(6,70)=2.23. This calculation indicated that only N=77 participants were required, i.e. about 25 participants in each of the three groups. The between-groups analyses will evaluate whether the intervention condition can facilitate weight loss over 3-months, relative to the study control groups. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, a number of specific between-groups hypotheses will be tested in the randomized controlled trial as detailed below:

H1: Participants in the experimental group will experience improved sleep quality, relative to the study controls, between baseline and follow-up at 3-months;

H2: Participants in the experimental group will lose a greater amount of weight, relative to the study controls, between baseline and follow-up at 3-months;

Further, a number of within-subjects hypotheses will be tested:

H3: 	The relationship between study group (i.e. hot/cold bath vs. study controls) and weight loss between baseline and 3-months follow-up will be mediated by the drop in mean core body temperature and improved sleep quality; and, 

H4:	The relationship between study group and weight loss between baseline and 3-months will be mediated by a reduction in binge- and/or night-time eating, which is due to the longer time spent asleep and less time sitting up at night. That is, participants who do not engage in eating late at night are expected to lose more weight than those who do eat late at night.

In the analyses pertaining to the hypotheses, we will control for all variables that are correlated with the outcome variables (i.e. sleep quality, and BMI), including symptoms of anxiety/ depression and a lack of exercise/physical activity, as well as certain conditions (e.g. hypothyroidism) or treatments (e.g. antidepressants), if appropriate.
