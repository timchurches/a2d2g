  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten-week yoga based program involving weekly 90 minute group classes instructed by a yoga instructor and daily 30 minute home practice which is based on recorded audio instructions.
Intervention includes all of the following modalities:
1) Yoga based exercises involving low intensity, low-weight bearing restorative movements and gentle stretching. Moderate rest periods between rounds and exercises.  Practiced for 30-35 minutes in weekly group classes and 5-8 minutes in daily home practice.
2) Gentle breathing exercises involving breath awareness, diaphragmatic breathing, thoracic breathing, and increasing tidal volume. No breath retentions are performed. Practiced for 10 minutes in weekly group classes and 5 minutes in daily home practice.
3) Guided meditation while supine or sitting in chair. Meditation involves body and breath awareness while the body is kept still. Practiced for 20-30 minutes in weekly group classes and 20 minutes in daily home practice.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants are randomised to participate in either the ten-week yoga based intervention program or no treatment (wait listed) control group.  The control group will be offered the intervention approximately 3 months after the 10 week intervention period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are two previous studies (Lynton, Kligler and Shiflett, 2007; Bastille and Gill-Body, 2004), which suggest yoga-based activity programs may be of benefit for stroke survivors but these studies have had quite small sample sizes and have not involved randomized control procedures, which prevent any firm conclusions. A sub study of the North East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study (NEMESIS) has indicated that interventions which target physical impairment and mood have the potential to improve health-related quality of life in stroke survivors (Sturm et al, 2008).  A yoga-based intervention may be able to provide benefits in terms of functional recovery and mood improvement due to its unique combination of exercise-like movements and meditation practices. Participation in yoga programs may be a cost effective, low side effect risk, option for addressing both physical and emotional disabilities in stroke survivors.</summary>
