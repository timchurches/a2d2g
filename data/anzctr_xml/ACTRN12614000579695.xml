  <interventions>
    <interventions>TinT is a group parenting program held weekly for two hours per week over a period of 6 weeks (total six sessions). Using a structured manual, the program is being delivered by the program authors (Sophie Havighurst, Ann Harley, Christiane Kehoe) and an accredited Tuning in to Teens facilitator Dr Katherine Wilson. Co-leaders are volunteers who are mental health professional and are trained in the Tuning in to Teens program (Havighurst, Harley, Kehoe &amp; Pizarro, 2012). 

The program aims to teach parents skills in responding to their adolescents' emotions, and the techniques used are psycho-education, mindfulness activities, role plays, discussion, dvd's. We aim to target parent functioning (i.e., parent psychological wellbeing, parent emotional competence, parent emotion socialisation) to improve family functioning and youth emotional- and behavioural functioning.</interventions>
