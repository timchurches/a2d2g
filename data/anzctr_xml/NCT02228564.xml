    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)
Treatment: devices - LIFESTREAM covered stent

Experimental: LIFESTREAM - This is a single arm study. All subjects receive percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and implantation of the LIFESTREAM covered stent.


Treatment: surgery: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a procedure that can open up a blocked blood vessel using a small, flexible plastic tube, or catheter, with a "balloon" at the end of it. When the tube is in place, it inflates to open the blood vessel, or artery, so that normal blood flow is restored.

Treatment: devices: LIFESTREAM covered stent

    <inclusivecriteria>CLINICAL INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The subject provides written informed consent using an Informed Consent Form approved
             by the Ethics Committee/ Institutional Review Board for the site.

          -  Subject agrees to comply with the protocol-mandated follow-up procedures and visits.

          -  Subject is a male or non-pregnant female = 21 years old with an expected lifespan
             sufficient to allow for completion of all study procedures.

          -  Subject has intermittent claudication (Rutherford Category 2-3) or ischemic rest pain
             (Rutherford Category 4).

          -  Subject is able and willing to comply with any required medication regimen.

        ANGIOGRAPHIC INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subject has evidence of single, bilateral, or multiple de novo and/or restenotic
             (non-stented) lesion in the native common and/or external iliac artery that is = 50%
             stenosed (including total occlusions).

          -  The target lesion can be successfully crossed with a guide wire and pre-dilated with
             an appropriately sized PTA balloon.

          -  The reference vessel diameter is between 4.5 mm -12.0 mm in diameter.

          -  The target lesion is = 100 mm in combined length (per side).

          -  The subject has angiographic evidence of a patent (&lt; 50% stenosis) profunda and/or
             superficial femoral artery (SFA) in the target limb.

        CLINICAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent or to conform
             to the study protocol follow-up procedures and visits.

          -  The subject is or plans to become pregnant during the study.

          -  The subject is asymptomatic, has mild claudication or critical limb ischemia with
             tissue loss described as Rutherford Category 0, 1, 5 or 6.

          -  The subject has a vascular graft previously implanted in the native iliac vessel.

          -  The subject suffered a hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 3
             months prior to the index procedure.

          -  The subject has a known uncorrectable bleeding diathesis or active coagulopathy.

          -  The subject has a serum creatinine = 2.5 mg/dl or is on dialysis.

          -  The subject has a known allergy or sensitivity to stainless steel (i.e., Nickel),
             ePTFE, or has intolerance to the antiplatelet, anticoagulant or thrombolytic
             medications required per the protocol.

          -  The subject has a known allergy or sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated.

          -  The subject had a prior vascular intervention within 30 days before or planned for
             within 30 days after the index procedure.

          -  The subject has another medical condition, which may cause him/her to be non-compliant
             with the protocol, confound the data interpretation, or is associated with a life
             expectancy insufficient to allow for the completion of study procedures and follow-up.

          -  The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug, biologic, or
             another device study.

        ANGIOGRAPHIC EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude safe insertion of an introducer sheath. The ipsilateral
             common femoral artery should be patent (&lt; 50% stenosis).

          -  The target lesion requires treatment other than angioplasty to facilitate subject
             device delivery.

          -  The subject has severe calcification of the target lesion, preventing inflation of PTA
             balloon.

          -  The target lesion has been previously treated with a stent (bare or covered).

          -  The subject has angiographic evidence of acute thrombus at the target lesion.

          -  The target lesion involves the origin of the internal iliac artery such that
             successful treatment of the lesion would require the subject device to cross/occlude
             the side branch.

          -  The target lesion located in the distal external iliac artery such that successful
             treatment of the lesion would require the subject device to cross/occlude side
             branches or be exposed to compressive forces associated with the close proximity to
             the common femoral artery.

          -  The subject has an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) contiguous to the iliac artery
             target lesion.

          -  The subject has a pre-existing target iliac artery aneurysm or perforation or
             dissection of the target iliac artery prior to the initiation of the treatment for
             this study.</inclusivecriteria>
