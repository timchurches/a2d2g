2 injections separated by at least 24 hours but not more than 72 hours. At least 24 hours but not more than 72 hours after the 2nd injection of the treatment cycle, the investigator will model the plaque (ie, gradual, gentle stretching of the flaccid penis in the direction opposite to the curvature). Treatment may be repeated after 42 days (± 5 days) for up to 4 treatment cycles.

         16. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other significant medical
             condition, which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the safety and
      efficacy of AA4500 0.58 mg in subjects with Peyronie's disease. Approximately 300 (200 AA4500
      and 100 placebo) men will be randomized. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility
      within 21 days before the initial injection of study drug in the first treatment cycle.

      Before dosing, subjects will be stratified by degree of penile curvature (ie, 30º to 60º or
      61º to 90º) and then randomized into two treatment groups to receive in a 2:1 ratio either
      AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo.

      In this study, qualified subjects may receive up to four treatment cycles; each cycle will be
      separated by a period of 42 days (± 5 days). During each treatment cycle, subjects will
      receive two injections of study drug with at least 24 hours but not more than 72 hours
      between injections. After the final injection of each treatment cycle, the investigator or
      qualified designee will model the penile plaque in an attempt to stretch or elongate the
      plaque. If the subject's penile curvature is reduced to &lt; 15 degrees after the first, second,
      or third cycle of injections or if the investigator determines further treatment is not
      clinically indicated (eg, adverse events; allergic reaction), subsequent treatment cycles
      will not be administered.

      Following the maximum of four treatment cycles, each subject will be followed for additional
      safety and efficacy assessments on Days 169 (± 7 days), 232 (± 7 days), 295 (± 7 days), 365
      (± 7 days) (nominal weeks 24, 33, 42 and 52). Subjects randomized to placebo may receive
      open-label AA4500 treatment after completing this study as part of another protocol.</summary>
