  <interventions>
    <interventions>Use of vault drain during vaginal hysterectomy. If the patient was randomised to 'drain' group, a non-suction drain was inserted in the vault at the time of hysterectomy. The drain was removed postoperatively at the discretion of the operating surgeon.
Duration of vault closure with drain: 10-15 minutes</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard vault closure without use of drains. Standard vault closure involves non closure of peritoneum and intermittent sutures to the vagina

Envelopes were double sealed to prevent bias. The randomisation envelope was opened on surgeon’s request at the time of closure of the vaginal vault.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vaginal Hysterectomy (VH) is one of the most commonly performed gynaecological opaerations and is associated with a significant risk of vault hematomas (25%-40%). Hematoma represents the most common peri-operative complication following VH and is significantly associated with febrile morbidity, post-operative haemoglobin drop, need for blood transfusion, re-admission to hospital and length of hospital stay
Prophylactic measures to reduce hematoma formation such as use of vault drainage may help to reduce the post-operative complications and morbidity of VH. The role of drains in abdominal surgery is well recognised and clinicians have been debating if this can be applied to VH. However no formal evaluation of routine drain insertion at VH has ever been performed. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of vault drains in reducing the risk of early post-operative morbidity following VH for benign gynaecological conditions.</summary>
