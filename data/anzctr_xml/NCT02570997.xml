  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort trial. The study
      will be conducted in two phases: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase "Part A", followed by a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase "Part B". In Part A, subjects will receive one dose of
      study drug. In Part B, subjects within a cohort will receive the same dose daily for 14 days.
      In both parts, sequential cohorts will be exposed to increasing doses of CT1812 in order to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</summary>
