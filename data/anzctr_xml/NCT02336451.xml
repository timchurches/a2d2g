  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC according to
             the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. In addition, the NSCLC must harbor
             an ALK rearrangement, as assessed using the FDA approved Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH
             Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) test and scoring algorithm (including positivity
             criteria). If documentation of ALK rearrangement as described above is not locally
             available, a test to confirm ALK rearrangement must be performed by a Novartis
             designated central laboratory. Patients must wait for the central laboratory result of
             the ALK rearrangement status before initiating treatment with ceritinib

          -  At least one extracranial measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. A previously
             irradiated site lesion may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign
             of progression since the irradiation.

          -  Patients may or may not have neurological symptoms but must be able to swallow and
             retain oral medication. Be neurologically stable within at least 1 week prior to the
             first dose of study drug.

          -  Patients may have received prior chemotherapy, crizotinib (other ALK inhibitors are
             not allowed), biologic therapy or other investigational agents. Patients must have
             recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to grade = 1
             (CTCAE v 4.03). Patients with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study.

          -  Patient has life expectancy = 6 weeks.

          -  Patient has a WHO performance status 0-2.

        Patients in Arm 1 to 4 must also meet the following inclusion criteria:

        - Patients must have active brain metastases from NSCLC, confirmed by Gadolinium-enhanced
        MRI without concomitant leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Dose of steroids must be stable for
        5 days before the baseline brain MRI.

        Patients in Arm 5 must also meet the following inclusion criteria:

        - Patients must be diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage />
    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patients who need whole brain radiation to control the brain metastases. Patients will
             not be eligible unless treated brain lesions are progressive or new brain lesions are
             observed since the post whole brain radiation therapy MRI.

          -  Planning of any brain local treatment (including but not limited to surgery,
             stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiation, intrathecal chemotherapy) following
             the administration of the first dose of study drug.

          -  Patient with a concurrent malignancy or history of a malignant disease other than
             NSCLC that has been diagnosed and/or required therapy within the past 3 years.
             Exceptions to this exclusion include the following: completely resected basal cell and
             squamous cell skin cancers, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.

          -  Patient has impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the
             absorption of ceritinib (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting,
             diarrhea, or malabsorption syndrome).

          -  Patient is receiving unstable or increasing doses of corticosteroids.

          -  Patient has other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that in the
             opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated with study participation,
             or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This is a phase II, multi-center, open-label, five-arm study in which the efficacy and safety
      of oral ceritinib treatment will be assessed in patients with NSCLC metastatic to the brain

      ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) test and scoring algorithm (including
      positivity criteria). If documentation of ALK rearrangement as described above is not locally
      available, a test to confirm ALK rearrangement must be performed by a Novartis designated
