  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare ocular symptoms and signs when Lacritec nutraceutical
      formulation (combination of flaxseed oil, borage oil and fish oil omega-3 fatty acids) is
      consumed daily over a 3 month period, with a control capsule that contains polyethylene
      glycol (PEG), oleic acid and propylene glycol, which are found in many pharmaceutical
      products and are generally considered to be biologically inert and safe. There is good
      evidence that the consumption of oily fish has a protective effect against dry eye, and other
      studies have provided evidence of the beneficial effect of supplementation with omega-3
      essential fatty acids in the treatment of dry eye disease. However, there have been limited
      well designed clinical trials investigating the potential for nutraceutical dietary
      supplementation to impact ocular comfort. To date, no controlled, randomised clinical trials
      have been conducted to evaluate the Lacritec nutraceutical formulation, which is an wholly
      Australian owned product. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-masked study to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation
      with a combination of flaxseed oil, borage oil and fish oil omega-3 fatty acids on ocular
      comfort including signs and symptoms of dry eye.</summary>
