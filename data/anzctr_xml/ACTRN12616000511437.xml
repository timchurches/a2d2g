  <interventions>
    <interventions>StrataXRT 'Registered Trademark' is a TGA-approved silicon-based topical preparation, consisting of polydimethylsiloxanes, Siloxanes, and Alkylmethyl Silicones

Patients will be asked to start topical application of their allocated topical preparation on the area of skin being irradiated at the onset of radiotherapy, twice a day until the skin reaction subsides, up to 4 weeks post treatment. The amount of topical preparation dispensed to each patient will be recorded throughout treatment. If moist desquamation occurs, Group one will continue to apply StrataXRT 'Registered Trademark' in addition to Atrauman 'Registered Trademark' dressing and non-sterile combine roll until the wound heals as per standard practice. Patients will be asked to still continue with the allocated topical preparation onto irradiated areas that have no skin breakdown. All participants will be given written instructions on how to apply the allocated treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sorbolene (usual care) is consisted of purified water, cetostearyl alcohol, liquid paraffin, white soft paraffin, caprilic/capric triglyceride, propylene glycol, cetomacrogol 1000, phenoxyethanol, methyl hydroxybenzoate and propyl hydroxybenzoate. 

Patients will be asked to start topical application of their allocated topical preparation on the area of skin being irradiated at the onset of radiotherapy, twice a day or more as needed depending on the occurrence of RD and pain, up to 4 weeks post treatment. Patients will discontinue applying Sorbolene in the area of skin breakdown and Intrasite Gel, Atrauman 'Registered Trademark' and non-sterile combine roll will be applied until the wound heals as per standard practice. Patients will be asked to still continue with the allocated topical preparation onto irradiated area that has no breakdown. All participants are given written instructions on how to apply the allocated treatment.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Intention to treat analyses will be carried out. Patient characteristics between arms will be compared using the chi-square test for discrete variables and the t-test for continuous variables. RDs will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier actuarial plots (time to event) with the log-rank test for significance. Uni-variate regression models will determine the significance of factors to be included in the multivariate Cox regression model. 

To address the economic-related aims of this study, skin-related healthcare resource utilisation will be summarised for both labour and non-labour items. This will include resource utilisation associated with the planned interventions for each group, as well as management of adverse skin reactions. Unit costs will be applied at market rates for the index year of the study. Cost effectiveness estimates will be generated from the perspective of a healthcare provider deciding whether or not to choose StrataXRT 'Registered Trademark' or Sorbolene (current usual care). This will be estimated using an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICER) cost per incident of &gt; Grade 2 RD averted derived from between group differences in costs and incidence rates of &gt; Grade 2 RD during the trial. Due to the potential for uncertainty and non-normal distribution for some data, 95% confidence intervals (for costs and effect estimates) and a 95% confidence ellipse (for incremental cost effectiveness ratio estimates) will be derived from bootstrap resampling (2000 replications of original sample size), and cost effectiveness acceptability curves for varying threshold values of cost effectiveness will also be prepared if relevant. An assessment of the sensitivity of the results obtained to variation in measured resource use, effectiveness, time-horizon, perspective and unit costs will be undertaken where appropriate using one-way or multi-way sensitivity analyses.

Sample size
A sample size of at least 93 in each arm would be required to detect a 20% difference in the CTCAE skin toxicity scores at week 6 using a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Assuming that approximately 5% will be lost to follow-up; an additional 5 in each group will be required so the final sample will require 196 patients (98 per arm). All eligible patients will be approached consecutively. According to the local statistics of RBWH Cancer Care Services, 270 patients receive radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancer over a twelve-month period. Thus, the sample size proposed is achievable over a period of 12 months. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy of StrataXRT in reducing the incidence and rate of onset of radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 or over, and have been diagnosed with a head or neck cancer for which you are receiving radiotherapy (&gt;50Gy) with or without concurrent chemotherapy or biotherapy. 
Study details 
Participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either StrataXRT gel or 10% Glycerine (Sorbolene). The allocated dressing will be applied to the irradiated skin, twice a day until the skin reaction subsides, up to 4 weeks post treatment. Participants will complete a range of questionnaires by interview every week from the start of radiotherapy and four weeks following the completion of radiotherapy, in addition to collecting data on radiation dermatitis symptoms, healthcare costs and side effects. It is hoped that results from this trial will provide information on whether StrataXRT is more safe and effective than Sorbolene for the prevention and treatment of radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.</summary>
