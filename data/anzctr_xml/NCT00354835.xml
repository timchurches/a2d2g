  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying two different combination chemotherapy regimens
      to compare how well they work when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients
      with newly diagnosed rhabdomyosarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine
      sulfate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination
      chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known
      which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective when given together with radiation
      therapy in treating patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.</summary>
