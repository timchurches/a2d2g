  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to either of the two resistance exercise group will be required to attend 12 weeks of twice a week resistance training of particular prescription (i.e. strength or hypertrophy). Session durations will be 70 minutes for strength training, and 30 minutes for hypertrophy training. The strength protocol will consist of five sets of five repetitions of a weight that can only be lifted maximally for five repetitions (i.e., 5 repetition maximum or 5 RM) followed by three minutes of passive recovery period between each set and exercise. The hypertrophy protocol will consist of three sets of ten repetitions at a 10 RM weight followed by one minute of passive recovery between sets and exercises. Sessions will be conducted by an accredited Exercise Physiologist at the Rehabilitation and Conditioning Laboratory at Murdoch University in small group sessions; however, one-on-one sessions will be common. Participants will perform four exercises per session at the respective RM and repetition range. The chosen exercises are bench press, incline leg press, latissimus dorsi pull-down and leg extension. As per participant tolerance, resistance will be increased from 2.5-5% per week over the intervention. Adherence will be monitored through attendance.</interventions>
    <comparator>A control group will run in parallel in which participants will be asked to maintain current lifestyle and exercise habits. Physical activity habits of all groups will be assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire which will account for activity within the last 7 days.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The proposed sample size was calculated at a power of 80% and alpha level of 0.05 based on the magnitude of change (Cohens d = 0.4; f = 0.2) necessary to observe a small to moderate change in cognitive function between conditions. Linear mixed modelling will be used to assess changes in blood biomarkers and cognitive function scores pre- to post- exercise intervention, and for changes between intervention conditions. Significant main effects or interactions will be assessed using a Fishers LSD post hoc analysis. All statistics will be analysed using SPSS (v.22, IBM; USA) with the level of significance set to p=0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Within an ageing population, high-intensity aerobic exercise has been suggested to enhance or maintain cognition; thus, providing evidence that exercise may help reduce the risk of dementia or delay the onset. Research examining the influence of resistance exercise; however, is currently lacking. This study will examine the influence of a 12 week high-intensity resistance training program in a healthy mid-life (40 to 70 years) population on cognitive function following the intervention. Furthermore, this study will examine change in cerebral blood flow and blood biomarkers associated with neural and vascular health to provide evidence for an effective cognition based resistance training program.</summary>
