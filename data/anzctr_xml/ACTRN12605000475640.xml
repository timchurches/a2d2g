  <interventions>
    <interventions>A trained research nurse conducts a functional assessment 
Participant identifies a functional goal (with the assistance of the COPM)
Research nurse designs an individualised home-based physical activity programme based on attaining the functional goal
The intervention will be an adaptation of the Otago Exercise Programme - regular walking, three times weekly, progressive resistance training of lower leg strengthening using weights, and balance retraining using progressive balance exercises â¿¿ with the addition of arm strengthening exercises and tai chi exercises for balance. 
Social contact will be encouraged by involvement of an exercise and walking companion.
The intervention nurse will visit on weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 12 (3 months) to ensure adherence and progression of activity. Participants will be encouraged to maintain the programme independently up to a total of 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group participants will receive social visits based on discussions of current social activities four times over three months to mirror the intervention group visits.</comparator>
