  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individual Cognitive Behaviour Therapy administered by post-graduate students completing their Master of Clinical Psychology supervised by a Clinical Psychologist 1x1.5-2hrs per week for 10 weeks targeting issues common in depression and overweight/obesity (e.g. self-efficacy, withdrawal, body image, eating behaviours) with concurrent semi-structured physical exercise program of 45 minutes 3x per week for 10 weeks administered by trained 4th Year Exercise Science students. Adherence to treatment is monitored via audio/visual recordings for fidelity check to ensure treatment program is followed. Participant adherence will be monitored by therapist/trainer (record of attendance).</interventions>
    <comparator>Individual Cognitive Behaviour Therapy administered by post-graduate students completing their Master of Clinical Psychology under supervision of a Clinical Psychologist 1x1.5-2hrs per week for 10 weeks targeting issues common in depression and overweight/obesity (e.g. self-efficacy, withdrawal, body image, eating behaviours). Treatment As Usual (TAU) approach to Exercise intervention (i.e. 5x 45minute sessions with an exercise physiologist ('trainer') in addition to individual CBT with recommendations for suitable exercise plan and instruction on applicable exercise technique (HIIT/Personal Preference). Three sessions will occur in the first 5 weeks with the other two offered 'as desired' by the participant prior to the end of week 10. Sessions with an exercise physiologist will occur at their and the participants discretion.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study will investigate the efficacy of a tailored 10 week CBT program with minimal exercise intervention vs combined CBT and novel exercise intervention. Depression is a common mental illness, affecting up to 1 in 7 Australians in their lifetime with the third highest burden of all diseases in Australia (i.e. total impact of disease measured by financial cost, mortality, morbidity and other indicators) and the number one cause of non-fatal disablity in Australia. Research has shown that inidividuals who are overweight or obese have higher rates of depression than normal weight peers and that individuals who are depressed are more likely to be overweight or obese than non-depressed peers. The use of exercise has proven to be an effective intervention for depression although a limited number of studies have been performed using a RCT. </summary>
