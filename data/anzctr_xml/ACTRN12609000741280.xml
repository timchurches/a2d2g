  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 8-session self-management intervention will be conducted by an occupational therapist and will include the provision and reinforcement of individualised written information, and activities that are aimed at assisting individuals to learn problem-solving skills, perform functional tasks, and adjust to life post-stroke. 

The 8-session coping skills intervention will be conducted by a clinical psychology trainee and will include cognitive and behavioural exercises to prepare individuals for discharge and to adjust post-discharge (for example, psychoeducation, self-monitoring, graduated activity participation, and cognitive restructuring).

In both groups, the 8 sessions will be of 1 hour duration and will be held once per week over 8 weeks, with the first session being held while the patient is still in hospital</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care: the usual contact that patients would receive from the hospitals treating team members. This would include medical assessment and treatment, nursing care, assessment and/or treatment from allied health staff, discharge planning and any information or education associated with this treatment. The control group will receive no information or intervention from the research team</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a pilot randomised control trial employing a prospective longitudinal design. It aims to evaluate two brief intervention approaches for improving early emotional adjustment to stroke during the discharge and transition to home period by comparing them to a control group. The two interventions are a self-management approach and a cognitive-behavioural coping skills approach.</summary>
