  <interventions>
    <interventions>high flow gas support
(minimum 4 litres/min - maximum 6 litres/min in 25% oxygen)

Dose size determined by level of support needed (ie. all will start on 6 litres/min, then be reduced as needed)

It will be administered continuously via nasal cannula for a maximum of 4 weeks (can be weaned off earlier if no support is necessary).</interventions>
    <comparator>CPAP (no minimum - maximum 5 cm H20 pressure in &lt;= 25% oxygen)

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Infants are eligible to enrol if-
1. They are at least 5 days old
2. They are at least 30 weeks corrected gestation
3. They are less than 32 weeks corrected gestation
4. They are CPAP dependent but not requiring greater than 5cm H2O preessure or greater than 25% oxygen
5. Parental consent is obtained</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Infants are ineligible to enroll if-
1. There is a major congenital malformation present
2. They are suffering severe asphyxia
3. Clinical airway obstruction is present

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Prior to randomisation, researchers will ensure infants are eligible by making sure they are a minimum of 30 weeks corrected gestation, a minimum of 5 days old and obtain parental consent.

After that, dependence to CPAP needs to be determined. If an eligible infant fails the trial-off CPAP, they need to be immediately randomised via the computer system by either a study researcher or attending staff member:</concealment>
    <sequence>Stratified allocation by gestational age and gender. Then randomisation by using a randomisation table created by a computer software.</sequence>
