         12. Subject has any of the following laboratory abnormalities at Screening:

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline
                  phosphatase (ALP) = 2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL

                  significant by the investigator

               -  Direct bilirubin outside the normal range

               -  Any other clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, as determined by the
                  investigator

         13. Subject is lactating, is known to be pregnant, has a positive pregnancy test at
             Screening or Treatment Day, intends to become pregnant, or is nursing.

         15. Subject has a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g., swelling of the mouth and
             throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) that require medical
             intervention.

         16. Subject has donated blood = 56 days prior to Screening and plans to donate blood
             within 5 weeks after study completion.

             determined by the investigator.

         18. Other unspecified reasons that in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor make
             the subject unsuitable for enrollment.</exclusivecriteria>
