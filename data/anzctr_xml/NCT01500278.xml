      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 104 - HAQ-DI was derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question was scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do), and the total HAQ-DI was scored on the scale of 0-3 as well. Change from Baseline was computed as the value at Week 104 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</outcome>
