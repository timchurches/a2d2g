  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Awake fibreoptic intubation is a method to enable intubation in patient with difficult airways.  To ensure safety of the patient, awake fibreoptic intubation may be required. Previous studies have shown that this process can be a cause of anxiety in patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of a video to demonstrate the process will alleviate anxiety in this group of patient. 
The study will be a randomised controlled trial. The control group would have the process explained to them verbally and in the form of a leaflet. The study group will, in addition to verbal and leaflet, be shown a video on the process. A questionnaire will be used prior to the explaination to assess the level of anxiety and the questionnaire will be repeated after the operation twice 
The data collected will be analysed using appropriate statistical method.</summary>
