    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary efficacy analysis population will be the intent to treat (ITT) population, comprising all randomised participants with at least one baseline calculated LDL-C value available and at least one calculated LDL-C value available at one of the planned time points from weeks 1 to 24 (regardless of treatment adherence). The percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24 will be analysed using a mixed effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach to account for missing data. All available post-baseline data at planned time points from week 1 to 24 regardless of status on- or off- treatment will used in the MMRM for the ITT analysis, with the model used to provide least-squares means estimates and comparison between treatment arms of LDL-C reductions at week 24.
Sample size calculation:
A sample size of 200 participants (1:1 randomisation) will have &gt;95% power to detect a difference in mean percentage change in LDL-C of 30% with a 0.05 two-sided significance level, assuming a standard deviation of 25% and all participants having an evaluable primary endpoint. Other factors taken into consideration with regard to the sample size include the assessment of safety of Alirocumab in Aboriginal participants and to evaluate the overall improvement in compliance with global risk factor control in participants receiving frequent SC injections.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies have shown that abnormal amounts of fat (lipids) in the blood are an important cause of heart disease and stroke. Some treatments that lower blood fat level reduce the risk of  heart attacks or other cardiovascular events. One type of cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), has been found to be a bad type of cholesterol. The purpose of this study is to see if we can significantly reduce blood levels of LDL-cholesterol when the medication Alirocumab (study treatment) is injected under the skin once per month.
Participation in this study will last for 24 weeks in total. Once commenced in the study, participants will receive an inactive dose (placebo) for 4 weeks to make sure they dont have any troubles with the small injections. They will then be randomly (like the toss of a coin) assigned to receive active treatment, or continue on the inactive (placebo) therapy. This is important to make sure we can tell how well the study treatment does its job.
