    <summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-354825 will have activity,
      defined by hematologic response, in subjects who have accelerated phase chronic myeloid
      leukemia (CML) who are resistant to or intolerant to imatinib mesylate. The safety of this
      treatment will also be studied.</summary>
