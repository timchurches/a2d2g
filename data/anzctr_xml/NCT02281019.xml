  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)
Treatment: devices - SpyGlass DVS and SpyGlass DS

Indeterminate strictures or undefined filling defects - 

Biliary stone cases - 

Other indications - 


Treatment: surgery: ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)
ERCP procedure will be performed to visualize bile ducts.

Treatment: devices: SpyGlass DVS and SpyGlass DS
Cholangioscopy using SpyGlass DVS or SpyGlass DS will be performed post ERCP for direct viewing of the bile ducts. What is seen during the procedure will determine a course of treatment. Among the options are biopsies taken, stones treated/removed, or a stent placed

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedural success for indeterminate strictures or undefined filling defects - For indeterminate strictures or undefined filling defects cases procedural success is defined as 1) ability to visualize stricture or defect, and 2) ability to provide visual impression of malignancy, and 3) when applicable, ability to obtain SpyBite biopsy adequate for histology</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedural success for biliary stone cases - For biliary stone cases procedural success is defined as 1) ability to visualize the stone(s), and 2) ability to successfully initiate stone fragmentation, and 3) ability to achieve stone clearance in one or more SpyGlass procedures.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedural success for other indications - For other indications procedural success is defined as ability to establish diagnosis and /or complete therapy in the following categories: 1) pre-operative assessment of extent of peri-ampullary and biliary tumors, 2) selective guidewire placement, 3) assessment of unexplained hemobilia, 4) assessment of portal biliopathy, 5) assessment of intraductal biliary ablation therapy, 6) extraction of migrated stents, or 7) other.</outcome>
