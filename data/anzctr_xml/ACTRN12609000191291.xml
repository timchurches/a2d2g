  <interventions>
    <interventions>Foradil Aerolizer (12 micrograms formoterol fumarate dry powder for inhalation) is an inhaled long acting bronchodilator medication that is indicated for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  PT005 is an inhaled long acting bronchodilator.  The design uses ascending doses of PT005 (3, 6 and 12 micrograms) with a  full crossover.   There are 5 single days of treatment with a minimum of 3 days and maximum of 10 days between treatments.  The Foradil Aerolizer is administered as per the instructions for use  with one inhalation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The clinical trial is placebo controlled.  Each subject will receive a single dose of placebo in a random order.  Subjects will not know whether they are receiving placebo or PT005, as the clinical trial is blinded.   The placebo is formulated in the same way as PT005, however it does not contain active drug.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours [AUC(0-12)] from test day baseline across the three doses of inhaled PT005 compared with placebo.  The outcome will be assessed by the evaluation of serial spirometry at pre-defined intervals over 12 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On each of five single dose test days, spirometry assessments will be obtained prior to dosing and then at pre-defined intervals over 12 hours.  This information will be used to calculate the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours [AUC(0-12)].</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to onset of action (&gt;10% improvement in mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from test day baseline).  Change in mean peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) over time from test day baseline.  Change in mean forced vital capacity (FVC) from test day baseline.  Changes in mean peak Inspiratory Capacity (IC).  The outcome will be assessed by the evaluation of spirometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary timepoint: On each of five single dose test days, spirometry assessments will be obtained prior to dosing and then at pre-defined intervals over 12 hours.  This information will be used to calculate the time to onset of action, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced vital capacity (FVC) and inspiratory capacity (IC).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of safety parameters [electrocardiograms (ECG), vital signs, clinical laboratory testing, dry mouth assessments, adverse events (AEs)] between treatments.  Vital signs, dry mouth assessments (if present will be asked if mild, moderate or severe) electrocardiograms (using an electrocardiogram machine) and physical exams will be conducted by a healthcare professional.  Laboratory testing will be evaluated by taking blood samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Electrocardiograms (ECGs) and vital signs will be obtained at baseline prior to study drug administration, and then at specified intervals over 12 hour after study drug administration on all test days.  Laboratory testing will be done at baseline prior to study drug administration and then four hours after study drug administration on all test days.   Dry mouth will be evaluated at baseline prior to study drug administration, and then at specified intervals over 24 hours on all test days.  Adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Non-compartmental analyses will be applied to determine the following pharmacokinetic outcomes: time to maximum concentration (Tmax), maximum concentration (Cmax), elimination coefficient (Ke), half life (T1/2) and area under the curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration [AUC(0-t)] and area under the curve from time 0 to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)]. These parameters will be calculated for the three doses of inhaled PT005 as well as the active comparator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be evaluated on each of the five test days prior to dosing and at specified intervals over 12 hours after study drug administration to calculate the pharmacokinetics outcomes.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Patients will be randomly allocated to a study treatment sequence.  Allocation was concealed by using numbered containers.   After the enrolment (inclusion/exclusion) criteria have been reviewed to confirm eligibility and informed written consent has been obtained from the patient at screening, the Investigator or Study Coordinator will allocate a sequential subject identification number (patient number) to the patient. Subject assignment will be made by selecting the treatment kit with lowest number in the sequence.</concealment>
    <sequence>The study statistician was responsible for preparing the randomization schedule.  A randomization sequence was generated using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e., computerised sequence generation).  The randomization schedule was used to prepare study drug packs for each patient.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the safety and improvement in lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) following administration of inhaled PT005 to inhaled placebo.  The safety and improvement in lung function will also be compared to a known and approved inhaled bronchodilator (Foradil Aerolizer) for the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  The primary hypothesis is that inhaled PT005 will be safe, well tolerated and will demonstrate greater improvement in lung function compared to placebo, and these improvements will be comparable to Foradil Aerolizer.</summary>
