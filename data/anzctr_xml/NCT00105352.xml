    <summary>OBJECTIVE:

      This study is being conducted by the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Study Group, funded by the
      National Institutes of Health, in collaboration with the European C-Peptide Group. The goal
      is to evaluate comparability and reproducibility of measures of beta cell function in type 1
      diabetes comparing the mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) and glucagon stimulation test (GST).
      These two tests will be compared to assess the relationship between the MMTT and IV
      (intravenous) Glucagon stimulated C-peptide responses as measured by time to peak C-peptide
      and AUC (area under the curve) values.

      Based on the understanding that type 1 diabetes results from an immune mediated loss of
      pancreatic beta cells, therapeutic trials and newer measures of beta cell function can be
      evaluated as endpoints for clinical trials. Direct assessment of residual beta cell function
      is an appropriate endpoint, as retention of beta cell function in patients with T1D is known
      to result in improved glycemic control and reduced hypoglycemia, retinopathy and nephropathy.
      Endogenous beta cell function or insulin secretion is best measured by determination of
      C-peptide (which is co-secreted with insulin in a 1:1 molar ratio). Intervention studies over
      the past few decades have usually used measurement of C-peptide. However, the relationship
      between these or other measures of beta cell function has not been well studied. The relative
      advantages of one measure over another in terms of variability, sensitivity and burden to the
      subject is unknown. In addition, the optimal conditions for the conduct of the test need to
      be determined.

      An important goal is to develop an international consensus about the conduct of metabolic
      tests in the context of large, multicenter trials involving type 1 diabetes (T1D) by
      balancing the scientific data with the burden on the subject.</summary>
