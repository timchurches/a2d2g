  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Single Perioperative Antibiotic Dose.  Patients received 1-2 grams of cefazolin intravenously within 30 minutes prior to surgery, based on the participants weight (1 gram for less than 100 kg &amp; 2 grams for greater than 100 kg).

Arm 2: Prolonged Antibiotic Dose.  Patients also received 1-2 grams of cefazolin intravenously within 30 minutes prior to surgery, based on the participants weight (1 gram for less than 100 kg &amp; 2 grams for greater than 100 kg).  After surgery patients received an additional 24 hours of intravenous dosing of cefazolin and then seven days of cephalexin 500 mg by mouth 3-4 times per day as directed.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>From October 2008 to December 2010 all patients presenting to 3 breast surgeons' clinic whose disease necessitated either single or bilateral mastectomy and who elected to have immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Once a potential study participant was identified, a member of the research team approached the patient with regard to inclusion in this study during their pre-surgical consultation with the breast surgeon.  During the consultation, patients were given an informed consent document, and had the study explained to them.  Those patients wishing to participate in the study and meeting inclusion criteria were then stratified to receive either a single dose of antibiotics prior to surgery or seven days of oral antibiotics in addition to the dose given prior to surgery.  

Allocation to study treatment was concealed.  Members of the study team responsible for determining inclusion eligibility were unaware of which group the subject would be allocated.  Individuals enrolling study participants contacted a single study investigator, located off-site, for randomization to a study arm.  This investigator was solely responsible for maintaining the randomization list and assigning patients to study groups and was not involved in subject screening or in subject consenting.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random number table was used to generate random number sequences for each block. Then the numbers were divided into 3 digit numbers and treatment A assigned to the first 5 numbers in the sequence and treatment B assigned to the last 5 numbers in the sequence. Four blocks of random sequences were prepared for each plastic surgeon participating in the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This small study did not reveal a significant difference between single-dose versus long-term antibiotic prophylaxis, although all infections occurred in patients in the single-dose antibiotic group.  Further studies are needed to determine whether the common practice of prolonged antibiotic use after immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders is beneficial.</summary>
