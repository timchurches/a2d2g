  <interventions>
    <interventions>The first supplement to be taken by all participants will be:
Supplement name: BroccoMax Broccoli Seed Extract (Myrosinase activated) . Delayed release.
Manufacturer: Jarrow Formulas 
Sulforaphane glucosinolate content 30mg per tablet (capsule)
1) Single dose (2 capsules)
2) The mode of administration: oral
Following the ingestion of this first supplement, there will be a 2 week 'wash out' period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Once the 2 week 'wash out' period has been completed, the second supplement to be taken by all participants will be:
Supplement name: Broccoli Sprouts Extract

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of the trial is to ascertain the serum level of Sulforaphane following the ingestion of two different preparations of broccoli sprout supplements in healthy adults.

Pharmacokinetic parameters include: Absolute bioavailability (F), absorption rate constant, (Ka), clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (Vd). Bioanalysis and modelling will be used to determine maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and terminal phase half-life (t 1/2).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected from participants for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis: before ingestion of the supplement (5 minutes, or less) and then following ingestion of the supplement, at a 'desired' seven further targeted time points of: 15 (+/-5) minutes, 30 (+/-5) minutes, 60 (+/-5) minutes, 90 (+/-5) minutes, 120 (+/-15) minutes, 240 (+/-15) minutes, 480 (+/-15) minutes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome of the trial is to determine if there is a difference in the serum levels of Sulforaphane between the two different preparations of broccoli sprout supplements in healthy adults. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected from participants for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis: before ingestion of the supplement (5 minutes, or less) and then following ingestion of the supplement, at a 'desired' seven further targeted time points of: 15 (+/-5) minutes, 30 (+/-5) minutes, 60 (+/-5) minutes, 90 (+/-5) minutes, 120 (+/-15) minutes, 240 (+/-15) minutes, 480 (+/-15) minutes.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is an exploratory study to obtain Pk data related to the ingestion of broccoli sprout supplements, the n=6 participants (3 female and 3 male) was chosen based on the data available from previous, similar studies.

Participant demographic data will be assessed for normality. Characteristics of the two groups will be tabulated and compared using the appropriate statistical test (e.g. Chi 2, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney test). Nonparametric data will be expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). A p-value &lt;0.05 (two-tailed) will be regarded as statistically significant. Data will be analysed using the SPSS statistical package (SPSS 24.0, IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA).  

PK data will analysed by nonlinear mixed-effects modelling.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring compound belonging to the isothiocyanate group. It can be obtained naturally through cruciferous vegetables with broccoli sprouts being one of the richest sources. Sulforaphane obtained through ingested broccoli sprouts are activated by myrosinase, a chemical that is released by chewing of the vegetable. Myrosinase is also present in the gut flora of individuals and mediates the conversion of pre足cursor compound to bioavailable Sulforaphane. Previous studies in humans has demonstrated the anti足oxidative, anti足inflammatory effects of Sulforaphane and its ability to protect against endothelial dysfunction and end organ damage. Therefore, we believe Sulforaphane may have a potential clinical utilitity in maternity care as a low risk intervention for the treatment of pre-足eclampsia.
The aim of the research project is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of sulforaphane obtained through the ingestion of two different natural broccoli sprout supplements in a healthy cohort of subjects n=6. 
Participation involves the ingestion of each of the two different supplements with associated PK blood sampling at 8 pre-determined time points, one just prior to ingestion and then following at: 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240 and 480 minutes intervals.
The study is an open-label, crossover design, with a two week wash out period, between taking the first supplement and the second (different) supplement.
