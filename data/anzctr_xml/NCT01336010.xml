  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Peginterferon alfa-2a
Treatment: drugs - Ribavirin

Experimental: Group A - 8 weeks therapy - 8 weeks total of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin if undetectable HCV RNA after 2 weeks of therapy.

Experimental: Group B - 16 weeks therapy - 16 weeks total of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin if undetectable HCV RNA after 4 weeks of therapy.

Experimental: Group C - 24 weeks therapy - 24 weeks total of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin if undetectable HCV RNA after 6 weeks of therapy.

Experimental: Group D - 32 weeks (gt1) or 24 weeks (gt 2/3) - 32 weeks total of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin if undetectable HCV RNA after 8 weeks of therapy (genotype 1) or 24 weeks total of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin if undetectable HCV RNA after 8 weeks of therapy.

Experimental: Group E - 48 weeks (gt 1) or 24 weeks (gt 2/3) - 48 weeks total of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin if undetectable HCV RNA after 12 weeks of therapy (genotype 1) or 24 weeks total of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin if undetectable HCV RNA after 12 weeks of therapy (genotype 2/3).

No Intervention: Untreated Group - Observation only. No treatment for hepatitis C administered. Subjects who have undetectable HCV RNA at baseline, do not wish to commence treatment or are ineligible for treatment.


Treatment: drugs: Peginterferon alfa-2a
PEG-IFN 180 mcg in 0.5 ml (prefilled syringes) administered subcutaneously (SC) once weekly

Treatment: drugs: Ribavirin
Genotype 1: 1000mg or 1200mg p.o. daily in split doses (1000mg for patients weighing &lt;75kg and 1200mg for patients weighing = 75kg) Genotypes 2/3: 800mg daily p.o. daily in split doses for genotype 2 and 3 patients

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the safety and efficacy of response-guided pegylated interferon and ribavirin for the treatment of recent HCV infection. Response-guided means the duration of treatment will be determined by the subject's early response to treatment. - Treatment duration will be determined by time to undetectable HCV RNA. Undetectable at week 2=8 weeks of therapy; Undetectable at week 4=16 weeks of therapy; Undetectable at week 6=24 weeks of therapy; Undetectable at week 8=32 weeks of therapy (24 weeks for genotypes 2/3); Undetectable at week 12=48 weeks of therapy (24 weeks for genotypes 2/3);</outcome>

    <summary>To determine whether response guided treatment with pegylated interferon +/- ribavirin is
      effective for the treatment of recently acquired hepatitis C infection. Response guided
      treatment is when the length of treatment is determined by how quickly you respond to the
      treatment.</summary>
