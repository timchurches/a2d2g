  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preterm infants used to present transitory hipertonia during their first year of life. This trial aims to study its incidence and its correlation to pre-, peri-, and post-natal factors. Study the influence in the motor evolution and check if there is a clinical standard defined that might be used for prognostic, helping to an earlier treatment, when necessary.</summary>
