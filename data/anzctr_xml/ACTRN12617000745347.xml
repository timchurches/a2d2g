  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be participation in interactive computer based activities using the kinect camera and software designed for stroke rehabilitation (JRS wave technology). Participants will view screen based activities and perform tasks that give feedback on arm and body position in space.  Between 3 and 5 upper limb exercises will be performed which are functional upper limb tasks that require shoulder flexion, abduction and adduction with elbow flexion, extension and forearm supination. the dose will be for up to 50 minutes twice per week in a community setting for 8 weeks. Sessions will be supervised by an exercise physiologist 1:1 face to face and attendance recorded. The software records duration and number of activities participated in. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be instructed to go about their normal daily activities and comply with their scheduled treatment plans. The control group participants will only be required to attend the testing sessions (at baseline and after 8 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: The STRoke Interactive Virtual thErapy (STRIVE) intervention provides community-dwelling stroke survivors access to individualised, remotely-supervised progressive exercises via an online platform. This trial aims to determine the clinical efficacy, effects on brain activity and user preferences of the STRIVE intervention in community-dwelling stroke survivors. 
Methods and analysis: In a multi-site, assessor blinded randomised controlled trial with a parallel mixed-methods implementation evaluation, 60 participants from 3 stroke support groups across Victoria and Tasmania will be equally randomised by location to receive 8 weeks of virtual therapy (VT) at a local community centre, or usual care. Participants allocated to VT will perform 3-5 upper-limb exercises (depending on initial impairment severity), whilst participants allocated to usual care will be asked to maintain their daily activities. The primary outcome measure will be upper extremity function and spasticity, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer upper extremity assessment and modified Ashworth scale respectively. Secondary outcome measures include task-related changes in bilateral sensorimotor cortex hemodynamics during hand reaching and wrist extension movements as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy. All measures will be assessed at baseline and immediately post-intervention.
