  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project will investigate the feasibility and efficacy of high intensity exercise (HIE) as compared with moderate intensity exercise (MIE) on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and psychosocial health in colorectal cancer survivors. 

Study Design: 
This study is a three-arm, 12 week randomised controlled trial. 

Participants: 
Men and women who have been previously treated for colorectal cancer will be invited to participate in this randomised clinical trial. 

Intervention Structure:
Following recruitment, participants will complete a familiarisation session, before which they will be provided with further details of the research program and afforded the opportunity to seek clarification for any questions related to the study. At the commencement of this session informed consent will be attained by way of a written consent form, witnessed by the principle investigator. The familiarisation session will conclude with a test of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak test) After familiarisation, participants will complete a baseline testing session to measure all primary and secondary outcomes. Participants will then be randomised  to one of three groups: (1) high intensity exercise - continuous (HIE-C) training group; (2) high intensity exercise - tapered (HIE-T) training group;(3) or a moderate intensity exercise (MIE) training group. 

The HIE-C and MIE groups will train at a frequency of 3 times per week for 8 weeks whereas the HIE-T group will train at a frequency of 3 times per week for the first 4 weeks, and at a frequency of once per week for the later 4 weeks. Participants will undergo testing at baseline (0 weeks), midpoint (4 weeks), endpoint (8 weeks) and follow-up (12 weeks). All exercise testing and training sessions will be supervised by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist (Exercise and Sports Science Australia). Participants will exercise in groups ranging from 1 to 4 depending on the suitability of times for each individual participant. 

Intervention:
The HIE sessions will commence with 10 minutes of warm up at 50-70% of peak heart rate (HRpeak) before commencing 4 x 4 minute bouts of cycling at 85-95% HRpeak. Each 4 minute interval will be interspersed with a 3 minute period of active recovery at 50-70% HRpeak, totalling 38 minutes for the session. Attendance will be measured via a training log, and adherence to the prescribed exercise will be asssessed by continuous heart rate monitoring. </interventions>
    <comparator>MIE has been implemented as a comparator 'usual care group' for this intervention. The MIE training protocol will consist of 50 minutes of cycling at 50-70% HRpeak. The frequency and volume of MIE was established according to current physical activity guidelines recommended for cancer survivors and for adults by the American College of Sports Medicine for adults (150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week). </comparator>

      <outcome>Program safety: Program safety will be assessed by the number and degree of adverse events during the intervention. Adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant subject to the intervention. A severe adverse event is defined as any event requiring hospitalisation or causing an inability to carry out usual activities. Adverse events will be assessed by monitoring and recording during all exercise sessions by the supervising Exercise Physiologist. 

Exercise testing and training can result in mild discomfort, delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) and joint stiffness especially in untrained individuals. However, participants will be informed of the possibility of DOMS, symptoms and procedures to alleviate them. Warm-ups and cool-downs will be incorporated in each testing and training session to reduce muscle soreness and return the individual to their resting level before leaving the testing facility. There is also the very low risk of a muscle strain however this risk will be greatly reduced by careful monitoring of each participant and requiring a warm-up and cool-down period with each exercise session.  </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were performed to determine the number of participants required for this trial at an alpha of 0.05 and power (1  beta) of 0.80. Calculations indicated that to detect a change in IGF-1 of 22.0 ng/ml with a pooled standard deviation (SD) of 25.2 ng/ml from pre-intervention to post-intervention and with an anticipated 20% attrition rate based on previous studies, 23 participants per group should meet the minimum power required to detect a significant difference between pre- and post-training. 

Data will be analysed using the SPSS statistical software package (version 22.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Analyses will include standard descriptive statistics, t tests, correlation, regression and two-way repeated measures ANOVA or the comparable non-parametric test as necessary to examine differences between and within groups, from baseline, week 4, 8 and 12.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overview:
The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of moderate (MIE) as compared with high intensity exercise (HIE) on a number of outcomes related to the health of colorectal cancer survivors. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over, and have finished treatment for colorectal cancer at least one month prior. 

Study details:
Participants, will undertake baseline testing including a fitness test, blood sampling, a body composition scan and questionnaires. Participants will then be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of three exercise programs for 8 weeks. Exercise sessions will last approximately 40-50 minutes and be carried out 1-3 times per week, depending on the program allocated. The exercise will be in the form of stationary cycling. Patient outcomes will then be assessed through further fitness testing, blood sampling, body scan and questionnaires at 4 weeks into the program, at the end of the 8 week program and 4 weeks after the end of the exercise program. This study will be used to inform exercise prescription recommendations to enhance prognosis following colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment.</summary>
