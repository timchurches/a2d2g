  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention (exercise) group will train for 40 minutes, three times a week over a 12-week period. The circuit training program will consist of aerobic exercise (including treadmill walking and cycling), muscle resistance exercise and stretching.  Training will take place at the participants workplace under supervision of a qualified professional during normal work time.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the comparison (control) group will not take part in any supervised work-site based training but will be encouraged to continue their normal leisure activity.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research project is to examine the feasibility of implementing work-site based exercise training as a means of improving physical fitness and 'work-ability in older workers. This pilot project is a necessary first step to demonstrate proof of concept in order for industry to commit funds for a larger trial.  This project will test response to treatment and treatment effect size.</summary>
