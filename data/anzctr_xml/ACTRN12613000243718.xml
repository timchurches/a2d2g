    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients presenting in the emergency department with acute ischemic stroke and are eligible for tPA therapy will be approached by a member of the research team and provided with a PIS/ICF. If consent is obtained, an online randomisation will occur and a treatment arm allocated. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>A block randomisation design will be used with stratifications for the size of baseline infarct core (less than or greater than 25 mL), and for the presence or absence of ICA occlusion.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Multicentre, prospective, randomised open-label blinded endpoint (PROBE) phase III study. 
Patients will be randomised 1:1 to standard dose tPA (0.9 mg/kg) or TNK (0.25 mg/kg). There will be two randomisation strata: first, randomisation will be stratified by the presence or absence of internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) on baseline CT or MR angiography; second, randomisation will be stratified by size of infarct core (above or below 25 mL) on baseline CTP or diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI). Patients with ICAO will be capped at a maximum of 25% of the sample size.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary efficacy analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome will be compared using a two-sided significance test with alpha set at p = 0.05 (unadjusted). 

For the secondary outcomes analysis, the proportions of mRS 0-1 outcomes will be compared between TNK and tPA arms adjusted for age and baseline NIHSS score using a binary logistic regression model. Analysis of the categorical shift in mRS will also be undertaken on the full range (0-6) of the mRS using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel shift test and proportional odds logistic regression subject to the validity of shift analysis model assumptions. Other secondary outcome analyses will be carried out according to standard statistical principles for comparison of parametric or non-parametric distributions as appropriate.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is comparing two clot dissolving medications tenecteplase and alteplase. Tenecteplase is not currently licensed and approved for use in acute stroke care, but has shown very promising results in recent stroke studies. Alteplase is the approved medication for ischaemic stroke. Despite the clear benefits of alteplase at reducing brain damage and disability, we would like to find a medication that has similar clot-dissolving effects with a lower risk of brain bleeding. This would result in an even greater reduction in long-term stroke disability.

The aim of this study is to compare alteplase with tenecteplase for stroke treatment to determine which will help more patients have less disability at 3 months following their stroke. </summary>
