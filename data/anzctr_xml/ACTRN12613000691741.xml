  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise programme, three times per week lasting for 1- 1.5 hours after school for 12 weeks. The moderate intensity exercise sessions will be run by two post-graduate Health Science and Exercise and Sports Science students. The intervention will use the principles of motivational interviewing and involve games and exercise routines designed by the post-graduate students with advice from the Sports and Exercise supervisor and in consultation with students. A healthy snack (e.g. fruit and milk/water) will be offered at each session. The post-graduate students will discuss achieving recommended levels of physical activity in every-day life and setting physical activity goals.
Students randomised to the intervention group will start the programme after baseline assessment, while the control group will start the programme 6 weeks later (waitlist control)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background:
In most parts of the world, non-communicable diseases have become a major epidemic. This is due, in part, to a rapid change in lifestyles leading to reduced physical activity and changing diets. Regular physical activity in adolescents is associated with improvements in numerous physiological and psychological variables. This may include a reduction in the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and obesity to name a few. Obesity is a leading risk factor for Type 2 diabetes and, in youths, is highest amongst Maori and Pacific in comparison to all other ethnic groups in New Zealand(1,2). In Youth 2007, only 11% of secondary school students met the current recommendations of 60 minutes of physical activity daily(3). Almost half of all Pacific young people do not participate in sports. The participation rate is lower among girls, older students, and those from lower socio-economic levels. There is thus a need for a greater focus on increasing participation rates among these groups(4). Additionally, previous studies have also shown that more Pacific students from neighbourhoods with high levels of deprivation had eaten fast food four or more times in the last week (37%) compared to Pacific students from neighbourhoods with low levels of deprivation (14%)(5). A recent Cochrane systematic review found that school-based exercise programmes can increase physical activity, improve VO2max and reduce time watching TV(6). Some studies have found improvements in other measures as well, including body mass index and blood pressure(7). Combining the school-based intervention with a community component has been recommended to improve the effectiveness and including abdominal girth as an extra outcome measure has been suggested by the recent authors of the Cochrane review(6). 
The aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of a group-based exercise program over 12 weeks, test research processes and explore effects on cardio-respiratory fitness (VO2max), insulin resistance, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbAlc), blood pressure, waist circumference, and physical activity levels in less-active Pacific and Maori adolescents at a local decile 1 secondary school.
Methods:
Study design: Pilot randomised controlled trial, with wait-list control group
Setting: Community gym 
Study population: Adolescents attending low decile college who are doing less than two organised exercise or sports sessions per week on a regular basis.
Intervention: 12 week exercise program, three times per week lasting for 1- 1.5 hours. The exercise sessions will be run by two post-graduate Health Science and Exercise and Sports Science students. The intervention will use the principles of motivational interviewing and involves games and exercise routines designed by the post-graduate students with advice from the Sports and Exercise supervisor and in consultation with students. A healthy snack (e.g. fruit and milk/water) will be offered at each session. The post-graduate students will discuss achieving recommended levels of physical activity in every-day life and setting physical activity goals.
Randomisation: Participants will be randomised after informed consent and baseline outcome measures to start the exercise program immediately or in 6 weeks.
Primary outcome measures: (assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks)
1.	Cardio-respiratory fitness (VO2max): as assessed by the 1-mile walk test.
2.	Insulin resistance: calculated according to Homeostatic Model, using fasting blood glucose and insulin levels 2 
Secondary outcomes: (assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks)
1.	Usual physical activity levels: using the short form of the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ)3, (and accelerometer and smart phone on a sub-sample)
2.	Waist circumference
3.	HbA1c
4.	Blood pressure
5.	Fasting lipid profile
Attendance at exercise sessions and any injuries will also be recorded.
