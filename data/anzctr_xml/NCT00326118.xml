  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the primary phase of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a
      single dose of GSK Biologicals' Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal C (Hib-MenC)
      conjugate vaccine when given in the second year of life to subjects primed in infancy with a
      Hib vaccine, but not with a meningococcal serogroup C vaccine, versus commercially available
      Hib and MenC vaccines.

      In the extension phase, at Years 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5, one blood sample is taken at each year to
      follow the antibody persistence up to 5 years after vaccination. No additional vaccine is
      administered during the extension phase. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to
      comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</summary>
