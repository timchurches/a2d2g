    <interventions>Group exercise and education program

Participants in the group exercise and education program are to receive a comprehensive, individualised exercise and education program over 12 weeks. This includes a single 1-hour clinical assessment session followed by an 8 week supervised group exercise program that is both graded and progressed. The group sessions will be conducted once per week and will run for one hour. The program will run at a ratio of between 3 - 8 participants per exercise provider. The program will also include three half-hour one-on-one sessions with the exercise provider to implement and monitor a home exercise program. These sessions will occur at four, eight and 12 weeks. The home exercise program will build upon the exercises conducted within the sessions and facilitate continuation of exercises once the supervised group exercise program has been completed. After completion of the 12-week program, weekly education and/or motivational tips will be sent to participants via phone (short message service; SMS) or email according to the participants preference for another 12-week period.

The exercises / activities implemented as a part of this intervention will focus on four key areas of exercise training identified by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). These are: 

1.	Cardiorespiratory exercises
2.	Resistance exercises 
3.	Flexibility exercises 
4.	Neuromotor exercises

All participants will be directed to meet the American College of Sports Medicines guidelines for cardiorespiratory exercise with specific resistance, flexibility and neuromotor components implemented according to areas of deficit identified in the initial assessment. The progression of the program will conform to the American College of Sports Medicines position statement. 

Clinical Assessment
The clinical assessment session to plan the individualised exercise program will occur within one week of the baseline assessment. The purpose of the assessment session is to enable the exercise provider to determine the appropriate level (quantity and intensity) of exercises and general activity most suitable for the participant. Also, within the assessment session will be time to develop a home exercise program consistent with the ACSM principles. 

Group component
Exercises conducted in the group sessions will focus on increasing strength, endurance and coordination of the trunk musculature. Specific exercises in the program may focus on a single area or include aspects from two or more areas above and will emphasise performance of functional everyday activities. Exercise providers will work with participants to provide an individualised and graded exercise program that reflects the participants physical capacity and the nature of the work, household, social and sporting activities the participant is involved in. All exercises will be conducted using the participants current level of fitness and ability as a starting point, and progress using the position statement on Quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuromotor fitness in apparently healthy adults: guidance for prescribing exercise as a guide. Exercise providers will use their clinical judgement to determine what aspects of exercise (cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility and neuromotor) to concentrate on in the group sessions.

Educational component
The educational component will consist of a number of elements:

1.	A basic understanding of anatomy and kinesiology 
2.	Postural and movement education 
3.	Causes and management of LBP
4.	Benefits of exercise
5.	Motivational ideas

The educational components will be delivered in two ways. The first will be conducted as part of the group classes, integrated with the provision of exercises such that while the participant is learning to perform the exercise they are also learning the theory behind what they are doing and why it is important for them. This will help in retaining the key principles of both the exercise and the education and assist in self-identification of any possible deconditioning that may occur after the exercise program has been completed. A series of education tips have been developed to focus the education points around a different aspect at each exercise session. The second educational component will be conducted from weeks 14 through 26 with the purpose of reinforcing the education received in the classes and maintaining compliance with the exercise program beyond completion of the 12-week program. These messages will be delivered by SMS or email depending on the participants preference.
 
Home exercise prescription
Participants will be given four separate opportunities to develop, discuss and revise their home exercise program in individual (ie one-on-one) consultations with their exercise provider. Compliance with the program will be also checked weekly at the group sessions. The aim of the home exercise program is to progress the participants activity to a level that is consistent with the ACSMs position statement and enable participants to continue exercising at this level beyond the duration of the group exercise program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive one half-hour appointment with the exercise provider where they will be provided with, and discuss, the Guide to Positively Managing Back Pain booklet. Included in this time will be opportunity for the participant to ask any questions they might have about the booklet or its contents. Participants will have the opportunity to contact the exercise provider by phone on one occasion after the end of the session to clarify the information contained in the booklet or ask further questions. In order to maintain the minimalist nature of this intervention exercise providers conducting the intervention are not to volunteer information that goes beyond the scope of the booklet.

The Guide to Positively Managing Back Pain booklet has been developed by BUPA whom have given approval for its use in this study. It is a publicly available resource that includes advice on self-management and prevention of back pain as well as a brief overview of types of exercise. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. Consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes will be used to conceal randomisation.
Allocation will occur immediately following the baseline assessment. At this time, the researcher conducting the baseline assessment will give the envelope containing the allocation to the exercise provider. The researcher will record the participant number, time and place of randomisation and then leave. The exercise provider will open the envelope and record both the randomisation number and treatment group. The exercise provider will organise for the provision of the prescribed intervention, either minimal intervention or group exercise. Participants will be considered to have entered the study at the time that the envelope is given to the exercise provider.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated to treatment group. The randomisation schedule will be generated by an independent investigator using a computer program prior to the commencement of the trial. The randomisation schedule will be developed using permutated blocks. Randomisation will be stratified by the number of previous episodes of low back pain (more than 2 episodes) and for each cohort. (This study includes 3 distinct populations undergoing an identical protocol. These are: working population, defence force or primary care.) Consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes will be used to conceal randomisation.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>TOPS will potentially incorporate 3 separate cohorts. We have funding from NSW WorkCover to enrol 160 workers (TOPS Workers). We have a pending application with NHMRC to enrol 1,022 patients from primary care (TOPS Primary Care) and with Defence Health Foundation to enrol 300 defence service personnel (TOPS Defence). Our plan is to use the same trial protocol for the three cohorts and if full funding is secured report the results as one trial enrolling 1,482 participants.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Each cohort (workers, defence and primary care) has been independently powered to detect a clinically significant result for the primary outcome. Sample size was calculated for the primary outcome using PASS software based on the method of Lakatos by means of a two-sided log rank test with an alpha value of 0.05. For the workers cohort we calculated that a sample size of 80 participants per group will give 80% power to detect a 40% relative reduction in recurrence rates between the treatment group and the control group. For the defence cohort 150 participants per group will provide 80% power to detect a 30% relative reduction between treatment groups and for the primary care cohort 511 participants per group will provide 80% power to detect a 20% relative reduction between groups. Pooling the data from all 1482 participants will provide 80% power to detect a 15% relative reduction between the treatment groups. These calculations are based upon 30% recurrence in 1 year in the control group. We have allowed for 1% loss to follow-up, and 1% treatment non-compliance per month in both groups.

Data will be analysed by a statistician who is blinded to group status. The primary analyses will be by intention-to-treat. For the primary outcome, a P value of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. For the secondary outcomes a P value of &lt;0.01 will be considered significant. We will assess difference in survival curves (days to recurrence of episode of work absence due to back pain) using the log-rank statistic. Cox regression will be used to assess the effect of treatment group on hazard ratios.

The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from the societal perspective and according to the intention-to-treat principle. It will compare group exercise to minimal intervention using the primary outcome as the measure of effectiveness. Costs will include costs of the intervention, costs of health care utilization due to low back pain and costs of work absenteeism. Costs of the study treatment will be measured bottom-up and derived from the cost of providing the intervention plus the cost of equipment purchased.
