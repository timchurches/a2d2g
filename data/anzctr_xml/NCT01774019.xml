  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that preoperative biliary drainage using
      self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) does not negatively impact overall surgical outcomes in
      patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for treatment of pancreatic or periampullary
      cancer.</summary>
