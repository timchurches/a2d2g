  <interventions>
    <interventions>About 400 residents living in 36 hostels and nursing homes will be randomly assigned (at the level of facility) to receive the SMILE intervention or usual care. The SMILE intervention will comprise a 1-day training woprkshop for a staff member nominated by the facility to act as the LaughterBoss for that facility. The training session will be run at a central location off-site in small group experiential learning format, facilitated by an experienced humour therapy practitioner. It will address how to incorporate humour into daily care practices with residents. The LaughterBoss will then partner with an ElderClown (a performer experienced in using humour in health care settings) to engage residents through humour using music, mime, props and other techniques. ElderClowns will visit facilities over 12 weeks for humour therapy sessions lasting 2 hours on each visit, with each facility receiving a minimum of 9 sessions. LaughterBosses will be encouraged to continue to use humour techniques between weekly ElderClown visits and after the program of visits has ceased. SMILE will evaluate whether humour therapy improves resident mood and quality-of-life.</interventions>
    <comparator>Aged care facilities assigned to the control group will provide usual care for residents with respect to the assessment and management of depresssion and other behavioural issues. Usual care will be in line with each facility's care plan, and the regular assessment processes as prescribed by the Aged Care Funding Instrument in NSW Health (ACFI). At the end of the trial, the staff in the control group will be provided with the same one-day (delayed) training workshop for the volunteer staff nominated as LaughterBosses, as per the intervention group. There will be no ElderClown on-site visits for the control group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression will be assessed by the researcher using the Cornell Depression Inventory. The item format will be the same as that adopted in the depression category assessment within the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI; Section 10). The ACFI was introduced by the Australian Government in residential aged care in March 2008</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life wil be assessed using the DEMQOL version 4, using both the self-report (DEMQOL, 29 item) and informant (DEMQOL-proxy, 32 item) formats. This measure will completed via interview with an informant, and where possible, the resident. The informant will be a person familiar with the resident's usual behaviour, such as a carer employed at the aged care facility, a legal guardian or family member.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Social engagement and agitation will be assessed using the 8-item social engagement subscale of the 40-item Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES) and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI, 29 items). These measures will be completed via interview with an informant. The informant will be a person familiar with the resident's usual behaviour, such as a carer employed at the aged care facility, a legal guardian or family member.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline (pre-intervention), 12 weeks post intervention, and 12 weeks followup</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A computer-assisted tool for real-time observation of behavioural and social engagement will be used. Developed by the research team, and using some principles of Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) , this behaviour, engagement, and agitation measure (BEAM) will be used by the researchers to record brief observations in three activity profiles for each resident: during a mealtime, a structured activity, and free time.</outcome>

    <concealment>Thirty-six RACF units will be stratified by size (small=18 beds or less, large=greater than 18 beds) and care type (high or low care) to ensure balance across treatment groups and to allow testing of whether the effects of humour therapy differ across strata. Units within each stratum will be assigned a number and then randomised to receive the humour intervention or usual care. Randomisation will occur after all the facilities have been recruited, however the group to which the units have been allocated will not be revealed to other study staff or RACFs until consent for individual residents has been obtained and baseline assessments have been completed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Sydney Multisite Intervention of Laughterbosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) is a trial of humour therapy in aged care. The study will recruit 36 hostels and nursing homes, and half of these faciilties will be randomly assigned to receive humour therapy (intervention) or usual care (control). The intevention comprises ElderClowns visiting residents on a weekly basis, and volunteer staff in to be trained as LaughterBosses to bring humour into dialy care routines.  About 400 residents will be assessed at three timepoints during the trial to test the hypotheis that humour may improve quality of life, engagement, and mood (e.g. depression).</summary>
