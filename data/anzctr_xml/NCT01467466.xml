    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - IV isotonic saline
Treatment: drugs - IV isotonic bicarbonate
Treatment: drugs - N-acetylcysteine
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Active Comparator: Arm 1 - IV isotonic saline and oral placebo drug capsule

Active Comparator: Arm 2 - IV isotonic saline and oral N-acetylcysteine drug capsule

Active Comparator: Arm 3 - IV isotonic bicarbonate and oral placebo drug capsule

Active Comparator: Arm 4 - IV isotonic bicarbonate and oral N-acetylcysteine drug capsule


Treatment: drugs: IV isotonic saline
The investigators will administer 3 ml/kg of isotonic saline over 1 hour at an infusion rate of not less than 1 mL/kg per hour and not more than 3 mL/kg per hour prior to the angiographic procedure, 1-1.5ml/kg per hour during angiography, and 6 ml/kg of isotonic saline over 4 hours following the procedure at an infusion rate of not less than 1 mL/kg per hour and not more than 1.5 mL/kg per hour. Providers will retain discretion to administer larger volumes of isotonic saline (up to a maximum of 12 mL/kg) over durations of up to 12 hours pre and 12 hours post-procedure.

Treatment: drugs: IV isotonic bicarbonate
The investigators will administer 3 ml/kg of isotonic bicarbonate over 1 hour at an infusion rate of not less than 1 mL/kg per hour and not more than 3 mL/kg per hour prior to the angiographic procedure, 1-1.5ml/kg per hour during angiography, and 6 ml/kg of isotonic bicarbonate over 4 hours following the procedure at an infusion rate of not less than 1 mL/kg per hour and not more than 1.5 mL/kg per hour. Providers will retain discretion to administer larger volumes of isotonic bicarbonate (up to a maximum of 12 mL/kg) over durations of up to 12 hours pre and 12 hours post-procedure.

Treatment: drugs: N-acetylcysteine
NAC will be administered at a dose of 1200mg orally 1 hour prior to angiography, 1 hour following the procedure, and then twice daily for the next 4 days.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
A placebo study drug capsule will be administered orally 1 hour prior to angiography, 1 hour following the procedure, and then twice daily for the next 4 days.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be a composite of serious, adverse, patient-centered events, including death, need for acute dialysis, or persistent decline in kidney function. - Death will be based on medical record and/or vital status registry documentation
Need for acute dialysis will be defined as the initiation of any modality of renal replacement (intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy, or sustained low-efficiency dialysis)
Persistent decline in kidney function will be defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 50% from the baseline value collected pre-angiography to the measurement taken 90 days following the angiography.</outcome>
