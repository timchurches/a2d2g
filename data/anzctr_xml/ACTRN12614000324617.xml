  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants from a larger validation study of mental health screening questionnaires will also be able to opt in to a low-intensity randomised controlled trial providing feedback about their symptoms. In the trial, participants will get feedback about their symptoms (intervention condition) or general feedback about symptoms in the population (control condition). This feedback will be for either depression symptoms, adult ADHD, or social phobia, depending on which screener is presented in the larger validation study. The feedback will be provided to the participants in the intervention online on a single screen. Prior to the feedback, participants will complete a brief set of questions on quality of life and service use. Following the feedback, participants will  then complete another brief survey 3 months later. Respondents who choose to participate in the trial will only be identifiable through their provision of an email address.  </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>In the Australian general population 11.9% of people seek help for a mental disorder in a 12-month period. However, 20% meet criteria for a disorder and substantially more have mental health problems. The feedback intervention aims to reduce the service gap by 30%, i.e., increase overall helpseeking from 11.9% to 15.5%. To find such a difference with 85% power, we will require 3372 participants (1686 in each condition across the three disorders of interest). The study will also have 90% power to find small differences (d &gt; 0.10) in help seeking intentions between intervention and control groups overall, and to find small differences (d &gt; 0.17) between intervention and control groups within the three disorders of interest.

Binary mixed effects repeated measures models will be used to analyse the help seeking outcomes, following an intention to treat approach under the missing at random assumption.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine whether feedback regarding mental health symptoms encourages increased help-seeking or service use.

The research group will be initially running a national survey of an estimated 105,000 people. The survey will contain screening questionnaires for common mental health issues. At the end of this survey, participants will be asked whether they would like to be included in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). If yes, participants will be asked to provide their email addresses only. The national survey (already completed by participants) will serve as baseline data. They will then be randomised into one of two conditions: 'Feedback' or 'No Feedback' (control condition). Those who are randomised into the 'Feedback' condition will immediately be provided with feedback regarding their mental health symptomology, based on screening results . All RCT participants will then be assessed in a post-intervention survey, 3 months after the initial survey regarding their help-seeking or service use for mental health problems, quality of life, disability (days out of role) and mental health symptoms.</summary>
