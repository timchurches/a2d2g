  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the psychometric properties in specific pain intensity and physical functional outcome measures in adults with chronic diabetic Neuropathic pain (NeP).   Specifically this study aims to:
1. Investigate the test-retest reliability of modified Brief Pain Inventory Diabetic Neuropathic Pain (BPI-DPN) scale and Screening of Activity Limitation and Safety Awareness (SALSA) scale in adults with chronic diabetic neuropathic pain (NeP).   
2. Longitudinally investigate the responsiveness: Minimal Clinically important change (MCIC) of BPI-DPN and SALSA in adults with chronic diabetic NeP.   
3. Observe the nature of relationship between pain intensity (BPI-DPN) and physical functioning (SALSA) outcome measures in adults with chronic diabetic NeP.
