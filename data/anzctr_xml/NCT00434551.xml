  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective study aimed to validate the ability of capsule endoscopy to accurately
      diagnose small bowel Crohn's disease in symptomatic patients who have a non-diagnostic
      standard workup. Patients will be randomized to undergo capsule endoscopy either one week or
      five weeks after enrolment. Patients will be followed up for up to 3 months after capsule
      endoscopy.</summary>
