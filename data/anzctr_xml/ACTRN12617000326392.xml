    <interventions>The study location is the Ocular Surface Laboratory at the University of Auckland.  On 2 separate days, with at least 24 hours washout between visits, participants are randomised to one hour of continuous computer use, with and without exposure to a desktop humidifier, set at a humidifying rate of 30ml/h (Homi Ltd).  Environmental conditions are otherwise identical between the two scenarios. The humidifier placement remains identical throughout the experiment, at a distance of 70-75 cm from the eyes, and with the indicator light obscured.

Lipid layer grade, non-invasive tear film break-up time and tear meniscus height are measured by clinical researchers before and after computer use. Subjective comfort relative to baseline is also assessed following the 1-hour period.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Control treatment is the identical scenario (1 hour of continuous computer use) without exposure to humidified air from the desktop humidifier.  Participant is masked with respect to the activity or non-activity of the humidifier by occluding the indicator light on the humidifier, and with a low level humming noise that masks any sound from the humidifier.  Participants were advised that vapour might or might not be visible in either scenario depending on the room conditions.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Non-invasive tear break up time (NIBUT) measured by observing mires reflected from the tear film after a blink for the first sign of a distortion in the pattern.  The time between the blink and first distortion is recorded as the break up time and an average of three measurements is recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 1 hour exposure to continuous computer use</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lipid layer grade is evaluated by interferometry.  Specular reflection of a wide-field white light  on the surface of the tears highlights interference fringe patterns on biomicroscopic examination, that are graded according to thickness and quality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 1 hour of computer use</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective comparison of ocular comfort relative to baseline, following the one-hour period of computer use, using a force-choice, three-point scale: greater, equal or lesser comfort.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 1 hour of computer use</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tear meniscus height: determined from a high magnification digital image that is subsequently calibrated via graticule on imaging software </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluates the potential for a desktop USB-powered humidifier in improving tear film parameters, ocular surface characteristics, and subjective comfort of computer users.

Participants are enrolled into a prospective, randomised, double-masked, crossover study. On separate days, they will be randomised to one hour of continuous computer use, with and without exposure to a desktop humidifier (Homi Ltd). Lipid layer grade, non-invasive tear film break-up time and tear meniscus height are measured before and after computer use. Subjective comfort relative to baseline is also assessed following the 1-hour period.
