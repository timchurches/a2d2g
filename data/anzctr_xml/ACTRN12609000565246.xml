  <interventions>
    <interventions>An individual exercise program will be formed and implemented based on the impairments identified in the interview and physical examination.  The intervention program will address the individuals impairments and aim to train control of the lumbar lordosis during sitting, squatting and rowing, with progressions to improve the strength and endurance of the lower limb and back muscles during these tasks with increased load and endurance demands. Subsequent to the initial examination each subject in the intervention group will receive 4 physiotherapy sessions, with a review at 1, 3, 5 and 7 weeks following the initial session to monitor adherence and understanding of the exercise program and to progress the exercises. The subjects will be asked to complete these exercises over a 12 week period. 

All exercise programs prescribed to the rowers will be written on a sheet of paper with diagrammatic representation and a brief explanation of the exercises. The rowers will be told to perform the prescribed exercises daily throughout the course of the rowing season. Rowers will also be asked to fill in a compliance sheet to indicate the level of adherence to the program. All assessments and interventions will be carried out in a private physiotherapy practice in Perth, and will be provided by a physiotherapist with post-graduate qualification and experience in a previous intervention research in adolescent female rowers.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will not receive physiotherapy exercise intervention, but will continue through the rowing season as usual and undergo the same coaching and conditioning program as the intervention group.  The subjects in this group will be asked not to participate in exercise or physiotherapy treatment therapy over a 12 week period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self reported Low Back Pain (LBP) on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  This scale will collect pain information on rowers during functional activities on the week prior to data collection.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The self reported pain will be recorded during the initial data collection period (Time 0). Following this initial assessment, rowers in the intervention group will receive treatment and the control group will continue their normal rowing training.  Eight weeks following initial treatment, the self reported pain will be collected again (Week 8 follow up) and then again 12 weeks after initial assessment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whilst the rowers are rowing on the ergometer, spinal kinematics data will be collected using the 3-Space Fastrak system (an electromagnetic device to measure spinal angles).  Using this device, the sacral angle, lower lumbar curvature, upper lumbar curvature and thoracic angles will be derived.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The spinal kinematics will be recorded during the initial data collection period (Time 0).  The VAS will be collected during every minute of the rowing ergometer trial.  The rowers in the intervention group will receive treatment and the control group will continue their normal rowing training.  Eight weeks following initial treatment, the ergometer trial will be repeated, spinal kinematics will be collected (Week 8 follow up).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Roland Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire will be completed prior to rowing ergometry testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Roland Morris Disability Scale will be collected prior to rowing ergometer trial at the initial data collection (week 0), this test will be repeated at 8 weeks and 12 weeks following the initial trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Patient Specific Functional Scale on the level of pain during functional activities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Patient Specific Functional Scale will be collected prior to rowing ergometer trial at the initial data collection (week 0), this test will be repeated at 8 weeks and 12 weeks following the initial trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Numeric Pain Rating Scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPFS) will be collected during initial ergometer rowing trials.  The NPFS will be collected every minute of the 20 minute rowing ergometry trial.  The test will be completed in the initial data collection, and then again 8 weeks following initial data collection session.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>40 adolescent male rowers with LBP between 14 to 17 years of age will be recruited for the study from local rowing clubs.  Participation is voluntary.  Informed consent will be collected from the rowers and their parent/guardian. The subjects that meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned an identification number.  They will then be randomly allocated to an intervention or a control group using the random number generator in Microsoft Excel 2003 that will generate a number between 0 and 1.  The twenty lowest numbers will be assigned to the control group.  This will be completed by an independent investigator who is not involved with data collection, intervention prescription or data analysis.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed using the random number generator in Microsoft Excel 2003 that will generate a number between 0 and 1.  The twenty lowest numbers will be assigned to the control group.  The allocation will only be known to an independent investigator who will not be involved with participant recruitment, intervention or follow-up assessment.  Participants in both groups will receive an identification number.  To prevent investigator/assessor bias, allocation concealment will be achieved by participants in both groups receiving a sealed, opaque envelope containing their identification number, information sheet and consent forms to participate in this research.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to find out whether physiotherapy treatment can change the spinal postures and levels of pain during ergometer rowing in schoolboy rowers with low back pain.  Similar physiotherapy intervention have worked in the past on schoolgirl rowers.</summary>
