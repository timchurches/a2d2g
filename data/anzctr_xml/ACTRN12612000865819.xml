  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Positive Parenting for Healthy Living Seminar Series (Lifestyle Triple P Seminar Series) is a new, brief adaptation of the Level Four Group Lifestyle Triple P program. It aims to help parents raise healthy children by providing them with information and practical strategies for positive parenting, promoting healthy eating, and increasing physical activity. 

Parents attend a total of three parent sessions delivered over 3 consecutive weeks. Each session lasts 90 minutes, and is delivered in group format to parents. Parents must attend all three sessions.  Both parents and other caregivers are encouraged to attend the program, however one parent need only attend for a family to be eligible for the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment -care as usual. The study will experimentally test the relative impact of Lifestyle Triple P against care as usual in improving both general and lifestyle-specific child and parenting outcomes.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Parenting Scale (Arnold et al., 1993).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Lifestyle Parenting Questionnaire (LPQ) -recently developed by Bartlett and Sanders (2012)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Lifestyle Behaviour Checklist (West &amp; Sanders, 2009)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accelerometers will be used to measure the amount and intensity of child physical activity (model: GT3X plus). Accelerometers are waterproof, small (4.6 cm x 3.3 cm x 1.5 cm), lightweight (19 grams) and unobtrusive. Accelerometers will be worn on the child's right hip via an adjustable waist belt as placement here has been found to be more valid and less obtrusive (McIver et al., 2005; Ward et al., 2005). Children will be asked to wear an accelerometer from morning wakening until bedtime for seven consecutive days. Accelerometers will be worn during bathing and swimming. Parents will complete an accompanying activity chart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A 3-day food diary will be used to measure the child's diet. Parents will be asked to monitor their child's food and drink intake for three days (i.e., two week days and 1 weekend day). They will be asked to record the type and quantity of all foods and drinks the child consumes for the three days. Food data will be analysed using nutrition software (Foodworks Professional, Xyris Software, Australia).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale (CAPES; Morawska &amp; Sanders, 2010)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parent body mass index (BMI) will also be collected to assess parental weight status. Parent BMI will be obtained using the same procedures used for collecting child BMI. BMI will be classified as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese using the Australian standard definitions (Australian Government Department of Health and Aging, 2002).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child body mass index. BMI will be expressed as measured weight in kilograms divided by measured height in meters squared (kg/m2). BMI scores will be converted into age and gender specific BMI z scores using the least mean square (LMS) reference parameters provided by the United States Centres for Disease Control (CDC 2000). Child height and weight recordings will be measured objectively using a stadiometer and scales, and under standard procedures (Davies et al., 2000).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child weight which will be objectively measured using scales according to the protocol outlined by Davies et al (2000).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (upon entry and before randomisation), 6 weeks later, 6 months later, and 12 months later.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child waist circumference will also be used to evaluate child truncal adiposity. A reduction in waist circumference in a child could indicate a loss of central fat.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This evaluation trial will evaluate a brief parent Lifestyle Triple P Seminar program for parents of overweight children aged 3  10 years of age in a randomised trial comparing the parenting intervention against care as usual. The CONSORT guidelines for randomised controlled trials will be utilised. The study is a 2 (Triple P vs case as usual) x 4 (time: pre-test, post-test, 6-month follow up, and 12-month follow up) design. The study will experimentally test the relative impact of Triple P against care as usual in improving both general and lifestyle-specific child and parenting outcomes. The trial is recruiting all over Brisbane and Ipswich suburbs.</summary>
