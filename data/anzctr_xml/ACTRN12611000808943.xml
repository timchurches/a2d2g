  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individualized bicycle training via Lose the Training Wheels protocol is implemented on a one-on-one basis for 75 minutes per day for 5 consecutive days. The total duration of training is 5 days. The primary focus is on maximizing the amount of time the rider is on the bicycle practicing within the 75 minute session. The training begins with an adapted bicycle that has a series of 8 different roller wheels rather than a standard wheel on the back. As the roller wheels go from 1-8, the rollers become more tapered on the ends requiring better control of the bicycle. There is also a bicycle training handle attached to the back of the bicycle to afford the trainer with a system of prompting the rider to lean into the turns and to stop the rider from falling or running into stationary objects. Eight riders participant with their trainer in each 75 minute training session and then go home until the next day of training. Riders begin to transition onto a standard two wheel bicycle once they demonstate good control of the training bicycle and learn to stop using hand breaks. Initial training occurs indoors until they transition to a two wheel bicycle at which time they move out of doors with their trainer. Those riders who succeed in making a transition onto a two wheel bicycle are encouraged to bring their own bicycle the last day of training.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study was to determine the rate of success in learning how to ride a two wheel bicycle in youth with Down syndrome and to evaluate if those participants who learned to ride, decreased their average amount of sedentary activity and subcutaneous body fat compared to the control group over a 12 month period. Our hypothesis was that those participants who learned to ride a two wheel bicycle would benefit more than those participants in the control group over the 12 month period following the treatment.</summary>
