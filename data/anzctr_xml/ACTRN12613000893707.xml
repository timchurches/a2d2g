  <interventions>
    <interventions>Health-message framing: The tri-fold, coloured A4 pamphlet was written either in a gain or loss frame, indicating either what mothers gain from the cocooning strategy or what mothers would lose by not receiving the pertussis booster vaccine (for adults). The intervention was administered by the research nurse once the baseline questionnaire was completed. The interventions ( gain or loss pamphlet) were allocated to participants using sequential block allocation by week. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control was the standard NSW Health pertussis facts sheet (A4, double sided). The printed factsheet was accessed from http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/factsheets/infectious/pertussis.html (Date: 14/SEPT/2009) and was the only available pertussis resource at the commencement of the study.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pertussis booster vaccine uptake by postpartum women, assessed by follow up questionnaire completed prior to discharge.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate postpartum period (prior to discharge from hospital following childbirth). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Baseline attitude and other factors influencing vaccine uptake were assessed using a self-administered, paper-based questionnaire completed at the participant's bedside. 

The questionnaire was comprised of 5 parts structure according to the Health Belief Model framework, with questions on: a) pertussis vaccination information sources b) pertussis susceptibility and severity c) vaccine benefits and barriers d) intentions to be vaccinated and e) demographic information. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline (following completion of the baseline questionnaire, prior to allocation of the intervention or control). </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Additional follow up ( by preferred method of phone or email) to assess household pertussis vaccine status and household exposure to pertussis and/or epidsode/s of pertussis. </outcome>
      <timepoint>from six months postpartum</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <concealment>All postpartum women present during recruitment days ( 3 week days) are approached sequentially (room by room on the postnatal ward) by the research nurse. Following consent, an paper-based, self-administered baseline questionnaire is completed. Next, the allocated intervention for that week is given to the participant by the research nurse. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of N=1080 is required to detect a difference between the gain-frame, loss-frame and control, with 80% confidence at the 0.05 level. This includes a 20% margin for non-response. Calculation based on vaccine coverage of 75%-80% post intervention.

Frequencies reported as percentages for all questions. Chi-square analysis to test for association of pertussis booster vaccine uptake and demographic, attitudinal, awareness and behavioural variables. Multiple logistic regression of significant variables in the univariate analysis is undertaken to determine predictors of vaccine uptake on the postnatal ward. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The cocooning strategy, which was implemented in Australia in 2009, can have a strong protective effect (indirect) against pertussis in infants. To achieve high maternal coverage, understanding maternal attitudes and other potentially influential factors is important. In this study, we examined the influence of baseline attitudes, modifiable factors and health message framing on pertussis booster vaccine uptake among postpartum women in the public hospital setting. </summary>
