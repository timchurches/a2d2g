    <statisticalmethods>To investigate the changes in lung volumes and flows, a mixed regression model will be used, that allows for repeated measures from the same individual. Spearman's correlation coefficient will be used to determine any correlation between end expiratory lung impedance and airway pressure change. To look at differences in RR, EtCO2, HR and SpO2 paired t-tests will be used. Any p values less than 0.05 will be considered significant.

A sample size of 20 was chosen following discussions with a statistician. As no prior similar data was available, sample size calculations relied on data obtained from several case studies conducted in our ICU.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Critically ill tracheostomised mechanically ventilated patients are often left voiceless due to air bypassing their vocal folds. There are speaking valves that can be used in this population to restore verbal communication, however they are not widely used with ICU patients due to concerns about the required cuff deflation causing a leak in the ventilation circuit and potentially leading to derecruitment of the patients' lungs. This in turn would be deleterious towards patients weaning off mechanical ventilation. This study is looking at assessing patients' lung mechanics before, during and after the speaking valve use to guide us on respiratory physiology and advise us on future best practice.</summary>
