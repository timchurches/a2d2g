  <interventions>
    <interventions>Aqua aerobics, 60 minute sessions, twice weekly for 12 weeks. The aqua aerobics sessions will comprise activities standing and walking in the pool that challenge balance strategies and increase the strength of the lower limbs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Computer Skill Training Programme, 60 minute sessions, twice weekly for 12 weeks. The Computer Skill Training Programme is run by a voluntary organisation catering for older adults known as SeniorNet. During the sessions participants practice their computer skills and roving advisors assist each individual at what ever level of computer skills they are presently at. 
Those participants not interested in computer training can engage in card or board games provided on the same time schedule (60 minute sessions, twice weekly for 12 weeks). These board and card games are organised by an organisation catering for older adults and comprise activities such as mah-jong.</comparator>

      <outcome>Falls incidence will be assessed with the use of monthly falls diaries. Participants will note on the appropriate day in the diary if they have a fall. Diaries are returned monthly to the researchers whether the individual has fallen or not.  Participants not returning diaries are reminded each month by a telephone call. Participants indicating they have had a fall are contacted to obtain details of the fall using a structured questionnaire.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the Dunedin area through community organisations catering for older adults (e.g. Age Concern, Grey Power), doctor and physiotherapy practices, churches and public media advertising.  Interested volunteers will contact the researchers. Eligibility for inclusion into the trial will be conducted by telephone interview using a standardised study eligibility questionnaire with volunteers responding to the study advertising. People who met the inclusion criteria and agree to participate will be invited for a baseline assessment. At this time informed written consent will be gained. Following the baseline assessments, participants will be randomly assigned to either Aqua aerobics or Computer Training (waiting list control arm) using sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, presenting in almost half of all people over the age of 60 and nearly all people over the age of 80. Lower extremity osteoarthritis in older adults is associated with functional losses, reduced daily physical activity and increased falls risk. Public health exercise programmes aimed at reducing falls risk in older adults are provided in New Zealand but are land-based, and potentially aggravate the signs and symptoms associated with arthritis. Aqua aerobics may be a suitable alternative form of fall prevention exercise for older adults with OA at risk of falling. This randomised control trial with six month follow-up will investigate whether a twelve week, twice weekly aqua aerobics programme decreases falls risk and improves measures of gait, balance and physical function in older adults with osteoarthritis who have a heightened risk of falling.</summary>
