Treatment: drugs - placebo

Active Comparator: caffeine - 

Placebo Comparator: placebo - 


Treatment: drugs: Caffeine citrate injection
Loading dose: 20 mg/kg administered over at least 30 minutes via IV infusion or over at least 10 minutes via slow IV injection.
Daily maintenance dose (to commence at least 24 hours after loading dose): 5 mg/kg, administered over at least 10 minutes via IV infusion, or over at least 5 minutes via slow IV injection. Maintenance dose to be adjusted for body weight every 7 days. If indicated, maintenance dose may be increased to a maximum of 10 mg/kg. May be given orally once full enteral feeds are established.
Duration of treatment: discontinue after infant has tolerated at least 5 consecutive days without positive pressure support AND when the infant is judged by the attending clinician to be no longer a candidate for methylxanthine therapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Apnea of prematurity is a common condition that is usually treated with methylxanthines.
      Methylxanthines are adenosine receptor blockers that have powerful influences on the central
      nervous system. However, little is known about the long-term effects of methylxanthines on
      the developing brain.

      The Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity-Sleep (CAP-S) Study is a sub-study of the main Caffeine
      for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP) trial, an international placebo-controlled randomized trial of
      methylxanthine therapy for apnea of prematurity. This sub-study is designed to take advantage
      of this cohort of ex-premature, 5-7 year old children who were randomized at birth to receive
      either caffeine or placebo, and are currently receiving detailed neurocognitive and
      behavioral assessments in the CAP trial.</summary>
