    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Romidepsin

Experimental: Romidepsin - Participants received romidepsin 14 mg/m^2 administered intravenously over 4 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Participants continued on monthly cycles of romidepsin. The planned duration of study therapy was 6 cycles. Patients who responded could continue beyond 6 cycles until disease progression or other withdrawal criteria were met. For participants treated for 12 or more cycles, maintenance dosing (2 doses per cycle) was permitted.


Treatment: drugs: Romidepsin
Romidepsin intravenously (through a vein) over 4 hours on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response According to the International Workshop Response Criteria (IWC) for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL) Assessed by an Independent Review Committee - Complete Response (CR): &gt;75% decrease in size aggregate of nodal index lesions (large and small), complete disappearance of extranodal and non-index lesions; total disappearance of clinical disease including skin involvement; disease-related signs and symptoms, normalization of biochemical abnormalities and reduction in size of spleen or liver so no longer palpable. Unconfirmed CR: all above criteria except all nodal index lesions must have regressed &gt;75% in the sum of the product diameters (SPD) from baseline. Individual nodes previously confluent must have regressed by &gt;75% in their SPD.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Objective Disease Response - Objective disease response was defined as patients with a Complete Response, Unconfirmed Complete Response or a Partial Response according to the IWC 1999 assessed by an independent review committee: CR, Cru defined above, PR defined as =50% decrease in size of 6 largest dominant nodes and/or nodal masses &amp; extranodal index lesions and no increase of non-index lesions, liver, or spleen; no new sites of disease evident; skin lesions decreased by =50%.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Objective Disease Response - Duration of response was defined as the number of days from the date of the first disease response (Complete, Unconfirmed Complete or Partial Response) until the date of progression and was determined using Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates.
