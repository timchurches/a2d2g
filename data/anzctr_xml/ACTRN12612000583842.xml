  <interventions>
    <interventions>Bioness Ness L300 Foot Drop System will be used in people admitted to hospital following stroke. Dose, intensity and activities of use will not be specified but will be described. 

The L300 is a wireless peroneal nerve electrical stimulation unit, which promotes ankle dorsiflexion after toe off and during the swing phase of gait (TGA Approval number 152654). The unit will be fitted by a trained physiotherapist and participants will wear the device during physiotherapy intervention and management. Devices will be worn by participants as required and will be at the discretion of the physiotherapist.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The QH Rural Stroke Outreach Service and the Queensland Rehabilitation Physiotherapy Network are investigating the use of the Bioness NESS L300 (L300) to support gait recovery in people following stroke with foot drop. A prospective clinical controlled study involving eight rehabilitation units is planned. Each participating site has nominated to be either an intervention or a control site. Following familiarisation, participants will use the L300 during physiotherapy treatment once medically stable until they are discharged or the L300 is no longer clinically required. Participants will be followed up by phone at 4, 8 and 12 weeks following recruitment to the study.</summary>
