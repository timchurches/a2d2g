  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will investigate the effects of intravenous fluid  (type of fluid and amount) for adult patients undergoing major surgery (duration &gt;2 hours and at least one overnight stay) over a 12-week period. The study will determine the association between perioperative intravenous fluids and acute kidney injury (AKI), defined by an increase in creatinine greater than 25% or 0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline to peak value within the first 72-hours postoperatively.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A recently published open label sequential period study of chloride-liberal vs. chloride-restrictive fluid administration demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of injury and failure based on RIFLE criteria from 14% (95% CI, 11% - 16%) to 8.4% (95% CI, 6.4% - 10%); P&lt;0.001) with the introduction of a chloride-restrictive fluid regime.  

Assuming that, as we have conservatively estimated, we can study 500-600 subjects over a 12-week period, our sample size will provide more than 90% power with an alpha of 0.01 to detect a difference of this magnitude between patients treated with saline vs. patients treated with different crystalloid fluids.  

The primary analyses will be unadjusted analyses in which binary outcomes will be compared using relative risks with 95% confidence intervals and chi square tests and continuous outcomes will be compared with the use of mean differences and un-paired T-tests assuming that normality assumptions are meet.  If normality assumptions are not met then we plan to attempt simple data transformation, such as a logarithm transformation, and if this fails to proceed to a Mann-Whitney rank based test.  Adjusted analyses will be performed using Poisson regression for binary outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes.  Baseline covariates will include age, gender, elective vs. emergency surgery, surgical specialty of admission, type of operation, and baseline serum creatinine level. Survival times will be compared using log-rank tests and presented as Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariable models will be developed to study the predictors of AKI and the independent association between fluid choice and renal outcomes. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The administration of intravenous (IV) crystalloid fluids (also known as fluid therapy) is a ubiquitous intervention in patients undergoing surgery. Worldwide, the most commonly used crystalloid fluids available for patients undergoing major surgery include Saline (0.9%), Hartmanns and Plasmalyte solutions. All three solutions are available for IV use at Austin Hospital and considered standard of care for all patients undergoing major surgery. Choice of these fluids amongst anaesthetists at Austin Hospital is similar to worldwide practices. In this study we will be collecting information about intravenous fluid intervention (type of fluid and amount) for adult patients undergoing major surgery (duration greater or equal to 2 hours and at least one overnight stay). Data will be collected over a 12-week period. Specifically, the effects of these fluids on kidney function will be investigated. Perioperative care and fluid intervention therefore will remain completely at the discretion of the treating clinicians.</summary>
