  <interventions>
    <interventions>Wii Active exercise programme 1x/week and approximately an hour (rest time inclusive), sessions are in small groups supervised by a physiotherapist over a period of 12 weeks.

Concurrently, home exercise 2x/week on non-programme days. Each session between 0.5-1 hour.

Wii intervention 15-20 minutes, stretching 5 minutes, balance training 10 minutes, resistance training 10 minutes, 10 minutes variable training based on subject needs including pain management.

Home programme: Stretching, balance and agility training, strength training and cardiovascular training.</interventions>
