    <interventions>Thymoglobulin - 2 different schedules:
Canadian patients will receive:
0.5mg/kg day -2
2mg/kg day -1
2mg/kg day 0 before graft infusion

Australian patients will receive the same dose and schedule of Thymoglobulin except the doses will be given on day -3, day -2 and day -1 respectively.
Thymoglobulin will be given as a continuous IV infusion over 4-8 hrs</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group will consist of historical `controls' who had a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) unrelated donor transplant at Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) from 2000-2006. Historical controls of patients did not receive Thymoglobulin (or any form of T cell depletion), but are otherwise comparable for other transplant characteristics.

      <outcome>To compare the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD at one and two years in patients receiving Thymoglobulin prophylaxis, with historical controls of patients who did not receive Thymoglobulin (or any form of T cell depletion), but who are otherwise comparable for other transplant characteristics.  For this purpose patients receiving the two different Thymoglobulin schedules will be analysed together. Grading of acute GVHD will be done according to Glucksberg/Seattle criteria. The scoring system from Filipovich (BBMT 2005) will be used to grade the severity of chronic GVHD.</outcome>

A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate chronic GVHD.  Severe chronic GVHD indicates major disability caused by chronic GVHD (score of 3 in any organ or site).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is for patients with a condition in which it has been recommended that an unrelated or (less commonly) a mismatched related donor stem cell transplant be performed.

One of the major side-effects of receiving a peripheral blood stem cell transplant from an unrelated or mismatched related donor is graft vs host disease (GVHD), particularly extensive chronic GVHD which can occur in up to 80% of patients.  Some forms of chronic GVHD, particularly of the skin, lung and liver, can be debilitating, respond poorly to therapy and result in significant impairment of quality of life and can lead to death.  

The type of donor cells which are responsible for GVHD are called T cells.  The number of T cells can be substantially reduced by giving the patient a drug, for three days prior to the transplant, called thymoglobulin.  This drug is derived from rabbits and is an antibody which inactivates or depletes many of the T cells as they are infused.  Evidence from various studies suggests that T cell depletion of this type can substantially reduce the risk of GVHD after a transplant, with major improvements in the quality of life in surviving patients.  

There are, however, potential disadvantages from T cell depletion.  The same T cells which cause GVHD may also be important for engraftment (the ability of the donor stem cells to grow successfully in the recipients bone marrow and restore blood counts), immunity against viral infections (particularly in the first 3-4 months post-transplant) and a graft vs leukaemia/lymphoma effect which is when the immune system of the donor attacks any residual tumour which has survived the chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</summary>
