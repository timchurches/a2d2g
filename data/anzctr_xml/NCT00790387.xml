Experimental: 1 High dose tirofiban and enoxaparin - Enoxaparin was administered at the commencement of PCI at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg .
Tirofiban was administered once the wire had crossed the lesion during PCI with a bolus dose of 25 µg/kg of bodyweight, followed by an infusion of 0.15 µg per kilogram per minute for 18 to 24 hours.

Active Comparator: 2 tirofiban and unfractionated heparin - Tirofiban was administered once the wire had crossed the lesion during PCI with a bolus dose of 25 µg/kg of bodyweight, followed by an infusion of 0.15 µg per kilogram per minute for 18 to 24 hours.
UFH heparin was administered as a bolus of 70 U/kg and additional heparin was given to maintain the activated clotting time (ACT) at 250

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing coronary angioplasty are frequently treated with new drugs that stop
      blood platelets working and so improve the success of the procedure. Individual patients may
      vary in the dose of the drug required. New platelet tests have been developed which can be
      performed near the patient and possibly immediately tell the doctor the degree of platelet
      inhibition achieved so that the dose can be adjusted accordingly. This study aims to
      investigate if these platelet tests indicate if new anticoagulants are more effective at
      inhibiting platelet function than the traditional anticoagulants. The study will demonstrate
      if these newer drugs improve blood flow through the heart muscle and thereby provide better
      long term outcomes for patients undergoing percutaneous intervention.</summary>
