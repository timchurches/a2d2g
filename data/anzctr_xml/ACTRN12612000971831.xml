    <interventions>Study Intervention Group (n=110) 

Intervention: Post-PCI nurse-led educational clinic.

Clinic: Post-discharge period education and support tailored to PCI patients including: cardiac rehabilitation [CR] referral and attendance; medication knowledge, education and adherence; post-discharge period cares, complication identification and management, including access site management; chest pain identification and management. 

Intervention to be administered in a 45-60 minute single visit at day 5-7 post-discharge from hospital.
Visit times (i.e. 45-60 minutes) will vary on a case by case basis. For example one participant may have more questions/concerns than others and therefore require slightly more time to have these addressed. 

Telephone follow-up for intervention group participants will occur at 1 and 3 months post-discharge.


Data collection: self-report standardised tools; and salivary cortisol.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Care Group (n=110) 

Participants will receive Hospital standard care and telephone follow-up by the principal researcher to collect post-discharge period data after undergoing PCI. Telephone follow-up for standard care group data collection will only occur once at each timepoint.  

Hospital standard care involves participants receiving in-patient procedural and post-procedural education from nursing and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) teams up until the day of discharge from hospital using standardised pathways. Follow-up outpatient appointments are made with the CR team and cardiologist.

Data collection: Psychosocial and physical health assessment using self-report standardised tools; and salivary cortisol. After baseline assessment, data collection will occur via telephone at 5-7 days, 1 month and 3 months post-discharge from hospital. Participants in the standard care group will not return for any follow-up at day 5-7 post-discharge and will only be contacted via telephone for data collection purposes.</comparator>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be identified through collaboration with ward staff at the hospital sites. 

The recruitment process - Day of hospital discharge:
1. Consultation with the nurse unit manager (NUM); 
2. Consultation with the nurse in charge of the shift; and 
3. Consultation with the nurse caring for the patient. 

Participants will be approached by their nurse, advised of the study and asked if they wish to speak with the principal researcher regarding potential participation. If participants agree, the principal researcher will offer a participant information and consent form (PICF) in the presence of their nurse and be given time to review the documents. If the patient wishes to speak with the principal researcher to seek clarification or to sign the consent form, they may advise their nurse, who will contact the researcher. Participants, if agreeable, will be consented to the study. Baseline data will be collected, and participants will be randomly assigned to a study group. 

The allocation sequence will be concealed from the hospital sites and participants. Envelopes containing random numbers for participant selection are opaque, aluminium lined and sealed. The aluminium lining will ensure the envelope is impermeable to intense light. Envelopes are only to be opened after the enrolled participants complete all baseline assessments.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluates the effectiveness of a nurse-led educational clinic offered to patients within 5-7 days after having a procedure on their heart. The main aim of the clinic is to reduce patient anxiety after discharge from hospital. This study also aims to reinforce education on post-operative cares, risk and lifestyle modification, and encouraging medication adherence whilst improving access to secondary prevention programs. Through the provision of nurse-led clinical follow-up, support and education in the early post-discharge period, it is hoped that patients can achieve confidence and independence in their health-management, resulting in improvements in psychosocial and physical well-being.</summary>
