  <interventions>
    <interventions>In  Group A we will apply Topical 1% Hydrocortisone (Fusidin-H cream) thinly smeared once daily with 4x4 inch gauze piece onto wound bed by the dresser. Primary researcher will follow the patient for intervention adherence and will note in data. During the dressing changes, routine digital photographs will be taken. Duration of treatment will be till the wound healed (epithelialized). Time to complete wound healing will be noted and defined as the number of days from application of steroid until complete epithelialization.</interventions>
    <comparator>In  Group B we will apply liquid paraffin gauze (Bactigras) onto wound bed by the dresser. Primary researcher will follow the patient for intervention adherence and will note in data. During the dressing changes, routine digital photographs will be taken. Duration of treatment will be till the wound healed (epithelialized). Time to complete wound healing will be noted and defined as the number of days from application of steroid until complete epithelialization.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The formation of granulation tissue into an open wound allows the re-epithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment and will be assessed by two different consultants by photographs. and the time of re-epithelialization will be noted by each </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After getting approval from the ethical committee of our hospital .Total 32 patients who fulfill our inclusion criteria will be enrolled in our study. An inform consent will be taken from each patient. All cases will underwent surgical debridement and split thickness skin grafting. 
We will randomized select the patients into two groups with secondarily graft loss area less than 5cm2 by lottery method.
   In  Group A, we will apply Topical 1% Hydrocortisone (Fusidin-H cream) and Group B will be managed with Medicated Paraffin gauze (bactigrass) dressing. Steroid will be applied topically thinly smeared once daily with 4x4 inch gauze piece onto wound bed. We will observe and access the wound weekly with visual and photographic evaluation that will be done by two consultant plastic surgeons. During the dressing changes, routine digital photographs will be taken with the signed consent of the patient/guardian for the purposes of treatment, teaching and use in academic publications.
 Time to complete wound healing was noted and defined as the number of days from application of steroid until epithelialization. Percentage of total body surface area burned, sex, age, burn mechanism, complications (burning skin, dry skin, and itching, increased hair growth at application site) and presence of hyper granulation tissue were assessed and correlated with time to complete wound healing.</summary>
