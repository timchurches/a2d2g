  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the vitamin B6 treatment or the micronutrient formula. In both treatment groups they will be asked to take a total of eight capsules per day; four in the morning, four in the afternoon/evening with plenty of food and water. Treatment adherence will be monitored through the return of unused pills at the beginning of each month. The treatment phase will last for a total of three months.
Women assigned to the micronutrient formula will take a blend of vitamins and minerals in the supplement EMPowerplus Advanced. This formula will be provided by Truehope located in Raymond, Alberta, Canada. The dose and ingredients are as follows: Vitamin A (as retinyl palmitate), 3072 IU, Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) 320mg, Vitamin D (as cholecalciferol), 768 IU, Vitamin E (as d-alpha tocopheryl succinate) 192 IU, Thiamin (as thiamin mononitrate) 9.6mg, Riboflavin 7.2mg, Niacin (as niacinamide) 48mg, Vitamin B6 (as pyridoxine hydrochloride) 19.2mg, Folic acid  768mcg, Vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin) 480mcg, Biotin 576mcg, Pantothenic acid (as calcium pantothenate) 11.52mg, Calcium (as chelate) 704mg, Iron (as chelate) 7.328mg, Phosphorus (as chelate) 448mg, Iodine (from Pacific kelp) 108.8mcg, Magnesium (as chelate) 320mg, Zinc (as chelate) 25.6mg, Selenium (as chelate) 108.8mcg, Copper (as chelate) 3.84mg, Manganese (as chelate) 5.12mg, Chromium (as chelate) 332.8mcg, Molybdenum (as chelate) 76.8 mcg, Potassium (as chelate) 128mg, Choline bitartrate 288mg, DL-phenylalanine 192mg, Bioflavonoids 128mg, Inositol 96mg, L-Glutamine 96mg, L-Methionine 32mg, Grape seed extract 24mg, Gingko biloba leaf extract 19.2mg, Germanium sesquioxide 11.04mg, Boron (as chelate) 1.28mg, Vanadium (as chelate) 0.6368mg, and Nickel (as chelate) 15.68mcg. Other ingredients: capsule shell (gelatin, titanium dioxide) microcrystalline cellulose, glycine, citric acid, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, mineral wax. The values given are based on a consumption of eight capsules per day.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Vitamin B6
For those participants assigned to receive the vitamin B6 treatment, they will take a total of 80mg per day. The B6 treatment also contains riboflavin, a vitamin known to change the colour of urine. This ensures that the blind can be maintained as both groups will experience the same change in urine colour.</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be directed to an online website (bit.ly/UCnutritionresearch) to complete a screening questionnaire. Those who meet inclusion criteria will meet with the researcher in person to undertake a structured clinical mood interview (SCID-I). Those who are deemed free of any current mood disorder will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups; vitamin B6 or micronutrient formula. Researchers will also remain blind to the random allocation process. </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised using a randomisation table created by computer software (www.randomization.com). A total of four lists will be generated whereby the pharmacy will choose one list for the randomization. 
Provided that an individual meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet exclusion criteria, the person is allocated the next available number on the list. All pills (ie active ingredient or placebo) have been pre-packaged by the pharmacy who holds the randomization code. A sealed envelope is contained within each pill package only to be opened in an emergency (ie patient deteriorates significantly).

    <statisticalmethods>Determining the sample size is a challenge based on the diversity of studies that have thus far been conducted. We are aiming to recruit 40 participants per group, making a total of 80 participants. The final sample size was calculated via a sample size calculation where the best estimate of the effect size (ES) of vitamin B6 on psychiatric symptoms was 0.36, while EMP+ produced (in a conservative estimate) an ES of 0.64 on mood symptoms. Yet in open label trials the reported effect size is above 1. To detect a medium ES of 0.6 in this study, a total of 72 participants are needed. This number has been increased to 80, 40 per-group, to allow for attrition. We have chosen to detect a medium effect as we believe this will be clinically relevant for those women choosing to use natural supplements in treating PMS.  Based on the available data is it reasonable to expect to see a medium ES difference between the two treatments; currently estimates for mood in blinded micronutrient trials appears to be medium to large.
The changes from baseline to the end of treatment will be compared between randomized groups using repeated-measures ANCOVA, with the baseline level as the covariate. Change measures assessed at the end of treatment with no baseline will be compared using one-way ANOVA. The differences between treatment groups in these measures will be summarized as the mean differences and 95% confidence intervals generated from the ANCOVA/ANOVA models. Categorical outcomes will be compared between groups using Chi-square tests and will be described using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. All analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis that includes all randomized participants analyzed according to the group to which they were randomized. For those participants not completing the full treatment, data from their final assessment will be used to evaluate the change scores. Secondary analyses will be undertaken on all outcomes using the per-protocol (completers) analysis set. All tests will be two tailed and any p values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

The results of each case will also be looked at using Brinley plots to examine each participants baseline measures and then response as the treatment is introduced. 

Categorical outcomes (individual symptoms) will be compared between groups using chi-square tests with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

Effect size (ES) measures (Cohens D) will be calculated for each of the treatment conditions in comparison to baseline scores. A difference score between the two effects will then be calculated to see if one treatment is significantly better at the 0.05 level. 

Mediation analysis will be used to explore whether the change in PMS symptoms is mediated by change in stress sensitivity. Hierarchical linear regression will be employed to investigate base-line stress sensitivity and mood measures as possible moderators.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to look at the effect that a micronutrient formula (vitamins and minerals) has on premenstrual symptoms. The efficacy of this formula is to be compared to an already validated premenstrual syndrome (PMS) treatment, vitamin B6. Previous research has shown that combinations of nutrients, like those found in the micronutrient formula, can lower symptoms of stress, mood, and anxiety. Since these symptoms are often reported in PMS, it is hypothesised that the micronutrient formula will decrease overall symptoms, producing a greater measurable effect than by using vitamin B6 alone. </summary>
