  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of patients altering the time of first rise of breath hydrogen after lactulose to greater than or equal to 75 minutes and/or delaying the rise by 30 minutes from baseline at week 6.
This is assessed by hydrogen breath testing following before and every 15 minutes for 2-3 hours after the ingestion of 15 g lactulose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>week 6</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Double-blind phase: the change in time of the first rise in breath hydrogen after lactulose.
This is assessed by hydrogen breath testing following before and every 15 minutes for 2-3 hoursafter the ingestion of 15 g lactulose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Double-blind phase: Proportion of patients altering status of fructose breath test from that prior to entering the study.
This is assessed by hydrogen breath testing following before and every 20 minutes after the ingestion of 35 g lactulose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>double-blind phase: The change in gastric emptying time.
This is measured using C-13 acetic acid liquid gastric emptying by assessing breath C-13 every 15 minutes over 240 minutes via the Iris infrared isotope analyser and associated software.

      <outcome>Adverse events.
These will be assessed by diary entries and by direct questioning at 3 weekly visits for 18 weeks of the study; i.e., assessed by history taking and physical examination. Expected adverse events will be exacerbation of irritable bowel syndrome, nausea, and trivial events unrelated to the study medication</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current therapy for irritable bowel syndrome is suboptimal. Recent studies have suggested that small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may be present and that its treatment may have therapeutic benefit. The primary aim is to examine whether the effect of Yakult on a breath hydrogen test feature of bacterial overgorwoth that was seen in the pilot study is reproducible and specific to the study treatment, or just a chance observation. The secondary aims were to define the effect of Yakult on the rate at which the stomach empties, to compare the effects on gut symptoms of Yakult, placebo and Yakult withdrawal, and to examine the association of change in breath test patterns with changes in gut symptoms. In addition, because bacterial overgrowth is said to be causally associated with fructose malabsorption, another aim is to examine the effect of Yakult and the changes in breath test patterns with changes in fructose absorption and malabsorption.
The major study hypotheses are that Yakult corrects small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and that this correction is associated with improvement in symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome</summary>
