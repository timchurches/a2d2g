  <interventions>
    <interventions>Healthy volunteers will repeatedly receive intravenous 10 min infusions of amino acids labeled with stable isotopes to assess albumin and fibrinogen fractional synthesis rates by measuring the increase of labels in the two plasma proteins, respectively. Either d5-phenylalanine (d5-Phe) or d8-phenylalanine (d8-Phe) will be used together with unlabeled phenylalanine (Phe). All infusions will contain a combined amount of labeled and unlabeled phenylalanine of 45 mg/kg body weight dissolved in sterile water to a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Only the proportion between the two labels and Phe will vary between the occasions. No other fluid will be given. All subjects will serve as their own controls.

In protocol 1a, volunteers (n=5) will receive a 10 min infusion of unlabeled Phe with 10 atom percent excess (APE) d5-Phe on day 1. APE is defined as 100*tracer/(tracer+tracee) where unlabled Phe is the tracee. On the second occasion day 3 the 10 min infusion will consist of unlabeled Phe and 10 APE d8-Phe. The combined amount of labeled and unlabeled phenylalanine will be 45 mg/kg body weight on each occasion.

In protocol 1b, volunteers (n=5) will receive a 10 min infusion of unlabeled Phe and 10 APE d8-Phe on day 1. On the second occation day 3 the 10 min infusion will consist of unlabeled Phe and 10 APE d5-Phe. The combined amount of labeled and unlabeled phenylalanine will be 45 mg/kg body weight on each occasion.
In protocol 1, n=10 volunteers will be studied at day 1 and day 3, thus in total receive 2 infusions of mixed labeled and unlabeled phenylalanine.

In protocol 2, volunteers (n=6) will receive a 10 min infusion of unlabeled Phe mixed with 10 APE d5-Phe in the morning of day 1, and, after approximately five hours, on occasion 2 the 10 min infusion will consist of unlabeled Phe with 10 APE d8-Phe. Finally, on the third occasion day 8 the 10 min infusion will consist of unlabeled Phe with 20 APE d5-Phe. The combined amount of labeled and unlabeled phenylalanine will be 45 mg/kg body weight on each occasion. The volunteers in protocol 2 will be studied at day 1 in the morning, day 1 in the afternoon (after approximately 5 hrs), and on day 8, thus in total receive 3 short infusions. 

The size of the plasma pool will be determined by anthropometric calculation of plasma volume and plasma-albumin and plasma-fibrinogen, respectively, which makes determination of absolute synthesis rate possible.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Synthesis rates derived from d5-phenylalanine will be compared to those from d8-phenylalanine. Also repeatability with the same label will be assessed. Volunteers will serve as their own controls.</comparator>

      <outcome>albumin synthesis rate

Albumin fractional synthesis rate is assessed by the flooding technique (Ballmer et al Am J Physiol 1990; 259: E797-803). The incorporation of labeled phenylalanine in plasma albumin is assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after separating albumin from other plasma proteins. The precursor pool is assessed from the ratio of labeled to unlabeled phenylalanine in plasma. </outcome>

      <outcome>Fibrinogen synthesis rate

Fibrinogen fractional synthesis rate is assessed by the flooding technique (Ballmer et al Am J Physiol 1990; 259: E797-803).

    <statisticalmethods>With alfa 0.05 and beta 0.80, 8 subjects are necessary to detect a difference corresponding to effect size 1. In a study with repeated meassures of albumin synthesis rate after 6 hrs with the same isotopic label coefficient of variation was 12%. Then a 12% difference is detectable with 80% power by 8 subjects . 10 subjects are planned in protocol 1, and another 6 in protocol 2.
Data will presented as mean +/- sd or median (range) as approprite. When applicable Student´s t-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon and Friedmman´s ANOVA will be used.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma. It has several important functions, but the plasma concentration decreases in inflammation, trauma and in connection with major surgery. There is a wide spread use of intravenous albumin infusions in these situations, but the evidence of benefit is sparse. 
One reason for the lack of consensus is the lack of knowledge regarding albumin kinetics. Albumin synthesis can be investigated by stable isotope labeled amino acids and the flooding dose technique. Repeated measures is a valuable tool to assess the effect of interventions, and the quality of such measures would be improved by using different labels.
The aim of this investigation is to validate two different isotopically labeled amino acids for assessment of albumin synthesis rate. Also synthesis rates of other plasma proteins, such as fibrinogen, will be measured. By using different time intervals we will be able to optimize the design of planned studies on albumin kinetics in surgical and critically ill patients.
