  <interventions>
    <interventions>High definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD tDCS) + Proprioceptive training. 15 minutes of active anodal stimulation at 1.5mA over the motor cortex, directly followed by 30 minutes of proprioceptive and balance training. These sessions will be run 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The exercises were novel, developed by a team of specialist physiotherapists and based on daily household activities like reaching. The stimulation and exercises were delivered by the primary investigator, a PhD candidate in the Faculty of Health with a background in neuroscience. All sessions in this intervention are one-on-one and take place in a laboratory setting at the University of Canberra. The study runs for 8 weeks, with three sessions of stimulation/exercise per week, and one fortnightly baseline measures session. The wash out period is two weeks, this does not have to be longer due none of the treatments being continued across both sessions and progress can be compared to baseline measures taken before interventions. </interventions>
    <comparator>It was a cross over study, for another 4 weeks the participant received sham stimulation which followed the exact same process to have the electrode cap applied, The activation ramps up to 1.5mA and then immediately returns to baseline where it sits for the remainder of the 15mins, producing a very convincing sham condition. This is the immediately followed this with 30 minutes of handwriting practice and cognitive training. Each week a different set of sentences is provided to the participant to copy out onto handwriting paper, and they are given tips on how to improve their style (approx. 15 mins). They also complete cognitive training tasks on a computer using the Lumosity program, each session completing three games (approx. 15mins). </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study uses high definition, noninvasive, transcranial direct current stimulation in combination with exercises in balance and proprioception. We aim to improve performance on balance and proprioception tests in people with Parkinson's disease. As a result, we aim to see an increase in quality of life and a decrease in the risk of falls.
