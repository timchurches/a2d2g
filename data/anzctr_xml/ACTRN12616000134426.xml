  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adolescent participants with anorexia nervosa (AN) (age 12-19 years) will be recruited during their inpatient admission at the Childrens Hospital at Westmead and Westmead Hospital. They will be studied on 3 separate occasions during their nutritional rehabilitation, at baseline (within 5 days of admission), and one and two weeks post-baseline. Their results will be compared to age-matched healthy-weight adolescent control participants assessed on one occasion. On each study day, participants in both the AN and control groups will undergo indirect calorimetry to assess energy expenditure. After this, they will receive an oral test meal of 2 Weetbix with 150mL full cream milk, an apple and a 250 mL full cream milk drink (2002kJ, 65.16g CHO, 19.12g protein, 14.92g fat) , following which, GI hormones and appetite perceptions will be measured. Gastric emptying will also be measured on all study days.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>With regards to gastrointestinal function, we focused on two key parameters in our power calculations: upper gastric motor function (gastric emptying), which is known to respond very quickly to changes in energy intake, and PYY, to represent gastrointestinal hormone function, with research suggesting this is a major factor regulating energy intake. Currently, there is little research investigating the other related gastrointestinal hormones. Between-group comparisons of patients and controls on gastric emptying half-time and PYY concentrations at t = 120 minutes after nutrient ingestion were used in the power calculations. These were selected due to the availability of published data to estimate the magnitude of the differences expected and the amount of variation (estimated standard deviations) for both patients and controls, although the published literature does not provide adequate precedents for the effects of refeeding on gastric hormone release and gastric emptying. As we hypothesise that these values will return to control/healthy levels after refeeding, we expect that our power calculations between patients and controls would allow such an effect from refeeding to be seen.

Calculations were based on between-group comparisons between patients and controls, using the formula for a two-sample t-test at 5% significance level and 80% power. Using estimates of the expected variation in outcomes from previous studies, the detectable difference between groups was calculated for a range of sample sizes to assess the feasibility of the study. A sample size of 30 per group was shown to be adequately powered for both gastric emptying (difference in GE half time 28.3 min) and PYY concentration (difference in PYY at 120 min of 13.8 mmol/L). While there are no reference ranges for these outcome variables in the anorexic population, nor are they used as clinical markers, we believe, based on results in other patient and healthy populations, that these effect sizes are likely to be of clinical relevance.

Data will be analysed statistically using repeated measures ANOVAs to compare variables across time points on each study day and independent samples t-tests to compare the AN and healthy control groups. Repeated measures ANOVAs will also be used to compare variables in AN patients across the three study days in the refeeding period.  Post-hoc paired comparisons, corrected for multiple comparisons, will be performed if ANOVAs reveal significant effects.  Statistical significance will be accepted at P &lt; 0.05.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We propose a comprehensive investigation of the effects of a standardised, intensive refeeding regime on GI function in adolescent patients with restrictive AN, which will form the fundamental basis for subsequent acute investigative and longer-term intervention studies. The study aims to examine whether gastrointestinal (GI) hormone and appetite responses to, and gastric emptying of, a mixed-nutrient oral test meal in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients are modified in response to changes in nutrient exposure and energy expenditure occurring during the refeeding period. Thirty adolescent participants with AN (age 12-19 years) will be recruited during their inpatient admission at the Childrens Hospital at Westmead and Westmead Hospital. They will be studied on 3 separate occasions during their nutritional rehabilitation, and their results compared to thirty age-matched healthy-weight adolescent control participants assessed on one occasion. On each study day, participants in both the AN and control groups will undergo indirect calorimetry to assess energy expenditure. After this, they will receive an oral test meal, following which, GI hormones and appetite perceptions will be measured. Gastric emptying will also be measured on all study days.
Specific hypotheses: (1) In comparison with healthy, age-matched controls, adolescents with AN will have exaggerated anorexigenic gut hormone secretion and delayed gastric emptying in response to an intragastric mixed-nutrient test meal.  (2) With increased GI nutrient exposure during refeeding over 2 weeks, gut hormone concentrations, blood glucose and gastric emptying will return towards healthy levels. Outcome measures: Gut hormone concentrations, gastric emptying, appetite perceptions, blood glucose, GI symptoms.
Study implications: GI hormone, blood glucose and gastric emptying disturbances in AN will be comprehensively characterised before, during and after treatment, identifying possible GI mechanisms underlying the starvation condition and potential treatment interventions.
