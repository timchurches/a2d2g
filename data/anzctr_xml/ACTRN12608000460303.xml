  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Macrolide antibiotics have beneficial effects in chronic infections of the lung, although apparently not due to antibacterial effects. We suspect that erythromycin in a low dose will alter inflammation in the lungs of subjects with bronchiectasis, and reduce the frequency of lung infections.</summary>
