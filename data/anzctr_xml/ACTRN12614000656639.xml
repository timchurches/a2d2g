  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The favourable effect of endometrial biopsy in women undergoing embryo transfer or natural conception indicates that the biopsy somehow enhances the endometrial receptivity in a group of women whose endometrium is otherwise not adequately receptive to an implanting embryo. As it is likely that poor endometrial receptivity is at least partly contributing to the experienced infertility in cases of unexplained infertility, endometrial biopsy may also be beneficial for these couples. 

Unfortunately, research concerning the utility of endometrial biopsy in couples with unexplained infertility who are trying to conceive spontaneously is sparse. 
We plan to address the current limitations by conducting a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, of endometrial biopsy in couples with unexplained infertility.
