  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of Participants With a Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) at Follow-up Week 12 (SVR12) - SVR12, defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), target detected (TD) or target not detected (TND) at follow-up Week 12. SVR12 imputation was based on Next Value Carried Backwards (NVCB) approach. HCV RNA measurements were excluded after the start of non-study anti-HCV medication on treatment or during follow-up.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of Participants With a Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) at Follow-up Week 4 (SVR4) and Follow-up Week 24 (SVR24) - SVR4, defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), target detected (TD) or target not detected (TND) at follow-up Week 4. SVR24, defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), target detected (TD) or target not detected (TND) at follow-up Week 24. SVR4 imputation was based on Next Value Carried Backwards (NVCB) approach. SVR24 imputation was based on missing being treated as non-responder. HCV RNA measurements were excluded after the start of non-study anti-HCV medication on treatment or during follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up Weeks 4 and 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Death, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events (AEs), Grade 3 or Grade 4 (Grade 3/4) AEs, and Grade 3/4 Laboratory Abnormalities - Serious adverse event (SAE) defined: a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Adverse event (AE) defined: any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. The degree of the adverse event or laboratory abnormality are evaluated by grades: Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death. Grading as per using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) Version 3.0 criteria.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if the combination of Daclatasvir, Sofosbuvir and
      Ribavirin for 12 or 16 weeks is safe and effective in the treatment of Genotype 3 Chronic
      Hepatitis C (HCV) in patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis. Patients in
      this study may have already been treated prior for HCV or may have never received treatment
      for their HCV.</summary>
