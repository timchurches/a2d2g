    <studytitle>Does methylnaltrexone reduce the incidence and severity of itch following spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal morphine in women undergoing caesarean delivery.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In women receiving spinal anaesthesia including intrathecal morphine for caesarean section, is subcutaneous methylnaltrexone 12 mg given at the end of surgery more effective than placebo in reducing 24 hour pruritus severity?</scientifictitle>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The severity of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus among woman delivering by elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, as determined by the mean maximum pruritus score in the first 24 hours after surgery and the 0-24 hour area under the curve for pruritus scores. Pruritus will be scored on a 0-10 verbal numerical rating scale = VNRS</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Women will be recruited at antenatal pre-admission caesarean section clinics and from the maternal-fetal assessment unit or ward, as appropriate. All must have consented to spinal anaesthesia, including intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia. The study intervention will occur post-delivery, at the end of surgery and the study will be completed at 24 hours postoperatively.
Group allocation will occur after delivery, by means of a sealed opaque envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomised, stratified for centre, in a 1:1 ratio by the hospital Pharmacy department using a computer generated random number sequence.</sequence>
