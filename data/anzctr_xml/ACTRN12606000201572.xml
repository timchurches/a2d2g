    <summary>Research Aim

The manufacturers current recommendation for the rate of administration of tramadol is over 2-3 minutes. In spite of this, many clinicians administer tramadol as a slow infusion as they believe that this reduces the incidence of some side effects including nausea and vomiting. The aim of this research is to determine whether there is a different incidence of nausea and vomiting when tramadol is administered slowly or rapidly. 

Study Outline

Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age presenting for significant non-abdominal surgery at the Royal Melbourne Hospital will be studied. These patients are at significant risk of post-operative pain and often require continuing post-operative analgesia.
After informed consent, patients will undergo their respective surgical operations under a standardised general anaesthetic. All patients will receive intravenous morphine for intra-operative analgesia and morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for post-operative analgesia.
Patients will be randomised to receive tramadol or placebo, immediately postoperatively, in the post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) in one of the following ways:
1)Intravenous tramadol (2.5 mg/kg) fast (conventional therapy over 120 seconds as per manufacturers product information) 
2)Intravenous tramadol (2.5 mg/kg) slowly (over 30 minutes)
3)Placebo (no tramadol)
Postoperatively, when the patient is fully awake and able to speak, they will be asked to rate their pain on a 100mm visual analogue scale (0 = No pain to 100mm = Worst imaginable pain). Patients will only receive tramadol or placebo in one of the above ways if they rate their pain as greater than 30mm on a 100mm visual analogue scale. Otherwise they will be excluded from the trial. At this point in the PACU, they will receive their trial drug (tramadol or placebo) as planned.
Patients will be reviewed at 0 (before administration of tramadol/ placebo), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hours after the administration of tramadol or placebo is commenced. Recordings for nausea, using a visual analogue scale (0 = No nausea to 100mm = Worst imaginable nausea), and episodes of vomiting will be the main clinical outcomes measured. Additionally, PCA usage, pain scores and patient satisfaction will be recorded.

4. Study Endpoints
Primary End Point: Comparative peak change from baseline in nausea visual analogue score (VAS) scores between fast, slow and placebo tramadol administration groups.
Secondary End Points: Comparative vomiting frequencies, morphine PCA usage, pain scores, duration spent in PACU and patient satisfaction scores between fast, slow and placebo tramadol administration groups.

Research Plan
This trial will be conducted in the operating theatres and surgical wards of the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Ethics committee approval will be obtained prior to the commencement of the trial.
Patients presenting for the trial who meet the eligibility criteria will be approached and written informed consent will be obtained. This will occur in the pre-admission clinic or day of surgery admission area of the Royal Melbourne Hospital.

Randomisation and Blinding
A three-arm prospective randomised double-blind controlled trial will be undertaken.
All eligible patients will be randomised preoperatively to one of three groups by using sealed opaque envelopes containing the information regarding whether the patient is to receive tramadol fast or slow or receive placebo. Envelopes will not be opened until after consent is obtained. Randomisation will be performed using a computer-generated list. All patients will be blinded to which group they are in and all will receive a loading dose of 2.5 mg/kg of tramadol (or placebo) intravenously as this has been shown to be the optimum amount required for maximal efficacy with minimal side effects. The study drugs will be prepared by a research nurse/ pain nurse and labelled Fast or Slow. One or both of theses study drugs will be placebo but the identity will be unknown to the patient, PACU nurse looking after that patient and investigator (Dr Sud Agarwal, Dr Malcolm Hogg or AMS Medical Student) who will be collecting data from that patient. The PACU nurse will administer the drugs blind to the identity of the drugs. The identity of the Fast and Slow study drugs will be recorded by the research nurse/ pain nurse and will not be made available to the investigators.
Fast group  will receive 2.5 mg/kg tramadol (made to 10 ml with addition of saline) intravenously over 2 minutes and 10 ml saline via a syringe driver over 30 minutes.
Slow group  will receive 10 ml saline over 2 minutes and 2.5 mg/kg tramadol (made to 10 ml with addition of saline) intravenously via a syringe driver over 30 minutes.
Placebo group  will receive 10 ml saline over 2 minutes and 10 ml saline via syringe driver over 30 minutes.
Postoperative assessment regarding nausea, pain, vomiting frequency, patient satisfaction and morphine PCA usage will be performed by a second blinded second investigator.
Sample Size Calculation
The sample size of 150 patients is calculated based on reported peak nausea visual analogue scores in response to 2.5 mg/kg of intravenous tramadol:
? = 0.05
? = 0.2
? = 0.3 (a 3 out of 10 difference on a ten point Visual Analogue Score)
? = 0.5 (Standard Deviation)15
Calculates sample size required in each group as 44 for p&lt;0.05. Sample sizes of 50 for each group have been chosen to allow for patients dropping out or being excluded after recruitment. This sample size was calculated using the UCLA statistical sample size calculator.
Nausea Score Estimation
Nausea after the administration of tramadol will be obtained at described time intervals (t = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hours) using a 100-mm visual analogue scale. All participants will be asked to make a mark on a continuous scale to indicate the level of nausea experienced.
Procedure
Operative Period
All patients will be given a standardised general anaesthetic for their surgical procedure with patient and equipment monitoring implemented as per the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists guidelines. A standard and widely practiced anaesthetic technique will be utilised. This will include midazolam, fentanyl, propofol (and atracurium for relaxant general anaesthesia) for induction followed by maintenance with sevoflurane in 50% oxygen in nitrogen. All patients who had relaxant general anaesthesia will receive neostigmine and glycopyrrolate reversal. Inhaled anaesthetic concentration will be at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist. Morphine, paracetamol or NSAIDs may be utilised for intraoperative analgesia. Wound infiltration with local anaesthetics by surgeons at any time of the procedure is permissible, but the use of tramadol or any antiemetics are not permitted intraoperatively or postoperatively unless it is being administered as part of this trial or as rescue anti-emesis.
Post-operative Period
In the PACU immediately following the end of their operation, all patients will receive tramadol or placebo as per the directions for the group they have been randomised to (see above under Randomisation and Blinding).
Patients in all groups will be asked to describe their nausea, pain, dizziness and patient satisfaction score on four separate 100-mm visual analogue scales (VAS) at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hours after commencement of administration of tramadol. In addition, PCA usage and any episodes of vomiting will be recorded for all patients within the three hour period.
Rescue Analgesia
Any patient who continues to have inadequate analgesia even after receiving paracetamol, NSAIDs and morphine via PCA will be reviewed by the pain registrar on call at that time and will be given morphine intravenous boluses until their pain is relieved.
Rescue Anti-emesis'
Any patient who continues to experience significant nausea (greater than 70 mm on VAS) or who vomits will be reviewed by the pain registrar on call at that time and will be offered antiemetics: 10-20 mg metoclopramide and/ or 0.02 mg/kg droperidol and/ or 4-8 mg dexamethasone and/or ondansetron 4-8 mg until their nausea/ vomiting is relieved.
Data Collection
Pre-operative: age, sex, height, weight, ASA physical status, operation, smoking status, menstrual status (if applicable), history of motion sickness, history of PONV. These (along with duration of anaesthesia) include all the factors cited by Apfel as prospective predictors which allow PONV risk scoring16.
Intra-operative: IV morphine total dose, fentanyl/ paracetamol/ NSAID/ alpha-2 agonist usage, estimated average sevoflurane expired end-tidal concentration, estimated average inspired oxygen concentration, use of local anaesthetic wound infiltration, any surgical complications, total surgical time, duration of anaesthesia.
Post-operatively: (in theatre PACU and hospital wards): analgesic requirements (IV and oral opioids, paracetamol, NSAIDS), pain scores, requirement for any rescue analgesia, nausea VAS, pain VAS, dizziness VAS, patient satisfaction VAS, total morphine PCA usage, requirement for any rescue anti-emesis, number of episodes (if any) of vomiting and duration of stay in PACU. Nausea, pain, dizziness and satisfaction data will be collected by a second blinded investigator who will ask all patients to mark a standard 100 mm VAS. 
Any clinically significant event during the course of the study period (3 h) (such as seizures, rash etc) will be recorded.
A Log will be kept including the number of eligible patients, refusals, recruited and randomised patients, dropouts and completed participants.</summary>
