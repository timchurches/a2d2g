  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention  group (20 hour protocol)  participants will receive prescribed amounts of enteral nutrition following a revised protocol that includes compensatory increase in feeding rates  over a set period of 20 hours a day and then fasted for a set period of  4-hours each day.
The prescribed amount given is based on the individual's  nutritional assessment and estimation of of the energy and protein requirements . These requirements are calculated using predictive equations as is the common practice by dietitians
The overall duration is a maximum of 12 days or till patient is discharged from the ICU whichever is sooner.

The 20 hour feeding protocol (Intervention group) involves running the prescribed amount for each patient as a continuous infusion for 20 hours per day followed by 4 hours of fasting  Example : If a patient's requirements are 1800 calories and the amount prescribed is 1800 ml formula over 24 hours , the infusion will run at a rate of 90 ml /hour (90 ml x 20  = 1800 ml per day)</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group (24 hour protocol) participants will receive prescribed amounts of enteral nutrition following the current 24 hour feeding protocol.
The 24 hour feeding protocol (Control group) involves running the prescribed amount for each patient as a continuous infusion for 24 hours per day . Example : If a patient's requirements are 1800 calories and the amount prescribed is 1800 ml formula over 24 hours , the infusion will run at a rate of 75 ml /hour (75 ml x 24 = 1800 ml per day).

      <outcome>Acceptability and  safety of the revised feeding protocol
Staff satisfaction survey 
A questionnaire will be distributed to the nurses, doctors and dietitians The secondary outcome of this pilot study is the feasibility of the new feeding protocol as judged by a questionnaire that evaluates their opinion of its safety and acceptability. The acceptability of each the novel parts of the feeding protocol and the overall protocol uses a scale where 1 = totally unacceptable and 10 = totally acceptable. This evaluation questionnaire will be  administered to all bedside nurse involved in caring for study patients at the end of each nursing shift during the study period  and to all medical staff. A minmum of 50 %  response rate is anticipated.  

Safety endpoints that will be measured are 1. Episodes of reflux, regurgitation or vomiting documented on nursing charts Frequency of diarrhoea (Stools &gt; 300ml liquid per 24 hours), Episodes of high gastric residual volumes ( &gt; 250 ml per 4 hours Ventilator associated pneumonia documented by medical staff, patient positioning daily: measured by researcher daily on rounds, 
 Management of risk factors or events

All critically ill patients are at risk of developing the above signs and symptoms while on Enteral Nutrition . ICU  Standard protocols are followed to manage these conditions for ALL patients. The same protocols will be followed for the study patients. 

In addition, two physicians independently will review the charts of all enrolled patients to determine whether episodes of vomiting, regurgitation, macroaspiration (visually noted gastric secretions when suctioning the endotracheal tube), and ventilator-associated pneumonia had occurred. Pneumonia is defined using a definition and process that is standard practice for the ICU doctors .This would determine if there were any undetected serious adverse events related to the nutritional management of the patient and whether the  prescription hourly target rates  was appropriate and this will be checked off on the data forms. At the discretion of the two physicians and /or the medical team the patient may be discontinued from the study</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to is to evaluate and assess a revised enteral nutrition protocol to deliver prescribed volumes of nutritional formula through a cyclic (also known as intermittent) 20-hour continuous method .The current enteral nutrition protocol is based on a  24- hour continuous cycle to deliver prescribed volumes of  formula. However, various planned processes and events (such as fasting for endotracheal extubation) often interrupt a 24 hour continuous cycle of feeding potentially resulting in sub-optimal levels of nutrition delivery.  Hence, the 20 hour continuous method (with a higher rate of feeding per hour) has been developed so that adequate nutrition can be delivered and planned interruptions can take place within the 4 hour non-feeding gap period. a minimum of forty patients will be enrolled from the  Monash Medical Centre Intensive Care Unit and will be randomly allocated to a control group ( current 24 hour enteral feeding protocol) or an intervention group (revised 20 hour enteral feeding protocol).  Data relating to nutritional and clinical outcomes will be collected for up to 12 days for each participant. The hypotheses is that the new protocol will safely and effectively improve current levels of nutritional adequacy from 48 % (based on local audit) closer to the optimal levels recommended in the literature ( &gt; 80 %) 
We postulate that this increased provision of calories and protein may translate into improved nutritional and clinical outcomes, but the current study is not powered to demonstrate such a difference.</summary>
