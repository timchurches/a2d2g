    <concealment>Participants will be randomised 1:1 to one of the two arms of the study.   Randomisation will be stratified by:
1)	History of one or more first degree relatives (biological parent or sibling) with parent-reported clinician diagnosed eczema, food allergy, asthma, hay fever or anaphylaxis.
2)	Parental report of maternal receipt of pertussis booster vaccine during pregnancy

On the day of first scheduled vaccination at age 6 to 11 weeks (42 to 83 days), an unblinded pharmacist or research nurse will record the participant’s identifiers and a sequential study number and then obtain the allocation from one of four sets of sequentially numbered opaque envelopes corresponding to each strata defined above. The allocation sequence will be generated and retained by an independent statistician. The allocation log will be maintained by the study pharmacist in a locked cupboard.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rise in atopy, particularly food allergy, over recent decades in Australia has coincided with a change from the routine use of Whole cell pertussis vaccination (DTwP) to Acellular pertussis vaccination (DTaP). These events may be causally related via the differential modulation of the Th1 and Th2 arms of the immune system by the different vaccines. A single first dose of DTwP followed by two doses of DTaP in the infant vaccination schedule may allow a more balanced immune response, and protection from subsequent atopy. Although a full DTwP vaccine course is more reactogenic than a full DTaP vaccine course, this may not be true for a single dose of DTwP given in early infancy. Furthermore, substitution of the first DTaP dose with DTwP may significantly reduce the frequency of extensive limb swelling observed after the 18 month and 4 year old booster doses of DTaP. An assessment of the immune responses of contemporary Australian infants primed with either a mixed DTwP/DTaP or the current DTaP-only schedule is warranted.

Infants will receive either a combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-whole cell Pertussis, Hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (DTwP-HepB-Hib) OR a combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis, Hepatitis B, Inactivated Poliovirus and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (DTaP-HepB-IPV-Hib) as their first vaccine dose at 6-8 weeks of age as part of the infant vaccine schedule.  Infants receiving DTwP-HepB-Hib at 2 months will receive combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis, Inactivated Poliovirus. (DTPa-IPV) at 18 months of age instead of the usually scheduled Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis, to complete the required 3 doses of IPV in the schedule.  Other than the described vaccines, infants will receive the standard Australian Immunisation Schedule. The dose and route of vaccination will be consistent with the manufacturers instruction. 

The primary objective of the study is to assess the allergy protective benefits of the addition of DTwP into the infant schedule.  Infants will be assessed for development of allergic disease and atopic sensitisation. The study will also assess the reactogenicity profile of the whole cell vaccine.  If DTwP is found to be acceptable to parents and protective against the development of atopic disease this could have profound implications for vaccine policy in Australia and around the world.</summary>
