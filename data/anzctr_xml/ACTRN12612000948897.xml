    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to receive up to 12 weeks of weekly individual therapy for earthquake-related PTSD, either metacognitive therapy(MCT) or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).  Therapy sessions last up to 1 hour. Clinical psychologists deliver both therapies and follow the work of Hamblen &amp; Gibson (2005) and of Wells (2009).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Since the September 4 2010 earthquake, the wider Christchurch community has been exposed to unpredictable strong aftershocks and this pattern is predicted to continue for some time. Many people have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD is effective but does not work for everyone. Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is a promising brief therapy for PTSD but it has yet to be trialled against CBT for PTSD. In CBT, the focus is on changing specific unhelpful thoughts whereas MCT addresses problematic thinking styles such as worry that maintain PTSD. Rapid effective treatments are needed, given projected demands for treatment. This study aims to 1) establish whether MCT is superior to CBT in reducing PTSD symptoms, physiological hyperarousal and behavioural avoidance and 2) to establish whether continuing aftershocks reduce treatment efficacy. The language of participants' accounts of their earthquake experiences will be analysed to better understand how the way they think about their experience may change after therapy, particularly in relation to levels of dissociative symptoms.  In this pilot study, thirty adults with PTSD will be randomised to receive 12 weeks of outpatient MCT or CBT with follow-up at 6 months.</summary>
