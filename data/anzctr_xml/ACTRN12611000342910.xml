  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients were subjected to general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation with continuous monitoring arterial blood gasses , blood pressure,  electrocardiography , pulse oximetry , intra operative blood loss and record to tracheostomy tube size. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) was done using the Griggs guide wire dilating forceps technique (through trans cervical insertion and the trachea cannulated with 14-G cannula between the second, or the second and third tracheal rings and J guide wire inserted followed by blunt dilation.This procedure was successful n the PDT group and was performed as a single intervention for each patient with a mean operative time of 20 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional surgical tracheostomy (CST) patients group subjected to horizontal skin incision midway between the sternal notch and cricoid cartilage, , revealing the thyroid isthmus and then the cricoid cartilage identified , cricoid hook used to pull the trachea superiorly finally insert suitable tracheostomy tube. This procedure was successful in all patients and was performed as a single intervention for each patient with a mean operative time of 19.3 minutes</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tracheostomy is  usually performed in patients with difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation or some catastrophic neurologic insult.  Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is increasingly popular and has gained widespread acceptance in many ICU and trauma centers as a viable alternative approach.
64 critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unite subjected to tracheostomy  and randomly divided into two groups; percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) and conventional surgical tracheostomy (CST).Operations were performed by the surgical team in the university hospital, department of Otolaryngology, Faculty of medicine, Suez Canal University, Egypt from 1/2/2007 to 31/8/2010.
  The aim was  to compare the outcome of both  techniques regarding mortality rate, intraoperative bleeding,the tracheostomy tube size and wound infection.
Conclusion:    PDT technique is similar effective and safe as CST with low incidence of post operative complication.</summary>
