  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - UX007 (triheptanoin)
Treatment: drugs - Placebo Oil

Experimental: UX007 (triheptanoin) - Oral liquid administered with food 4 times a day to make up to 35% of total caloric intake. 52 weeks.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo Oil - Placebo oil matching color and appearance of UX007.


Treatment: drugs: UX007 (triheptanoin)
Triheptanoin is a triglyceride composed of three heptanoate (C7 fatty acid) esters. UX007 is manufactured by chemical synthesis from glycerol and heptanoic acid. UX007 (triheptanoin) is a liquid, intended for oral (PO) administration.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo Oil
