    <inclusivecriteria>-  Age &gt; 45 years

          -  First stroke resulting in hemiplegia

          -  At least 4-months post stroke

          -  Residing at home or community-based (non-institutionalized) living environment

          -  Self selected gait velocity between 0.42 m/s to 0.80 m/s

          -  No longer receiving physiotherapy.

          -  Adequate comprehension of instructions and perceptual abilities (assessed by stroke
             clinician during medical screening), no significant musculotendinous or bony
             restrictions of the affected limb, nor any serious chronic disease independently
             causing significant disability or profound atrophy of the affected limb will comprise
             further indications to participation</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subjects will be excluded if they have significant cardiac disease, symptom limiting
             peripheral vascular disease, or any of the exclusion criteria contraindicating
             moderate exercise as outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines
             for cardiac disease rehabilitation or for frail and elderly adults. The initial
             symptom-limited/maximal aerobic assessment will serve as the screening test for
             contraindications to further exercise.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the efficacy of aerobic exercise and progressive resistance
      training (PRT), singularly and combined, on changes in walking endurance for
      mildly-to-moderately affected chronic stroke patients. Specifically, we will determine the
      relative importance of training induced changes in muscle strength versus aerobic fitness on
      increases in gait velocity and 6-min walking distance, and assess the concomitant functional
      and psychosocial impact of increased muscle strength, aerobic fitness and improved gait. This
      longitudinal study will be conducted as a double blinded factorial randomized controlled
      trial of exercise training for chronic stroke patients.</summary>
