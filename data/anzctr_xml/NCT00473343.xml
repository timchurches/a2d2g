  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the selective destruction of abnormal cells through light
      activation of a photosensitiser in the presence of oxygen. These cells accumulate more
      photosensitiser than normal cells. The photosensitiser generates reactive oxygen species upon
      illumination.

      For skin diseases, there has been an increasing interest in using precursors of the
      endogenous photoactive porphyrins. The most commonly used precursors have been
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its derivatives. The present test drug, Metvix®, contains the
      methyl ester of ALA, which penetrates the lesions well and shows high lesion selectivity .

      BCC is a highly frequent skin malignancy, and accounts for approximately 75% of all
      non-melanoma skin cancers . It is the most common cancer in humans . Several
      non-pharmacological treatment modalities are used for BCC, including excision surgery,
      curettage and electrodesiccation, cryosurgery and more advanced modalities like radiation
      therapy, plastic surgery with reconstruction and Moh's surgery. The treatment used depends on
      the type, size, depth and localisation of the BCC lesion. Treatment options for BCC give good
      response rates in the majority of patients but are inadequate in a small group of patients
      defined as "high-risk" BCC.

      In this particular patient group, even a moderate complete response rate with good cosmetic
      results may be considered beneficial, since the number of patients who have to receive more
      advanced therapy with the possibility of high morbidity and poor cosmetic outcome will be
      reduced. Even a partial response is of clinical interest since the remaining tumour will
      require less extensive surgery. In the case of treatment failure, Metvix PDT does not
      interfere with the use of other treatment modalities.

      The variable "complete response" after one or two Metvix treatment cycles will be used as the
      basis for the justification of sample size. The following hypothesis will be tested:

      H0: Complete response rate of Metvix is less or equal to 65 % versus the alternative
      hypothesis HA: Complete response rate of Metvix is greater than 65 %</summary>
