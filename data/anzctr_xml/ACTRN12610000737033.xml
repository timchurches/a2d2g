  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nasogastric rehdydration is a standard treatment of mild to moderate dehydration in patients with gastroenteritis. A nasogastric tube is inserted through the nose into the stomach and oral rehydration fluid slowly infused, as clinically indicated.

Patients will be randomised to receive one of two nasogastric rehydration regimens:
1 - Rapid nasogastric rehydration (RNR) over 4 hours (100 ml/kg total); or
2 - Slow nasogastric rehydration (SNR) over 24 hours (replacement of 5-7% body weight over 24 hours)</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will be treated with standard or rapid nasogastric rehydration, as randomised. 

Standard nasogastric rehydration (SNR) involves replacement of the estimated fluid deficit (5-7% body weight) and maintenance requirements via a nasogastric tube over 24 hours in hospital.

Rapid nasogastric rehydration (SNR) involves replacement of 100mls/kg of oral rehydration solution via a nasogastric tube over 4 hours in the Emergency Department.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: To compare the efficacy of two nasogastric rehydration regimens in children with acute viral gastroenteritis.

Patients and methods: Children aged 6-72 months with acute viral gastroenteritis and moderate dehydration were recruited from Emergency Departments (ED) at two metropolitan pediatric teaching hospitals. After a clinical assessment of the degree of dehydration, patients were randomized to receive either standard nasogastric rehydration (SNR) over 24 hours in the
hospital ward, or rapid nasogastric rehydration (RNR) over 4 hours in the ED. Primary treatment failure was defined as weight loss of &gt;2%, compared to the admission weight. Secondary treatment failure was defined as the need for (re-)admission to hospital, insertion of an intravenous line for rehydration or inability to tolerate nasogastric rehydration. 

Results: Of 9331 children with acute gastroenteritis screened, 228 children were recruited and randomized (RNR 119 [52.2%], SNR 109 [47.8%]). Baseline characteristics for both groups were similar. All patients made a full recovery without severe adverse events. Primary failure rate at 24 hrs was similar for RNR 12.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 6.618.6) and SNR 8.3% (95%CI; 3.113.5); p=0.12. Secondary treatment failure was more common in SNR patients 44% (95% CI; 34.653.4) vs RNR 31.1% (95%CI; 22.038.6); p=0.03. Discharge from the ED after RNR failed in 28 (23.5%) patients, and 9 (7.5%) were re-admitted within 24 hrs. 

Conclusion: Primary treatment failure and clinical outcomes were similar for RNR and SNR. While RNR generally reduced need for hospitalization, discharge home from the ED failed in about one quarter of patients.</summary>
