  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to evaluate the success of two types of surgical procedures in the treatment of women with exertional or activity related urinary incontinence, commonly brought on by coughing and sneezing.  Modern advances involve development of minimally invasive procedures which saw the introduction of tension free vaginal tapes (TVT) and transobturator tape (e.g. Monarc) which provides good success rates when compared to the traditional operation, although with the advantage of a quicker recovery. 
Both the TVT and Monarc tape have a success rates in the order of 85-90% but do attract complications such as bleeding and bladder injury (4-9%) at the time of needle passage, difficulty in passing urine, urinary urgency (2.9%), mesh material making its way through to the vagina (1%) or thigh pain.  
The MiniArc sling is a procedure that places the tape in a different way. It is inserted through a small vaginal incision with no exit site and acts more as a hammock. It may have less complication than the Monarc slings because of its exitless design.
We aim to compare the success rate of MiniArc versus Monarc slings in treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with the hypothesis that MiniArc has at least the equivalent success rate</summary>
