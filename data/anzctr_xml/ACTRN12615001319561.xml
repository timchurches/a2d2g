  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Induction of anaesthesia and management of the airway is designed to prevent a child from suffering a lack of oxygen during the phase from consciousness to deep anaesthesia for a surgical procedure. Current practice provides a very high standard of induction of anaesthesia with a very low number of complications. However if anaesthesia needs to be achieved in emergency settings of in the presence of a complicated airway, the rate of complication rapidly increases. Particularly in emergency settings experienced operators are often not present. In these circumstances newer methods to reduce the risk of complications is desirable. This study investigates under very controlled circumstances in a tertiary childrens hospital a new concept to prolong the time to secure and improve airway management. The results and findings will then be tested in emergency settings in a follow up study.</summary>
