  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PEOPLE/SHOP is a prospective, longitudinal, multicentre cohort study conducted at 4 sites in New Zealand and 5 sites in Singapore. The aims are to:
1.	To determine proportion of patients with heart failure who have Heart Failure-Preserved Ejection Fraction (HF-PEF) according to newly proposed European Society of Cardiology criteria.
2.	To determine clinical outcome for patients with HF-PEF with patients with heart failure with low ejection fraction (HF-lowEF). 
3.	To determine clinical, echocardiographic and neurohormonal characteristics and predictors of outcome in HF-PEF compared to HF-lowEF. 

Subjects will be those patients with heart failure who are either admitted to hospital or seen in an out-patient clinic with a primary diagnosis of heart failure.  Clinical characteristics, echocardiographic and neurohormonal status will be documented at the time of enrolment.  Follow up visits will be undertaken at 6 weeks and 6 months, when clinical, quality of life, echocardiographic (6 months only) and neurohormonal status will be determined.  Clinical events will be followed for 2 years.</summary>
