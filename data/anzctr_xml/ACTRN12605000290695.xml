  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study design was a randomised, controlled trial. Repeated measures were taken at baseline, 3 points during treatment, and after a wash-out period at the end of the trial. The participants and the person doing the cognitive testing and data analysis were blinded to the treatment allocation, and the staff administering the treatment were blinded as to which of the treatments was the active. The trial will be carried out in parallel groups, with staggered starting times to allow adequate time for the cognitive testing.</summary>
