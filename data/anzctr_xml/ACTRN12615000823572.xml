  <interventions>
    <interventions>For each parent-neonate pair involved in the study, one skin-to-skin contact (SSC) between parent and neonate is being observed. 
This SSC can take place at any time during the neonate's admission to the NISC, whilst the neonate is aged between 28 weeks gestation to 34 weeks and 6 days gestation and is on oxygen support.
For the purpose of the study, the length of the SSC between parent and neonate is for the time the parent wishes and the neonate is stable for. The SSC will be observed by the Researchers just once for the purpose of the study.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Information on the parents gender and age and the neonates gender, gestational age, birth weight and respiratory support will be presented descriptively.  If continuous demographic data are normally distributed, they will be presented as the mean and standard deviation. If the continuous demographic data are non-normally distributed, they will be presented as the median and interquartile range. 

The association between the duration of skin-to-skin contact (SSC) and the study outcomes (for parents this is their HR and BP and for the neonate this is the percentage of the SSC that their HR, RR, oxygen saturation and temperature remain with the target range) will be explored using regression analyses. To obtain a trend of the data, a line graph will be used showing the mean of each measurement at each time point. 

The number of participants needed to achieve study objectives was determined to be 26. This was calculated by determining to find a correlation coefficient as high as 0.5 between the percentage of time the neonate is in the target range for their oxygen saturation and the duration of SSC, with an 80% power.

Thus, we will have a target of recruiting 35 parent-neonate pairs, acknowledging that due to the setting and nature of the study, low participant retention rates are likely. The study is taking place in a tertiary level NISC, and therefore neonates may be transferred to lower level NISCs when they are deemed to require less intensive care, resulting in a withdrawal rate of participants due to this transfer.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) between a parent and their baby is a commonly used intervention in Neonatal Intensive Special Care Units (NISC). It can help parents to feel more connected to their baby, and feel attached and bonded, as well as help them to feel like they are interacting with their newborn baby, and helping them to feel a little more like a "normal" parent. It also offers multiple benefits to the baby and is the closest for them to being back inside their mother's stomach, as they were before being born. They can hear their mother's heart beat and know their smell, so it can offer the baby comfort and warmth and feel love from their parent.

Over recent years, there has been an increased focus on the use of family centred-care interventions, such as SSC, being utilised in NISCs. 

However, there is an overall lack of studies conducted in Australia on the effect that the duration of the SSC between a parent and baby in a NISC setting has on physiological benefits to the baby, as well as physiological benefits to the parents (both mothers and fathers). 

The physiological measurements examined in the current study are the baby's heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation. The parent's physiological measurements examined in the current study are the parent's heart rate and blood pressure.

For the current study, it is hypothesized that the effects from the SSC for the baby will be increased when they have longer SSC with their parent. For the parents, it is hypothesized that there will be physiological benefits from the SSC with their baby, reflected as lower heart rate and blood pressure, and that these benefits will increase with a longer duration of SSC.
