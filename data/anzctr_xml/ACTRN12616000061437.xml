    <interventions>Those randomised to the experimental arm will receive 6 cycles of chemotherapy within a 4 weekly schedule as follows:
Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 as a 1-hour i.v. infusion on day 1,8 and 15 of each cycle followed by carboplatin 1-hour (or 30-min) i.v. infusion to an AUC of 5 on day 1, with the
initial dose calculated according to the Calvert formula (mg = [glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) + 25] x 5). The GFR used in the Calvert formula to calculate
AUC-based dosing should not exceed 125 ml/min.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the control arm will receive 8 cycles of chemotherapy within a 3 weekly schedule as follows:
Cisplatin 60 mg/m2 by iv infusion on day 1
5-Fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day - days 1-4 by continuous 24 hour iv infusion</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate best overall response rate (ORR) by 24 weeks post treatment in the cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) arm versus the carboplatin plus weekly paclitaxel arm</outcome>
      <timepoint>Best overall response rate is defined as the percentage of patients achieving confirmed partial or complete responses as per RECIST v1.1 by 24 weeks post treatment start in the intention to treat population</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival</outcome>
      <timepoint>PFS will be analysed once all patients have been followed up for at least 12 months post treatment start. This is calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of confirmed clinical/radiological progression or death from any cause. Patients who are lost to follow-up, withdraw from follow-up or alive and progression free will be censored at the date of last follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival </outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival will be analysed once all patients have been followed up for at least 12 months post treatment start. This is calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause. Patients, in whom no death is recorded, will be censored at the date they were last seen alive.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease control rate (DCR) (stable disease (SD) or better) at 12 and 24 weeks</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 and 24 weeks post treatment start. Disease control rate is defined as complete response, partial response or stable disease, and will be assessed in accordance with the RECIST criteria v1.1.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best overall response rate of non-irradiated lesions</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks post treatment start. Best overall response of non-irradiated lesions is defined as the percentage of patients achieving confirmed partial response or complete response as per RECIST v1.1 of non-irradiated sites of disease.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Anti-tumour activity and magnitude of response as captured by waterfall plot analyses. Anti-tumour activity will be assessed by imaging (CT or MRI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Anti-tumour activity and magnitude of response will be captured by waterfall plot analyses and indicate the percentage change in tumour size from baseline to the time of best response.  
Imaging (CT or MRI) will be performed at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of study treatment. In case the study treatment is continued for more than 24 weeks, tumour response will be assessed every 12 weeks. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity</outcome>
      <timepoint>Toxicity will be analysed once all patients have been followed up for at least 4 weeks post treatment completion. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years. Quality of Life will be evaluated using the EORTC QLQ C30 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. The functional and symptomatic scales and global health status from the QLQ C30 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be calculated as per EORTC and EuroQol guidelines, respectively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of conducting a multicentre, international study on squamous cell carcinoma of the anus and recruiting within a reasonable time frame. </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years. The study will be conducted in approximately 50 international centres. This secondary endpoint will be measured by (i) the proportion of centres that successfully recruit at least one patient and (ii) overall recruitment rate. We anticipate and would be able to confirm feasibility if 80% of the centres fully engaged with the study. The aim would be to recruit 80 patients in 36 months (10 by month 6, 20 by month 12, 50 by month 24 and 80 by month 36).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to compare two different chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of inoperable, locally recurrent, or metastatic anal cancer to demonstrate which is more effective and less toxic for patients with this disease. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with inoperable, locally recurrent or metastatic anal cancer. 
Study details: Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and 5-FU for 8 x 3 week cycles (about 24 weeks in total)  this is the most frequently prescribed chemotherapy for this condition. Participants in the other group will receive chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel in 6 x 4 week cycles (24 weeks in total). Both groups will receive their chemotherapy intravenously, i.e. given into a vein through a drip. All participants will be followed for up to 3 years post treatment in order to evaluate treatment response, toxicity and quality of life. This is the first time that a formal comparison of these chemotherapies has been performed.</summary>
