  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase II/III trial is studying the side effects and how well giving dasatinib together
      with combination chemotherapy works in treating young patients with newly diagnosed acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving dasatinib together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
