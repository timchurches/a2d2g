    <interventions>Assessment of weight and appetite changes in response to treatment for thyrotoxicosis

Participants will be weighed on digital scales and asked to complete and appetite questionnaire and assessment of appetite on a 100mm visual analogue scale whilst fasting. This will take about 10 minutes.
Each participant will complete the assessment session at enrolment, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients who are euthyroid with structural thyroid disease

Participants will be weighed on digital scales and asked to complete and appetite questionnaire and assessment of appetite on a 100mm visual analogue scale whilst fasting. This will take about 10 minutes. This group will also undergo assessments at 4 time points i.e. baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Thyrotoxicosis is a common endocrine disorder. During the time an individual is hyperthyroid with untreated thyrotoxicosis, despite an increase in appetite weight loss is commonly reported. Most patients with thyrotoxicosis are initially treated with anti-thyroid medications to achieve a euthyroid state. With restoration of normal thyroid levels, most patients not only regain the weight they had previously lost, but continue to gain additional weight over the subsequent several months. This has significant implications for adherence with medical therapy, particularly if the person perceives the extra weight gain to be a result of treatment.  
Understanding why patients with thyrotoxicosis continue to gain weight after the restoration of a euthyroid state and investigating the regulation of appetite control in these patients has the potential to contribute to our understanding of obesity and provide insight new approaches to treatment of the hyperthyroid state.  </summary>
