  <interventions>
    <interventions>The voluntaries were submitted to anthropometric evaluation constituted by height and weight measurements (utilizing a stadiometer and a calibrated balance). On the same day, and in just a single session the respiratory muscle strength was evaluated by measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure values, utilizing an aneroid manovacuometer. For this, each maneuver it was made at three repetitions (sustaining 1 seconds each repetition) with an interval of one minute between each repetition. The forced inspiratory maneuver was performed from residual volume and the forced expiratory maneuver was performed from total pulmonary capacity. The total time of the session was about 40 minutes.</interventions>

      <outcome>To compare the maximal respiratory pressure with the predicted values. After the maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures measurement were taken for each patient using an aneroid manovacuometer, these values were compared to the predicted values for the Brazilian population according to Neder et al. (1999). The predicted values were calculated for each patient utilizing the following formulas: MIP= -0.80 (age) + 119.7 + 0.48 (weight) and MEP = -0.81 (age) + 165.3.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After the subject did three repetitions of each maneuver with an interval of one minute between each repetition.</timepoint>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Clinically healthy and sedentary individuals. To classify the volunteers as sedentary was applied the Baecke questionnaire for epidemiological studies. The questionnaire included four questions about sport activities, eight about occupational activities and four about habitual leisure habits. According to the sum of scores of the questionnaire, the volunteers were classified as sedentary.
    The volunteers should have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 to 24.9Kg/m2 and 25.0 to 29.9Kg/m2 in accordance with the World Health Organization classifications for eutrophics and overweight, respectively.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Interestingly, studies have found link between the level of physical activity and respiratory muscle strength. Additionally, no study in Brazil proposed to evaluate the respiratory muscle strength in a sample of just healthy volunteers. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the values of the maximal respiratory muscle strength in a sample composed just sedentary healthy subjects and propose predictive equations for maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) in Brazilian sedentary healthy individuals.</summary>
