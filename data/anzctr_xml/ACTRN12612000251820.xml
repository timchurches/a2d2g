  <interventions>
    <interventions>After a screening visit, participants will be randomly allocated to either a dietary intervention group or a social support control condition. The intervention will consist of 3 weekly educational and counselling sessions, targeting diet, followed by 4 two-weekly booster sessions. In each of the sessions, background information as well as strategies to address dietary change and adherence will be presented. At the commencement, each participant will be provided with a sample meal plan and selected ingredients: oil, margarine and, nuts (e.g. walnuts as high in n-3 PUFA) for snacks (over the duration of the study). Examples of portions of fish and lean cuts of meat will also be provided. Sessions will be one on one, face to face and approximately 1 hour in length.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control condition will comprise a befriending protocol, operating using the same visit schedule and length as the intervention (i.e over a 12 week period). Befriending is the benchmark control condition in psychosocial research and consists of a therapist talking about neutral topics of interest to the client (music, sport etc.) that are exclusive of emotionally loaded topics, with the intention of keeping the client engaged and positive about the control intervention. Befriending has been demonstrated to be highly effective as a control condition as it is manualised, easy for the therapist to learn, and acceptable to participants.  The control group will also undergo physical assessments (weight, height etc.), blood tests, and complete Food Frequency Questionnaires, physical activity and smoking questionnaires, at the beginning and end of the intervention. In order to enhance recruitment, all individuals in the control condition will be offered the active intervention at the end of the study period (i.e. 3 months post-trial completion, after final assessment).</comparator>

    <inclusivecriteria>Aged 18 or over; have the capacity to consent to the study and to follow its instructions and procedures; fulfil the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode or Recurrent, as well as scoring 18 or over on the MADRS at the time of entry into the study. Antidepressant therapy is not an inclusion criterion; however, those on antidepressant therapy need to have been on the same treatment for at least two weeks prior to randomisation. Habitual diet quality will be assessed at screening using the validated Dietary Screening Tool (DST), and only those below the predetermined cutoff (less than 60= categorized as at risk) will be eligible for the study</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Patients will be recruited through various avenues, including
advertisements in local newspapers; flyers in medical waiting rooms, pharmacies and university campus; and direct contact with potential referral sources. Trial clinicians will contact all patients referred to the trial and screen for suitability through an initial telephone assessment and, where no obvious exclusion criteria are present, a subsequent face-to-face screening interview. Through this process, the trial clinicians will establish whether inclusion and exclusion criteria are satisfied, and perform the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either the active or control condition in addition to any established
pharmacotherapy for their major depressive episode. Allocation will be concealed from Investigators and data collectors and performed via a central randomisation process by computer</concealment>
