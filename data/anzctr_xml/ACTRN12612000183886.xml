  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study Drugs were dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) and Chloroquine (CQ). One group was treated with DP daily over 3 days, and another group was treated with ASMQ daily over 3 days for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In a separate group of patients with P. vivax malaria, CQ alone was used for treatment.

DP (oral tablet) with a dose of 4mg/kg for D and 20mg/kg for P daily for 3 days based on the weight group

ASMQ (oral tablet) with AS at a dose of 11-14 mg/kg and with MQ at a dose of 22-28 mg/kg daily based on the weight group
 
CQ (oral tablet) at 10mg/kg on Day1, 10mg/kg on Day2 and 5 mg/kg on Day3 based on the weight group</interventions>
    <comparator>No control and comparator group. This was a single group trial. In falciparum infected patients in Preah Vihear, DP was tested first and when it was finished ASMQ was tested for another group of patients, in Pailin and Rattanakiri only DP was tested. In a separate group of vivax infected patients, CQ was tested in the three sites.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated falciparum and vivax malaria. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Preah Vihear and only DP in Pailin and Rattanakiri provinces, and Chloroquine (CQ) in these three sites in Cambodia. The WHO 28-day and 42-day in vivo protocol was used. Patients with uncomplicated P.f or P.v malaria who met the study inclusion criteria were enrolled and treated on site with DP or ASMQ or CQ and monitored weekly for 28 days for P.v cases and 42 days for P.f cases. The follow-up consists of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these assessments, the patients were classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the follow-up period were used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis were used to distinguish between a true recrudescence or reinfection. The results of this study are being used to assist the Ministry of Health of Cambodia in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. f and P.v malaria.</summary>
