    <interventions>Multi-centre cluster randomised control trial of scripts versus no scripts for the quality of debrief of medical simulation within a paediatric resuscitation course.

The Recognition and Management of the Deteriorating Paediatric Patient (RMDPP) is a resuscitation course currently delivered at 30 sites in all 16 Hospital and Health Service districts of Queensland, the most decentralised state in Australia. Resuscitation skills are contextualised into 2 simulated scenarios using medical manikins, which run for about 10 minutes. These scenarios are immediately debriefed, which entails staff sitting down with participants and discussing the scenario to make sense of what occurred, what went well and what could be improved upon.  Many of the staff at regional sites have limited or no previous experience in debriefing simulated scenarios, which can impact on how effectively they meet the participants learning objectives. Each site is supported by staff from Children's Health Queensland, who undertake 2 annual visits. Feedback is provided for debriefing the scenarios in the form of a tool, which has been proven to be objective and reliable.[1]  This study specifically looks at whether the addition of a script for debriefing at each of the sites improves the score on the feedback tool for each debrief. The overall goal being to provide consistent training in paediatric resuscitation throughout Queensland to better patient outcomes, particularly in rural and remote locations, where resources are limited.

Intervention
The concept of the debriefing scripts was adapted from the ExPRESS trial and based on the debriefing theory known as advocacy-inquiry.[2-4] Our scripts were constructed from each of the scenarios learning objectives, with a mixture of both crisis resource management and technical issues, which reflect the course skills stations.  The scripts are delivered by the faculty at each RMDPP site across Queensland that are randomised to the intervention arm.  The duration of the scripted debriefing is around 10 minutes, as per a standard debrief.

Blinding
Blinding is an issue given the potential pattern recognition amongst assessors and is likely to be a limitation of this study. However, it is also probable that experienced debriefers will not stick to the script and may perform debriefs that are harder to recognise. It was noted that in the ExPRESS trial all debriefers held a clipboard that was purported to allow for blinding of the video reviewers to non-scripted versus scripted debriefing, but there was no mention in the study of its effectiveness.[2] This could be replicated in our study but may not mitigate this bias.  As this will be a real-world trial, adherence to the script will not be scrutinised.

As a multi-centre randomised controlled trial, sites currently delivering the RMDPP program will be clustered where SToRK staff routinely work, stratified into large and small centres and then randomised into intervention and control groups. Consent will be obtained to video all debriefs undertaken at moderation visits and have these videos scored using the OSAD tool by a common blinded assessor in a physically and temporally removed setting.[1] We will assess the between-arm difference using a mixed effects linear regression, with treatment arm included as a fixed effect and site as a random effect. This method will account for any within-site correlation in debrief outcomes. We will conduct pre-specified subgroup analyses to account for centre size and faculty debriefing experience.

    <sequence>Allocation in this study was by hospital. Randomisation occurred after hospitals were ranked according to the expected number of paediatric ED presentations annually. Using the ranked list hospitals were formed into pairs. A list of computer-generated random numbers was used to allocate either the intervention or control treatment to the first of each pair; the second in each pair was allocated the alternative treatment.

    <statisticalmethods>To identify a clinically important effect of the structured debriefs, with 80% power and alpha=0.05, we are required to conduct 46 scored debriefs in each treatment arm in our trial. To adjust for the clustered nature of the trial, we assume that the median number of faculty debriefing at each site is 4 and conservatively estimate the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.05. This gives a total number of 53 debrief scores in each treatment arm in order to detect a clinically important between-arm difference. We will assess the between-arm difference using a mixedeffects linear regression, with treatment arm included as a fixed effect and site as a random effect. This method will account for any within-site correlation in debrief outcomes. We will conduct pre-specified subgroup analyses to account for centre size and faculty debriefing experience.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paediatric patients are a vulnerable population who can deteriorate rapidly. Teaching medical and nursing staff across the state to recognise this in a learning environment that simulates this is crucial in maintaining their skills. Simulation and appropriate debriefing has been well-documented as an ideal tool to prepare for these real-life situations. It is currently unknown the impact that the introduction of a script will have on the quality of the debriefing, particularly by novice instructors. This proposal aims to improve the quality of the delivery of a paediatric resuscitation course that is delivered state-wide, including rural and remote centres, by introduction of pre-scripted debriefing. The ability to utilise an approved team with access to train clinicians each year will directly improve the care delivery at the bedside for children across the state.  Furthermore, the findings may be applicable to how large scale simulation courses are taught and delivered.</summary>
