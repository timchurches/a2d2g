  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Intervention group will involve whole body vibration as a component of usual care rehabilitation from entry into the rehabilitation wards to discharge (mean stay = 17 days). Usual care physiotherapy would occur in the morning and whole body vibration would be scheduled for the afternoon for patients randomised to whole body vibration. All Participants will receive usual inpatient physiotherapy care. whole body vibration will occur three times per week (with a minimum of 1-day rest in between) from onset of physiotherapy until discharge and consist of six static exercises targeting lower limb muscles. The frequency (load) of the vibrating platform will be at 30 to 50Hz and the amplitude will be progressively increased from 2 to 5 mm to allow the programme to be individually tailored to the participant and to ensure their heart rate remains below 85% age-predicted maximal heart rate. The intervention will begin wtih two sets of 30 seconds with a one minute rest in between repititions.  The exercise volume and intensity will be progressively increased according to the overload-principle. Participants will stand on the whole body vibration platform in a semi-squat position and hold on to the railings secured onto the platform. This semi-squat position maximises the force of contact with the platform.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients admitted to an older persons rehabilitation ward willb e screened for inclusion in the study. Eligible patients will be approached to determine their willingness to participate in the trial. If they agree then they will be visited by a research assistant and informed consent will be obtained. Following this the will be randomised. Randomisation will be ascertained by a randomisation schedule held at a distant site. (50 in intervention group and 50 control). This schedule will be compiled by someone with no involvement in the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project seeks to explore the effect of vibration training (VT) for increasing physical activity, muscle strength and functional ability among frail older admitted to Assessment, Treatment and Rehabilitation (A, T &amp; R) units.  VT involves a participant standing on a vibrating platform that generates vertical sinusoidal vibration at varying frequencies and amplitudes. This stimulates sensory receptors, which initiate muscle contractions comparable to the tonic vibration reflex. VT has been shown to be an effective alternative to resistance training  and has been shown to have an effect on isometric and dynamic leg muscle strength in young and old populations, including rest home residents. Frail older people are more prone to overloading of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system due to reduced resistance to stressors; we propose that VT may be safe and effective alternatives to resistance training for increasing ADL function in frail older people, after a period of hospitalisation and illness. The potential of this tool to allow an increased intensity of rehabilitation to frail older people with A, T &amp; R units is considerable.</summary>
