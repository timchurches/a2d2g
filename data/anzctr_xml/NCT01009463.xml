  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annual Rate of Moderate and Severe COPD Exacerbations Expressed as Least Square Mean - The annual rate of moderate and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations during the treatment (trt) period (per participant [par.] per year) was assessed. An exacerbation of COPD, is defined as the worsening of two or more major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, sputum purulence [color]) for at least two consecutive days; or the worsening of any one major symptom together with any one of the minor symptoms (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, increased cough, increased wheeze) for at least two consecutive days. The COPD exacerbation was categorized as mild, moderate and severe by the investigator. Mild: worsening symptoms of COPD that were self-managed by the par. without the use of oral corticosteroids or antibiotics; Moderate: worsening symptoms of COPD that required treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics; Severe: worsening symptoms of COPD that required treatment with in-patient hospitalization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the start of the double blinded study medication until Visit 11 (Week 52)/Early Withdrawal</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Occurrence of Moderate or Severe COPD Exacerbation - Time to first occurrence analyzed by using a Cox proportional hazards model with covariates of treatment, smoking status at screening (stratum), baseline disease severity (pre-dose Day 1 % predicted FEV1) and centre grouping. An exacerbation of COPD is defined as the worsening of two or more major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, sputum purulence [color]) for at least two consecutive days; or the worsening of any one major symptom together with any one of the minor symptoms (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, increased cough, increased wheeze) for at least two consecutive days. A moderate exacerbation is defined as worsening symptoms of COPD that required treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. A severe exacerbation is defined as worsening symptoms of COPD that required treatment with in-patient hospitalization. The number of participants with a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation while on treatment are presented.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the start of the double blind study medication until Visit 11 (Week 52)/Early Withdrawal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annual Rate of Exacerbations Requiring Systemic/Oral Corticosteroids Expressed as Least Square Mean - The annual rate of COPD exacerbations during the treatment period (per participant per year) that required systemic/oral corticosteroids was assessed. An exacerbation of COPD is defined as the worsening of two or more major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, sputum purulence [color]) for at least two consecutive days; or the worsening of any one major symptom together with any one of the minor symptom (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, increased cough, increased wheeze) for at least two consecutive days. The COPD exacerbation was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe by the investigator. Mild: worsening symptoms of COPD that were self-managed by the participant. Mild exacerbations were not associated with the use of oral corticosteroids or antibiotics. Moderate: worsening symptoms of COPD that required treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Severe: worsening symptoms of COPD that required treatment with in-patient hospitalization.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Trough FEV1 at Week 52 (Visit 11) - Pulmonary function was measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Trough FEV1 was defined as the 24-hour post-dose FEV1 assessment, which was obtained at each visit. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, smoking status at Screening (stratum), baseline (pre-dose Day 1), centre grouping, Week, Week by Baseline, and Week by treatment interactions.</outcome>

          -  Gender: Male or female subjects A female is eligible to enter and participate in the
             study if she is of: Non-child bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of
             becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically sterile).
             Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or
             bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Post-menopausal females are defined as being
             amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms. However in questionable cases, a blood
             sample with FSH &gt; 40MIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory. OR

        Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of
        the following acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and correctly (i.e., in
        accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the
        duration of the study - screening to follow-up contact):

             or

          -  Male partner is sterile (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to female
             subject entry into the study, and this male partner is the sole partner for that
             subject; or

          -  Implants of levonorgestral inserted for at least 1 month prior to the study medication
             administration but not beyond the third successive year following insertion; or

             administration and administered until the Follow-Up Phone Contact; or

          -  Oral contraceptive (combined or progestogen only) administered for at least one
             monthly cycle prior to study medication administration; or

             spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository); or

          -  An intrauterine device (IUD), inserted by a qualified physician, with published data
             showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year; or

          -  Estrogenic vaginal ring; or

          -  Percutaneous contraceptive patches

               -  Age: =40 years of age at Screening (Visit 1)

               -  COPD diagnosis: Subjects with a clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
                  following definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory
                  Society [Celli, 2004]: COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized
                  by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is
                  usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of
                  the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking.
                  Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic
                  consequences.

               -  Tobacco use: Subjects with a current or prior history of =10 pack-years of
                  cigarette smoking at Screening (Visit 1). Former smokers are defined as those who
                  have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe and/or
                  cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history. Number of pack years =
                  (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked

               -  Severity of Disease:

          -  Subject with a measured post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of =0.70 at Screening
             (Visit 1)

          -  Subjects with a measured post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1 &lt;70% of predicted normal
             values calculated (via centralized vendor equipment) using NHANES III reference
             equations [Hankinson, 1999] at Screening (Visit 1). Post-bronchodilator spirometry
             will be performed approximately 10-15 minutes after the subject has self-administered
             4 inhalations (i.e., total 400mcg) of albuterol/salbutamol via an MDI with a
             valved-holding chamber. The study provided central spirometry equipment will calculate
             the FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 percent predicted values.

               -  History of Exacerbations: A documented history (e.g., medical record
                  verification) of at least one COPD exacerbation in the 12 months prior to Visit 1
                  that required either oral corticosteroids, antibiotics and/or hospitalization.
                  Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless
                  the use was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as
                  increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence (color). Subject verbal
                  reports are not acceptable.</inclusivecriteria>
