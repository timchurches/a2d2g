  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Fisher and Paykel Humidifier (MR860)
Treatment: surgery - Standard insufflation

Experimental: 1 - Humidified and warmed carbon dioxide laparoscopic insufflation.

Placebo Comparator: 2 - Cold and dry carbon dioxide laparoscopic insufflation.


Treatment: surgery: Fisher and Paykel Humidifier (MR860)
Humidification to 98% relative humidity, and warming to 37 degrees C of laparoscopic insufflate. This will be done for the duration of the operation.

Treatment: surgery: Standard insufflation
No humidifier or warmer will be used (device switched off). This will deliver laparoscopic insufflate at 0% humidity and 20 degrees C.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Laparoscopic surgery allows surgeons to remove bowel via small incisions. To allow insertion
      of a camera and instruments, cold and dry gas is blown into the abdominal cavity. This
      project investigates the use of warmed, humidified gas in laparoscopic surgery. The
      hypothesis is that this will result in less damage to internal surfaces, and shorten recovery
      time. Previous studies have demonstrated positive outcomes in laparoscopic gallbladder
      operations. The investigators plan to study patients undergoing laparoscopic colon
      operations, as these operations are longer and the effect of humidification will be
      magnified. The investigators will enroll 74 patients: 37 will have the operation with cold
      dry gas, and 37 will have warm, humidified gas. The investigators will measure intraoperative
      heat loss, postoperative pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and time to return of bowel
      function.</summary>
