    <statisticalmethods>Calculation of sample size is limited by the lack of information on expected changes seen with SGLT2 treatment. Published algorithm by Pitcher at al suggests that for parallel study designs with before and after treatment cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scans appropriate sample sizes are 10-15 per treatment group for LV-ejection fraction and LV mass (power 80%, P-value 0.05). A 25% drop out rate has been incorporated in the sample size resulting in the final sample size of 20 participants in each group (total 40 participants).
Statistical methods used to examine differences between empagliflozin treatment status (categorical  YES or NO) and:
(i) baseline cardiac magnetic resonance imaging parameters, BNP and heart failure questionnaire score (all continuous variables) will be by unpaired t-test. This will indicate any evidence of pre-existing differences between the two treatment groups which will need to be considered as possible confounding or bias in the final analysis and report.
(ii) effect of confounding clinical factors of age, weight, blood pressure and glycemic control on baseline cardiac magnetic resonance imaging parameters, BNP and heart failure questionnaire score (all continuous variables) will be by ANCOVA. The impact of these clinical factors on the primary and secondary outcomes of the study is important for the formulation of future cardiac magnetic resonance imaging studies in studies of people with type 2 diabetes as well as in the interpretation of these findings in this study, particularly if pre-existing differences between the two treatment groups is identified in (i). 
(iii) change in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging parameters, BNP and heart failure questionnaire score (all continuous variables) will be by repeated ANOVA

Exploratory examination of effects of disease duration, age, renal function, weight, blood pressure, glycemic control and medication on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging parameters (all continuous variables) will be undertaken by Pearson r correlation for normally distributed data and by Spearman rank correlation for non-normally distributed data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are aiming to assess the effect of commencing empagliflozin (Jardiance), a medication used for blood glucose lowering on heart function and structure. This ultimately may lead to a better understanding of the effects of this class of medication on heart function.</summary>
