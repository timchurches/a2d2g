  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cerebral Palsy (CP) in a diplegia features type imposes a series of commitments including abnormal gait, which makes the acquisition of a gross motor activity less elaborate. A variety of techniques have been used for the treatment and improvement of motor performance of children with CP. Among them the stationary cycling and Hippotherapy, according to some literature promotes a better performance in the assessment of gross motor function, as measured according to the GMFM88 protocol (Gross Motor Function Measure). Considering that the mentioned benefits cited arose from studies using independent techniques, the purpose associated with this research was to verify their effectiveness in a combined application on three children with spastic diplegia, aged between 5 and 10 years. All classified in levels 1 and 2 of the GMFCS. The results from the statistical parameters of the GMFM test revealed an improvement in the scores of items for all subjects, being significant for the individual who was trained in conjunction compared to those who made the practice of hippotherapy and stationary cycling, respectively. In percentage terms the improvement in the total of the two dimensions studied by the GMFM were 19%, 8% and 4% for the individual treatment associated hippotherapy and stationary cycling, in that order. For the two other instruments also used goniometry to assess passive range of motion of lower limb and Ashworth scale quantifying the degree of spasticity of the lower limb muscles showed positive gains for all participants. Likely that these gains reflected upon the improvement observed in gross motor skills.</summary>
