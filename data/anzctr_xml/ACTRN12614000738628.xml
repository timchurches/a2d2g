  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention is primarily delivered by parents using an iPad based application for at least 20-30 minutes per day over 6 months. The intervention follows a early learning curriculum based on evidence-based practices about childhood development. The curriculum covers learning areas such as imitation skills; sensory discrimination; early joint attention skills; early receptive and expressive language skills. The curriculum is delivered in two ways 1) On-iPad activities are designed for children to complete, 2) Off-iPad activities are designed for parents to implement as part of Natural Environment Tasks during routine adaptive routines and play times with their child affected by autism.
This intervention can be used as a complement to any other community therapy a child might be receiving. Intervention adherence is monitored using an objective - electronic report upload system through the App and parent-report diaries of TOBY and other community therapy frequency and duration.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis including all participants with outcomes data available. The primary outcome- total score on the ATEC (range 0-180) at Time Point 1, 2 and 3 will be analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA method. Based on the study investigator's clinical judgment in managing children with autism, a score of 72 (50th centile) and a difference of 1SD=32 (30th-70th centile)) on the ATEC can represent clinically important improvement in autism symptoms. This intervention aims to find a moderate effect size of 0.5 with 80% power and two-sided alpha of 0.05. This will require a sample of 64 participants per treatment group. Allowing for a 10% drop-out rate, 70 participants will be required per treatment group, thus, the trial aims to recruit a total of 140 participants. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is now a substantial evidence base for a range of treatment strategies that target the core features of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Educational and behavioural interventions in particular have been the focus of several well-designed studies that have reported benefits of intense and sustained therapy. However, the effectiveness of these interventions depends on significant therapy time with trained clinicians, and come at considerable financial cost. Thus, a significant proportion of families are unable to access these therapies. Any activities that can improve the time- and cost-effectiveness of early intervention, and are proven to enhance the longer-term outcomes among individuals with ASD, will provide enormous benefit to the community. 
TOBY (Therapy Outcomes By You) Playpad, an iPad App developed by a team of computer scientists, psychologists and speech pathologists, is one such tool that may enable a more cost-effective way to provide therapy to children with ASD. The TOBY curriculum covers social skills, language, sensory discrimination, and cognitive skills, using Applied behavioural analysis (ABA) principles. While TOBY was not designed to replace one-on-one therapy with clinicians, it may provide an affordable (RRP: $27.99AUD) and easily accessible intervention method to complement existing therapy. Anecdotal reports suggest that TOBY may be an effective intervention method for children with ASD, and also a means of positively empowering parents by giving them greater control over their childs therapy. However TOBY is yet to be subjected to a randomized controlled trial. 

1.To determine the effectiveness of the TOBY Playpad app as a complement to early behavioural intervention using a multi-site single-blind, randomized controlled design. 
2.To examine whether the use of TOBY influences parental empowerment in relation to therapy.
