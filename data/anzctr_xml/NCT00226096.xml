  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether lowering high blood pressure levels after
      the start of a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain (intracerebral haemorrhage) will reduce
      the chances of a person dying or surviving with a long term disability. The study will be
      undertaken in two phases: a vanguard phase in 400 patients, to plan for a main phase in 2000
      patients.</summary>
