  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An abdominal distribution of fat is associated with the greatest heart disease risk, because
      commonly, several risk factors of metabolic origin (high blood pressure, unfavourable
      cholesterol profile, elevated blood sugar, impaired insulin action) cluster in these
      individuals. When this occurs the condition is called the 'metabolic syndrome' (MetS). The
      cause of the MetS is yet to be fully elucidated. Increased activity of the nervous system
      resulting in enhanced release of the stress hormone 'norepinephrine', may be one mechanism by
      which adverse cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae of the MetS might be mediated. Dietary
      weight loss, and exercise are first-line treatments for the MetS and provide an opportunity
      to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in this high risk
      group. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the effects of these lifestyle factors
      on the nervous system. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether active weight loss ('negative
      energy balance') or a stable lower weight (weight loss maintenance) is more important in
      modifying MetS components and nervous system activity. The aims of the proposed project are:

        1. To determine whether dietary weight loss in combination with aerobic exercise is more
           beneficial than dietary weight loss alone in reducing nervous system activity and
           improving metabolic and cardiovascular parameters in middle-aged men and women with
           abdominal obesity and the MetS.

        2. To determine whether weight loss maintenance four months after active weight loss is
           associated with a preservation of clinical benefits.

        3. To study biological determinants of successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance.</summary>
