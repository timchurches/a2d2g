    <interventions>Modified Meal Replacement Program (M-MRP):
The M-MRP group will alternate between MF (3 days/week; Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and the Standard-MRP (3 days/week; Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday), with one day where participants can eat freely, i.e. ad libitum (Saturday).  On the MF days, participants will consume 2 Impromy meal replacement shakes (1000kJ each) and a meal of free vegetables. Participants will follow this intervention for 16 weeks. Compliance will be collected in week 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 using 7-day checklists. Participants will be required to mark yes/no to consumption of the allocated number of meal replacements, snacks, evening meal and the approximate number of cups (to the nearest half cup) of free vegetables consumed. Intake on the ad libitum day will not be assessed. Qualified research dietitians will deliver face to face instructions and support at baseline, week 1 (via telephone) 2,4,6,8,10,12, and 14.
All participants will then be instructed by the study dietitians to follow an 8 week weight maintenance program based on the Live Well Plan (http://www.beefandlamb.com.au/Learn/Online_magazines/The_Live_Well_Plan).</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Meal Replacement Program (S-MRP):
The S-MRP includes a daily regimen of consuming  2-3 meal replacements (1000kJ each) for 2 meals, one balanced meal (~1500kJ) and prescribed snacks (500kJ). Participants will follow this intervention for 16 weeks. At study commencement individual participants estimated energy requirements will be calculated using the Schofield equation (using actual body weight), and multiplied by physical activity levels (PAL). This will be reduced by 30% to achieve energy restriction for weight loss. This energy level will then determine the number of meal replacements and allowable 500kJ snacks, and the energy content of the evening meal for the S-MRP dietary prescription. During this intervention all participants will have all meal replacement shakes/bars supplied at no cost, and the participants can choose the flavour and the time they are consumed.
At the end of week 16, all participants will then be instructed by the study dietitians to follow an 8 week weight maintenance program based on the Live Well Plan (http://www.beefandlamb.com.au/Learn/Online_magazines/The_Live_Well_Plan).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to test if participant retention in a commercially available meal replacement program (MRP; Impromy) is improved when the standard Impromy program is modified to enhance weight loss. Enhanced weight loss will be expected by incorporating 3 days per week of additional calorie restriction and one day of free eating per week, over 16 weeks.
Impromy is a weight loss program developed in partnership with CSIRO, and validated by CSIRO. It is commercially available through pharmacies across Australia. The current program consists of an energy restricted weight loss diet that includes meal replacements, personalised support from trained pharmacy assistants and a phone application for additional support and monitoring. 

The outcomes of this study will inform development of the Impromy program with the goal of improving program retention and therefore overall weight loss. 

A second aim of this study is to investigate how the two dietary protocols affect , or are affected by:
1.Biological indicators of health, including changes in body fat and muscle, blood glucose and cholesterol levels, blood pressure, nutrient status, gut health and the gut bacteria, genetic &amp; blood and buccal cell epigenetic markers and novel markers of metabolic health (including retinal vascularity). 
2.Eating behaviours and food craving, well being, psychological outcomes, perceived health, cognitive function and gut comfort.
