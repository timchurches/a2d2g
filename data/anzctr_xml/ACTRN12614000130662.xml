  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a two by three factorial design. The first factor is the degree to which participants have dementia and consists of 2 groups dementia or no dementia. The second factor is the essential oil treatment and consists of 3 groups: Lavendula Angustifolia, Melissa Officinallis and placebo Sunflower oil. The second factor is within group factor, as all participants will receive all three treatments separately during the study with a two week washout period between each treatment were velcro will be attached daily without essential oil or placebo. Velcro will remain in place for a minimum of 2 hours during treatment and washout before being removed.

Lavendula Angustifolia essential oil- 2 drops applied to 2.5x2cm cotton wadding attached to participants lapel with double sided Velcro daily for 2 weeks. 

Melissa Officinalis essential oil - 2 drops applied to 2.5x2cm cotton wadding attached to participants lapel with double sided Velcro daily for 2 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant agitation levels will be observed, recorded and monitored throughout this study, in conjunction with a nurse carer, using the Neuropyschiatric Inventory (NPI) and Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory(CMAI). 

The NPI and CMAI are validated and reliable measurement tools for agitation in this population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>NPI and CMAI data will be collected every two weeks coinciding with the conclusion of interventions and placebo treatments. NPI and CMAI data will also be collected at baseline and after every two week washout between treatment to give a new baseline.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant Quality of Life [QoL] will be measured throughout this study by have the participant complete the LEIPAD questionnaire. The LEIPAD survey measures psychosocial functions of cognitive functioning, depression/anxiety and life satisfaction. </outcome>
      <timepoint>LEIPAD data will be collected every two weeks coinciding with the conclusion of interventions and placebo treatments. LEIPAD data will also be collected at baseline and after every two week washout between treatment to give a new baseline.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Agitation levels and QoL measures will be compared respective and irrespective of treatment between the older adult participant groups of dementia and no dementia participants. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Data from the NPI, CMAI and LEIPAD QoL will be compared at the studies conclusion when all participant data has been collected.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Semi-structured nurse interviews will explore nurse perceptions towards agitation, relationship to dementia, complementary therapies and their applications as a management for agitation in residential aged care facilities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Nurse interviews will be conducted prior to the randomised controlled trial [RCT] commencing and again after the RCT has concluded. Nurse participants will be consenting regular carers of older adult participants who inform the NPI and CMAI from observation.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomisation and intervention sequencing will be preformed by an independent researcher. Participants will initially be allocated to dementia (30 participants) or no dementia (30 participant) group as determined by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Participants will then allocated a sequence of the three treatments in this study using block randomisation.

 </concealment>
    <sequence>The participants will be randomly allocated a treatment sequence A, B or C giving a total of six groups for comparison. Participants, researchers and staff will be unaware of group allocation and treatment sequence. A factorial design allows comparison within participants for intervention effect and also examination between the independent groups, dementia and no dementia.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is the first three-phase mixed method sequential design conducted to investigate the effect of Lavender or Lemon Balm on agitation in older people living in residential aged care facilities [RACFs]. This study will investigate the clinical effect of the essential oils on agitation and the situation, RACF setting, in which the clinical investigation is being conducted to identify perceptions or bias which may influence the study and outcomes. This proposed study is guided by the following questions:
*What is the effect of Lavender or Lemon Balm aromatherapy on agitation in older people living in RACFs?
*Are there differences between the agitation behaviour, frequency or severity experienced relative to no dementia or the degree of dementia?
*Is the effectiveness of agitation management with Lavender or Lemon Balm dependent on no dementia or degree of dementia?
*Can aromatherapy management affect the quality of life for the older person living in RACFs?
*Can a nurses pre conceived perception and clinical experiences of aromatherapy effect methods and outcomes in essential oil investigations?
This research seeks to answer the research questions by addressing five hypotheses:
*Participants when receiving the Lavender or Lemon Balm aromatherapy treatment will experience less agitation than when receiving placebo treatment. 
*Participants who have dementia will experience greater agitation than participants who have no dementia. 
*Aromatherapy affects agitation differently in older people with no dementia to those with dementia.
*Participants quality of life will improve with aromatherapy treatment groups than those receiving the placebo.
*Bias in the study will be identified through nurses perceptions of aromatherapies effectiveness and practicality in RACFs
