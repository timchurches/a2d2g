  <interventions>
    <interventions> We will use Modified yale preoperative anxiety scale (mYPAS)  to score childrens premedication anxiety.  We  will apply  and record  it to 100 children  having genitourinary operation aged 3-7 years when they enter the preoperative waiting room with  their parents. The children will be  randomly divided into two groups. After 3 minutes of staying in the room, playing dough will be given to  one group of  children(group A) (group B will not receive playing dough)and group A will play with it.After 3 minutes of playing, mYPAS  will be applied,recorded  to both of the groups after  the childrens's play. After  5 minutes of the second scoring we  will apply oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg to both groups of children and  at that time we will score the 3rd mYPAS  and record  it for the last time to both groups.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our primary outcome is to reduce the premedication anxiety in 3-7 year old children (who will have elective genitourinary operation) using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). </outcome>
      <timepoint>1. The first time when children enter the preoperative waiting room,  first mYPAS will be scored.
2.   3 minutes after entering the room, play dough will be given and children will play with it for 3 minutes time then 2nd mYPAS is scored.
3.  5 minutes after the 2nd score, midazolam is applied and 3rd mYPAS is scored</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> Before operation, children receive midazolam orally to reduce anxiety about operation. Most of the children also have anxiety in receiving this premedication. Our purpose is to reduce this premedication anxiety so we gave playing dough to children to play. mYPAS  is  used to score the anxiety of children. </summary>
