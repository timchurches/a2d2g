  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two active intervention groups
Group 1: Isometric exercises: 4 weeks. 4x per week, 5x 45 second isometric contraction of both legs on a leg extension machine with a knee joint angle of 60 degrees. 80% Maximal Voluntary Contraction, with a 2.5% progressive overload of RM per week. 
Rest period after completing both legs is 15 seconds. Total duration of exercise session including 5 minute warm up is 15 minutes. 

Group 2: Isotonic exercises: 4 weeks. 4x per week, 4x 8 repetitions of isotonic contractions of both legs on a leg extension machine through range of motion (three second concentric phase immediately followed by a four second eccentric phase). 80% of 8RM, with a 2.5% progressive overload of RM per week. 
Rest period after completing both legs is 15 seconds. Total duration of exercise session including 5 minute warm up is 15 minutes. 
Participants will receive (smart phone) audio instructions to listen to during their exercises. 

Participants will be asked to fill out an exercise diary and will be followed-up weekly at the venue of the matches of their team to improve adherence. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Researchers of this study will be present at game or training days of volleyball, basketball and Australian rules football teams. Athletes who are willing to participate in the study, will be screened on in- and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, they will be registered in the trial and allocated to a treatment. 


Participants will be allocated to a treatment by fully opaque envelopes randomization. After registration to participate in the trial, a participant has to draw an envelope with one of the two interventions in it. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Forty envelopes are randomised using a randomisation table created by computer software (20 each group). </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>There are no data on which to base an a priori power analysis, therefore a post-hoc power analysis will be conducted after first round of inclusion (2 weeks), and if needed another round of inclusion will follow.  
Dummy data suggest that if the pain score change by 2.5 points in one group and 1 in the other group (SD 1 both groups, we have no data to indicate if one group is superior to the other), and effect size of .75 is achieved and a sample size of 18 is required (alpha .05, beta 0.95).

The statistical methods described below will be reviewed by a statistician. 
For each outcome measure, independent t-test will be used to test the  differences between groups at baseline. Four week week outcomes will be analysed with a mixed factor ANOVA (group x time (0 and 4 weeks)). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Jumpers knee (patellar tendinopathy) is often reported in jumping athletes like volleyball players, especially during the volleyball season. It is hard to relieve this pain in-season. In this study we will investigate the effects of two physiotherapy /rehabilitation exercise programs (isometric and isotonic exercises).  It is hypothesized that both exercise programs will decrease the level of tendon pain in in-season jumping athletes with patellar tendinopathy. </summary>
