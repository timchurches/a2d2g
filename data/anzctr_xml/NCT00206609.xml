  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients who have dyspnoea mainly due to advanced cancer. Patients with a history of
             COAD will be eligible for participation in this study as long as the main mechanism of
             current dyspnoea is related to tumor.

          -  intensity of dyspnoea of at least 3 on a 0-10 visual analogue scale at the time of
             treatment.

          -  Regular Bronchodilators and corticosteroids and other adjuvant medications for
             dyspnoea will be allowed to continue during the study. Inhaled bronchodilator steriods
             may not be used during the study period.

          -  Patients may be receiving regular oral or parenteral opioids and opioid dose must be
             stable for 24 hours.

          -  Patients must have normal cognitive status defined as normal state of arousal and
             absence of obvious clinical findings of confusion, memory or concentration deficit
             according to Blessed Orientation Memory &amp; Concentration mental status examination
             (score&lt;10).

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Patients must have no contraindications to oxygen.

          -  Patients must sign written informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect that oxygen has when administered to
      patients complaining of shortness of breath, where the underlying cause of this symptom is
      advanced cancer. The study tests the hypothesis that oxygen improves shortness of breath more
      than air in this population. Both oxygen and air will be administered to patients in random
      order and in a blinded fashion, with patients asked to rate their shortness of breath before
      and after each gas. Finally patients will be asked which gas they prefer.</summary>
