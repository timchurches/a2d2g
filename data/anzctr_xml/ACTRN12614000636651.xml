    <statisticalmethods>Primary analysis will describe the trajectory of change in Health-related Quality of Life from baseline by time and treatment group using linear mixed models.  
Associations of secondary endpoints will be evaluated by entering each of the factors as time-varying covariates in separate linear mixed models. 
As this study seeks to describe the trajectory of Health-related Quality of Life over time, it is not powered for hypothesis testing.  It is anticipated that 200 participants can be recruited.   The sample size is sufficient for hypothesis-generating exploratory analyses used to power future studies of this population.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to describe the symptoms, quality of life and supportive care needs of people diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma (MM). Additionally, we aim to describe the nutritional and functional status of people with MM, and to assess the relationship between psychological factors (anxiety and depression) and quality of life and other outcomes. Who is it for? You may be eligible to joint this study if you are aged 18 years or more and have been diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. Study details Participants in this study will be asked to complete a range of patient reported outcome measures at 6-12 week intervals for up to 2 years. These measures will include assessment of health related quality of life, anxiety and depression and unmet supportive care needs. Optional sub-studies will involve nutritional assessment, functional assessment and donation of additional blood for the analysis of inflammatory markers.</summary>
