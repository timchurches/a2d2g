  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to compare the treatment device (Solyx) to a different
      mesh sling or control device (Obtryx II) for the treatment of symptoms for SUI. Safety
      information and patient outcomes will be collected for three (3) years and evaluated.</summary>
