  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional arm of the trial will receive a smart phone application detailing their condition, prognosis and expected recovery time along with text and video content detailing their rehabilitation program, This program will be supervised by a physiotherapist (with at least 5 years experience) in conjunction with the treating surgeon/medical officer (senior and junior medical officers under the supervision of a senior consultant orthopaedics surgeon). 

The exercises within the app. will be industry standardised rotator cuff and stability exercises such as "Codman circles", Active range of motion stretches, and strengthening exercises i.e. shoulder abduction with dumbbell or weight. each exercise will have explanatory text and a short video clip demonstrating the movements.  

The application would also prompt/remind the patient to practice their rehabilitation exercises as well as give them feedback r.e. Their progress. The application will also serve as a method of data collection where as the patient will receive periodic questionnaires and requests for feedback - particularly the Oxford instability and stability questionnaires - to track their progress. 

The application will be free to the patient and there will be regular follow-up and supervision with clinicians and allied health. The patient will be required to pass a supervised program with the departments physiotherapist before being approved for individual rehabilitation exercises via the application.  

The patient will have follow up at one week post injury - by which the patient will be assessed by the physiotherapist and medical officer and the application introduced. Their will then be a three, six and potentially twelve and twenty four week follow-up. These follow-up will depend on the patients adherence to the treatment plan i.e. the trial drop out rate. If the Patients delete the app. and no longer respond to emails at 24 weeks then follow-up may be lost. 

These follow-up session will be within the Sunshine Coast University Hospital and Nambour Hospital Orthopaedic outpatients department. 

There will be no personalisation of the intervention meaning that if the rehabilitation program derived on the application is not suitable the patient will not be eligible for the trial.

Adherence will be assessed according to the response from the regular periodic questionnaires and patient feedback. There may be incentives for completing a significant percentage of feedback questionnaires I.e. Those who fulfil &gt;90% response to questionnaires go into the draw for an iPad Pro.   

N.B. The rehabilitation program and information provided by the app will be created/designed in conjunction with the senior orthopaedic physiotherapist and Consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Nambour General Hospital as well as being referenced with empirical evidenced and industry approved standards </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive the same questionnaires and follow-up without access to the smart-phone application. They will go through the usual rehabilitation as the intervention group but without access to the app. 

Usual rehabilitation usually entails a one week out patients appointment with an orthopaedic clinic followed by weekly physiotherapy  for 3-6 weeks depending on the patients progress and compliance. The exercises used are ROM, proprioception and strengthening exercises. There is no set guideline of pathway r.e. which exercise should be used but this will be established prior to recruitment with the assistance/cooperation of the physiotherapy departments. there will be 2-4 exercises for 1) range of motion, 2) proprioception, 3) strength and prevention. The details of which will be decided in concordance with the senior physiotherapists at each department to ensure all participants are receiving the same rehabilitation program.  </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the SPACS study is to determine the efficacy of smart phone applications as adjuncts in the rehabilitation of orthopaedic patients, in this particular instance - shoulder dislocations. 

Hypothesis: That smart-phone applications used in conjunction with an industry standardised rehabilitation program will improve patient outcomes represented by comparatively better Oxford stability and instability scores 

Design: The study will be a simple RCT with two parallel cohorts. One with access to the app. and regular questionnaires and the other with questionnaires only. At the completion of 18 months data collection via the smart-phone apps. the scores between the two cohorts will be compared and analysed

Outcomes: the "constant", Orford stability score and Oxford instability scores will used to assess the patients recovery and rehabilitation before  being compared to assess the efficacy of the intervention
