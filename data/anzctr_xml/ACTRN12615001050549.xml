  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive verbal and written nutrition education from a student dietitian, focusing on how to select and prepare low sodium foods. This includes an information booklet compiled by the student dietitian which includes recipes, tips on food label reading and dietary practice.  Participants will attend weekly one-on-one consultation clinics (30 min) for four weeks.  Dietary sodium intake is measured at baseline using 2 day weighed diet record, 24 hour diet recall and 24 hour urine.  Participants will then attempt to undertake a low sodium diet for four weeks(target &lt;2000 mg/day) from the second weekly consultation visit(once baseline measures have been taken), consuming food and beverages of their own choice. Participants will then receive tailored advice and support for maintaining a low sodium diet from a student dietitian. 

Over the period there will be a log of attendance.  At four weeks participants will provide a 2 day weighed diet record, a 24h diet recall and a 24-hour urine collection to assess nutrient intakes and monitor adherence to the intervention.  In addition, participants will attend a semi-structured interview at the end of the low sodium diet to evaluate effectiveness of the dietary support aids.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a pilot for a larger study examining the effects of diets that are consistent with WHO recommendations on sodium, and draft recommendations on sugar on blood pressure and other cardiovascular disease risk markers.

To reduce the global burden of high blood pressure on cardiovascular disease and morbidity, the WHO recommends adults consume &lt;2000 mg sodium/day. Currently, New Zealand adults have a mean intake of around 3300mg/day.  Previous studies have indicated it may be difficult for people to adhere to the WHO sodium target intake, and barriers and supports to adherence are not known. It is also unknown whether adhering to a low sodium diet is associated with other dietary changes that can affect health (It is likely that such changes will be beneficial to health but this has not been tested). Therefore, more research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of dietary support aids, and to explore whether low sodium diets are associated with other dietary changes that may influence cardiovascular disease risk markers.</summary>
