  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive secondary prevention support program delivered via mobile phone text message and an opportunity to communicate with a health counsellor over a 12 month period. The messages will provide education, support, motivation and reminders with respect to medications and lifestyle. As the focus is medication adherence at least 1 message per week will be about medications. Messages will be delivered on average 4 times per week. Participants can respond to their daily text message to ask advice from their health counsellor. All responses from participants to text messages will be reviewed and responded to by the health counsellor. Once a month participants will be asked if they would like more information or support, if they reply yes  they will be contacted by a health counsellor.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of patients regularly taking appropriate secondary prevention medications</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective measures of cardiovascular risk factors - mean total cholesterol, mean LDL cholesterol, mean systolic blood pressure at 12 months. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol will be measures on venous blood samples obtained from participants at the 12 month follow-up. Blood pressure will be measured using a digital blood pressure monitor. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion regularly using each medication class. This will be self-reported using a standardised questionnaire. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Behavioural risk factors - Smoking, physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake. Smoking will be assessed using a standardised questionaire. Physical activity will be measured using the Active Australia Questionnaire and diet measured using a sub-sample of questions on fruit and vegetable intake from the WHO steps instrument. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major vascular event (CV death, non-fatal AMI, stroke or hospital admission with unstable angina or congestive heart failure), coronary revascularisation (coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention), Death, hospital readmission. This will be measured at 12 months using self-report and additional supporting documentation will be collected by study staff for central adjudication.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>psychosocial factors including anxiety and depressive symptoms will be assessed using the GAD7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. </outcome>

    <concealment>Patients with acute coronary syndrome will be screened in hospital for inclusion criteria, informed consent obtained , baseline data required to personalise the intervention program will be collected and patients will be enrolled into the study. Centre study staff will enter data into an electronic case report form. Allocation to intervention or control will be done centrally and concealed from study personnel until the completion of the trial. Study personnel taking follow-up assessments will also be blinded to parallel group assignments. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will occur using a centralised, computerised randomisation program. The random allocation sequence will be in a uniform 1:1. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>We will follow the intention to treat principle and analyse patients in the treatment group to which they are allocated. Characteristics will be compared between the two groups using independent ttests or chi-square tests as is appropriate. We will analyse the primary outcome at the end of followup
with the chi-square test. The primary analysis will be unadjusted. We will compare the mean level or proportion using chi-square or t-test as relevant for each of the secondary outcome measures as well as calculate the relative risks, 95% confidence intervals and two-sided p-values.
We will also calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) and its 95% CI for the primary outcome. We will investigate the possible effects of baseline effect modifiers or confounders using logistic regression analysis. We will analyse effects across subgroups using logistic regression models with
and without interaction terms between treatment allocation and sub-group defining variables using the likelihood-ratio test. The criterion for statistical significance will be set at 0.05. 
We considered a 10% improvement in the proportion taking appropriate secondary prevention to be a clinically meaningful increase as such results have been associated with a 10% decrease in short-term mortality.  To test for a 10% improvement in the primary outcome (RR of 1.10) in the treatment compared to the control arm (assuming about 70% of patients are taking appropriate secondary prevention in control arm, based on the CONCORDANCE registry, and this would rise to 77% in the intervention arm) with 80% power (type I error = 5%, two-sided test) we would require a total sample size of 1256, rising to about 1385 accounting for about 10% loss to follow up. This sample size of 1256 would enable us to also detect with 80% power a minimum detectable difference in secondary outcomes of  i) 1.5 mmol in total cholesterol assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 0.96mmol/L, ii) 2.7 mmHg in systolic blood pressure, assuming a SD of 17mmHg and a minimum detectable relative risk of 0.69 in CV events assuming a major CV event rate of 19% based on data from CONCORDANCE.</statisticalmethods>
