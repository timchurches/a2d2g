    <interventions>3.0 monocryl will be used in interrupted manner, 1-2cm apart long the caesarean section wound. they will be removed day 5-7 post op, this will take approximately ten minutes to carry out.</interventions>
    <comparator>3.0 monocryl will be used in a subcuticular continuous manner to approximate the skin. this is a dissolvable suture and does not need to be removed. this will take approximately ten minutes to carry out.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients with a BMI&gt;30  will be approached in high-risk ante-natal clinic. They will be provided with the patient information and consent form and have the opportunity to ask the recruiting member of medical staff any questions they may have. they will also have the opportunity to take the consent form home to read and can consent on day of surgery.
Once signed, the consent will go onto their digital medical record. On the day of the caesarean section, the consent form will be printed alongside the operative consent form.
A computer generated randomized sequence of either interrupted or subcuticular sutures will be produced. A sequence of numbered envelopes will each contain the result of the randomization, indicating if the patient should have interrupted or continuous sutures. The envelopes will be stored in theatre. As each patient enters theatre they will have an envelope assigned to them that contains the random result: either subcuticular or interrupted sutures.The caesarean section will be carried out as per protocol. All patients included in this trial will have the subcutaneous fat layer closed with 2.0 vicryl. After closure of this layer, the envelope will be opened by the theatre scout and the corresponding suture type will be disclosed to the surgeon. The scout will instruct the surgeon on whether to perform subcuticular continuous suture or interrupted sutures</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Throughout the world, rates of obesity and rates of caesarean sections are simultaneously increasingly. Moreover, women who have a body mass index (BMI) in the obese category ( that is &gt;30) are much more likely to undergo caesarean section. These women there is a higher rate of wound infections and other wound complications such as wound breakdown and collection. In our study we propose that using interrupted stitches to close skin at caesarean section will reduce the rate of wound complications compared to using a continuous stitch.
