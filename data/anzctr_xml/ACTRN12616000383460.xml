  <interventions>
    <interventions>Students will be randomized into two groups: 1) Qcpr arm and 2) instructor arm. After a unique frontal lesson cycle from qualified instructors about cardiac arrest, Basic Life Support - Defibrillation (BLS-D) and high quality chest compression, students will be randomized. In the Qcpr group (Q) students will receieve feedback about their chest compression performance on resuscitation training mannequin by a computer-based feedback system (QCPR Registered Trademark, Laerdal, Norway) which analyses rate, depth, recoil and hand position. QCPR (Registered Trademark) is a software displaying parameters related to chest compression performance on a screen linked to the manneqiun. Students will receive also a global compression score taking into account all variables related to the quality of chest compression. In the instructor arm, students will receive feedback from a qualified instructor who will decide when the criteria for high quality standard chest compression will be reached. 
All students will perform a 2-minute CPR trial. In the qcpr arm, an instructor will comment with every student his/her performance basing on the score from QCPR (Registered Trademark) system for a maximun time of 10 minutes. In the instructor arm, students will recevie feedback from the instructor basing on what the instructor have seen during the CPR trial for a maximun time of 10 minutes each.
The feedback from instructor will be delivered immediately after the CPR trial. The outcomes assessment will be performed in a separate 2-minute CPR trial with QCPR (Registered Trademark) system blinded to students and instructor 7 days later. 
There is no planning for strategies to monitor adherence.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a computerized feedback system connected to a manikin that provides a real-time assessment of quality of the chest compressions in students attending the 4th and 5th year of secondary school in terms of their technical ability.
Students will be subjected to lectures about the Cardiac arrest and BLS-D. They will be randomized into two groups. In the first group, students will perform cycles of two minutes of chest compressions guided by a computerized feedback system that will evaluate their performance. In the second group students will receive feedback about their chest compressions performance by a qualified instructor. After seven days all students will be evaluated by the execution of a single cycle of chest compressions with manikin and computer system. After the training phase investigators will submit to the participants a questionnaire that will assess the satisfaction.
