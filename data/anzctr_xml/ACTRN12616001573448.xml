  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a web based Colorectal cancer RISk Prediction tool (CRISP) risk assessment tool utilising a risk model to provide patients with a personalised risk assessment and colorectal cancer screening advice based on their risk.
Patients in the intervention group will be invited to complete the risk tool with a trained researcher prior to a consultation with their GP. The tool will take a maximum of 7 minutes and will be completed at baseline only. Participants will receive their risk of colorectal cancer and screening advice based on their risk which they will take with them into their consultation with their GP. All participants will also complete a survey collecting information about cancer risk perception, worry and bowel cancer screening intention and behaviour at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after recruitment. The follow up survey should take no more than 15 minutes to complete and will be sent through the post or a link to the online survey will be sent via email.
We will ask for permission to access GP records, records from Medicare, Victorian Admissions and Emergency Dataset (VAED) and from the National Bowel Screening Program (NBCSP) 1, 3 and 5 years after the participants enrol to track the colorectal cancer screening they have had.</interventions>
    <comparator>'Usual care' in a primary care clinic as well as general information about 'How to Cut Your Cancer Risk' from the Cancer Council of Victoria. 'Usual care' indicates screening for colorectal cancer will be based on the NHMRC guidelines for colorectal cancer screening. Control patients will be having a consultation without being provided with absolute risk of colorectal cancer.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants who have had risk-appropriate screening after 12 months' follow-up. Appropriateness of screening will be determined by their absolute 5-year risk of CRC, using a 1% threshold and completion of FOBT, colonoscopy no screening, or a referral to a Familial Cancer Centre for genetic counselling if indicated by their family history.  Patient self-report at 12 months will tell us what screening each patient has had and this will be cross-checked with GP records, records from Medicare, Victorian Admissions and Emergency Dataset (VAED) and from the National Bowel Screening Program (NBCSP)</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of participants who have had risk-appropriate screening after 3 years' follow-up, measured as above for primary endpoint. We will ask for permission to access GP records, records from Medicare, Victorian Admissions and Emergency Dataset (VAED) and from the National Bowel Screening Program (NBCSP) to determine screening undertaken at 3 years.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health service utilisation and health care costs. We will measure GP consultations, referrals for colonoscopy, and completion of FOBT. Costs of delivering the CRISP and control consultations will be calculated. 
This includes assessment of GP consultations, colonoscopy services, FOBT and associated pathology services. Costs of delivering the CRISP and control consultations will also be calculated. Any other associated changes in health care utilisation will be captured through access to patients Medicare data.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is aiming to test an intervention led by the practice nurse in general practice to calculate and discuss people's individual risk of bowel cancer and screening tests in order to have risk appropriate screening to detect a malignancy or pre-malignancy as early as possible.
Who is it for? Any primary care patient aged between 50 and 74 years who has an appointment with a general practitioner (GP) who is participating in the study. Anyone who has had a previous colorectal cancer diagnosis will not be eligible.
Study details: Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will continue to receive the usual care in the primary care clinic. Participants in the other group will go through a web-based colorectal cancer risk assessment with the research nurse, who will then provide risk output and screening advice which can be discussed with their GP. Our primary aim is to determine well the risk assessment tool encourages patients to have and doctors to recommend colorectal cancer screening that is appropriate for the patients actual risk of developing the disease. The research is part of a larger body of research: the 'NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence for Reducing the Burden of Colorectal Cancer by Optimising Screening: Evidence to Clinical Practice'.</summary>
