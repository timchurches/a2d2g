  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of a delay of 8 weeks in commencing the standard Active Follow (AF) pathway invitees to bowel screening who have not returned a test kit within 4 weeks of being sent an invitation letter.  The standard AF service consists of the following.  Eligible individuals are identified and extracted from the Bowel Screening Pilot register.  This data is inserted into an Access (Registered Trademark) database.  The database is available to the team of Community coordinators who carry out the AF activities.  They use the database to filter the population according to the ethnicity that they serve.  The Coordination Centre employs 0.4 FTE of Maori Community Coordinators, 0.4 FTE of Samoan/Other Pacific Coordinators and 0.9 FTE of Asian Coordinators.  They phone the individuals and record the outcome of the calls.  Key Performance Indicators set by the MOH require a minimum of 3 phone calls to be made within a 4 week period, one of which must be made after regular working hours. If a number appears to be invalid other data sources are searched for current contact details.  These include the hospital systems, the Primary Health Organisation age/sex registers, the patients GP practice, and contacts the Community Coordinators have with their own communities.    In the intervention group this active follow-up activity commences 12 weeks after being sent an invitation letter for bowel screening rather than 4 weeks after as in the control group.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is the standard (not delayed) active follow-up pathway as described above.  This commences 4 weeks after being sent an invitation letter among those eligible for active follow-up (Maori, Pacific and Asian ethnicity invitees).</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All subjects will be recruited from the universe of population eligible for participation in the Waitemata Bowel Screening Pilot.  This is (currently) men and women aged 50-74  who are eligible for publicly funded healthcare resident in the geographical area covered by Waitemata District Health Board.  If the invitee has not returned a test kit within 4 weeks of the date of invitation, then s/he is sent a reminder letter.  In addition, if that individual is recorded to have a Maori, Pacific or Asian ethnicity, then they are entered in the AF pathway.  These are the individuals who are eligible to take part in the study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment will be ensured by adherence to a  strict randomisation protocol.  A master randomisation key of 10,000 rows will be provided to the Project Manager to import as an Access (Registered Trademark) database. Three times per week, invitees whose test kits were sent out 28 days or more previously and who have not yet returned a test kit will be extracted from the Bowel Screening Pilot Register into an Access (Registered Trademark) database.  An access table will be formed of those eligible for AF (i.e. with a prioritised ethnicity recorded as Maori, Pacific or Asian) and this will be appended into the master randomisation key in alphabetical order of the NHI numbers within that batch.  The treatment allocation (intervention or control) corresponding to each individual will be copied into that person’s record, and those assigned to the control group will be allocated today’s date as their start date and will be available immediately for follow-up phone calls. </concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created in an excel file by its random number generator, with numbers between 0 and 1 rounded down to 0 if less than 0.5 (control group) and up to 1 if above 0.5 (intervention group). </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations have been performed considering the trial either as a test of non-inferiority of the intervention (delayed AF) and alternatively as a test of superiority of the control group (immediate AF).  In both cases a difference of 5% in the overall participation rate was the critical limit being tested.  To perform these sample size calculations it was first necessary to determine what difference in participation during AF would lead to a 5% difference in overall participation, based on the historical (2015) participation within 30 days and during the first 8 weeks of the Active Follow-up period. Sample size calculations were based on power of 90% and 95% confidence limits. Additional detail is available in the study protocol or upon request.

Analysis will be performed on an intention to treat basis.  That is the endpoints will be compared for the two groups as defined from the point of randomisation to intervention or control groups and even participants who are no longer living in the DHB or who are not contactable will be included in the analysis. The initial analysis of data will test for any deviations from balance between the two groups by comparing the distribution of basic demographic variables in each. Differences in participation rates between the two groups will be tested by simple bivariate methods (e.g. the Chi square test) and also by logistic regression analysis to permit statistical control for potential confounding variables (age, sex, ethnicity, provider of active follow-up service, time period etc.).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Maori, Pacific and Asian participants in bowel screening who do not submit a test kit within one month of being invited currently enter an active follow-up (AF) process whereby attempts are made to contact them by telephone, ensure that they received the invitation, and offer assistance with completing the screening test.  This is a rather costly service and we are uncertain whether this cost can be justified by its impact on participation rates. The proposed trial will test this by randomly allocating eligible individuals to the usual active follow-up protocol or to the same active follow-up but delayed by eight weeks.  The trial is designed to test whether AF has a significant impact on participation among the recipients of this service by comparing participation rates between the two groups at 8 weeks from the point that they are allocated to their groups.  By eight weeks from initiating AF, approximately 90% of participants who will eventually submit a test kit have already done so.  Thus the primary endpoint is the difference in participation between intervention and control groups at eight weeks from the time of allocation.  Secondary endpoints will examine whether there are ethnic specific differences in this measure and whether there are differences in this outcome between the service provided directly by the Bowel Screening Coordination Centre and that subcontracted to external providers.  There will be approximately 7000 subjects in the trial (3500 in each group).</summary>
