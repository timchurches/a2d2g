  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Cardiac and Liver Iron Overload. - Hepatic iron overload (liver siderosis) and cardiac iron overload (cardiac siderosis) in patients with transfusional siderosis (Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), thalassaemia major, non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT) and other anaemias) were measured using MRI (R2 by FerriScan and T2*, respectively).</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac Siderosis Severity - Cardiac siderosis severity was measured by MRI (T2*). The severity grade of siderosis was tiered in 3 levels: mild (T2* &gt;= 20ms), moderate (T2* from 10 to 20ms), and severe (T2* &lt;10ms). Mild cardiac siderosis, by the definitions used in this study, were equivalent to not having cardiac siderosis. Values were compared to published thresholds of iron overload to determine severity of transfusion siderosis in the participant population studied.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of T2* Levels to Evaluate the Severity of Iron Overload Due to Transfusion Therapy in Chelation-naïve and Chelation-treated Participant Subgroups - Iron overload due to transfusion therapy was assessed based on chelation status of each participant (i.e. minimally exposed to chelator treatment and chelation-treated patient subgroups).</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean Quality of Life (QOL) Scores - Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey. The SF-36 consists of 8 sub-scales: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. The raw sores of the 8 scales are transformed to a 0 - 100 scale where 0 indicates maximum disability and 100 indicates no disability. There also are two physical and mental health summary measures. Each summary measure is the mean average of the 4 associated sub-scale scores. The range for each summary measure is 0 to 100 where 0 represents maximum disability and 100 represents no disability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Low Medium or High Adherence to Iron Chelator Therapy - Adherence of participants was assessed using an adherence questionnaire. Adherence questionnaires were completed only by participants who received chelating agents. Participants answered yes or no to 6 statements such as "Forgot to take pills". Based on the responses to these questions, adherence was classified as low, medium or high.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Investigator Treatment Decisions Based on MRI Results - Treatment decisions were recorded after the investigator evaluated the MRI results, in order to assess the impact of such diagnostic test on the overall clinical management of participants with iron overload. Investigators answered the following question: "Since the MRI scan, have you changed or are planning to change the management of iron in your subject?".</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Iron, one of the most common elements in nature and the most abundant transition metal in the
      body, is readily capable of accepting and donating electrons. This capability makes iron a
      useful component of various, essential biochemical processes. Despite the essential role of
      iron, the excess of iron is toxic to the human body. It is critical for the human body to
      maintain iron balance, since humans have no physiologic mechanism for actively removing iron
      from the body.

      The development of iron overload occurs when iron intake exceeds the body's capacity to
      safely store the iron in the liver, which is the primary store for iron. Long-term
      transfusion therapy, a life-giving treatment for patients with intractable chronic anemia is
      currently the most frequent cause of secondary iron overload.

      The mounting evidence regarding the mortality and morbidity due to chronic iron overload in
      transfusion dependent anaemias has led to the establishment of guidelines that aim the
      improvement of patient outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted in order to assess
      the impact of iron overload in patients with acquired anaemias.

      In this study, non-invasive R2- and T2*-MRI techniques were applied to the liver and the
      heart, respectively, to complement the primary variable (serum ferritin) assessed in patients
      with various transfusion-dependent anaemias. The main objective of this study was to assess
      the prevalence and severity of cardiac and liver siderosis in patients with transfusional
      siderosis. This study was also aim to establish possible correlations between cardiac and
      liver iron levels with clinical effects in patients with different transfusion-dependent
      anaemias. Patients were eligible for enrollment irrespective of receiving chelation therapy
      or not (and irrespective of the chelating agent used).</summary>
