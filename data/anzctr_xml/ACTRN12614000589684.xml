  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in acupressure wristband group will have the Seaband "Registered Trademark" wristband applied on arrival to ICU from surgery to both wrists by a Registered Nurse (bilateral application is recommended) ensuring the bead stimulates the Neiguan (PC6) acupoint. The wristbands are elasticized to encircle the wrist, will be covered with a light opaque covering bandage and will be removed at 36 hours from admission time to ICU after final outcome measurement. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in placebo wristband group will have a placebo (sham/without bead) wristband applied to each wrist on arrival to ICU from surgery. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Participants' nausea will be assessed at 6 time points: 6 hours from arrival to the ICU; 12 hours post arrival (to compare with studies using a 6 hour dose as patients will likely be ventilated for first 6 hours); then 4 hourly up to 24 hours; and then at 36 hours on a 10-point numerical scale. All episodes of retching or vomiting in the 36-hour time period will be recorded</outcome>
      <timepoint>First 36 hours following admission to Intensive Care Unit post cardiac surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rescue drug therapy. Rescue antiemetic will be given and recorded for patients who experience mild-severe nausea or an episode of vomiting within the 36-hour study period </outcome>
      <timepoint>First 36 hours following admission to Intensive Care Unit post cardiac surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Recovery (QOR). Participants will self-assess the QOR on the morning of the 4th post-operative day using a 15-item questionnaire  the QOR-15. This instrument asks participants to rate their recovery from 0 = none of the time to 10 = all of the time to enable a QOR score as a summary (max score 150), and has evidence of excellent validity and reliability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Morning of day 4 post-operatively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Costs associated with treatment for PONV. Healthcare resource use related to the management of nausea and vomiting will be assessed and costed. This will include: band use; frequency, dose, route and duration of rescue anti-emetics; length of stay in ICU and length of stay in hospital post ICU; and costs associated with any adverse effects of the PC6 stimulation device.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Discharge from hospital</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients satisfaction with their PONV care.  At PC6 stimulation device removal, the RN will ask the patient (if able) about their satisfaction with their PONV care on a 10-point scale (0=completely dissatisfied, 10=completely satisfied). </outcome>
      <timepoint>At removal of wristbands 36 hours after application</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical staff's perceptions of  clinical use, feasibility, acceptability and challenges of using acupressure wristbands for post-operative nausea and vomiting in practice. Clinical staff will be invited to participate in either group or individual semi-structured interviews about the clinical use, feasibility, acceptability, and challenges in using the acupressure wristbands for PONV in clinical practice, and their trial involvement. Interview schedule will be informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 4, 8, and 16th month of recruitment</timepoint>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A Registered Research Nurse (RRN), employed specifically for this project, will identify the elective patients from operation lists and approach each patient (at pre-admission clinic or on ward) to initially explain the study to them. Those interested will then be formally screened by the RRN and those eligible will be provided with an information sheet and contact details of the study manager for further information. Written informed consent will then be obtained. RRN will obtain a participant code number corresponding to a study pack to which each participant will be randomly allocated by a web-based independent automated service at the university Clinical Trials Coordination Centre (CTCC), configured for this trial by a biostatistician, and record study group code in patient’s medical record and on study forms. Computer-generated random assignment will occur at the point of study entry, and each patient will be allocated to a numbered trial group.  RRN1 will record the code on patient’s medical record and data collection sheet. </concealment>
    <sequence>each participant will be randomly allocated by a web-based independent automated service at the university Clinical Trials Coordination Centre (CTCC), configured for this trial by a biostatistician. Randomisation will involve a 1:1 ratio; stratified assignment by risk of nausea (Apfel Score that can be stratified into low [score 0 or 1], moderate [score 2], extremely high [score 3 or 4] and study site, with random variation in block sizes.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common unwanted complications for patients following anaesthesia/cardiac surgery, affecting at least 1:3 patients, despite pharmacologic treatment. Patients have a strong preference for avoiding PONV: satisfaction with anaesthetic care and subsequent quality of health care is strongly related to experiences of PONV. Acupressure is one alternative approach thought to prevent nausea and vomiting through an alteration in endorphins and serotonin levels and is an intervention endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This two-group, parallel, superiority, randomised controlled trial (RCT) will test the efficacy of PC6 acupoint stimulation versus placebo for reducing PONV in cardiac surgery patients.</summary>
