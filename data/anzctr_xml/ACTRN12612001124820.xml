  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients had the affected leg treated with a short leg walking cast windowed over the ulcer. The cast consists of five layers: a thick hydrocolloid protective layer applied directly to the skin around the wound; then a layer of cotton gauze; then water resistant foam padding; then cotton padding; then fiberglass. A window is then cut with a cast saw over a pre-marked area of the cast that is over the ulcer. The cast application process takes approximately one hour. This was continued for 4 months with evaluation every two weeks. The PDGF gel was applied daily to the ulcer approximately 2 mm thick after cleaning the ulcer with saline. A bandage was applied over the gel and the window in the cast was then replaced and taped in place.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo gel is identical in appearance and consistency to the Regranex gel except without PDGF. All patients had windowed casts.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is ulcer healing rate at four months. Clinical assessments were scheduled every two weeks from randomization until 4 months of treatment were complete. The assessments consisted of removal of the cast window for wound inspection. Healing was defined as complete epithelialization of the wound.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every two weeks from randomization until four months of treatment were complete.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The patients with unhealed ulcers at 4 months were followed until wound healing or amputation. These final results for ulcer healing are included in the data and thus can be considered a secondary outcome. At nine months after randomization all patients had either healed, dropped out of the study or had an amputation of the affected limb.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects were screened in a surgical wound clinic for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Treatment allocation to placebo or PDGF was randomized on a 1:1 basis as follows. An equal number of pieces of paper labelled with placebo or Regranex were placed in a bag and at the time of randomization a secretary not involved in patient treatment or outcome assessment drew a piece of paper from the bag. The secretary then assigend the patient to the corresponding group and procured the study or placebo medication in a container that prevented identification of its contents. Thus both the patient and the treating physicians were blinded to which treatment group was selected. The physicians assessing outcomes were also blinded, as only the secretary had access to the randomization information.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The was a multi-centered, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of topical platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Forty six male patients with Wagner Grade 1 diabetic foot ulcers were randomized to treatment with PDGF hydrogel (tradename Regranex) versus placebo hydrogel, and all patients received treatment with a windowed cast for ulcer off-loading. Patients with abscess, osteomyelitis or infection requiring antibiotics were excluded. The patients were evaluated at four months after randomization for wound healing. Fifty two percent of the patients treated with PDGF plus windowed casts healed at four months compared to 57% of the placebo patients, yielding a non-significant p-value 0.79. Regranex gel does not appear to improve ulcer healing when combined with effective off-loading. Windowed casting is a safe and effective means of treating diabetic foot ulcers.</summary>
