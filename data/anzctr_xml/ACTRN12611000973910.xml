  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two interventions in the trial. 

The first intervention is intravenous Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (1.2 pmol/kg/min) or placebo (normal saline infused at 1 ml/min). The pharmacy at the Royal Adelaide Hospital randomises the volunteers to product or placebo on each occasion and also conducts the blinding.

The second intervention is the glycaemia of the volunteers, being either euglycaemia (target blood glucose concentration of 6.0 mmol/l) or hypoglycaemia (target blood glucose concentration of 2.6 mmol/l). This is achieved through administering an intravenous insulin infusion at previously validated rate plus a simultaneous intravenous 25% glucose infusion titratedf to the target glycaemia. There is no blinding to the glycaemia of the patient.

Each patient undergoes 4 different experiments in the trial, being as follows:

 1. Euglycaemia and GLP-1;
 2. Euglycaemia and placebo;
 3. Hypoglycaemia and GLP-1; and
 4. Hypoglycaemia and placebo.


 This ensures that each of the four possible combinations of interventions is covered by each participant. As noted earlier, the order of combinations 1 and 2 is randomised, as is the order of combinations 3 and 4. Each study day is separated by a minimum of 4 days.

The protocol for the study begins at t = -60, when the GLP-1 / placebo infusion is initiated. The glucose-insulin clamp is started at t = -30 and achieved by t = -15. The test meal and drink are consumed at t = 0. If the study is a hypoglycaemic study, the clamp is continued until t = 45, when the target blood glucose concentration is increased back to euglycaemia (6.0 mmol/l). Measurements are taken until the study concludes at t = 180.

The standardised test meal is 100 grams of minced beef containing 20 MBq of 99m Technetium-sulphur-colloid. This is utilised to enable a gamma camera to measure gastric emptying. The standardised test drink is 150 ml of water containing 3 grams of 3-O-methyl-D-gluco-pyranose. This is a glucose analogue that is absorbed across the intestinal wall in the same way as glucose but which is not hepatically metabolised and is renally cleared. Blood concentrations of 3-O-methyl-D-gluco-pyranose are used to assess glucose absorption. These are both consumed in all studies at t = 0.</interventions>
    <comparator>As described above, the 'control' studies are:

 2. Euglycaemia and placebo; and
 4. Hypoglycaemia and placebo.

The protocol for these experiments is described above. Each patient thereby acts as their own control, by participating in all four of the possible combinations of the two interventions (and their associated 'control' / placebo arms).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastric emptying.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured by radioisotopic gamma camera. This camera takes frames every 1 minute for the first 60 minutes and then every 3 minutes for the remaining 120 minutes. The recording begins at t = 0 (the time at which the meal and drink are consumed) and continues until t = 180.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Plasma Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 concentration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Epitope diagnostics, United Kingdom). Blood is collected to measure the concentration of this hormone at t = -60 and t = -30 minutes. Collections are then taken every 15 minutes from t = 0 to t = 60 minutes and subsequently every 30 minutes for the remaining 120 minutes.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Peptide concentration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured by Gut Hormone Milliplex Kit (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts). Blood is collected to measure the concentration of this hormone at t = -60 and t = -30 minutes. Collections are then taken every 15 minutes from t = 0 to t = 60 minutes and subsequently every 30 minutes for the remaining 120 minutes.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma glucagon concentration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured by radioimmunoassay. Blood is collected to measure the concentration of this hormone at t = -60 and t = -30 minutes. Collections are then taken every 15 minutes from t = 0 to t = 60 minutes and subsequently every 30 minutes for the remaining 120 minutes.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glucose absorption.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured by determination of absorption of 3-O-methyl-D-gluco-pyranose concentration through High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Blood is collected to measure the concentration of this agent every 15 minutes from t = 15 minutes to t = 60 minutes. Subsequently collections are made every 30 minutes for the remaining 120 minutes.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glucose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood glucose concentration is measured using a portable glucometer at the beginning of the study. It is measured every 5 minutes from t = -30 minutes to t = 90 minutes. It is then measured every 15 minutes for the remaining 90 minutes. These recordings are validated against measurements via venous blood gas analysis, which are taken every 15 minutes from t = -30 to t = 90. They are then taken every 30 minutes until t = 180.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the effects of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (a hormone) on gastric (stomach) emptying in heathly volunteers with normal and low blood sugar levels. 

In particular, the study aims to answer the question: does the slowing of stomach emptying caused by Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 persist even when a person has low blood sugar levels? 

The 'null hypothesis' is that the effects of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 on gastric emptying will be unaffected by blood sugar levels.

This study is important because important safety implications arise from the relationship between slowed gastric emptying caused by Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 and blood sugar levels. If a patient is receiving Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 as a therapy for Type II Diabetes Mellitus and also develops low blood sugar levels, then the rate his / her stomach empties is important for the correction of the low blood sugar levels.</summary>
