    <statisticalmethods>We retrospectively audited intraoperative blood pressures of 200 colonoscopy patients prior to the actual study. We used previous investigators criteria to define hypotension, which is a drop in systolic blood pressure of 25% or more from the baseline, and that one reading was sufficient to define hypotension. Of the 200 patients, 101 had hypotension (50.5%), and 99 did not (49.5%). Based on the control event rate of 50.5% and an estimated experimental event rate as low as 25%, a sample size requirement to be 60 patients per group provides 80% power to detect this difference, assuming a Type 1 error rate of 5%.
Differences between groups at baseline were assessed using t-tests for normally distributed variables and chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests for discrete variables, as appropriate. The difference in incidence between groups was then assessed using a chi-squared test without continuity correction.
We also conducted a multivariable secondary analysis on hypotension, adjusting for group assignment, gender, age, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) status, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, right atrial pressures, diabetes mellitus, presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, cardiac comorbidities, renal comorbidities, and respiratory comorbidities, using logistic regression analysis. Model fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. A p-value less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was accepted as significant with 95% confidence intervals reported. Analyses were conducted using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas.)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Colonoscopy patients are often "dry" or dehydrated as a result of the bowel preparation. This often results in a drop in blood pressure during the procedure. A study in 2006 showed that by giving patients 15ml/kg of fluid, it did not result in improvement of blood pressures, and it was postulated that the volume infused could have been insufficient. In our study, we plan to give 30ml/kg of fluid to colonoscopy patients before their procedure, as we hypothesise that 30ml/kg may be enough to prevent or reduce the drop in blood pressures. We aim to do this by using echocardiography (taking a picture of the heart) to titrate fluids so that patients will not be overloaded with fluids.</summary>
