  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the 3-year DFS (disease free survival) between the two group therapies [Xeloda and Oxaliplatin (XELOX) versus 5-FU/Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)] in patients with colorectal cancer of stage B2 (high risk) and C, according to Dukes</outcome>
      <timepoint>Disease-free survival will be assessed in each patient by history and physical examination at each cycle and by history, physical examination, serum tumor markers [Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)], computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis and chest x-rays every 4 months and endoscopy every 1 year during follow-up. The final outcome will be assessed 3 years after the enrollment of the last patient at the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome is assessed 3 years after the enrollment of the last patient at the study. It is assessed using clinical data records</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost comparison of treatment between the two arms</outcome>
      <timepoint>The length of hospital stays, the cost of the study drugs and other supportive medications and measures required to treat therapy and disease complications, the cost of laboratory, radiologic and other examinations and the length of stay off work because of treatment or disease complications will be assessed for each patient. Cost analysis will be performed at 3 years after the enrollment of the last patient at the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of quality of life (QoL) in both arms of the trial</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed using Euro-QoL 5D (EQ5D) questionnaires that each patient fills in at the beginning, at the end and 6 months after the completion of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Translational research</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed using blood samples collected at the start of chemotherapy and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue taken during surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
