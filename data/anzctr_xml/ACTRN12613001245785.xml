  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Pair of commercially-available rocker-sole shoes (MBT Mahuta, Masai Barefoot Technology, Switzerland), characterized by a rounded sole in the anteriorposterior direction and a soft cushioned heel.

Participants will be asked to wear the footwear as often as possible/practical during the 12 week trial period.

Adherence will be documented at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Participants will provide information concerning the number of hours per day and number of days they have worn their rocker-sole shoes during the previous 4 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Prefabricated orthoses group: Pair of individualised, prefabricated foot orthoses (Vasyli Customs, Vasyli Medical [trademark], Labrador, Queensland, Australia), that will be modified using a first ray cut-outs and 3 mm open cell polyurethane foam forefoot extensions (Poron [registered trademark], Rogers Corp., Rogers, CT, USA).

Participants will be asked to wear the orthoses as often as possible/practical during the 12 week trial period.

Adherence will be documented at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Participants will provide information concerning the number of hours per day and number of days they have worn their prefabricated orthoses during the previous 4 weeks.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for the study has been determined using an a priori power analysis based on the primary outcome measure: the pain domain of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire. We have previously determined that the minimal important difference for this measure in people with foot pain is 13 points. Using a standard deviation of 19 (derived from a recent trial), a power level of 0.8, alpha level of 0.05 and accounting for a drop-out rate of 15%, a sample size of 80 participants (i.e. approximately 40 per group) will be required. We have conservatively selected a drop-out rate at the higher end of previous trials of specialised footwear and/or orthoses for lower limb OA (between 2 and 15%).

Statistical analysis will be undertaken using SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp, NY, USA) using the intention-to-treat principle for all randomised participants. The exception to this will be the safety outcome measures which will be analysed as treated. In participants with bilateral symptoms, the most painful foot will be analysed. Multiple imputation will be used to replace any missing data using five iterations, with age, baseline scores, and group allocation as predictors. The exception will be for the variables use of rescue medication and co-interventions where no data substitution will be applied. Standard tests to assess continuous data for normal distribution will be used and transformation carried out if required. Differences in the primary and secondary outcome measures between the two groups will be compared. Continuously-scored outcome measures will be analysed using analysis of covariance with baseline scores and intervention group entered as independent variables. Ordinal scaled data will be analysed using non-parametric tests. Dichotomously-scored outcome measures will be compared using relative risk reductions (RRR) and number needed to treat (NNT).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the foot is a common condition which results in pain, stiffness and impaired ambulation. Footwear modifications and foot orthoses are widely used in clinical practice to treat this condition, but their effectiveness has not been rigorously evaluated. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of rocker-sole footwear and individualised prefabricated foot orthoses in reducing pain associated with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis.   </summary>
