  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare two formulations of trastuzumab to determine whether a new formulation produces similar blood levels to the current product. Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are a healthy male, aged 18 to 55, with a BMI of 18-30 and body weight of 50-100kg. Study details Participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive a single dose of either the existing formulation of trastuzumab (known as Herceptin), or the new formulation of trastuzumab. After the single dose has been administered, blood samples will be taken [at the end of infusion and at 0.5, 1 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 hours and at Days 15, 22, 29, 36, 50, 64 and 78], to check the concentration of the drug in the blood over time. Researchers will also monitor participants for side effects e.g. by physical examination etc, until Day 78. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide information on whether the new formulation of trastuzumab is equivalent to the existing formulation in the manner in which it is moved through and absorbed by the body. </summary>
