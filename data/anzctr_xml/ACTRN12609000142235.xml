  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment arm will be given 2000 international units (IU) of cholecalciferol orally daily commencing between 14 and 18 weeks gestation.  Vitamin D levels will be checked again at 28 weeks gestation.  If still deficient the dose will be doubled to 4000IU orally daily until birth.  Follow up will cease at six weeks postnatally but vitamin D supplements will need to be taken indefinitely.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment during pregnancy.

The nontreatment arm will be treated after birth of the baby.  The mother will recieve 300000IU cholecalciferol orally immediately and the baby 150000IU cholecalciferol orally immediately.  This is known as a Stoss dose and is required only once or twice a year. Mother and baby will receive one dose during the study and will then follow up with their primary care physician.  This Stoss dose needs to be given only once or twice a year at the dose recommended by a combined Australian/New Zealand working group addressing vitamin D deficiency.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The incidence of childhood rickets is increasing and is caused by vitamin D deficiency.  Of those children, 81% of their mothers are also deficient.

We aim to screen high risk women in early pregnancy and randomise those found deficient to either treatment with vitamin D supplements or non-treatment.  We will monitor the effect of vitamin D supplementation by repeating vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy, cord and maternal blood at birth, and infant and maternal blood at six weeks postnatally.

We hope to develop a protocol so all high risk women will be identified and treated, thereby preventing paediatric complications.</summary>
