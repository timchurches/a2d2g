  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will have two distinct treatment arms, where participants will receive either a combination of intravenous ketamine and Fentanyl, or intravenous ketamine and Dexmedetomidine. 

In all cases, participants will begin by receiving a bolus dose of 0.3mg/kg intravenous ketamine, to be immediately followed by a ketamine only intravenous infusion of 0.15mg/kg/hr for one hour (total ketamine infusion of three hours for each study arm). After this one-hour ketamine only period, participants will then receive either:
-Receive three 25mcg intravenous injections of Fentanyl at 1.5, 2 and 2.5 hrs after ketamine infusion commencement (if in KET/FENT arm)
OR
-Receive additional 0.7mcg/kg/hr intravenous infusion of Dexmedetomidine commencing one hour post ketamine-only infusion, for a duration of two hours (if in KET/DEX arm).</interventions>
    <comparator>We are comparing the sedating, cognitive and behavioural effects of between the two treatments (KET/FENT or KET/DEX)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Associations between the treatment combinations (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine) and neurocognitive ability (CANTAB computerised battery).</outcome>
      <timepoint>After administration of treatment combination (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine). Specifically, this will occur at baseline, 1 hour post treatment (following cessation of the ketamine and combination treatment), and 1.5 hours post treatment and at 2 hours-post treatment. This will be assessed using the CANTAB cognitive battery; where reaction time, spatial working memory and verbal recognition memory will be assessed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Associations between the treatment combinations (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine) and objective and subjective sedation (Visual Analogue Scale and Algometer).

Objective and subjective sedation will be taken as a composite.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After administration of treatment combination (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine). Specifically, this will occur at baseline, 1 hour post treatment commencement,  1.5 hours post combination treatment commencement (both for KET/FENT and KET/DEX) and at 2 hours-post treatment cessation. This will be assessed using the Visual Analogue scale of alertness (CANTAB BATTERY) and the Algometer (in conjunction with a visual pain scale); where pain detection and/or pain tolerance threshold will be assessed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Associations between the treatment combinations (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine) and driving performance (highway driving scenario).</outcome>
      <timepoint> After administration of treatment combination (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine). Specifically, this will occur at baseline, 1 hour post treatment commencement,  1.5 hours post treatment commencement and at 2 hours-post treatment cessation. This will be assessed using the Forum 8 portable driving simulator. Weaving of the car, expressed as standard deviation of the lateral position (SDLP), standard deviation of speed (SDS, km/h) and lapses will be assessed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Level of alertness over time as a function of treatment. This will be assessed using subjective alertness questions which comprise part of the CANTAB battery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After administration of treatment (ketamine combined with either Fentanyl or Dexmedetomidine). Specifically, this will occur at baseline, at 1 hour post Ketamine-only treatment, at 1 hour post-commencement of combination treatment and at 2-hours post treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Demographic data will be presented with summary statistics (number of participants, mean, standard deviation, median and range). The number and percentage of subjects will be presented for categorical variables. 
All statistical tests will be performed two tailed at the 5% significance level and performed using IBM SPSS statistical package. Z scores for the distribution will be calculated for each variable and displayed in histogram form. Out of range values will be recoded as missing values. 
Demographic data will be presented with summary statistics (number of participants, mean, standard deviation, median and range).  Pressure pain algometer analysis will be reported as mean +/- SEM. Neurocognitive, subjective, sedation index scores and neurobehavioural  data derived from the CANTAB task, Algometer and the driving task will be analysed using separate Linear Fixed Effects Models. Appropriate covariance structure will be interpreted as to best fit the data. Time will be entered into the model as the repeated measures factor and CANTAB outcome measures, Algometer scores  and driving performance scores will be included as the outcome variable. Where a main effect is observed, post-hoc paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons will be conducted to contrast each time point to baseline score. 
Correlations between CANTAB VAS scores and performance outcomes on CANTAB tasks and the driving simulator across time points as function of treatment will be conducted using Pearson product moment coefficient r.
Linear regression models will be used to assess associations between whole blood concentrations of both ketamine and norketamine and dexmedetomidine or fentanyl (separate for KET/FENT and KET/DEX) and performance on target CANTAB and driving simulator variables.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Both alone and in combination, the effects of Ketamine, Fentanyl and Dexmedetomidine are effective at providing analgesia to patients in the ICU. However, these drug combinations can potentially also have very important consequences for tasks involving complex cognitive and behavioural ability, which includes making important clinical decisions (in a clinical setting both during and post-treatment), and driving a car (post treatment discharge). Currently, it is unclear which clinically indicated drug combination (either KET/DEX or KET/FENT) has more favourable effects on sedation, alertness and cognitive/neurobehavioral outcomes.

We therefore seek to test whether sub-anaesthetic KET/DEX combination will yield in better analgesic and alertness level when compared to KET/FENT, and if there are any differences in cognitive and neurobehavioral abilities between these drug conditions.
