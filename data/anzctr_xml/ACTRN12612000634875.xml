  <interventions>
    <interventions>A new technology for delivery of Omega-3 oils in foods. The amount of active ingredient (DHA/EPA fish oil) provided by the new technology (a seaweed gel encapsulant) will be 1300mg. It will be provided as a liquid oil emulsion in 300mL milk. This is a single dose delivered on one day only. 

This is a crossover study with a 6-week washout period. The second treatment arm is 1300mg DHA/EPA fish oil without the 
seaweed gel encapsulant. This is a single dose delivered on one day only.

The technology is planned to assist the delivery of higher concentrations of Omega-3 oils in food and beverage products, thereby facilitating the development of new functional food products.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Long-chain Omega-3 fatty acids, Docosahexanoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentanoic Acid (EPA), are associated with reducing the risk of a range of chronic diseases, as well as inflammation. They are also linked to improved outcomes as adjunctive therapies in some cancers and arthritis, in addition to promoting growth and development. The National Health and Medical Research Council recommendation for males and females is outlined in Figure 1. Suggested Dietary Targets represent the amount recommended for the prevention of chronic disease, i.e. cardiovascular disease and is equivalent to the 90th percentile of intake of the Australian/New Zealand population. Unless people consume oily fish at least twice per week or take omega-3 fish oil capsules, meeting this recommendation is difficult. Fortifying foods with fish oil is a means of improving intakes of EPA/DHA, but existing encapsulation technologies prevent significant doses being incorporated into foods. Higher doses using the current technology produces unsatisfactory flavour profiles and instability in the product. This project aims to improve on this with a trialling a new technology.</summary>
