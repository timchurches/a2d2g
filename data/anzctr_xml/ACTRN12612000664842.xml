    <interventions>The experimental condition involves a single day of prolonged sitting (total duration= 7hrs) with intermittent bouts of short-duration standing.  Participants will remain seated for the initial 140min (steady state) period, after which they will consume a standardised mixed meal (50g fat, 75g carbohydrate) and will complete a 2min bout of standing every 20mins for the remaining 5 hours (total standing duration:28mins). All activities will take place in a controlled laboratory environment under the supervision of trained clinical research staff. During the condition, participants will be permitted to watch television, DVDs or read. 
In this trial, participants will complete each condition (experimental and control) in random order, with a minimum 7 day washout period between conditions.</interventions>
    <comparator>In a controlled laboratory environment, participants will complete one day (total duration=7hr) of prolonged sitting without standing breaks. Participants will sit quietly in a comfortable chair and will consume a standardised mixed meal (50g fat, 75g carbohydrate) after an intial 140min steady state period. Participants will be permitted to watch television programs, DVDs or read during the condition, and all activities will be supervised and recorded by clinical research staff.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Interested volunteers will receive written information about the study in lay terms and a full description of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent and background information, the potential participants will be screened to confirm eligibility. Once a potential subject has been deemed eligible, the subject will be randomised to the order of experimental conditions. The method for allocation concealment is closed envelopes. The allocation information will be placed in numbered envelopes (1 allocation per envelope) by an independent researcher. After a subject has been enrolled in the study, the study co-ordinators will contact an independent staff member to ask for the sequence of experimental conditions. The independent staff member will keep a log of the date and time the envelope was opened, the envelope number, the initials and gender of the participant and the order of experimental conditions. The study co-ordinator will also keep a record of this information</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well known that being physically active is important for maintaining good health. However, new evidence has emerged showing that being sedentary (sitting for prolonged periods) is adversely associated with indicators of poor health, such as elevated blood glucose and blood fats. Recent experimental evidence suggests that breaking up sitting time throughout the day with light-intensity activity (ie. walking) results in lower blood glucose and blood fat levels than sitting for prolonged periods without activity breaks. However, it is not known whether short-duration bouts of standing, of comparable frequency, can elicit similar metabolic benefits to those observed with treadmill walking. Consequently, this study aims to test the acute (7-hour) effect of prolonged sitting on glucose metabolism and vascular function with and without intermittent breaks of standing.</summary>
