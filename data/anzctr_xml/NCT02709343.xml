    <summary>This study is designed for lung transplant patients who have developed chronic lung allograft
      dysfunction (CLAD). Consented patients will receive 4 intravenous doses of allogeneic,
      bone-marrow-derived MSCs (2*10^6 cells/kg/dose) or matching placebo over a period of 2 weeks
      with a 12 month follow up.</summary>
