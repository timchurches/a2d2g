Virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment within the window of the visit of interest. Plasma samples were collected for HIV-1 RNA at Week 0 (Day 1), Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Treatment with DTG + RPV were declared non-inferior to CAR if the lower end of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two groups in response rates at Week 48 lies above -10% by Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test. The Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) population consisted of all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug.</outcome>

             R263K in any available prior resistance genotype assay results. Note: Any prior
             genotypic resistance testing is not required but if available it must be provided to
             GlaxoSmithKline, after screening and before randomization, to provide direct evidence
             of no pre-existing exclusionary resistance mutations. You must wait for the study

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the participant's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine if virologically suppressed, human immunodeficiency
      virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adults on an antiretroviral regimen (including 2 nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus a third agent) remain suppressed upon switching
      to a two-drug regimen with dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV). The study will primarily
      assess the non-inferiority antiviral activity of switching to DTG + RPV once daily compared
      to continuation of current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) up to Week 48 with a switch visit for
      eligible subjects in the CAR group to initiate DTG + RPV therapy at Week 52. CAR will include
      2 NRTIs plus 1 HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (INI), or 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NNRTI), or 1 protease inhibitor (PI). The study will include a 148-week open-label
      treatment phase, comprising of an Early Switch Phase (Day 1 to Week 52) and a Late Switch
      Phase (Week 52 to Week 148). The participants fulfilling the study eligibility criteria will
      participate in the Early Switch Phase where they will either switch from their CAR to DTG +
      RPV, or continue taking their CAR, until Week 52. At the end of Early Switch Phase, eligible
      participants will proceed to the Late Switch Phase where all participants in both DTG + RPV
      and CAR treatment groups will receive DTG + RPV therapy until Week 148. After Week 148,
      subjects may be eligible to continue to receive DTG +RPV in the Continuation Phase. The study
      is planned to be conducted in approximately 476 participants.</summary>
