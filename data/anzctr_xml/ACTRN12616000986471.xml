  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will receive 8 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation coupled with 8 weeks of behaviour change intervention. The 8 week pulmonary rehabilitation program will consist of 2 supervised exercise training sessions a week. Each session will comprise 20 to 30 minutes of walking training and resistance exercises for the lower and upper limbs. These exercise training programs are considered usual care and are run by physiotherapists. In addition to pulmonary rehabilitation, participants in this study will be requested to attend weekly (i.e. total of 8), face-to-face, educational and goal-setting consultations (i.e. the behaviour intervention). These sessions will occur either immediately before or after a supervised exercise training class once a week. Each weekly consultation will last approximately 30 minutes. Participants will be asked to wear an activity tracker called the "UP2" (Jawbone, USA) for 2 to 3 days before each weekly consultation. During the weekly consultation, data from the activity tracker will be downloaded and reviewed. Each participant will receive counselling, using their own UP2 data, with the goal of reducing their sedentary time and increasing participation in physical activity at any intensity. The specific intervention message will be if you have been sitting continuously for 30 minutes, stand up and move for 2 minutes. Strategies to assist the participants achieve this goal will include motivational interviewing, feedback, vibration prompts from the UP2 and ideas to overcome barriers. A similar intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing sedentary time in healthy older adults, aged between 60 and 92 years. Attendance to weekly consultations will be documented so that adherence can be monitored.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility / uptake of adding a behaviour change intervention to a standard pulmonary rehabilitation program (composite primary outcome). During the assessments and intervention period, feasibility / uptake will be measured by taking notes of (i) the proportion of people who were approached to participate who consent to participate (ii) the proportion of people who commenced the intervention and also completed the intervention; (iii) the average number of sessions attended by the sample; (iv) the proportion of people who completed baseline assessments, post-intervention assessments and each component of the intervention; and (v) the proportion of people who reported adverse events such as skin irritation associated with monitor use.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sedentary time and walking-based physical activity (composite secondary outcome). These will be assessed by the ActivPAL (PAL Technologies Ltd, UK). Participants will be asked to wear the monitor for 7 consecutive days, throughout waking hours. They will be instructed to remove the monitor to sleep and during showering and swimming activities. Data collected over these 7 days will be averaged for analysis. The ActivPAL is a small (0.7 x 5.3 x 3.5 cm) and lightweight (20 g) uniaxial monitor that has been validated to assess physical activity in people with COPD. The monitor attaches to the anterior aspect of the right thigh and combines data pertaining to gravitational acceleration and acceleration from segmental movement of the thigh. Time spent in sedentary behaviour is detected as time spent in supine and sitting.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations have not been undertaken as the main purpose of this study is to collect pilot data to inform sample size calculations for a future project grant. We will aim to include 12 participants. To account for possible attrition, we will inflate the sample size by 25% when recruiting participants. Therefore, the number of participants recruited will be 15. All analyses will be performed using the SPSS, version 24.0. Normality in the distribution of data will be checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between baseline and post-intervention data will be assessed using either paired t-tests or the Wilcoxon test. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. </statisticalmethods>
