Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Fingolimod 1.25 mg - Participants received 1.25 mg fingolimod orally once a day for up to 24 months during the core phase. In the Extension phase participants continued to receive 1.25 mg fingolimod orally once a day.
Note: Upon implementation of a protocol amendment all patients taking 1.25 mg fingolimod were switched to 0.5 mg fingolimod orally once a day.

Experimental: Fingolimod 0.5 mg - Participants received 0.5 mg fingolimod orally once a day for up to 24 months during the core phase. In the Extension phase participants continued to receive 0.5 mg fingolimod orally once a day.

Experimental: Placebo - Participants received placebo capsules orally once a day for up to 24 months during the core phase. In the Extension phase participants received either 1.25 or 0.5 mg fingolimod orally once a day.
Note: Upon implementation of a protocol amendment all patients taking 1.25 mg fingolimod were switched to 0.5 mg fingolimod orally once a day. Upon implementation of a protocol amendment, all patients taking placebo were switched to 0.5 mg fingolimod orally once a day.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aggregate Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) Estimate up to Month 24 - ARR is the average number of relapses in a year calculated by negative binomial regression as the sum of confirmed relapses of all patients in the group divided by the sum of the number of days on study of all patients in the group and multiplied by 365.25.
A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (&lt;37.5C) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by the Independent Evaluating Physician (examining neurologist).
ARR estimates were calculated from a negative binomial regression model adjusted for treatment, pooled center, number of relapses in the previous 2 years prior to enrollment, and Baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS).</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Free of 3-month Confirmed Disability Progression at Month 24 and End of Study - Disability progression was defined using the following criteria: One point increase from baseline in patients with Baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point increase from Baseline in patients with Baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. A 3-month confirmed disability progression was defined as a 3-month sustained increase from Baseline in EDSS score. The EDSS quantifies disability in multiple sclerosis in 8 functional systems; the score ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). Progression curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Free of 6-month Confirmed Disability Progression at Month 24 and End of Study - Disability progression was defined using the following criteria: One point increase from baseline in patients with Baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point increase from Baseline in patients with Baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. A 6-month confirmed disability progression was defined as a 6-month sustained increase from Baseline in EDSS score.

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Relapse-free up to Month 24 - Estimates of the percentage of participants relapse-free at 24 months were generated from Kaplan-Meier curves of the time to first relapse. A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (&lt;37.5C) or infection. A relapse was confirmed by an Independent Evaluating Physician.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Z-score - The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is a multidimensional clinical outcome measure that includes quantitative tests of leg function/ambulation (Timed 25-Foot Walk), arm function (9-Hole Peg Test), and cognitive function (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test). The overall MSFC z-score as an average of the three standardized scores derived using baseline data pooled over each treatment arm as reference population. Higher scores reflect better neurological function and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
