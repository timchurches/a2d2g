    <interventions>This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors as prophylaxis against pandemic influenza infection in patients who are prescribed a long term course in the context of a place of employment or profession. The study is observational only.
The recommended adult dosage of oseltamivir for prophylaxis is 75mg once daily for seven days however safety and efficacy has been demonstrated for up to six weeks.  Zanamivir prophylaxis consists of 2 x 5mg doses (inhalations) once daily.  This study does not stipulate the dose or duration of the prophylaxis, this will be determined by the treating physician.  Within the pandemic environment these listed doses or durations may be different.  This study is observational only. 
The Australian Pandemic Plan outlines that all "workers" at risk of pandemic influenza will be treated with prophylaxis.  The workers at risk includes medical staff, border control and customs staff etc. 
The duration of observation is 6 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of symptomatic pandemic influenza in patients receiving prophylaxis.
All data will be collected on electronic case report forms.  Data includes collection of laboratory and adverse event results to assess evidence of pandemic influenza.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Seroconversion to pandemic influenza.
All data will be collected on electronic case report forms.  Data includes collection of laboratory and adverse event results to assess evidence of pandemic influenza. 
All (any) adverse events thought to be related to the NA inhibitor prophylaxis will be collected.  These may include gastro-intestinal upsets, fatigue, sneezing, nausea, rash, basically any event that occurs post-prophylaxis that cannot be definitely ruled out as having a causal relationship.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>

      <outcome>The incidence of adverse events
All data will be collected on electronic case report forms.  Data includes collection of laboratory and adverse event results to assess evidence of pandemic influenza. 
All (any) adverse events thought to be related to the NA inhibitor prophylaxis will be collected.  These may include gastro-intestinal upsets, fatigue, sneezing, nausea, rash, basically any event that occurs post-prophylaxis that cannot be definitely ruled out as having a causal relationship.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. the relative effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis.

2. Please specify how each of these outcomes will be measured i.e. what assessment tools/questionaires/tests will be used?   
All data will be collected on electronic case report forms.  Data includes collection of laboratory and adverse event results to assess evidence of pandemic influenza. 
3. Please include examples of adverse effects that you will be measuring.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors as prophylaxis against pandemic influenza infection in patients who are prescribed a long term course in the context of a place of employment or profession. The study is observational only. The primary measure used in this study will be the incidence of symptomatic pandemic influenza in patients receiving prophylaxis. Seroconversion to pandemic influenza, the incidence of adverse events and the relative effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis will also be examined. This project will commence upon pandemic influenza being declared in Australia, Hong Kong or Singapore. Data will be analysed as quickly as possible to help inform the continued use of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy as a cornerstone of the public health agency response to pandemic influenza.</summary>
