    <interventions>This study is designed to provide high quality feasibility data for a future multi-centre cluster randomized cross-over study. Children attending Starship Childrens Hospital, who require IV fluids will be assigned to use either 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte 148 (Registered Trademark) as the primary crystalloid fluid therapy in a blinded fashion, in alternating four week blocks.  Blinded study fluid will be used for fluid therapy in situations where the two study fluids are regarded as equivalent by the treating clinician, and will be administered for all resuscitation and maintenance fluid for up to 28 days after enrollment.  Both 0.9% saline and Plasma-Lyte 148 (Registered Trademark) will be available for open-label administration in the rare situations, where, in the opinion of the treating specialist, there is a clinical indication for one fluid or the other. 

As per standard practice in children, the blinded study fluids will be available with and without added glucose, and the glucose will be clearly labelled on the bags as per current labeling guidelines. The amount and rate of fluid administration, along with the concentration of glucose will be determined by the clinicians managing the patient according to clinical need and in line with Starship Hospital's recommended best practice guidelines.

The daily amount of all intravenous fluids administered (both blinded study fluid, open label crystaloids and other fluids such as blood products), will be recorded in the case report form for all participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>This feasibility study will compare 2 standard therapies, so the use of the term 'control' may be slightly misleading. In Starship hospital, 0.9% Saline is more frequently administered than Plasmalyte (although for many children's hospitals the contrary is true). Therefore 0.9% saline will be denoted control.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>As a feasibility trial, primary and secondary outcomes are of similar importance. length of hospital stay has been chosen as the primary outcome, but the main trial to follow may use a different primary outcome based on the data and outcomes obtained from analysis of this trial. Data to calculate length of hospital stay (date and time of admission and discharge) will be collected by the research nurses and entered into the case report form. The hospital clinical information system data will be used to examine for large discrepancies in the 'data validation' phase, prior to analysis.</outcome>

    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Analyses of clinical outcome will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. As a feasibility study we will investigate various methodologies for analysis of the data. The distribution of the primary outcome of length of stay is expected to be highly skewed, which may be best suited to transformation into a more normal distribution suitable for more standard parametric analysis, or may be better suited to methods that allow for the skew such as generalised linear modelling. Multivariable modelling to adjust for Primary outcome will undergo log transformation and confirmation of normality prior to parametric analysis. 

Binomial outcomes will be assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with as associations described using Odds Ratios and 95%confidence intervals (CI) while continuous outcomes will be analysed using generalised linear modelling (GLM) and reported as either mean differences (with 95%CI) or ratios (with 95%CI) as appropriate. Sensitivity analysis will be performed adjusting for an a-priori defined list of covariates (baseline serum creatinine level, medical or surgical, ICU, elective admission, diagnostic criteria) will be undertaken. Other continuous and binomial outcomes will be investigated similarly, and odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals calculated. All analyseis will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA) or JMP version 11 and a two-sided p-value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.

This study will provide data to better allow statistical modelling of the number of clusters required, and the overall sample size for a future large scale multi-centre cluster randomised cross-over study. From the study groups we will ascertain estimates of the distribution/variation of the outcome measures, across various hospital environments, under the specific conditions of this study protocol. The degree of variation between hospital environments may provide a useful insight into how much level of variation can exist between different centres. Power and sample size calculations for a future cluster randomized crossover study, based upon the data of this study, will be undertaken using published methods such as that of Reich et al.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The administration of intravenous (IV) fluid is an extremely common therapy in children requiring hospital care.  Recent research strongly suggests we must increase the concentration of sodium in intravenous fluid routinely given to hospitalised children, in order to minimise the potentially dangerous complication of low serum sodium concentration. Hence, fluids currently considered appropriate to administer for ongoing IV fluid maintenance include 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte (Registered Trademark) 148.

0.9% saline and Plasma-Lyte 148 have both been routinely administered to children as IV bolus resuscitation (10-20 mls/kg given over 5-30 minutes) fluid for decades. The choice of which fluid is administered is largely dependent on the institution and the prescribing habits of individual clinicians. For example, children in Victoria commonly receive Plasma-Lyte  148, while those in New South Wales commonly receive 0.9% Saline. Theoretical benefits have been attributed to Plasma-Lyte 148 over 0.9% saline, but current clinical data is insufficient to recommend one of these fluids over the other. Recent research has also supported that fluids containing 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte 148 should be routinely given for ongoing IV fluid maintenance in children, in addition to their current use for IV bolus fluids. Once again there is insufficient clinical data to recommend one fluid over the other, despite IV fluid prescription being the second most common prescription to occur in children admitted to hospital (second to analgesia/anti-pyretics). Plasma-Lyte 148 is considerably more expensive than 0.9% saline. Thus there is an urgent need for an interventional trial comparing 0.9% saline to Plasma-Lyte 148 for both IV fluid bolus and maintenance therapy in children admitted to hospital. The results of such a study will widely inform national and international fluid prescribing guidelines for children.

This study will assign two clusters of participants by alternating treatments over consecutive time periods. It is designed to provide high quality feasibility data for a future multi-centre cluster randomized cross-over study of the same design. Children attending Starship Childrens Hospital, who require IV fluids will be assigned to use either 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte 148 as the primary crystalloid fluid therapy in a blinded fashion, in alternating four week blocks.  Blinded study fluid will be used for fluid therapy in situations where the two study fluids are regarded as equivalent by the treating clinician. Children require varying amounts of glucose within the fluid administered, thus both glucose and non-glucose containing versions of the study fluids will be available and clearly labelled. As per current practice, clinicians will be able to add extra glucose and/or potassium to intravenous fluid bags.</summary>
