    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Pimasertib
Treatment: drugs - Dacarbazine

Experimental: Pimasertib - 

Active Comparator: Dacarbazine - 


Treatment: drugs: Pimasertib
Pimasertib will be administered as oral capsule at a dose of 60 milligram (mg) twice daily continuously. Treatment will consist of repeated 21-day cycles which will be continued until progression of the disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or death, whichever comes first.

Treatment: drugs: Dacarbazine
Dacarbazine will be administered intravenously at dose of 1000 mg per square meter of body surface area on Day 1 of each 21-days cycle. Treatment will be continued until progression of the disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or death, whichever comes first.
Eligible subjects with documented tumor progression on dacarbazine will be offered to switch to pimasertib treatment at the end of the treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Subjects with measurable, histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced
             or metastatic cutaneous melanoma (stage III c or M1ac) N-Ras mutated. If N-Ras
             mutational status is unknown at screening, it must be prospectively defined before
             inclusion. If N-Ras mutational status is already known before screening, it must be
             retrospectively confirmed after inclusion by the sponsor.

          2. Tumor lesions amenable to biopsy or available tumor tissue as archival samples.

          3. Age = 18 years.

          4. Has read and understood the informed consent form and is willing and able to give
             informed consent. Fully understands requirements of the trial and willing to comply
             with all trial visits and assessments.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test at the
             screening visit. For the purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential are
             defined as: "All female subjects after puberty unless they are post-menopausal for at
             least two years, or are surgically sterile".

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of
             childbearing potential must be willing to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate method
             of contraception for 2 weeks prior to, during and four weeks after the last dose of
             trial medication. Effective contraception is defined as the method of contraception
             with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Adequate contraception is defined as
             follows: two barrier methods or one barrier method with a spermicidal or intrauterine
             device or oral contraception for female partners of male subjects.</inclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial of pimasertib versus
      dacarbazine aimed to confirm the activity of pimasertib in previously untreated subjects with
      N-Ras mutated locally advanced or metastatic malignant cutaneous melanoma by comparing the
      progression-free survival (PFS) of subjects treated with either pimasertib or dacarbazine and
      by getting a better understanding of the efficacy, safety, pharmacogenomics (PGx) and their
      relationship with pimasertib exposure.</summary>
