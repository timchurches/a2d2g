  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change in Bone Level (Distance B) After 6 Months Compared to Baseline (=Surgery) - The primary aim is to measure the bone level change between mesial and distal aspects of the implant at 6 months post implantation. The reference point for the bone level measurement is the implant shoulder.</outcome>
