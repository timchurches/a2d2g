    <interventions>randomized controlled study 
54 school children (age 10.14-14.11) in Switzerland were randomly assigned to participate twice weekly at a guided strength training programme for 19 weeks. Spontaneous physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE; 3-axial accelerometry for 7 days), leg and arm strength and body composition (DEXA) were measured at baseline, after 19 weeks of training intervention and after  three months of wash out. The intervention consisted of an individualised maximum strength training programme for the whole body. Seven basic multiple-joint exercises were performed as a circuit in groups of two: Leg press, lunges with short dumb-bell, low back on back-bank or on mat, waist diagonal on mat, rowing exercise with short dumb-bell, bench-press with long dumb-bell, over-head-press with long/short dumb-bell. After the children were introduced to their exercise programme and had mastered the proper technique, the training loads were individually adapted (muscle fatigue) once per week to optimise strength and power gains. The training took place during two of the three regular 45 minuts PE classes over a period of 19 weeks, with group size of 18 children administered by two exercise physiologists. To monitor adherence, all pupils had to protocol all exercises (time under load, repetitions, weigth).</interventions>

48 school children (age 10.14-14.11) in Switzerland took PE-lessons twice weekly for 19 weeks. Spontaneous physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE; 3-axial accelerometry for 7 days), leg and arm strength and body composition (DEXA) were measured at baseline, after 19 weeks and after  three months. Physical education classes were conducted by a physical education teacher acording to the grade specific curriculum which include all physical activities while respecting the physical and mental and social well-being and take 45 minuts each. One exercise physiologist is supervising a class with about 18 children. Session attendance was protocolled by the teacher.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In the intervention group, compared to the control group, PAEE increased by a 10% from baseline to end of training in boys (p = 0.019), but not in girls. Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) was objectively measured for 7 consecutive days by a body-fixed triaxial accelerometer (RT3, Stayhealthy, Monrovia, California) in all participants. The accelerometer was worn following the manufacturers instructions at all times, except during sleeping hours and when taking a bath or a shower. Measurements of physical activity energy expenditure were analysed by a single blinded examinator.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Leg and arm strength were increased due to training intervention in both boys and girls. Maximum strength of leg extension (leg press) and arm muscles (breast press) were tested by 1 RM testing (RM = repetition maximum). After a short standardized warm-up the participant performed the test with the maximum possible resistance (weight). All performance tests were conducted by a single examiner (R.P.).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM) were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, Hologic Discovery Wi)
Boys: Age corrected LBM slightly increased in the intervention group from baseline to the end of training intervention, however when comparing the groups LBM was unchanged. Age corrected relative FM was unchanged across the study and between the groups. 
Girls:Age corrected LBM was decreased in the intervention group at the end of the training period (ns) and increased in the control group (ns), the differences between the groups being significant (p=0.02). At the end of training intervention relative FM significantly increased in the intervention group compared to the control group (p=0.03).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>As a result of the intervention, we expect an increase in spontaneous activity of 10-15%. With 40 probands and a co-variance coefficient in the activity measurement of 8% (our own data), there is a probability of 90% that a significant difference (p = 0.05) can be measured between the groups.
Students t-test was used to test differences between groups and univariate relationships were assessed with Pearson correlation analysis. Multiple regression analysis was used to test associations independently from possible confounding factors. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During the last fifty years, lifestyles changed from being physically active to being predominantly sedentary and inactive. Today, the majority of girls and a large proportion of boys fail to meet the minimum target of 60 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity (PA) per day. Furthermore, PA declines as children get older. Recently we have shown in children with Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS), as well as in healthy junior ice hockey players, that individually targeted strength training induces increased spontaneous PA outside of training. The main objective of this randomised controlled intervention study was to assess whether participation in a structured individualised strength training programme 2 hours per week would increase spontaneous daily PA outside of training in normal school children. We could show that a targeted strength training programme during regular school PE lessons increases the daily amount of spontaneous PA behaviour in children before puberty and that the strength training programme was most efficient for the children with the lowest PA at the beginning. The declining physical activity among children could be reversed if more specifically targeted PE classes, for example including strength training, were to become an integral part of physical education.</summary>
