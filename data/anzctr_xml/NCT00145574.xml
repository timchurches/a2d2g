    <summary>This study will evaluate the lipid-lowering effect and safety of colesevelam therapy
      administered to heterozygous familial pediatric patients 10 through 17 years of age who are
      on a stable dose of a pediatric-approved statin monotherapy (atorvastatin, lovastatin,
      simvastatin or pravastatin), or who are treatment naive to lipid-lowering therapy.</summary>
