  <interventions>
    <interventions>QUT has developed a methodology for community engagement and consultation based on design thinking and facilitated by an interactive booth (known as the InstaBooth), containing different kinds of interactive opportunities (e.g. pin-boards for post-it notes, drawing surfaces, interactive screens, projectors, cameras, small printers, scanners, digitising pens). This community engagement strategy invites participants to leave messages, share comments, memories, drawings or photos with the general public to foster discussion about a specific topic. This study intends to install the InstaBooth for a 2-week period into the outpatient department of Cancer Care Services at the study site to engage consumers, carers, healthcare workers and visitors to the hospital to share their experiences and suggestions for improving hand hygiene practices and/or reducing healthcare-associated infections. The InstaBooth installation with be supervised by nursing staff and members of the research team during opening hours. Research staff will inform healthcare workers, consumers, carers and visitors to the hospital about the InstaBooth by displaying posters, handing out flyers, newsletters, social media and/or TV interviews and will supervise the InstaBooth during the two-week installation period and be available to answer any questions potential participants may have about the study and/or InstaBooth. Consumers, carers, healthcare workers and/or visitors to the hospital who choose to interact with the InstaBooth, will be able to provide feedback using whichever aspect of the booth they choose.

QUT and Metro North Hospital and Health Service Consumer Engagement will also facilitate two-three collaborative workshops to be held before and after the InstaBooth installation to ensure the project (composition of InstaBooth components, data collection, data analysis and intervention development) is participant-centred from its inception. These collaborative workshops will invite consumers, carers and/or healthcare workers to share their experiences about a specific healthcare problem to inform the development of possible solutions. The workshops will be 2-8hrs in duration, depending on the stage of intervention design and preferences of the participants. The first workshop will occur within 1 month prior to InstaBooth installation. This workshop will ask participants to suggest topics/research questions that could inform the development of interactive components of the InstaBooth, that aim to engage the public about sharing their experiences and suggestions for improving hand hygiene practices and/or reducing healthcare-associated infections. The second and final workshops will facilitate co-analysis of the data collected from the InstaBooth by workshop participants and inform the development of possible solutions to improve hand hygiene practices and/or reduce healthcare-associated infections across the hospital. The second and final workshops will occur 3-8 weeks post InstaBooth removal and may be combined or held separately; dependent on the collaborative decision of the workshop participants. The workshop facilitators are qualified researchers who have completed their PhD and have experience in qualitative research. The workshop facilitators have previously led similar workshops in conjunction with the InstaBooth to promote community engagement on other topics, such as urban planning and domestic violence. Their role in the workshops for this study will involve employing design thinking and EBCD strategies to promote participant engagement, guide data analysis and intervention design. 

Once the workshops are completed, one of the possible solutions developed during this project will be implemented into Cancer Care Services, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital as part of a separate study.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>As a pilot study, the main outcome is feasibility. Feasibility will be established by a composite analysis of participant demand; acceptability; implementation; practicality; adaptation; integration; expansion; and limited-efficacy testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Feasibility for the InstaBooth installation will be assessed during its two-week installation period by data collected from InstaBooth participants using surveys and/or semi-structured interviews and a detailed log book of all tasks, processes, organisational requirements, additional equipment or staff time utilised during this project. The InstaBooth will be installed at the study site in 2017. 

Feasibility for the collaborative workshops will be assessed by data collected from workshop participants, using surveys and/or semi-structured interviews during 2017. 

The Health Service Co-Design Framework: engage, plan, explore, develop, decide and change (Boyd, McKernon &amp; Old, 2010) and the EBCD toolkit (The King's Fund, 2013) guided the development of interview questions and a survey instrument specifically for this study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate whether InstaBooth participants prefer to share their healthcare experiences and provide feedback using the InstaBooth, compared to completing patient experience surveys (standard practice).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Directly after participating in the InstaBooth, invite participants to provide feedback about their experience through a semi-structured interview and/or survey. Interview questions and survey items were specifically developed for this study using an EBCD framework. </timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Consumers and/or carers were invited via the Metro North Hospital &amp; Healthcare Service Consumer Registry to participate in the collaborative workshops for this study. There are no set inclusion criteria to participate in the collaborative workshops, however it is desirable to engage consumers and/or carers who had experienced healthcare-associated infection/s, observed poor hand hygiene practices or were interested in developing possible solutions to these healthcare solutions. Healthcare workers who were employed by Cancer Care Services at the study site were invited to participate in the collaborative workshops.

There are no set inclusion criteria to participate in the InstaBooth during its two-week installation. It is an interactive booth open to the public.</inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Given the intent of the InstaBooth installation is to achieve a maximal participation rate and assess the feasibility of this community engagement method, no sample size calculation was needed.

The sample size for the collaborative workshops was determined based on the previous experiences of the QUT workshop facilitators, who have led several collaborative workshops using design thinking strategies. The QUT workshop facilitators have previous found that workshops with four to eight participants aid collaborations between participants and the development of possible solutions for the topic of interest. Thus, we will invite between four to eight consumers, carers and/or healthcare workers to attend each of the workshops for this study.

Participant demand of the InstaBooth and collaborative workshops will be assessed using counts and percentages. Participant experiences measured in the semi-structured interviews for the InstaBooth installation and workshops will be analysed using thematic analysis. Survey data collected from workshop and InstaBooth participants will be analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.

A detailed log book will be kept of all tasks, processes, organisational requirements, additional equipment or staff time utilised throughout this study. Descriptive data will be analysed from these log book records to determine whether the implementation, practicality, adaptation and integration of the InstaBooth was feasible.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall objective of this study is to pilot test the feasibility of a community and consumer engagement strategy using design thinking and EBCD methodologies in the healthcare setting. This study aims to invite consumers, carers, healthcare workers and/or visitors to the hospital to attend collaborative workshops and/or the InstaBooth (an interactive booth) to share their experiences and suggestions for improving hand hygiene practices and/or reducing hospital-acquired infections and inform the design of possible solutions to these healthcare problems. After data analysis is completed, one of the possible solutions designed in the collaborative workshops will be implemented at the study site and its impact will be evaluated.</summary>
