  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of nadolol vs placebo; 2 phases of 3 months each with 2-week washout. Nadolol will be commenced at 40mg daily, increasing to 80mg after 1 week. Nadolol and placebo will be dispensed in a form that is indistinguishable. Patients will be re-assessed at 2 weeks after beginning each 3-month phase and, if necessary, the dose of nadolol adjusted to achieve a target resting pulse rate of 60 beats per minute or a 20% reduction in baseline resting pulse rate. This adjustment will be made by an unblinded third-party clinician who is not involved with end-point measurements. The patients and investigators will remain blinded to the treatment allocation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Liver cirrhosis is associated with significant changes in energy metabolism and body composition. Increased resting energy expenditure (REE) is commonly found and is an independent predictor of reduced survival. Short-term intravenous infusion of beta-blockers can reduce REE in cirrhotic patients indicating the potential for long-term beta-blockade to modulate the metabolic and nutritional consequences of cirrhosis. We hypothesised that oral beta-blockade over the longer term will reduce REE. The present randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study aims to determine if 3-month treatment with oral beta-blockers can reduce REE in cirrhotic patients. A positive result from this study would provide a strong rationale for further investigation of their potential for improving survival and reducing the demand for liver transplantation.</summary>
