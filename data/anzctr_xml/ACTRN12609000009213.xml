  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomized trial of 6 lessons of Internet based education for people who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days (each lesson will involve homework, an online discussion forum assignment, email contact with clinicians, and an online reading assignment, requiring up to 4 hours/week) vs wait-list control. The lessons will be completed by participants online in their own homes. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, beginning of the first lesson, 1-week poststudy, and 6 months follow-up. The educational materials are based on cognitive behavioural techniques. Once Education Group participants have completed the 6 lessons the Wait-List group participants will begin the lessons.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will examine the efficacy of an Internet based education program for improving the mental health of people with depression. Participants will be recruited via a website developed for this Program (www.climateclinic.tv), and a structured diagnostic interview via telephone. Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to an active Education Group, or Wait-List Control Group. Participants will complete six lessons of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based education delivered via the Internet and weekly emails from a clinician, weekly homework, and weekly contact with other participants via an online discussion board. Participants will be assessed at application, prestudy, one week poststudy, and 6 months poststudy. Once the Education Group have completed the lessons the Control Group will be given access to the lessons.</summary>
