    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Ecteinascidin 743 may be an effective treatment for solid tumors.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of ecteinascidin 743 in treating children
      who have refractory solid tumors.</summary>
