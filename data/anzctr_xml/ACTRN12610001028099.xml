  <interventions>
    <interventions>The efficacy and safety of 2 drugs used by the control program as anti-malarial standard treatment, artesunate and DHA-PIP, will be assessed separately in 2 different groups of patients in 2 different study sites. Malaria patients in Yingjiang, Dehong site will receive co-formulated DHA-PIP for 3 days. Patients in Menglian site will receive Artesunate for 7 days.
All drugs will be given by oral route.
Artesunate will be administered at a total dose of 16 mg/kgbw over 7 days (1st day: 4 mg/kgbw, 2nd to 7th days: 2 mg/kgbw/day). 
Dydroartimisinin- piperquine(DHA-PIP) dose is a dose of 2mg/kg/day DHA and 16mg/kg/day PIP for 3 days.
The WHO 28 day in vivo protocol, used in this study, consists of parasite count and temperature measurements at baseline (day0 before dosing) and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This surveillance study is a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated malaria. The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PIP) and artesunate (AS7) monotherapy for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 2 sites Dehong and Menglian, Puer, Yunnan province in China.  The WHO 28-day in vivo protocol will be used.  People with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with the ACT DHA-PIP or 7-day artesunate monotherapy and monitored weekly for 28 days. The follow-up consists of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these assessments, the patients will be classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the follow-up period will be used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis will be used to distinguish between a true recrudescence or reinfection.  The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of China in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.</summary>
