A radiofrequency ablation catheter, IntelliTip MiFi XP, will be used to deliver energy to the cardiac tissue to create a line of scar (through heat) to the cavotricuspid isthmus in patients with Type I atrial flutter.  The total procedure duration may last 1-5 hours, but typically does not take longer than 2 hours. A participant in the trial will undergo the procedure 1 time and will be seen at one week following the procedure to evaluate the participant.  </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ablation procedure uses tools called catheters to treat the atrial flutter.  Ablation catheters are thin, flexible plastic tubes that use electrical energy to stop abnormal heart rhythms by heating (ablating) and destroying a small area of tissue to break the abnormal pathway. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, performance and effectiveness (success) of a new ablation catheter that is used to treat atrial flutter.  The new catheter is called the Intellitip MiFi XP Ablation Catheter.  The catheter is made by the company Boston Scientific Corporation, who is also the sponsor of this research study.  </summary>
