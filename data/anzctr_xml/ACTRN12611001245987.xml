    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and he/she or a parent/guardian (in case of children) consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, 28 (for artemether-lumefantrine and chloroquine) and 35 and 42 (for artesunate-mefloquine).</concealment>

    <summary>Title:Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and chloroquine for vivax malaria in Mu-se Township, Northern Shan State and Kalay-Ta-mu townships, Sagaing Region, Myanmar.

Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in Myanmar to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and chloroquine for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax. 

Objective: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, and chloroquine for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax in Mu-se Township, Northern Shan State and Kalay-Ta-mu townships, Sagaing Region.

Methods: participants will be febrile people above 6 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum or P. vivax infection. Patients will be treated with artemether-lumefantrine twice a day over 3 days or artesunate-mefloquine over 3 days or chloroquine daily for 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored either over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate artemether-lumefantrine and chloroquine efficacies or over a 42-day follow-up to evaluate artesunate-mefloquine efficacy.  
The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Myanmar in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum malariaand vivax malaria.</summary>
