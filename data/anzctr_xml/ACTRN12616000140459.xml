  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observation of exhaled nitric oxide immediately before and then 15 minutes after 400 micrograms of inhaled salbutamol (4 puffs of participants' usual reliever medication).  Exhaled nitric oxide measurement required participants to blow out through a tube at a constant flow rate using visual feedback from a computer screen giving a target flow rate.  Exhaled nitric oxide measurements were performed immediately before and then 15 minutes after the dose of inhaled salbutamol with no further follow-up.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in exhaled nitric oxide a was assessed by measurement of exhaled nitric oxide immediately before and 15 minutes after the dose of inhaled salbutamol.  Measurements were undertaken using a chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyser according to American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guidelines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately prior to and 15 min after dose of inhaled salbutamol.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in flow-independent exhaled nitric oxide parameter, JawNO (the maximal flux of nitric oxide from the airway compartment).  Measurements of exhaled nitric oxide were undertaken using a chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyser at multiple expiratory flow rates.  From these, JawNO was calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately prior to and 15 min after dose of inhaled salbutamol.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in flow-independent exhaled nitric oxide parameter, CANO (the distal airway/alveolar concentration of nitric oxide).  Measurements of exhaled nitric oxide were undertaken using a chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyser at multiple expiratory flow rates.  From these, CANO was calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately prior to and 15 min after dose of inhaled salbutamol.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is a marker of airway inflammation, and high levels are associated with greater responsiveness of airways disease to steroid treatment.  Studies have shown that, in the presence of narrowed airways in asthma, FENO levels can be reduced, but the effects in smoking related chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) are unknown.  This is important as we may be underestimating FENO levels in COPD patients who might otherwise benefit from steroid therapy.  We aim to perform FENO measurements in twenty COPD patients before and after bronchodilator (reliever) therapy, to test the hypothesis that FENO increases with wider airway calibre.</summary>
