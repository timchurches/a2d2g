  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention  Peer support based Cardiac-Diabetes Self-Management Program (CDSMP) consisting of three face-to-face sessions as well as telephone and text-messaging follow-up. The face-to-face sessions will be provided by a trained Research Nurse, conducted while the patients are in Coronary Care Unit, and be continued by trained peers* as the patient makes the transition home after discharge. Peers will firstly telephone the participants 1 week after discharge home and secondly send 2 text-messages a week after telephone follow up. *A peer is someone who has similar conditions to use their own experience to provide information (former patients, not health professionals).
The aims of the CDSMP are to achieve better knowledge, self-efficacy (confidence) levels in managing their conditions and better adherence to their self-management activities. However as this is a pilot study, the overall purpose of this study is to investigate feasibility and applicability of the study.
The frequency and overall duration of the intervention components are:
Face-to-face sessions with approx 30 minutes for each session after participants physical condition is stabilised (within 48 hours of admission), and be provided by a trained Research Nurse, commenced while the patients are in Coronary Care Unit, and to be continued by trained peers as the patient makes the transition home after discharge for up to 1 month. Peers will firstly telephone the participants 1 week after discharge home and send 2 text-messages (as reminders) a week after telephone follow up for up to 1 month after baseline.</interventions>

Allocation will be concealed by using sealed, numbered opaque envelopes, 
List generation will be provided by researcher off site,
After randomisation, patients are not blinded to 'intervention'; 
survey do not have group ID, thus data entry is blinded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with cardiac disease who have type 2 diabetes have higher readmission rates (22%) than those without diabetes (6%) (Wu &amp; Chang, 2008). Although self-management is an effective approach to achieve better health outcomes, there are no such programs specifically designed for patients with both conditions. Such programs need to be enhanced by user-friendly technology and supported by patient peers. This project aims to extend the development of a peer support based Cardiac-Diabetes Self-Management Program (CDSMP) by preparing a DVD to support persons' engagement in follow-up study.</summary>
