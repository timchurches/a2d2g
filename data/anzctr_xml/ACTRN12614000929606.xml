Haemodialysis (&gt;6hour treatment at a frequency of alternate nightly or greater = &gt;20hrs treatment/week) OR peritoneal dialysis (conventional ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or overnight automated peritoneal dialysis). Patients must be established on therapy for at least 3 months. Patients will be observed over one dialysis treatment and subsequent interdialytic period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date no prospective study has been undertaken to investigate the effect of haemodialysis dose delivery on the epidemiology and biological effect of blood pressure variability. This study represents the first comparative investigation between peritoneal dialysis, extended-hours
haemodialysis and conventional thrice-weekly satellite therapy, with the expectation of objectively demonstrating smoother and better control of blood pressure using home-based therapies. This study hypothesises that patients undergoing  therapies with high-dose dialysis achieve better control of blood pressure with less time spent in hypertensive ranges and less blood pressure variability than patients undergoing conventional thrice-weekly satellite haemodialysis</summary>
