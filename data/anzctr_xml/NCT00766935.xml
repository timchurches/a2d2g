  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to prove that the ImpSFB7+ (L-Dex U400) is equivalent to the
      Imp XCA device in assessing Lymphoedema. The Imp XCA device is a simple device capable of
      assessing Lymphoedema of a single arm. The ImpSFB7+ (L-Dex U400) is a more complex device
      capable of assessing Lymphoedema in a larger population of Lymphoedema sufferers. The
      ImpSFB7+ (L-Dex U400) will be developed to assess patients with Lymphoedema in their arms or
      their legs. The Imp XCA and Imp SFB7 are both TGA approved devices. The Imp SFB7+ (L-Dex
      U400) is similar to the Imp SFB7 the changes are to the software and user interface.</summary>
