      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS)-29 Physical Score - The 29-item MSIS-29 is a disease-specific participant-reported outcome measure that has been developed and validated to examine the physical and psychological impact of MS from a patient's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. Responses use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. All questions are to be answered. The physical well being assessment portion of the MSIS-29 consists of 20 questions in which participants rate the impact of MS on their day-to-day life during the past two weeks from 1=no impact to 5=extreme impact for a total score of 20-100. A lower total score indicates less physically-related impact while a higher total score indicates greater physically-related impact on a participant's functioning. Observed data after participants switched to alternative MS medications or after Amendment 3 took effect are excluded.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Mental Component Score (MCS) - The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey. The questions were combined, scored, and weighted to create two scales that provide glimpses into mental and physical functioning and overall health-related-quality of life. MCS computed using the scores of 12 questions and range from 0 to 100, where a 0 score indicates the lowest level of health and 100 indicates the highest level of health. Observed data after participants switched to alternative MS medications or after Amendment 3 took effect are excluded.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Euro Quality of Life (EQ-5D) Index Score - The EQ-5D is a participant-answered questionnaire scoring 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Scores of 1, 2, or 3 are possible responses for each of 5 questions (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=severe problems). A scoring formula developed by the EuroQol Group is then used to assign utility values for each participant's Health State Profile. A summary index score (EQ-5D index score) is derived from the 5 questions by conversion with this scoring formula and a table of scores. EQ-5D Summary Index values ranged from -0.6 (worst health state) to 1.00 (perfect health state). Observed data after participants switched to alternative MS medications or after Amendment 3 took effect are excluded.</outcome>

The scale was normalized to a scale of 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better health state. Observed data after participants switched to alternative MS medications or after Amendment 3 took effect are excluded.</outcome>
