  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study evaluates the effect of macitentan on right ventricular and hemodynamic properties
      in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Patients are treated with
      macitentan for 1 year. Patients undergo right heart catheterization (RHC) at baseline and
      Week 26. They also undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, Week 26 and
      Week 52. Safety is monitored throughout the study. The study has three stub-studies. Each
      patient can participate in no sub-study or in one sub-study. The sub-studies are: (1)
      metabolism sub-study (with PET-MR scans); (2) biopsy sub-study (biopsies taken during the
      RHC); (3) Echo sub-study.</summary>
