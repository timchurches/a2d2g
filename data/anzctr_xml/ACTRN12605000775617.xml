  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Abnormal tracking of the patella during knee joint movement, associated with imbalance of the pull of the inner quadriceps muscle (VM) and the outer quadriceps muscles (VL), has been proposed as a primary factor in anterior knee pain. Botulinum toxin (BTXA) can be used to reduce the relative overactivity in the VL muscle in addition to an exercise programme to strengthen the VM muscle in subjects with chronic anterior knee pain who had failed conservative management. We hypothesise that the combination of these therapies (BTXA and specific exercise for VM muscle control) has the potential to facilitate restoration of normal patello-femoral joint mechanics, particularly by restoring timing of onset of the VM muscle compared with VL, and consequently to reduce anterior knee pain and associated disability.</summary>
