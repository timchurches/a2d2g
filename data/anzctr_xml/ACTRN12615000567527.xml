  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether an accurate liver fat measurement, when reviewed by a surgeon, leads to changes in surgical approaches and hospital care that result in improved outcomes for colorectal metastases patients who require liver resection.

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have colorectal liver metastases requiring liver resection. 

Study details 
All patients enrolled in this safety and tolerability study will have a liver resection and will be assigned by chance to surgery with the surgeon having knowledge of accurate fat liver measurements or to surgery where the surgeon is not aware of the liver fat content prior to starting the surgery. Patient outcomes will then be assessed through medical records. It is hoped that this study will aid in developing strategies that could lead to better survival and health outcomes for colorectal metastases patients after liver resection.</summary>
