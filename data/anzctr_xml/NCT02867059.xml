    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - (+)-SJ000557733

Experimental: first dose - The dose used in the first cohort was determined on the basis of the safety and PK data generated in the FIM study (NCT02661373) currently ongoing in United States (US) and will be 150 mg.

Experimental: second dose - Depending on the pharmacodynamics data (effect of SJ733 on parasitaemia) obtained from this first cohort, the dose in Cohort 2 may be adjusted but will not exceed 600 mg.


Treatment: drugs: (+)-SJ000557733
(+)-SJ000557733 (SJ733), in short SJ733, will be the second PfATP4 inhibitor to enter clinical development after KAE609 (Novartis) which is currently in Phase 2 stage. KAE609 (cipargamin; previously known as NITD609) is a spirotetrahydro-ß-carbolines (spiroindolone). KAE609 inhibits QP15C20_SJ733_Challenge Protocol_v2.0_26July2016 Page 28 of 110 PfATP4, which results in a disruption of parasite sodium homeostasis. Compared to KAE609, SJ733 has the potential to be a very fast acting, antimalarial drug for human therapeutic application and may have a different safety profile in human participants. Finally, SJ733 blocks parasite transmission in vivo at potencies close to those where it is efficacious in blood stages, indicating its potential for transmission blockade in humans.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Activity of SJ733 treatment on clearance of malaria parasites will be monitored by PCR. - PCR monitoring of parasitaemia will occur AM/PM or AM at 84 h, 96 h, 120 h, and 144 h post initial SJ733 dose. Participants will return morning and evening until parasite counts are &lt;~500 parasites(p)/ml which is when sampling may revert to daily visits at the investigator's discretion.
When parasite counts are &lt;~200p/ml sampling may revert to alternate day visits at the investigator's discretion. Once the qPCR results are negative, or low and stable, the participants will be reviewed 3 times per week, coinciding with PK time-points where possible until rescue medication treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 16 days post dose or less if rescue medication is require earlier due to insufficient clearance of parasites by SJ733</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of SJ733 in healthy subjects (men and WNCBP) following infection with blood stage P. falciparum during the IBSM challenge study will be evaluated by observation of occurrence of adverse events, blood samples (incl. LFT, etc.).</outcome>
      <timepoint>for up to 25th day post SJ733 treatment or longer as determind by the principal investigator</timepoint>

          -  A history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to SJ733 or any of its excipients or artemether or other

             basis following approval by the Sponsor in consultation with the Investigator.) (Note:
             diazepam interferes with the analysis of blood levels of SJ733 and thus should not
             have been used for at least 8 weeks prior to administration of the study drug).

          -  Known severe reaction to mosquito bites other than local itching and redness.
             Participants are requested to refrain from taking non-approved concomitant medication

        Participants who are excluded from participation on study days for any of the above reasons
        may be eligible to participate on a postponed schedule if the Investigator considers this
        appropriate.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single-centre, open-label, study using induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) infection
      to characterize the activity of (+)-SJ000557733 or SJ733 for short, against early Plasmodium
      falciparum blood stage infection. The study will be conducted in two cohorts (n=8 per
      cohort). The anticipated efficacious dose range is expected to be within a range of 125 to
      600 mg. The dose used in the first cohort was determined on the basis of the safety and PK
      data generated in the FIM study (NCT02661373) currently ongoing in United States (US) and
      will be 150 mg. Depending on the pharmacodynamics data (effect of SJ733 on parasitaemia)
      obtained from this first cohort, the dose in Cohort 2 may be adjusted but will not exceed 600
      mg. Based on the PK from all three cohort from the FIM study, the median estimated dose to
      obtain the target SJ733 AUC of 13,000 (ug hr/L) is 370 mg. The dose of cohort 2 (=600mg) is
      intended to provide further concentration-response information in the human challenge model.

      For Cohort 2 only, a second dose of SJ733 may be administered at peak gametocytaemia to
      assess if SJ733 can reduce gametocytes and subsequent infectivity to mosquitoes (a washout of
      ~15 days post initial SJ733 treatment will be observed). Depending on the data obtained from
      the first two cohorts, there may be a subsequent cohort, with the investigated dose of SJ733
      to be determined by the Sponsor and Principal Investigator (PI) and endorsed by the Safety
      Review Team. Should this third dose be investigated, a substantial amendment including
      preliminary data from the first two cohorts will be submitted to the HREC for approval.</summary>
