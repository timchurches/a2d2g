  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the Fonterra Milk for Schools programme on childrens dietary habits (particularly milk and dairy consumption) and anthropometric measures. Students in randomly selected Auckland schools participating in the Milk for Schools programme who are in years 3 and 4 will take part in the baseline assessment, and will be followed for up to 2 years. We aim to recruit 300 children in total.  Children will complete a questionnaire in class during Term 4 2013 (baseline), and anthropometric measures will also be taken. Demographic information will be summarised. Descriptive statistics will be conducted for milk and dairy habits and knowledge and attitudes towards milk and other dairy products. There will also be the potential to follow-up these participants after 1 and 2 years. At follow-up, paired statistical tests will be conducted to evaluate the level of significance in reported differences in milk and dairy intakes. </summary>
