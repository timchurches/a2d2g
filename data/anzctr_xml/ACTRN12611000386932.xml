  <interventions>
    <interventions>We aim to assess the effectiveness of a 42-month parent- focused child obesity-prevention intervention (compared with a no-intervention control) delivered to first-time parents.  This cluster RCT (InFANT-Extend) will replicate the InFANT study design. InFANT is a 15-month parent-focussed obesity-prevention intervention commencing when infants are three-months of age, and delivered in existing social networks (first-time parent groups). InFANT concluded in March 2010. Children are 18-months of age at program conclusion. This study, known as InFANT- Extend, will enable assessment of the effectiveness of a 42-month parent- focused child obesity-prevention intervention (compared with a no-intervention control). In summary, the InFANT intervention involves: 
* delivery of six quarterly group-sessions (child aged 3-18 months) The sessions will run for approximately 1.5 hour each and will cover a different topic. The Tap into Water, Colour Every Meal with Fruit and Veg, Snack on Fruit and Veg and Off and Running and Parents Provide Kids Decide. topics will be Eat together Play Together. 
* six between session mailed newsletters reinforcing session messages 
* purpose-designed InFANT DVD used in sessions and as take-home resource 
* control-group receive usual care plus quarterly generic child health newsletters 

The intervention arm will receive the previously trialled InFANT intervention delivered in first-time parent groups until child is aged 18-months. Around this time parent capacity to participate in groups rapidly diminishes, reflecting recommencement of work for many mothers. As continued delivery via groups is no longer viable, InFANT-Extend will be delivered at the individual level for the additional 24-months of the intervention. This will be via newsletters sent out to the intervention group approximately quarterly.</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be a non intervention control group in the InFANT Extend project. These first time parents will not receive the intervention. The control-group receive usual care plus quarterly generic child health newsletters. Usual care will be that the mothers and children might still meet in their informal mothers groups however they will not be scheduled to meet with us to receive their intervention. The control group will remain the control group for the entire project including the extended intervention.</comparator>

      <timepoint>Measured when the child is 18 months and 3.5 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In comparison to the control group infants, intervention group infants will:
Demonstrate greater increases in time spent being physically active and smaller increases in time spent in sedentary behaviours, specifically television viewing.

      <timepoint>Accelerometer data will be measured when the child is 18 months and 3.5 years 

Sedentary behaviour will be measured when the child is 3 months, 18 months and 3.5 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In comparison to the control group infants, intervention group infants will:

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In comparison to the control group parents, the intervention group parents will demonstrate greater increases in: 
Knowledge regarding child eating, physical activity and sedentary behaviours and greater self-efficacy regarding their capacity to influence these behaviours.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Sixty two first time parent groups from Maternal and Child Health (MCH) centres in the Greater City of Geelong and within surrounding municipalities (Melton shire, Wyndham city, Surfcoast shire, Hobsons Bay, Ballarat) will be recruited. Groups with a minimum of 8 mothers willing to participate will be included in the study. In all, 62 groups will be recruited and randomly selected into the Intervention and Control groups. Children will be aged 3-4 months. Participation in this study would require participants to be a member of a 'first-time parents group'. More specifically, participation entails being a parent for the first time and regularly attending a first-time parents group which is linked to a Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHC) within a randomly selected recruited Local Government Areas (LGA). Parents will also be eligible to participate if they are able to freely give informed consent and can communicate in English.
For the extended intervention, all parents must have been enrolled in the InFANT study before they receive the extended intervention.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Allocation of participants to either the control or intervention group will be through random computer generated allocation. The allocation of each group will be contained in a sealed opaque envelope and this will be opened in front of the group before their first intervention or control session. The researchers will be blinded as to the groups allocation until that point.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will identified through randomly selected first-time parent groups initiated by Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) selected from a convenience sample of LGAs in close proximity to Geelong where the research will be conducted. 

Contact will be made with participants through the MCHCs. A member of the research team will visit parent group sessions, at a time arranged with the MCH nurse. 

We plan to recruit first time mothers and their child. These methods have been used previously and successfully in the Melbourne InFANT study. In summary, recruitment will involve: 
* selecting local government districts in Melbourne, Australia from predominantly low mid socio-economic areas 
* randomly selecting (proportionately) first-time parents’ groups - the unit of randomisation (computer sequence generated)
* recruiting parents of infants aged approximately three-months participating in first-time parent’s groups (a minimum of eight first time parents per group)
* randomly assigning groups to intervention or control (computer sequence generated)</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim:
This study aims to test the effectiveness of a childhood obesity prevention intervention delivered to first-time parents and focused on parenting skills which support the development of positive diet and Physical Activity (PA) behaviours, and reduced Sedentary Behaviours (SB) in infants.

Hypotheses: 
In comparison to the control group infants, over the course of the intervention, the intervention group infants will: 
1. Demonstrate greater increases in consumption of fruits and vegetables, and smaller increases in consumption of cordials, soft-drinks and juices and energy-dense snack foods
2. Demonstrate greater increases in time spent being physically active and smaller increases in time spent in sedentary behaviours, specifically Television (TV) viewing
3. Exhibit reduced incremental Body Mass Index (BMI) gain

In comparison to the control group parents, the intervention group parents will demonstrate greater increases in: 
4. The frequency with which they offer fruit and vegetables, water and milk (rather than cordials, soft-drinks and juices), and smaller increases in the frequency with which they offer energy-dense snack foods to their child
5. Knowledge regarding infant eating, physical activity and sedentary behaviours and greater development of positive attitudes/beliefs regarding their capacity to influence these behaviours
6. The adoption of desired feeding strategies, including the division of responsibility in feeding and in providing opportunities for modelling of healthy eating
7. The adoption of strategies, including modelling, for increasing opportunities for physical activity and reducing opportunities for sedentary behaviours</summary>
