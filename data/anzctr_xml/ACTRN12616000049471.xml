    <interventions>This is a first-in human study of ANB020. It is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, ascending single (SAD) and multiple-doses (MAD) study in healthy male and female subjects.
The study is planned to have approximately nine cohorts in the SAD section and approximately three in the MAD section of the study. Cohorts maybe added or removed upon interim analyses evaluations.
Eight (8) healthy subjects will be assigned to all single and multiple dose cohorts at predicted doses ranging from 10mg to 750mg. The study drug will be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection (doses of 10 mg, 40 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg) or intravenous (IV) infusion (doses of 40 mg, 100 mg, 300 mg or 750 mg) for the SAD part. For the MAD part, the doses and administration method (SC or IV) will be determined based on the results from the SAD part. The infusion time for the IV infusion cohorts will be 1 hour. Each SC or IV dose cohort of eight participants, for both the SAD and MAD parts, will be distributed on a 3:1 ratio to receive ANB020 (six participants) or placebo (two participants).
Subjects in the single dose cohorts will be admitted to the clinical facility on Day -1 and will remain in the clinic for up to 3 days for a total of up to 4 days in-house. Dosing of ANB020 or placebo will occur on Day 1. Safety PK and PD assessments will be performed during the study.Subjects will return to the facility on Days 4, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 57 and 85 for additional PK, immunogenicity, PD and end of study safety assessments.
Subjects in the multiple-dose cohort(s) will be admitted to the clinical facility on the morning of Day-1 and will remain in the clinic for 3 days for a total of 4 days in-house. Following this in-house period, subjects will be admitted the evening prior to their next dosing day and discharged the evening of the day of dosing for a total of 3 additional doses of ANB020 and 3 additional days in-for a total of 7 days in-house. Each subject will receive 4 doses of ANB020 or placebo, administered weekly by SC injection. Following the last dose of study drug on Day 22 of the study, subjects will return to the facility on Days 29, 36, 43, 57 and 85 for additional PK, immunogenicity, PD and end of study safety assessments.
In order to monitor participants adherence to the treatment schedule, all the study drug administrations will be performed on-site by the study staff. </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo for ANB020 is formulated as 50 mM sodium acetate, 103 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% polysorbate-80, pH 5.7. This is the same formulation as the active product except that it contains no active ingredient. As with the active product, the Placebo for ANB020 is filled to a total volume of 1.2 mL in a 2-mL type I glass vial.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>This is an ascending dose study divided into two parts. The SAD part, in which, depending on the safety of the drug observed on a cohort, the dose might be increased. If the safety and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters attain levels acceptable to the sponsor and Safety Review Team (SRT), the study will proceed to the multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase. As well, during the MAD part, the decision to escalated the dose will be taken by the SRT based on the safety parameters observed until that moment.</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>No formal sample size calculation has been made. Subject numbers are based on empirical assessments and prior experience of this study type, and are considered sufficient to meet the objectives of the study. There is no formal primary research hypothesis to be statistically tested.
Safety Analysis - Demographics and baseline characteristics (gender, race, age, body weight, height, Body Mass Index (BMI) and et al.) will be tabulated by treatments (route of administration and dose levels) using descriptive statistics. Separate Analyses will be done for single and multiple dose cohorts.
PK parameters will be summarized by treatment (dose and route of administration). Geometric means and coefficients of variation will be presented for Cmax and AUCs. Medians and ranges will be presented for Tmax. Additionally, scatter plots of Cmax, AUC(0-T), and AUC(INF) versus dose will be provided for each route of administration to assess the dependency on dose. A statistical analysis using a power model will be applied to assess dose proportionality in SC dose cohorts. Means and standard deviations will be provided for the other pharmacokinetic parameters. Separate analyses will be performed for SC and IV dose cohorts and also for single and multiple dose cohorts.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Conditions such as asthma, Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and food allergies are all characterised by abnormal immune responses to an external stimuli that ultimately leads to a potentially life threatening inflammatory state. One protein which is key to triggering this inflammatory cascade is the protein IL-33. Animal studies have shown that by inhibiting IL-33, the detrimental inflammatory cascade is suppressed. AnaptysBio Pty Ltd is developing the drug ANB020 to treat these and other related conditions also associated with abnormal inflammatory responses. ANB020 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) meaning that it can specifically bind to and inhibit IL-33.
This study will be conducted in two parts: the first part will investigate the effect of a single dose of ABN020 and the second part will investigate the effect of multiple (weekly) doses of ABN020 for 4 weeks. The single dose study will explore different doses of the study drug given either via a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection (SC) or via an intravenous (into the vein) infusion (IV). The results from this part will be used to determine the dose and route of administration to be used for the multiple dose part of the study.
Over the entire study a total of 96 people will be enrolled over 12 dosing groups/ cohorts. In each group of 8 participants, 6 will receive the active drug, ANB020 and the other 2 will receive an equivalent placebo (an injection/ infusion that looks identical to the active drug, but contains no active drug).
This study is a dose escalation study meaning that the first group/ cohort will receive the lowest dose of study drug. Results will be reviewed by a safety monitoring committee after each dose strength has been tested to make sure that it is safe to continue with the next higher dose strength in the next group. The next group will not be enrolled until the safety monitoring committee have confirmed it is safe to do so. The study can be stopped at any time, based on evaluation of the side effects of the study drug.
As this is a first in human study, the primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of ANB020 administered to healthy humans.</summary>
