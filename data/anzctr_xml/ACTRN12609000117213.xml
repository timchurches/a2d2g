  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single deepest vertical pocket method for assessment of amniotic fluid volume using real time ultrasound. The sonographer measures the largest vertical diameter of a fluid pocket (not containing small fetal parts or loops of umbilical cord). The assessment will be performed at least one weekly from recruitment till delivery. The absence of a single 2 x 1 cm pocket will indicate decreased fluid volume</interventions>
    <comparator>amniotic fluid index method for assessment of amniotic fluid volume using real time ultrasound. The sonographer divides the uterine cavity into four quadrants. In each quadrant, the largest vertical diameter of a fluid pocket (not containing small fetal parts or loops of umbilical cord) is measured. The sum of these four measures provides a single value for the AFI. The assessment will be performed at least one weekly from recruitment till delivery. AFI &lt;5 will indicate decreased fluid volume</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Amniotic fluid provides a supportive and protective environment for fetal development during pregnancy. A decreased amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios) can occur because of intrauterine growth restriction, pre-eclampsia or prolonged pregnancy. Many caregivers practice planned delivery by induction of labor or caesarean section after diagnosis of decreased amniotic fluid volume at term, to prevent an adverse pregnancy outcome. Ultrasonography is non-invasive and is used widely for the follow up of pregnancy. It can be used to determine amniotic fluid volume by measuring either the amniotic fluid index or single deepest vertical pocket. The aim of the current randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to  compare the use of the amniotic fluid index with the single deepest vertical pocket measurement during pregnancy to prevent adverse pregnancy outcome.</summary>
