  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Cibiem Transvenous Ultrasound System (CTUS) is a catheter based device delivering ultrasound energy to ablate the carotid body. The procedure is done via a percutaneous Insertion of the CTUS and advancement though the femoral vein to the jugular vein in subjects with difficult to control hypertension. Duration of the procedure is expected to range between 60 to 90 minutes. Procedure performed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound imaging guidance. </interventions>
