  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Peginterferon alfa-2a
Treatment: drugs - Ribavirin

Experimental: Group A: Moderate Renal Impairment - Participants with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min will receive 12 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a, 180 micrograms (mcg) via subcutaneous (SC) injection once weekly, in combination with ribavirin, 600 milligrams (mg) orally (PO) daily in two divided doses. Those with Genotype 2 or 3 disease may receive an additional 12 weeks of the same regimen, and those with another genotype may receive an additional 36 weeks.

Experimental: Group B: Severe Renal Impairment - Participants with CrCl &lt;30 mL/min will receive 12 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a, 180 mcg via SC injection once weekly, in combination with ribavirin, 400 mg PO daily in two divided doses. Those with Genotype 2 or 3 disease may receive an additional 12 weeks of the same regimen, and those with another genotype may receive an additional 36 weeks.

Experimental: Group C: Hemodialysis/ESRD - Participants requiring hemodialysis will receive 12 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a, 135 mcg via SC injection once weekly, in combination with ribavirin, 200 mg PO every morning. Those with Genotype 2 or 3 disease may receive an additional 12 weeks of the same regimen, and those with another genotype may receive an additional 36 weeks.

Experimental: Group D: Normal Renal Function - Participants with CrCl &gt;80 mL/min will receive 12 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a, 180 mcg via SC injection once weekly, in combination with ribavirin, 800 to 1200 mg PO daily in two divided doses. Those with Genotype 2 or 3 disease may receive an additional 12 weeks of the same regimen, and those with another genotype may receive an additional 36 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Peginterferon alfa-2a
Peginterferon alfa-2a will be administered for 12 to 48 weeks. The dose will range from 135 mcg (Group C) to 180 mcg (Groups A, B, and D) once weekly via SC route.

Treatment: drugs: Ribavirin
Ribavirin will be administered for 12 to 48 weeks. The total daily dosage will range from 200 mg (Group C) to 1200 mg (Group D), depending upon CrCl and participant-specific factors.

    <summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (area under the curve [AUC], maximum
      concentration [Cmax], and other parameters) and tolerability of peginterferon alfa-2a and
      ribavirin combination therapy following single and multiple doses in participants with CHC
      infection and moderate to severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving
      hemodialysis. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 48 weeks, and the target
      sample size is 48 individuals.</summary>
