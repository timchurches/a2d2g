    <interventions>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of kinesiology taping (KT) on surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity and muscle flexibility of rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) muscles in healthy volleyball players. 

Active KT intervention:
In subjects from KT group, the one-time Kinesio Tape (Nitto Denko K-Active Tape 5m/5cm, Japan) over the RF in an Y shape was used to increase muscle strength (facilitation technique). The subjects were in a supine position, with knee joint passively flexed out of the bed at an angle of 90 degrees. The KT was applied longitudinally in descending direction, from RF origin (anterior inferior iliac spine) to its insertion (tibial tuberosity). The basis of KT was applied from 2  3 cm below RF origin without tension. The middle part of KT between origin and patella basis was applied without tension but during RF muscle passively stretching at flexed knee joint position. Finally two tails were circled around the patella and placed on the skin without tension at an angle of 90 degrees flexed knee joint position. In KT group intervention involved left RF (n=7) and right RF (n=5) and time of application was continued for 24 hours.

Passive PT intervention:
In subjects form PT group, the one-time adhesive non-elastic tape (Polovis Plus 5m/5cm, Poland) with no therapeutic influence over the same muscle was used. Subjects were in supine position with neutral knee joint position flexed at an angle of 30 degrees. All parts of the PT were applied longitudinally in descending direction in analogous Y shape. In PT group intervention involved left RF (n=5) and right RF (n=5) and time of application was continued for 24 hours. In both groups immediately after 24 hours, KT or PT applications were removed and athletes underwent a final assessment without tapes which was identical to the initial. All procedures were accomplished as one-session intervention in the same conditions (day time, ambient temperature, research room). All subjects were informed not to remove and unstuck the tapes until final measurements will be taken.

    <concealment>Simple randomisation using a computer-generated
random numbers which were hidden in sequentially numbered envelopes and than selected by subjects. Random allotment contained KT group (W) or placebo group (X) as well as  the choice of the left (Y) or right (Z) rectus femoris (RF) muscle for intervention in the same way. 
The person responsible for participant allotment was not aware of the designations and therefore, did not know into which group the study participant would be included and which limb would be studied. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>STATISTICA 10 software by StatSoft Company was used for statistical data analysis. Arithmetic means, standard deviations and ranges of variation were calculated for measurable variables. A non  parametric Wilcoxon sequence pair test for dependent variables was used for comparison of results before and after the intervention. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. A non  parametric U Mann  Whitney test for independent variables (p=0.05) or chi2 test (p=0.05) was used for comparison between groups.

For this pilot analyses included 22 subjects the team had to use non-parametric tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Kinesiology taping (KT) is a popular method to support professional athletes during sport activities as well as a part of traumatic injury prevention and physiotherapeutic procedures after wide range of musculoskeletal injuries General clinical applications of KT include wide range of musculoskeletal injuries as low back pain, shoulder impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendonitis chronic Achilles tendon pain or post  stroke muscles spasticity. However, some recent researches suggest an unclear and insufficient influence of KT in some cases. It is still needed to assess the short  term and long  term effectiveness of KT application on the muscles performance in supporting, prevention and rehabilitation procedures.
