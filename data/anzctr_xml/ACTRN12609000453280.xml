  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>High prevalence of children (over age 4 years) consuming regular fat dairy foods despite nutrition recommendations to consume reduced or low fat varieties.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Parents will receive individualized nutrition education about the significance of the recommended dietary changes, creating a supportive home environment, overcoming barriers and resistance to change. Parents will be provided with dietary advice including explicit written and pictorial information on appropriate dairy products to purchase. The education sessions will be delivered during four 30 minute appointments over the first 12 weeks of the intervention (weeks 1,4,8,12). The intervention will be delivered to the parent only (children will not be required to attend the intervention sessions).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: Parents will receive general health information with no specific reduced fat dairy nutrition education, and will be encouraged to continue with their usual dietary pattern for the intervention period. To ensure study contact and process is similar between the intervention and control groups, parents in this group will receive individualized advice about non nutrition health messages such as reducing childrens television viewing time. The education sessions will be delivered during four 30 minute appointments over the first 12 weeks of the intervention (weeks 1,4,8,12). The intervention will be delivered to the parent only (children will not be required to attend the intervention sessions).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in children's intake of total and saturated fat from dairy foods. Children's intake will  be measured on three occassions (weeks 0,12,24) using multiple (3 days) 24 hour recalls at each occasion. The multiple pass 24 hour recall method will be conducted by a dietitian in person (day 1) and then by phone (day 2 and 3).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 0, 12 and 24</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in overall dietary intake (food choices, energy and nutrient intake, diet quality).Children's intake will  be measured on three occassions (weeks 0,12,24) using multiple (3 days) 24 hour recalls at each occasion. The multiple pass 24 hour recall method will be conducted by a dietitian in person (day 1) and then by phone (day 2 and 3). 
The rigorous method used to collect dietary intake will allow nutrient intakes to be estimated. Diet quality will be assessed using a validated index.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 0, 12 and 24</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compliance to intervention measured by a change in pentadecanoic acid as a biomarker for dairy fat intake; degree of change in dairy food choices using the pantry inventory and dietary recall; exploring the facilitators and barriers to intervention compliance (parental, child and intervention factors).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 0, 12 and 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The degree of dietary change (full, partial, or nil) from regular fat dairy foods to reduced/low-fat varieties will be associated with the degree of overall dietary change.
Dietary change will be detiremined using the 24 hour recall data and verified using nutrient (saturated fat) and biomarker (pentadecanoic acid) data. "Full" change will reflect children consuming only reduced-low dairy fat products, "nil" change children consuming only regular fat dairy products and "partial" change will be a mixed of both full and low fat products.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 and 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Healthy children aged between 4 and 13 years.
Children and early teens have been selected as parent-led dietary change is appropriate across this age group (detailed below). Additionally this age group is an appropriate target for substitution, rather than eat more dairy food message.
Child is a regular fat dairy consumer
Dairy consumer is defined as a child who consumes a minimum of 2 serves of dairy foods (milk, cheese, yoghurt, dairy desserts, ice-cream) on the day prior to study eligibility screening AND
Child usually consumes regular fat milk and cheese.
Child living in the Adelaide Metropolitan area.
Child able to visit study site on 4 occasions over the study period and give informed and written assent
Parent/ caregiver with adequate written and spoken English, prepared to attend all intervention and assessment sessions (visit study site on 6 occasions and participate in 6 data collection phone calls) and give informed and written consent (parental consent and on behalf of child) .</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Sibling enrolled in the study (Note: Parents will be asked to implement the intervention as a family, but nominate one child for study assessment to prevent any clustering effect)
Child consuming any reduced-fat or low-fat milk or cheese, and less than 2 serves of dairy foods per day
Child has any allergy or intolerance to dairy products
Any pre-existing medical condition which affects dietary intake</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Families will be recruited via public advertisement and media, and also from the database of children who have participated in previous Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) studies (Note all families have previously agreed to be listed on this database and contacted for future research).  Study families may need to be recruited in two waves depending on the interest and response to advertisements.  It is estimated that the majority of participant recruitment will be completed within a 3 month period. Allocation to treatment will be randomized. Staff member conducting initial assessment will be blinded to treatment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomized to one of two groups via computer program (www.randomization.com).  Block randomization will be used matching the two groups for childrenâ€™s age and gender.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will assess the effectiveness of nutrition education in changing children's food choices and dietary intake. We expect that brief nutrition education asking parents to switch their children's dairy products from regular to reduced or low fat varieties will significant benefit the healthiness of their children's overall diet.</summary>
