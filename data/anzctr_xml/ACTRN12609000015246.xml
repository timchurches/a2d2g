  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two tablets daily of 30Plus to be taken orally over 8 weeks.
30Plus 
Each tablet of 30Plus contains the following active ingredients:
Tyrosine 150mg
Cimicifuga racemosa extract, (Equivalent to dry rhizome 60mg)
Pyridoxine HCl 25mg
Folic acid 100mcg
Cyanocobalamin 150mcg
Chromium picolinate 200mcg
(Equivalent to Chromium 25mcg)
Calcium hydrogen phosphate 25mg
(Equivalent to Calcium 6mg)

B group vitamins are commonly taken by women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and systematic reviews have shown that vitamin B6, in particular, is an effective treatment for both the physical and psychological symptoms. Black cohosh extracts have been used traditionally to treat PMS and menopause symptoms. A recent large randomised controlled trial has shown that black cohosh extract is an effective treatment for menopause symptoms, including psychological symptoms. Chromium supplements have been variably shown to improve glucose metabolism and might help reduce sugar cravings. Tyrosine appears to prevent the substantial decline in various aspects of cognitive performance and mood associated with many kinds of acute stress.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will evaluate how effective a herbal formulation is in decreasing psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. The study will run for 12 weeks in total, and over that time participants will be asked to complete one questionnaire every 4 weeks to evaluate their symptoms of depression and anxiety.  

Half the women in the study will take 2 tablets daily of the study product while the other half will take 2 placebo tablets. A placebo is a dummy treatment, which looks and tastes like the real medication, but contains no active ingredient.</summary>
