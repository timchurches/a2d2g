    <interventions>Chakra-puncture (CP) is a highly innovative, minimally invasive and reproducible complementary healing modality which uses less than 0.2 to 0.4 mm skin penetration via thin single-use acupuncture needles.  The HEAL-1 Study is a prospective randomised crossover clinical trial of up to 80 participants from the general population aged 18 to 65 of equal gender who report impaired sleep rhythm and/or symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in presence of chronic body pains unrelated to a prior diagnosis of autoimmune disease or chronic trauma.  These participants will be randomised to either chakra-puncture (CP) with medical treatments or medical treatments alone for the duration of 6 weeks then treatment will be reversed after a washout period of 4 weeks.   The CP treatments will be a total of three sessions with each session composed of a generic configuration of one hour duration at a fortnightly interval which will be administered by a roster of accredited CP practitioner(s).  These practitioners will be blinded to the treatment sequence or the participant's detail of diagnosis and treatment..  The maximum number of the CP needles will be 22 which will be left intact for up to 45 minutes in one hour per session which includes participant preparation and completion of treatment summary.  The 'generic' configuration is designed for body supportive treatment of anxiousness and sleep which is inclusive of the support for the vascular, lymphatic and endocrine systems as per the current published curriculum of CP training in its basic form.. The minimum level of accredited training required for a practitioner is 12 months of Diploma of CP education with a minimum of 100 hours of supervised practical experience. Treatment completion and study follow up will closely monitored for adherence via reminder phone call and follow up study visits by a dedicated study nurse.  All participants will receive the standard medical treatment following diagnostic polysomnography screening.  The nominated Principal Investigator will ensure optimal training and implementation of level 2 overnight diagnostic polysomnography and ancillary diagnostic testing during and following the CP treatments. At the time of study completion, comprehensive qualitative and quantitative physiological measures of sleep and pain will be collected from each participants throughout the study to document the clinical effects of CP in impaired sleep and chronic body pain.</interventions>
    <comparator>Due to the crossover study design, each participant act as his or her own control within the clinical study.  At the time of study enrolment, diagnostic polysomnographic screening will screen for the underlying sleep rhythm disturbance and/or sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)..  Accordingly, each participant will be treated with the usual standard of medical care such as continuation of their usual medication including analgesia, sleep hygiene advice and dietary modification for impaired sleep rhythm and/or SDB irrespective of whether or not the chakra-puncture (CP) is offered in addition to the medical treatment.  The participants who require a definitive CPAP treatment due to severity of SDB such as symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) will be analysed as a subgroup within the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. </comparator>

Whilst the PSQI global score of greater than 5 and/or ESS score of greater 11 is defined as 'abnormal' as per the published literature, the study is examining the differences in the overall change of the scores to support the changes in sleep quality with CP and standard medical treatment or standard medical treatment alone.

    <statisticalmethods>Confounding variables include the effect of age, gender and medical comorbidity, which are adjusted in participant stratification at the commencement of the study.  Specific subgroup (or cluster) analysis will be performed for participants who share similar baseline phenotypic data and/or post-treatment effect within the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.

Descriptive statistics will summarise the quantitative descriptions of the study population before, during and following chakra-puncture (CP) and/or medical treatment.  Univariate analysis will examine each of the important symptom variables of pain, sleep and physiological sleep and movement data for the differences in the distribution, central tendency and dispersion.

Given the two-group post-test randomised experimental model of the crossover study, the measured differences between the means of the specific measured outcomes will be analysed via unpaired T-test or one-way ANOVA assuming a statistical significance (alpha) of 0.05, power (1-beta) of 0.80, drop-out rate of 10% and minimal detectable difference in means (MDD) of sleep and and/or chronic pain of 1.  The true effect size (t-value) will be calculated for the study population from the ratio of the differences between group means and the variability of groups and applied to inferential statistics. 

Inferential statistics will be utilised to derive objective conclusion of the study population using multivariate analysis and general linear model including the t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and regression analysis.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to collect real-world data on patients undergoing medical treatments with chakra-puncture (CP)  or medical treatments alone in impaired sleep rhythm and/or sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) with chronic body pains.  

There are two main hypotheses assessed by the study: firstly, the experimental treatment with CP and medical treatments result in 20% or greater reduction in perceived body pains, and objective improvement in self-perception of quality of sleep over a six-months of follow up as compared to the medical treatments alone.  Secondly, the improvements in chronic body pains and quality of sleep correspond to a significant reduction in abnormal body movements during sleep, which is associated with objective changes in sleep-related and daytime physiological markers.

The study is a crossover-randomised study which will be completed over a period of 16 weeks, which is inclusive of participant recruitment, stratification, central randomisation, treatment and follow up.  All relevant baseline physiological and demographic data will be collected at the time of randomisation. All participant-specific data will be de-identified to protect participant confidentiality and maintained in a safe data storage facility.  Up to 80 participants will be randomly allocated to either consecutive generic CP treatments at 2-weekly intervals along with their medical treatment or medical treatment alone.  After the initial treatments over a period of 6 weeks, a wash-out period of four weeks will be given before the treatment sequence is reversed for each participant.  

Upon the study completion, a comparative analysis will be performed for clinical and statistical significance. Significant changes in impaired sleep rhythm and body pain will be summarised both by the percentage proportion (%) of participants experiencing at least 20% or more change in baseline sleep rhythm, pain scores and physiological markers at Week 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 17 of the study.  Additional outcome analysis will be performed for adverse events, regional EEG patterns, quantitative core body temperature changes in localised areas of pain, participant satisfaction survey and QOL questionnaires, serial actigraphy and polysomnographic parameters, and nocturnal sleep-related movement data. 

To date, there is no published literature on the application of CP in neurocognitive research and treatment of impaired sleep rhythm associated with or without chronic body pains through a well-designed clinical study. The minimally invasive nature of the CP offers a potentially important avenue of non-pharmacological treatments.</summary>
