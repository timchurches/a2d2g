  <interventions>
    <interventions>two groups:
Group I: patients suffering neck and scapular pain with hypogastric scars who receive toggle recoil technique and functional technique
Group II: patients suffering neck ans scapular pain with hypogastric scars who receive placebo maneuver.

Group I: 
toggle recoil technique:the subject is supine with arms along the trunk. The therapist is placed standing at the ipsilateral scar' s side. Firstly, he must find where it has more restrictions, as well as the direction of the slide where the skin and deeper layers have more limitations. One thumb is placed in one side of the scar, while the other one is located on the contralateral side facing its homonym, either perpendicular to the scar, parallel to this or other directions (according to the restriction found).  Now, therapist is claimed to make fast thrust from biceps and pectoralis major muscles from both sides, followed by a fast contraction from triceps muscles to withdraw abruptly both of thumbs from scar site.
lenght of technique=2minutes


Functional technique: the subject placed in the same position as before and the therapist sitting next to the trunk. The caudal hand is placed in the dorsal part of the region where the scar is. The other one is placed in the ventral region below the scar. Therapist looks at which parameters will best maintain and accumulate, to the right or left sides, after cranial or caudal position, and finally rotation left or right. At this point, he has to wait for the fascia to rebalance and return to the starting position.

 Lasting of technique: 2 minutes

both, toggle recoil technique and functional technique occur once only during the same session.
 
therapist begins with toggle recoil technique, and once it' s over, he will wait 1 minute before beginning with the functional technique.</interventions>
    <comparator>group 2: placebo maneuver
Articular technique of inferior tibiofibular articulation: 

the subject is placed supine with the knee bent. The therapist at the foot of the table standing and looking forward to the subject. With the fingers of one hand takes the edge posterior of lateral malleolus. The thumb and thenar eminence rests in the front edge of the malleolus and talar neck to control the interline talo-fibular and plantar flexion. The other's one lines the lower part of the medial malleolus. The thumb and thenar eminence rests in the anteromedial talar neck and the front of the medial malleolus, controlling dorsal flexion of the anteromedial talus. One Therapist' s hand tractions the fibula towards him, maintaining this position. The other hand pushes the tibia backward and then he relax,and he makes again the same mouvement during two minutes in each foot

lengh of this maneuver= 2 minutes in each feet= 4 minutes

placebo maneuver will be administered once only during the same session.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Check that toggle recoil technique and functional technique on hypogastric scars increase active cervical mobility with an inclinometer CROM in any or all axes of space( Flexion,extension, both lateroflexion left and right, and left and right rotation)</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline.
this outcome is measured before and after both, the intervention/placebo techniques to compare both resultats.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> check that toggle recoil technique and functional technique increase the pain threshold to pressure on trigger points (PG) of the levator scapula and trapezius PG1 and PG2. therapist will push with the algometer rubber tip in specific points if trapezius and levator scapulae muscles, and he rises up pression gradually. Subjets are claimed to make a verbal signal to therapist at first time when pain sensation appears</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline. this outcome is measured before and after both, the intervention/placebo techniques to compare both resultats.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Verify that toggle recoil technique and functional technique on hypogastric scars decrease number of units in a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during active cervical motion in any or all axes of space. VAS is a useful and standard tool for subjects pain own-rating. VAS is a bar that measures 10 cm with ranges from 0 to 10, so during each neck mouvement, subjects have to measure their own pain sensation</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline. this outcome is measured before and after both, the intervention/placebo techniques to compare both resultats</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>in this clinical trial, we study neck active motion, pain and algometry in some trigger points from any neck muscles in subjects who have neck and scapular pain presenting scars in hypogastrium, before and after toggle recoil technique and functional technique on those scars.

we hipothesize than toggle recoil technique and functional technique on scars improve neck active motion, by decreasing some points in EVA during cervical motion in any/all axes du body and increasev pain threshold to pressure in trigger points from trapezium and levator scapulae muscles.</summary>
