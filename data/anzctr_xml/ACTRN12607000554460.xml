  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and effectiveness of a drug called KB002.  KB002 is a monoclonal antibody which specifically target parts of the immune system that lead to inflammation, which can contribute to asthma.  This study will help decide if KB002 may be safe at reducing the symptoms of asthma.</summary>
