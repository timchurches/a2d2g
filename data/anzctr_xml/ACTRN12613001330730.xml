  <interventions>
    <interventions>The heart rates (3-channel electrocardiograms), noninvasive blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of all the patients were monitored. Thirty minutes before the induction of anaesthesia midazolam (12 mg) was administered IV as premedication. Before spinal anaesthesia, for postoperative analgesia, Group T received TAP block under ultrasonographic guidance, and Group P underwent PVB in combination with nerve stimulation. Investigatorss prior experience with both these techniques were enough  (They did at least 80 times).

For the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, a linear ultrasound (US) probe (613 MHz) (Logiq book XP, GE Medical Systems, China) and an 80 mm 22 G (Uniplex Nanoline, Pajunk, Germany)

needle were used. As local anaesthetic, 0.5% bupivacaine (1.5 mg/kg, diluted to 20 ml with normal saline) was preferred.

For the paravertebral block (PVB), a nerve stimulator (Stimuplex (registered trademark), B. Braun AG, Melsungen, Germany) was applied at the T1112 and the L1 vertebral levels using an 80 mm 22 G (Uniplex Nanoline) needle. The stimulator was set at 2 mA, 9 V, 2 Hz for 0.1 msec. After insertion of the needle through the skin, contractions of the paraspinous muscle occur. When the paravertebral space is entered, these contractions disappear, and they are seen in the lower abdominal and inguinal regions. In the current study, when the contractions were observed at 0.8 mA, a local anaesthetic drug (0.5% bupivacaine, 5 ml at every level) was injected. 
We confirmed that the blocks with the icepack test. Both block success was 100%. Then the patients were positioned in the lateral decubitus position, and the L4L5 interspinous space was entered with a 25 G Quincke needle. Spinal anaesthesia was administered using 1012.5 mg heavy bupivacaine + 25 microgram fentanyl. The sensory block was then evaluated using the icepack test, and the operation commenced when the PVB and TAP block extended beyond the vertebral T9 level and above.

The heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure, Sp02 and VAS values were recorded during the preoperative period every 3 min for 15 min and then at 5 min intervals after the induction of spinal anaesthesia. During the postoperative period, when the level of spinal anaesthesia dropped below T10, the patients were transferred to their room. During follow-up visits in their room, their blood pressure, heart rates and VAS values were recorded at 1 and 30 min and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. If the VAS score was between
3 and 5, 75 mg IM diclofenac sodium were injected. If it was above 5 points, this was
 

proceeded  by 75  mg  IM diclofenac  Na.  If  this  was  ineffective within  30  min,  an additional 25 mg IM meperidine were administered. When the SpO2 dropped below
95% during the intraoperative and recovery periods, oxygen was delivered by a face mask at a rate of 23 L min-1. When the mean arterial pressure dropped below 65 mm Hg,   510   mg   IV   ephedrine   were   injected.   Intraoperative   and   postoperative complications and the treatment modalities were recorded. The type of surgery in both groups is used Lichtenstein's tension free technique.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: To compare postoperative analgesic efficacies of transversus abdominis block (TAP) and paravertebral block (PVB) in inguinal hernia surgery.

Material and Method: Sixty patients aged between 19 and 76 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) risk scores of IIII scheduled to undergo elective unilateral inguinal hernia repair were included in the study. Randomization was achieved with sealed envelops containing randomisation numbers (simple randomisation using a randomisation table from a statistic book).
 Before spinal anaesthesia, one group (Group T) was administered TAP under the guidance of ultrasound, and the other group (Group P) was administered PVB, with concomitant regional nerve stimulation. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the patients before and during the operation and within postoperative 24 h were recorded.

Results: There were no differences between the two groups with respect to demographic data, ASA scores, pre-, intra-, and postoperative blood pressures, Sp02, heart rates, operative times or complications. Relative to Group T, the VAS scores (at
30 min and at the 3rd, 6th and 12th h) of Group P were lower, the percentages of analgesic users were higher in the former during the first postoperative 12 h (Group T:
66%, Group P: 35%).


Conclusion: In the current study, PVB block was more effective than TAP block in the management of postoperative pain.
