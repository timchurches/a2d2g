    <interventions>Ultrasound-guided axillary vein cannulation for central venous access in intensive care patients compared to traditional infraclavicular subclavian vein cannulation for central venous access . Study to be conducted over 1 year, with 40 patients in each arm. Each adult patient requiring a subclavian vein central venous cannulation (CVC) to potentially be enrolled (if no exclusion criteria), then randomised to either intervention. CVC to take approx 20 minutes from initial skin puncture, using the Seldinger technique for cannulation and will occur only once in each participant. Success/Failure of procedure, duration of intervention (from skin puncture to blood flashback) to be recorded, number of skin punctures recorded, if assistance required and any complications (e.g. pneumothorax) recorded. Post-procedure Chest Xray to determine position of catheter tip (ie in Superior Vena Cava).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Success/Failure of central venous cannulation - success indicated by flashback of venous blood into catheter ports, failure indicated if unable to aspirate blood from catheter ports following attempted insertion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. At end of cannulation procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Position of cannula: if tip in Superior Vena Cava = correct position, any other position = misplaced</outcome>
      <timepoint>2. At end of cannulation procedure, after Chest Xray performed</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Number of skin punctures before successful cannulation (&gt;3 = difficult and procedure recorded as Failed)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3. Recorded from start of first skin puncture until successful cannulation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. Time taken for successful cannulation (&gt;20 mins = difficult and procedure to be abandoned and recorded as Failed)</outcome>
      <timepoint>4. Clock commenced when the first skin puncture is made and stopped when blood flashback in to the syringe is seen</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5. Complications of procedure e.g. local bleeding/haematoma or pneumothorax</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To assess whether ultrasound-guided axillary vein cannulation is more successful, less difficult and has fewer complications than landmark-guided infraclavicular subclavian vein cannulation for central venous access (CVA) in the intensive care unit. The hypothesis is that ultrasound-guided axillary vein cannulation is more successful, less difficult and has less complications than the traditional infraclavicular approach</summary>
