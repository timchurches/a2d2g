  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Mepolizumab

Experimental: Mepolizumab SC 100 mg/milliliter (mL) in autoinjector - Three doses of mepolizumab liquid drug product in autoinjector will be self-administered by the subject/caregiver at 4-weekly intervals; 2 doses will be administered under observation in the clinic (at Week 0 and 8). One dose will be administered outside the clinic and without observation (within 24 hours after attending the clinic at Week 4).


Treatment: drugs: Mepolizumab
It is a clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow sterile solution for SC injection, supplied in a single-use, prefilled syringe containing 100 mg/mL mepolizumab with sodium phosphate, citric acid, sucrose EDTA and polysorbate 80 within an autoinjector.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects successfully able to self-administer their observed third dose at Week 8 - The subject/caregiver will self-administer the dose of study treatment by SC injection. The investigator or designee will observe the process, using a checklist based on the autoinjector Instructions for Use (IFU). Failure to perform one of the critical steps will be deemed to be a failure to successfully administer the injection.</outcome>

             permitted to be enrolled without continuous high dose ICS providing the subject was
             receiving continuous ICS and the Investigator attest that the subject should have been
             treated with high dose ICS to mitigate the risk of exacerbations, or the subject has

             ICS. For subjects receiving maintenance CS, the CS treatment for an exacerbation must

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is aimed to assess the correct real-world use of an autoinjector for the repeat
      self-administration of mepolizumab SC, so to improve subject / physician convenience and to
      enable repeat dose self injection themselves or via caregivers. This Phase III study will be
      an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose, multi-centre study of mepolizumab liquid drug product
      in autoinjector (100 milligrams [mg]) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (3
      doses) in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will receive 100 mg mepolizumab
      SC as a single injection that is self-administered in the thigh, abdomen or administered in
      the upper arm (caregiver only). Each subject will participate in the study for up to 18 weeks
      including pre-screening visit, a screening visit and a 12-week treatment period which
      concludes with end of study assessments (Visit 5) 4 weeks after the last dose of mepolizumab.
      Approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled in the study.</summary>
