    <interventions>Patients weighing 30 kg or more will receive a combination of a fixed dose of 1500 mg durvalumab via intravenous infusion  followed by a 75 mg tremelimumab intravenous infusion every 4 weeks (28 days) for up to 4 doses/cycles. After this, treatment will continue with 1500 mg durvalumab every four weeks (28 days) starting on Week 16 for up to 9 doses.

Retreatment is allowed (once only) for patients meeting the retreatment criteria below:

1.	Patients who achieve and maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to the end of the 12-month treatment period may restart treatment with the combination upon evidence of PD, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1, during follow-up.

2.	Patients who complete the 4 dosing cycles of the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab portion of the regimen (with clinical benefit per Investigator judgment), but subsequently have evidence of PD during the durvalumab monotherapy portion of the combination regimen, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1, may restart treatment with the combination.

Total treatment on this study will be approximately two years with further treatment to be discussed with the treating clinician.

Participating institutions will maintain a record of drug dispensed for each patient.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary end point is disease control defined as a composite of: 
1.	Objective tumour response rate (OTRR), based on complete and partial responses using cancer specific response criteria; and/or 
2.	Time to progressive disease exceeds the documented time to progressive disease on the last treatment prior to substudy entry by at least 1.3 times (TTP2/TTP1 &gt; 1.3).

* Or exceeds 6 months if TTP1 is not evaluable. 

CT scans for disease evaluation will take place every 8 weeks until progression. 

Where disease evaluation is not based on CT scans alternative validated guidelines, such as Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria will be employed. 

Where radiological progression cannot be assessed, evidence for clinical progression will be documented. These data will be collected from patient questionnaires, such as quality of life per the QLQ-C30 version 3 or Brief Pain Inventory, if applicable or clinical reports to supplement the primary outcome. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour progression will be monitored by CT scans (or other imaging as appropriate) and GCIG and PCWG2 criteria  every 8 weeks. 

Quality of life or pain scores, if applicable will be collected every 4 weeks.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>A group of 64 patients will be analyzed, divided into 4 sub-groups of 16 subjects each based on PD-L1 and TIL expression levels. Median expression levels will be used as an arbitrary cutoff to assign patients to sub-groups of high and low expressors 
(PD-L1 high TIL high, PD-L1 high TIL low, PD-L1 low TIL high, PD-L1 low TIL low). 
Each sub-group will be considered a substudy for the purpose of the MoST program. 

As described in the framework protocol (ACTRN12616000908437), substudies with  greater than or equal to 3 out of 16 responding patients, will in general be sufficiently interesting to investigate further. As a general rule, substudies with less than 3 out of 16 responses will be considered to not support the molecular hypothesis behind the substudy.

If some activity is recognised in a 16 patient substudy cohort but further information is needed to inform development of phase II testing, iterative substudies may be opened to enrich for patients that harbour a specific common biomarker or histologic cancer subtype. Each such iteration would constitute a new substudy for the purposes of this framework.

The sample size and guiding definitions of what constitutes an interesting signal are determined empirically as the investigators considered these numbers of patients as sufficient for signal-seeking purpose.

The PD-L1 and TIL expression levels will be determined post hoc and will not guide treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a substudy of the Cancer Molecular Screening and Therapeutics (MoST) Program, which is registered on ANZCTR with ID ACTRN12616000908437. This substudy will evaluate the activity of tremelimumab treatment in combination with durvalumab followed by single durvalumab treatment in patients with advanced cancers and tumours. 

Who is it for? All participants in this study must have completed screening as part of the Cancer Molecular Screening and Therapeutics (MoST) Program (ACTRN12616000908437), and been identified as having having no actionable molecular targets. 
Study details All participants in this study will take the intravenous drugs tremelimumab plus durvalumab once every 28 day cycle. From week 16 of treatment durvalumab will be administered alone once every 28 days. Treatment will continue until progression,  unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Retreatment will be discussed with you by your doctor.

All participants will undergo assessments at 8 weekly intervals or as clinically indicated in order to evaluate tumour response, safety and tolerability of treatment, health related quality of life during treatment, and overall survival. 

We cannot guarantee that patients will receive any benefits from this study. This study is being carried out to improve the way we treat cancer patients who may have limited treatment options available to them. It is hoped that palbociclib will be well tolerated and will improve outcomes for future patients, however, there may be no clear benefit from participation in this study.</summary>
