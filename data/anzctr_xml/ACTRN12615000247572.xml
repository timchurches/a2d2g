  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of a brief web-based parenting program ('Partners in Parenting') which is part of a larger research translation program (Parenting Strategies; www.parentingstrategies.net).
Parents will first complete an approximately 20-minute online survey (developed specifically for use in this study) that assesses their current parenting practices against the recommendations in the Guidelines 'How to Prevent Depression and Clinical Anxiety in Your Teenager: Strategies for Parents' (Parenting Strategies Program, 2013; henceforth the Guidelines).  Based on their responses to this survey, parents in the intervention group will then receive a once-off, individually-tailored feedback report that highlights areas where they are doing well (i.e., concordant with the Guidelines), as well as areas where they can improve (i.e., not concordant with the Guidelines). The messages in the feedback report are brief, with practical strategies provided in dot point form, and are designed to motivate behaviour change. Parents in the intervention group will view their feedback report online, and will also be emailed a copy of their feedback report as well as the Guidelines.</interventions>
    <comparator>3-month no-treatment waitlist control condition.
Parents in the waitlist control group will receive the intervention (individuall-tailored feedback report) 3 months after their baseline assessment, upon completion of their 3-month follow-up assessment. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental concordance with the Guidelines 'How to Prevent Depression and Clinical Anxiety in Your Teenager: Strategies for Parents'. This will be assessed by a newly developed parenting survey, developed for use in this study. The survey consists of 79 questions, and is a criterion-referenced measure assessing parents' current parenting knowledge and behaviours against specific recommendations in the Guidelines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The parenting survey will be completed by both the intervention and control group parents at the following timepoints:
Baseline (pre-intervention)
1 month follow-up (post-intervention)
3 month follow-up.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adolescent depressive symptoms, as measured by the total score on the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ). The SMFQ will be administered to both parents (parent-report form) and adolescents (child-report form).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The parent- and child-report SMFQ will be completed by both the intervention and control group (parent and child participants) at the following timepoints:
Baseline (pre-intervention)
3 month follow-up.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adolescent anxiety symptoms, as measured by the total score on the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS). The SCAS will be administered to both parents (parent-report form) and adolescents (child-report form).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The parent- and child-report SCAS will be completed by both the intervention and control group (parent and child participants) at the following timepoints:
Baseline (pre-intervention).
3 month follow-up.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child-reported parental concordance with the Guidelines 'How to Prevent Depression and Clinical Anxiety in Your Teenager: Strategies for Parents'. This will be assessed by a child-report version of the parenting survey developed for use in this study. The survey consists of 47 items, assessing a subset of the parenting recommendations in the Guidelines, as perceived by the child.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Child participants (in the intervention and control group) will complete the child-report parenting survey at the following timepoints:
Baseline
3 month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Parent Participants:
Parents or guardians of at least one child aged 12 to 15 years (inclusive), who reside in Australia, are fluent in English, have regular access to the internet and an email account. 

Adolescent Participants:
Adolescent children of participating parents/guardians, aged 12 to 15 years (inclusive) on entry to the trial, who reside in Australia, are fluent in English, and have regular access to the internet.

Only one parent and one adolescent per family can participate in the trial.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Parents:
1. Parents who reside outside of Australia.
2. Parents who are not proficient in English.

Adolescents:
1. Adolescents who reside outside of Australia.
2. Adolescents who are not proficient in English.
3. Adolescents who do not have parental consent to participate in the study; or who do not provide verbal assent to participate. Note: parents can still participate if their child does not participate.

Parents and adolescents will not be excluded if the adolescent scores in the clinically elevated range (as determined by published clinical cut-off scores) on either the SMFQ or SCAS (either parent- or child-report form) at baseline. However, by assessing baseline symptoms, we will be able to conduct post-hoc analyses in which we exclude adolescents who scored above the clinical cut-off scores at baseline.
The cut-off scores used are as follows:
SMFQ (parent- or child-report versions): 8 or more
SCAS (Child-report):
For male children: Scores of 48 or more.
For female children: Scores of 51 or more.
SCAS (Parent-report):
For male children: Scores of 24 or more.
For female children: Scores of 26 or more.

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>When parents submit their baseline assessment on the trial website, the website will generate an automated random allocation sequence to allocate parent-adolescent dyads to either the control or intervention group. Parents find out their assignment immediately thereafter: the intervention group receives their brief intervention (tailored feedback), whereas the control group is informed that they will receive their feedback report in 3 months' time. As such, allocation is concealed from both participants and researchers prior to assignment. </concealment>
    <sequence>The trial website is programmed to run a random allocation sequence to allocate parent-adolescent dyads to either the control or intervention group, immediately after parents submit their baseline assessment online. </sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>"The people administering the treatment/s" are "masked" because the intervention is delivered online by a fully automated trial website.

Child informants ("people assessing the outcomes") are assumed to be blinded because they are not direct recipients of the web-based parenting intervention.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Required sample size:
Based on a power analysis, for a repeated-measures design with a power of 0.80, small effect size, and alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 294 parent-adolescent dyads (147 dyads per group) is required.
Based on an expected attrition rate of approximately 10-15%, we aim to recruit 340 parent-adolescent dyads (170 dyads per group).

Data analysis:
The main analyses will be intent-to-treat. To assess group differences in changes in parental concordance with the Guidelines (primary outcome) and adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms (secondary outcomes) across timepoints (baseline, 1 month and 3 month follow-up), a series of mixed effects analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) with missing cell design (to account for parent-only data at 1-month follow-up) will be conducted. Adolescent age and gender will be used as covariates.
Little's MCAR (missing completely at random) test will be used to analyse the extent and pattern of missing data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effects of a brief, individually-tailored web-based parenting program on parenting behaviours associated with adolescent depression and anxiety disorders. The program is designed to provide parents with personalised feedback about their current parenting, including what they are doing well and areas that they can improve in order to reduce their teenagers risk of depression and anxiety.
We aim to find out whether this program can help improve parenting behaviours associated with adolescent depression and anxiety, and in turn reduce risk of depression and anxiety in teenagers.</summary>
