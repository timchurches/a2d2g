  <interventions>
    <interventions>Body-Mind Group Therapy (BMGT) is a body-oriented small group therapy conducted by two expereinced clinicians (one psychologist, one psychiatric nurse) as well as one experienced circus trainer.  A maximum of eight clients meet for 120 min, once per week for ten weeks.
The aim is to increase body awareness through body centered movements and experiecnes in an interpersonal situation.  The body movements included basic circus skills such as acrobalance, juggling, ball games and aerials.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spectrum, a state-wide service for treating patients with severe borderline personality disorder, has been running body-orientated group therapies since 2006.  In 2009 Spectrum partnered with the Womens Circus in Footscray to develop an outpatients Body-Mind group therapy program.  Clinical observations of patients who attended this group suggest a reduction in symptoms and an increase in involvement with their bodies, sensation, feelings and emotions.  This is important as patients with borderline personality disorder often dissociate and avoid difficult emotions and sensations.

We aim to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this treatment in a small pilot research study.  Patients with borderline personality disorder will be recruited from Area Mental Health Services to participate in a 10 week Body-Mind Group.  These patients will continue to receive treatment as usual from their local mental health case manager while attending this group.  During this group therapy, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected regarding symptom severity and group participation in order to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment.</summary>
