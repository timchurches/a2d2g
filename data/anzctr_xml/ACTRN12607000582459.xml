  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: personal email interaction with doctor or nurse over 6 months. The number of emails and their content will vary according to the questions and issues raised by the participant, ie they will be tailored to the individual participant. Several attempts will be made to engage the participant in ongoing email interaction via weekly emails for one month, then monthly emails up until follow up at 6 months. The doctor/ nurse will try to form a clinical relationship with the participant via email and it is this relationship that is the crux of the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: monthly automated emails over 6 months. These emails do not contain any information about Chlamydia nor do they invite direct contact with the doctor or nurse, rather they suggest that participants can find out more via the chlamydia website. Monthly emails are sent to remind the participant that they are still enrolled in the trial. At 6 months they are invited to complete the follow up questionnaire, and are then invited to contact the doctor or nurse directly if they have any questions about Chlamydia.</comparator>

      <timepoint>At baseline and at 6 month follow up in both groups</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased awareness of Chlamydia trachomatis infection, measured via an online quiz at baseline and 6 months later conducted on 2 separate websites including the trial website and another that linked to the trial website.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence of genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection among participants who undergo testing; this will be measured by number of self-reported positive tests divided by those who report via the questionnaire, having had a test at baseline and at follow up</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured at baseline and at 6 month follow up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of participants testing positive for Chlamydia testing receiving appropriate treatment and contact tracing. This will be measured by self-report on the baseline and follow up questionnaires</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured at baseline and 6 month follow up</timepoint>

    <concealment>Eligible participants will be enrolled in the trial prior to allocation. Persons determining eligibility and enrolling subjects will be unaware, at the time of enrolment, which group the subject will be allocated to. Allocation is concealed by virtue of the fact that the only information known to the persons allocating is that participants meet both eligibility criteria. Data is downloaded from the website and imported into a Microsoft Access database. Eligibility is determined via an Access program query, a study number is then given, and allocation determined. At this point, at the time of allocation, the participant's name (optional and might not be provided), age, sex and email address are not known.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to promote testing for chlamydia among at-risk 16  25 year old Australians. A website about chlamydia will be developed in consultation with young people, and linked to an existing, evaluated health promotion website. Eligible visitors to the chlamydia website will be invited to participate in the study. 1,000 participants will be randomly allocated into one of two groups. The intervention group will be offered confidential email interaction with a nurse or doctor to discuss their needs and barriers surrounding testing for chlamydia. The control group will receive an automated email reply directing them back to the website for information. Both groups will complete a de-identified online questionnaire at baseline and 6 months. The main outcome measure will be whether chlamydia testing took place.</summary>
