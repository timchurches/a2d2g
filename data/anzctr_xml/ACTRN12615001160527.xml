  <interventions>
    <interventions>The delivery of a mindfulness course called Mindfulness Skills for Students, a secular, manualised, group-based skills training programme based on the course book Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Finding Peace in a Frantic World, by Mark Williams and Danny Penman, and adapted for university students. The course is free but students need to buy the course book.
The sessions last for 90 minutes for the first session, and 75 minutes for the remaining sessions. There are eight weekly sessions. The sessions are run by Dr Elizabeth English, a certified Mindfulness trainer with over 30 years experience of practising and teaching meditation. The sessions include two mindfulness meditations, the first embedding the meditation that the students have practised at home throughout the week; the second, introducing them to the new meditation that they will practice at home in the coming week. There are also periods of reflection and inquiry, helping the students to understand the nature of mindfulness, to deepen their learning and embed it into their everyday lives. A few simple models are used and developed throughout the course, to give the students some theoretical understanding of the points developed experientially. Each session also includes interactive exercises, so that the students share their experience and get to know each other throughout the course, building a sense of safety and community. Before and after each class, students receive an email from their Mindfulness teacher. This reminds them of the themes covered in the previous class, and lets them know the topics coming up in the next class. These emails also include handy tips, poems and video clips. There is also a course handout available in hard copy at each class, which describes the home practice for the coming week (this handout is also available as a download in the post class email, and the home practice is also described in the course book.) The home practice time varies through the course, starting at eight minutes, and increasing to about 15-25 minutes per week, plus ongoing reflection through the day. More practice is possible for those who want it, and students are encouraged not to miss a day, and therefore to consider doing less on days when they are very busy, rather than missing the practice altogether. The home practice includes meditations from the CD by Mark Williams, as described in the course book above. Other mindfulness practices are recommended by the authors of the course book, such as a mindful walk, mindful eating, habit breakers, and so on.
Seven courses are offered to students each term, two terms a year (Michaelmas, which runs from October to December, and Lent, which runs from January to March). Courses are not offered during the exam period (Easter term, which runs from April to June).
The following process measures will assess how the course is being delivered: (a) Registering attendance to mindfulness courses and asking why sessions were missed; (b) Asking students about their compliance with their mindfulness homework.</interventions>
    <comparator>Students will be recruited at the beginning of Michaelmas 2015 (October) and Lent 2016 (January). The comparator will be university mental health provision as usual. Those who are still students will receive the intervention a year later (October 2016 and January 2017 respectively).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Undergraduate and graduate university students show elevated levels of stress. At the University of Cambridge, the University Counselling Service and other support services see an increasing number of students seeking help. A preventative intervention to help students cope with stress is needed. 
To address this need the University has funded an implementation and evaluation project. A three-year pilot mindfulness intervention began in late 2014. Eight-week introductory mindfulness courses are being provided to healthy volunteer students in groups that are oversubscribed. An evaluation of this provision will be conducted too see whether it: 
1.	Improves university students mental wellbeing and resilience to stress up to one year later. 
2.	Reduces their use of mental health treatment and support services 
3.	Helps them to manage stress during the examination term
4.	Improves their engagement with student life, including their academic performance.
