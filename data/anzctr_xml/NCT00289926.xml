  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Dehydroepiandrosterone
      (DHEA) 50mg daily, for 12 months in naturally menopausal women with low libido who are not
      receiving systemic oestrogen or oestrogen- progestin therapy.

      Efficacy measures for the present study are effects on sexual function, wellbeing and
      menopausal symptoms. Safety measures will include endometrial assessment by transvaginal
      ultrasound (TVU), vital signs, lipid profiles, general electrolytes, effects on glucose
      metabolism and reports of adverse events.</summary>
