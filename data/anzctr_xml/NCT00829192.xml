  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether afamelanotide (CUV1647) is effective in
      reducing the number of actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinomas developing in immune
      compromised organ transplant recipients, who are at particularly high risk, over a 24 month
      test period.

      The number of lesions formed on the head, hands and forarms will be monitored over this 24
      month test period.</summary>
