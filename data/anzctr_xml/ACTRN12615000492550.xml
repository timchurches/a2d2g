  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible participants with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) will be given questionnaire(s) to complete relating to the specific medications that they are prescribed. Each participant will complete a questionnaire relating to Tiotropium use. Tiotropium is a Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonist (LAMA) inhaler used in patients with COPD. It should not be co-prescribed with Short-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists (such as Ipratropium) due to unwanted side-effects and cardiovascular risks. If participants are prescribed concomitant ipratropium-containing medications they will receive an additional questionnaire for each of these medications. The duration of observation in each participant will be as long as is required for the participant to fill out the questionnaire(s), and is anticipated to take no longer than thirty minutes. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary characteristic of interest is the proportion of patients who used more than one actuation of Tiotropium per day in the seven days prior to admission.
A sample size of 100 gives a 95% CI for a proportion plus or minus 10%. E.g. sample size of 100 has 90% power to rule out a proportion of 25% if the true proportion is 38%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to collect information about inhaler use in patients who are prescribed a tiotropium inhaler (Spiriva). This medication in commonly prescribed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but it is unclear how patients are using this medication at home.  

The study involves the idetification of patients admitted to hospital for an exacerbation of COPD who are prescribed Spiriva at the time of admission. These patients will be approached to complete a questionnaire which collects data about their usual use of this medication as well as their use in the 7 day period prior to hospital admission. 

If they are prescribed a similar medication called ipratropium as well as Spiriva, they will be asked to complete an additional questionnaire. 

The data collected will help to identify if patients are using the Spiriva inhaler as prescribed by their doctor, if they are taking more than the prescribed dose and whether they are prescribed another similar medication at the same time as taking Spiriva (ipratropium).
