      <outcome>EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Stomach Cancer Specific (QLQ STO22) Questionnaire Scores - The QLQ-STO22 is a gastric cancer quality of life questionnaire. There are 22 questions concerning disease, treatment related symptoms, side effects, dysphagia, nutritional aspects, and questions about the emotional problems of gastric cancer (dysphagia, pain, reflux, eating restrictions, anxiety, dry mouth, body image, and hair loss). The questions are grouped into five scales and 4 single items which are related to the symptoms of the disease. Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 1 question was a yes or no answer). A linear transformation was used to standardize all scores and single-items to a scale of 0 to 100; higher score=better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.</outcome>

    <summary>This parallel, randomized, open-label, multi-centre study will evaluate the effect on overall
      survival of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in combination with a chemotherapy compared to the
      chemotherapy alone in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. Trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) will be administered as intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg (loading dose 8 mg/kg)
      every 3 weeks. The chemotherapy consists of a combination of 6 cycles of fluorouracil (800
      mg/m2/day intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion
      every 3 weeks), or capecitabine (Xeloda, 1000 mg/m2 po twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks)
      and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Treatment with trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) will continue until disease progression. The target sample size is 300-600
      patients.</summary>
