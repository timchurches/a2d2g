  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible participants will be approached by the genetic heart disease clinic coordinator and asked if they are happy to receive their genetic result as part of a research study. Those who agree to participate and provide consent will then undergo randomisation. Records of the number of participants who decline participation will be kept. The study group will be randomised to intervention or normal practice. Those who are randomised to intervention will receive their genetic result using a communication aid developed by our group. Our group is a multidisciplinary team comprising of cardiologists specialising in genetic heart disease, scientists and cardiac genetic counsellors. In addition to research initiatives the group run a genetic heart disease clinic and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy clinic through Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The aid was developed with the aim of assisting communication of genetic results and risk to family members. Development of the aid was a multi-step process on the basis of multidisciplinary meetings, literature review and empirical evidence. The aid addresses: 1) What is genetic testing 2) The outcome of genetic testing 3) Criteria that determines pathogenicity 4) The implication for family members. Participants randomised to intervention will receive their genetic result for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from a genetic counsellor, face to face, using the communication aid. The genetic result will be returned during one session only which lasts approximately 30 - 45 minutes. The genetic counsellors delivering the intervention are tertiary trained individuals with a minimum of three years experience in cardiac genetic counselling. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group (those participants randomised to control) will receive their genetic results for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as per current clinical practice at the genetic heart disease clinic. This typically involves return of result by the genetic counsellor and cardiologist. Return of result is usually conducted after clinical cardiology review of the patient in their annual clinical review appointment. These participants will not be given the communication aid.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ability and confidence of the proband to communicate genetic results to family members. We will use a single primary outcome variable that is a combination of perceived knowledge and risk communication action. This will aim to determine consistency between the probands self reported ability to communicate information against their self reported percentage of immediate family members informed. This is a binary outcome and has been specifically designed for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There is one assessment timepoint for this outcome. Participants will receive a survey two weeks after the return of their results. They will be given a reminder to return the survey at two weeks and encouraged to return the survey before completion of six weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Genetics knowledge. This will be assessed using an amended version of the Breast Cancer  Genetic Counselling Knowledge Questionnaire (BGKQ). This scale was originally developed to assess knowledge of information typically included in genetic counselling for breast cancer.</outcome>

      <outcome>Satisfaction with services. This will be assessed using the widely used Satisfaction with Genetic Counselling Scale (SGCS). The original scale was designed to assess three dimension of patient satisfaction: Instrumental, affective and procedural.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>A priori sample calculations have been performed. Prior data from a previous feasibility study indicate that 75% of participants communicated with their family members. Assuming a control group percentage of 50% communication a significance level of 5% and 80% statistical power, a sample size of n=21 is required per group. We will aim to recruit 45 participants to account for drop-out rates.

A number of statistical analysis tools will be used to compare primary and secondary outcomes between the intervention and control group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Genetic testing in the era of next generation sequencing technologies brings unique challenges to the genetic counselling of families. Families are confronted with large quantities of complex information for which they hold the responsibility of communicating with family members. In order to communicate genetic results or risk information the proband must have adequate understanding of the information received. Several studies indicate this may be problematic, and some individuals may not retain or understand the information presented to them.

Few resources exist which aim to facilitate the process of cardiac genetic testing for patient understanding, recall and ability to communicate. Data from our research indicates cardiac genetic testing understanding, recall and ability to communicate risk to relatives may be insufficient in a subset of patients. Efforts to better communicate this information is therefore critical. 

We have developed a communication aid which aims to assist communication of genetic results and risk to family members. Feasibility and acceptability of the aid has been proven through a pilot study.

We are seeking to determine whether a genetic counsellor- led intervention incorporating a communication aid improves knowledge, satisfaction and patient empowerment compared to current clinical practice. In addition, we aim to assess the dissemination of genetic risk information amongst family members.

We are utilising a randomised controlled trial methodology. Eligible patients diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (with a genetic result available and ready for return) will be recruited to intervention or control. Those randomised to control will receive their result as per current clinical practice within the genetic heart disease clinic. This typically involves return of result by the genetic counsellor and cardiologist. Return of result is usually conducted after clinical cardiology review of the patient in their annual clinical review appointment.Those randomised to intervention will receive their result from a genetic counsellor with use of the communication aid. Primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between the two groups.</summary>
