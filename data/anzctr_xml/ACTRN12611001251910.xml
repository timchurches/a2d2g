  <interventions>
    <interventions>The "Clinician-Led Improvement in Cancer Care (CLICC) intervention, which will be implemented through the established Urology Network, has four elements: 1) engaging the target group through educational sessions facilitated by clinical leaders (the educational session will occur once at the start of the intervention phase in that particular hospital and will last approximately 30 minutes; urologists not in attendance will be contacted to identify a convenient time to discuss the study); 2) disseminating printed materials to reduce clinical uncertainty; 3) implementing new systems and processes to flag eligible cases for discussion at multi-disciplinary meetings to encourage collaborative decision-making (all eligible cases will be flagged by pathologists for review at a multidisciplinary team meeting); and 4) providing the target group with feedback and audit data to reinforce the impact of their clinical practice. The overall duration of the intervention is 18 months. The subjects of the research are clinicians whose practice is being monitored, so there is no direct interaction between the investigators and patients. The objective is to harness the Urology Clinical Network, within NSW hospitals to increase appropriate utilisation of adjuvant radiotherapy for high risk patients with positive margins after radical prostatectomy in line with the grade B recommendation in the Australian Cancer Networks Locally Advanced and Metastatic Prostate Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines.</interventions>

    <concealment>All patients being treated by urologists at 9 out of 29 hospitals in the Urology clinical network that have multidisciplinary teams will be included in the study. The order in which hospitals will receive the intervention will be determined randomly. Outcome data to assess changes in healthcare practice will be collected through medical audit of hospital records by a researcher blinded to whether the hospital has commenced the intervention phase.</concealment>
    <sequence>The study will use a stepped-wedge design to roll out the intervention to the 9 hospitals in five 2 month blocks over a period of 10 months. Hospitals will be randomised to be in the intervention or control phase by simple randomisation using a computer generated table. Throughout the study the hospitals will either be in passive implementation (control) or active implementation (intervention) phase. In the passive implementation phase all Urologists will be posted the new guidelines book by the Australian Cancer Network that will be discussed at the Urology Network meeting along with the RAVES trial (ACTRN12611000781943). For the active implementation phase the CLICC intervention will be implemented.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The stepped-wedge design is a type of crossover design where a hospital (cluster) will only crossover from control to intervention ie unidirectional. By the end of study all hospitals will have received the intervention, however the order in which the hospitals receive it will be randomly determined.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a Clinical Network led organisation intervention to improve evidence based care for locally advanced prostate cancer. The subjects of the research are the clinicians whose practice is being monitored. You may be involved in this study if you are a male of any age who has been diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy. You must also be a patient at one of the 9 NSW based hospitals included in this study that have entered the active implementation phase of the intervention. Clinicians involved in this study will be involved in an educational session at their hospital. Clinical champions will be enlisted to persuade peers to attend the education sessions and to educate their peers and multidisciplinary teams. The objective is to use the Urology Clinical Network to increase referrals of patients to a radiotherapist for discussion about the appropriate use of adjuvant radiotherapy for high risk patients with locally advanced prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. If you are a patient treated by one of the clinicians involved in the study you may be eligible for inclusion. This would involve medical record audit to determine whether you were referred to radiotherapy treatment, whether you completed radiotherapy, and if so, the time between surgery and radiotherapy.</summary>
