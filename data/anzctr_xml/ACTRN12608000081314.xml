  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose  of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a program that aimed to build coping skills for adolescents who were being bullied at school. We predicted that adolecents who completed the program would reported less bullying, reduced impact of being bullied, and lower symptoms of anxiety and depression than adolescents who had been allocated to a wait-list control condition.</summary>
