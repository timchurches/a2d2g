  <interventions>
    <interventions>PACT is a parenting intervention grounded in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for parents of children with Cerebral Palsy. PACT includes ACT technologies already established in an RCT as effective with families of children with CP, including mindfulness, experiential acceptance and cognitive defusion (Whittingham et al., 2014; Whittingham et al., in press; Whittingham, Sanders, et al., 2013). It includes some techniques from the established parenting literature but focuses on strategies to enhance the parent-child relationship and promote parental emotional responsiveness. An online course was created using an open source course management system for the purpose of the current study. The course incorporates: virtual written text, video presentations, screen-based interactive activities, journal activities, reflections, guided experiential and mindfulness exercises and participation in moderated discussion board. The course is offered as three modules with a fortnight to complete the content of each module and a four week break after that to allow for practise of the materials from the course.  Overall the course lasts for 10 weeks),  Parents will be able to move through each module's content with some flexibility.  In addition, research participants will be offered Skype/phone sessions with a therapist as well as reminder text messages and emails.  Skype/phone sessions will be offered weekly and up to 30 minutes in length, however the exact frequency and duration will vary according to participant need. Completion of activities within the course will be monitored.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study is a randomised controlled trial following CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. Parents of children with CP will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: 
(1)	Online Parenting Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (PACT)
(2)	Wait-list control 
Follow up will occur at 6 months post intervention (retention).  The wait-list condition will be offered the intervention after completion of the review assessment.

    <inclusivecriteria>Parents with a child (2-­6 years old) with Cerebral Palsy. As PACT uses integrated web-based delivery parents are required to have: (1) reliable internet access at home (e.g. ADSL) and be committed to maintaining internet access for the duration of the study; (2) a mobile phone for receiving text messages; (3) an email address for receiving emails; and (4) access to Skype.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>To have sufficient power to detect an effect size of 0.40 (power 0.8) a total sample size of 52 is required. If a conservative retention rate of 80% is assumed this leads to a total of 66 families to be recruited. 

Analysis will follow standard methods for randomised controlled trials using comparisons between the two groups. Initially the two groups will be assessed to determine if they differ on key variables at baseline and covariates will be used to control for this in post-intervention analyses if necessary. The protocol of intention-to-treat analysis will be followed in order to minimise inflation of treatment effects consistent with CONSORT guidelines. The experimental unit will be the family represented by parent-reported data. Attrition analysis will be conducted, although strategies will be used in order to minimise missing data and attrition.  Data will be analysed using SPSS. The hypotheses relating to intervention efficacy will be tested using general linear models, specifically via ANOVA or ANCOVA. Where continuous data exhibit substantial skewness not overcome by transformation, non-parametric methods will be used for simple comparisons. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Our aim is to design and pilot an innovative, translatable ­by design online parenting support package: Parenting Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (PACT) for families of young children with CP. We will pilot PACT in a
randomised controlled trial recruiting 66 families of children with CP (2-6yo). We predict that PACT will be associated with improvements in the parent-child relationship, in child functioning, and in both parent and child 
adjustment and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed immediately post-intervention and at 6 months post-intervention (retention). </summary>
