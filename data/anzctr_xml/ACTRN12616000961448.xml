  <interventions>
    <interventions>A Partnered Pharmacist Medication Charting (PPMC) Model has been in place at Alfred Health in the General Medical Unit since 2012. A pharmacist, in consultation with a medical officer, charts the patient's regular medications on admissions to the unit. A randomised trial demonstrated that the PPMC significantly reduced medication errors on admission compared to the standard medical model.
From the 1st August 2016 the PPMC model will be implemented as standard of care in General Medical Units at the following Victorian health services (hospitals): Melbourne Health (Royal Melbourne Hospital), Monash Health (Monash Medical Centre, Dandenong Hospital), Barwon Health (University Hospital Geelong ), Eastern Health (Box Hill Hospital, Maroondah Hospital) and Echuca Regional Health (Echuca Hospital). 
Each participant will be followed from hospital admission to one month post-discharge, with pre and post phases running for 6 months prior to 1/8/16 and for 7 months post 1/8/16. Data for months passed (Feb to mid-June) will be collected retrospectively.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a pre/post study. Data will be collected for patients admitted before implementation of the PPMC in August 2016 to act as comparison data..
During the 'pre'-period, all patients will have their medications charted on admission by a doctor as is currently standard care. From mid-June to August, data has been prospectively collected. Medical record review will be used to retrospectively collect data prior to June 2016.
The pre-stage will include patient admitted to hospital from February 2016 to August 2016.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Comparisons between study phases will be performed using commercially available statistical software with the advice of a biostatistician. Continuous variables will be compared using means (plus standard deviation) or medians (plus interquartile range) depending on underlying distribution of data. Where appropriate, a Student t-test will be used for normally distributed continuous variables or a Mann-Whitney U test where data is found to be non-normally distributed. Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used for ordinal variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate for categorical variables. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.  

To detect a change in the length of stay of 5% with 80% power at a 5% level of significance, a sample of approximately 5,500 patients in each arm (total of 11,000 patients) is required. 
Based on the current admission data to the general medical units at the 6 health services involved, approximately 15,000 patients should be able to be included during the proposed study period.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A Partnered Pharmacist Medication Charting (PPMC) model has been in place at Alfred Health in the General Medical Unit since 2012. A randomised trial conducted in 2015 demonstrated that PPMC significantly reduced medication errors on admission compared to the standard medical model. 
From the 1st of August 2016, the PPMC will be implemented as a new standard of care in the General Medical units of 6 health services across Victoria. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this new standard of care.
This pre/post study is not seeking participants. All patients admitted to the General Medical units of these services will be enrolled. Ethics approval and a waiver of consent has been granted by the Alfred HREC. </summary>
