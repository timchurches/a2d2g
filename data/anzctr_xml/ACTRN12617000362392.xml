    <interventions>ThermaCare Low-back HeatWraps provide continuous, low-level, direct heat therapy and will be evaluated in two population samples:
Group 1: participants with low back pain occuring for &gt; 3 week,
Group 2: participants who engage in moderate-to-high intensity exercise 3 times a week or more as assessed by the Borg Perceived Exertion Scale

Efficacy of ThermaCare HeatWraps (Pfizer Consumer Healthcare) will be assessed using reliable and valid subjective measures of pain and disability, in conjunction with objective movement and function data (ViMove sensors, dorsaVi Ltd.)

The study will occur across two consecutive days. The first day will provide a baseline assessment of the participant, and will require the following from both groups:

Fitment of ViMove Sensors, followed by a ViMove in-clinic assessment of movement in the "start interview" of day 1
The participant will then leave the clinic whilst wearing the sensors, and will go about their day. This provides a baseline assessment of movement and activity.
The participant will return to the clinic after approximately 8-hours for an "end-of-day interview", and will be required to complete questionnaires assessing pain and disability. This will be followed by a 2nd ViMove in-clinic assessment. Sensors will then be removed for the day.

The second day will assess the efficacy of ThermaCare HeatWraps.
The procedure is almost identical to the first day, with the difference being the additional application of the HeatWrap during the "start interview".
The HeatWrap will be worn outside of the clinic for the 8-hour period, and will be removed following the completion of the "end-of-day interview".

These Heatwraps are wrapped around the low back of the participant  and worn for 8 hours. They will be applied by the treating physician according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each heat wrap is designed to heat to about 40 degrees Celsius  (104 F).

Intervention adherence will be assessed by the treating clinician during the end-of-day interview. No strategies will be utilised to improve adherence, other than the recommendations outlined by the clinician (i.e that the Wrap should be worn for the 8-hours unless you feel extremely uncomfortable etc.)

    <designfeatures>Both participant samples (i.e. 1.Low back pain 2. Regularly engage in sport) will receive the same sequence of interventions, which will be as follows:

Day 2 (Intervention day)
-Intervention applied (i.e. ThermaCare HeatWrap)
- ViMove sensors attached.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>An initial descriptive analysis will be completed on the baseline measures of movement to determine mean scores, ranges and standard deviations of each sample group. This analysis will be repeated at later time points. Wilcoxon Signed Ranked Tests will be completed to determine if participant movement significantly changes following an intervention: One each for Day 1 and Day 2. A repeated measures ANOVA will then be completed on all post trial data for the 2 separate groups to determine movement changes in the post-trial period. 

Bivariate correlational analyses through the Pearson product-moment coefficient, will be undertaken to determine if there is a relationship between movement and pain on movement using data collected at each time point. This potential relationship will be mapped to assess any temporal influences.

Similarly, correlational analyses will be conducted to determine if there is a relationship between daily activity and ODI scores, using data collected at each of the four total time points. This potential relationship will also be mapped over time to determine if there are any temporal effects following initial treatment.

All findings with a p-value &lt; 0.05 will be deemed significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low back pain commonly occurs in the general population, making it an important target for intervention. ThermaCare HeatWraps may prevent and relieve pain in regions such as the low back through continuous, low-level, direct heat therapy. The objective of this Investigator Initiated study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ThermaCare HeatWraps in improving flexibility and low back muscle relaxation, and in patients experiencing pain, reducing pain during movement. 

This study is an intervention trial on two discrete subject samples; (1) people with recent back pain, and (2) people who regularly play sport. ViMove wearable sensors provide precise objective measurements of low back muscle activity and movement in real time and can capture a patients reporting of pain during movement. Outcomes will be assessed through standard ViMove protocols in conjunction with multiple validated measures of pain, perception of change, and function.</summary>
