  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing elective or semi-urgent Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery at Flinders Medical Centre will be identified using the ANZ Cardiac Surgery Registry. The glucose range associated with optimal post-operative outcomes in the 30 day post-op period will be determined.  
Glucose ranges tested will be defined by both absolute glucose ranges, and the Stress Hyperglycaemia Ratio. SHR is defined by the time-weighted glucose during ICU stay divided by the estimated average glycaemia ( as calculated from the HbA1c using the formula developed by Nathan et al. Diab Care 2008;31:147314788. The study is retrospective - patients will have undergone routine post-op intensive care. Pathology results used in the analysis will be those already available through routine care. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>ROC curves will be used to ascertain AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of pre-defined ranges, including ranges designated by both the relative and absolute changes in glucose during post-op critical care management. Best final model will be determined using AUC, specificity and sensitivity from ROC curves in consideration with the lowest OR for adverse outcomes associated with Time-In-Range using multivariable regression. Following variables to be used: 
  - Time In Range 
  - APACHE lllj
  - lactate
  - CABG, re-do CABG, CABG + other cardiac surgery
  - other variables depending on results of univariable analysis and degree of co-linearity
The successful model will then be applied to a validation sample to determine reproducibility.
We will use a cohort of 2500 patients identified in the SHR-CABG study (also listed on ANZCTR) </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patient groups, including post-operative outcomes. The association between hyperglycaemia and poor  post-operative outcomes is strong in patients without diabetes, but a weaker predictor in patients with diabetes.
This discrepancy is in part driven by the difficulty in distinguishing genuine stress hyperglycaemia from chronic high levels seen in diabetic patients. A high plasma glucose concentration in a hospitalised patient can occur because of chronic poor diabetes control and be normal for that patient, represent a transient physiologic response to an interÂ¬current illness (stress hyperglycaemia), or be a combination of the above. 
A metric for stress hyperglycaemia has been developed at FMC - the Stress Hyperglycaemia Ratio is defined as glucose concentration divided by the Estimated Average Glucose concentration, which is calculated from HbA1c. This enables quantification of the relative change in hyperglycaemia eg a patient with a SHR of 1.4 has an glucose concentration 40% higher than their average glucose over the prior 3 months. 
Our previous work indicated that the relative change in glucose was a better indicator of stress hyperglycaemia and more strongly associated with adverse patient outcomes than glucose. 
Patients undergoing CABG surgery require mandatory post-op observation in the ICU setting, and commonly require intervention for glucose management. There is some conjecture that the commonly used glucose control range is no appropriate for all patients. We aim to determine the glucose control range that is associated with the best post-op outcomes. </summary>
