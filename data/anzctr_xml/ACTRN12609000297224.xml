  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is for patients to lie in a bed and be prewarmed with a forced air warming blanket set at 40 degrees for one hour prior to induction of anaesthesia.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive routine care (ie: no prewarming).  The control group are not required to lie on a theatre trolley for an hour prior to their surgery and will simply wait for their operation as they would for usual surgery.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether prewarming can prevent hypothermia. Skin temperature and core temperature (tympanic) will be measured pre and post anaesthesia. During anaesthesia, temperature will be measured using an oesophageal temperature probe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Temperature will measured pre-operatively, intra-operatively and post-operatively every 30 minutes until discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether prewarming effects the duration of recovery from anaesthesia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time spent in the post anaesthesia care unit (from arrival until discharge).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether prewarming effects the amount of surgical blood loss. To assess intraoperative and postoperative blood loss we will use (a) Weighing packs, (b) Measuring Drains and (c) Haemoglobin Balance method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood loss measured intraoperatively and postoperatively.  These measurements will take place at frequent intervals within these periods.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether effects the rate of wound infections.  Wounds will be classified as infected if there was a purulent discharge or painful erythema that lasted for 5 days and was treated with antibiotics within 6 weeks of surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Postoperative wound infection will be assessed during their inpatient stay and also in their scheduled outpatient visits at 3 and 6 weeks post discharge.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be identified from the orthopaedic booking list.  Patients routinely attend the hospital in the week(s) prior to their surgery.  At this point, they will be assessed for inclusion in the study.  If they are eligible and the parents provide informed consent, they will be randomised into the study.  The allocation concealment was carried out using sealed opaque envelopes. The study will be single blinded (the patient and parent will be aware which treatment group they are allocated to, the anaesthetist will be aware, the surgeon will be blinded, the recovery nurse assessing readiness for discharge will be blinded).</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will undergo computer generated block randomisation into two groups: prewarmed versus routine care. Blocks will not be of fixed length.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a controlled single-blind randomised study assessing the effect of prewarming on outcomes of patients with severe cerebral palsy undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.
The study objectives are to assess the effect of prewarming participants prior to anaesthesia with regard to:
i) Avoiding hypothermia.
ii) Duration of recovery from anaesthesia.
iii) Amount of surgical blood loss.
iv) Rate of wound infections.</summary>
