    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible, consented patients will be registered including details of three stratification factors for randomisation: surgery (breast conserving surgery vs mastectomy), planned use of boost or not, and fraction size (2.0 Gy or less vs &gt;2.0 Gy). The completed request for randomisation will be given to the hospital pharmacy who will allocate patients to treatment based on the stratification group they fall into, in a double-blinded fashion, using numbered opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random allocation of patients in a 1:1 ratio within the strata will be undertaken via a computerised method.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Skin injury is a common side effect of breast-cancer radiation therapy. Radiation-induced skin toxicity is a common clinical problem that affects approximately 95% of women receiving breast radiation. Skin reactions range from redness to extensive superficial ulcers. Severe skin reactions can be painful, and may result in treatment interruptions or dose reduction, with reduced effectiveness of treatment. 
Over the years, there have been many trials looking at the various skin care products that are currently in use, but to date none of these have been proven to prevent radiation-induced toxicity. Recently laboratory studies have reported that use of statins (a group of cholesterol-lowering drugs) can reduce radiation-induced inflammatory reactions. They might also reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence.
We are performing this study to see if statins (in this case simvastatin) can reduce the inflammation from radiation in breast cancer patients. We will give 65 patients simvastatin 40mg daily during radiation treatment and for 3 weeks afterwards; 65 patients will get placebo (a dummy pill). A doctor will assess the skin inflammation each week during treatment and several weeks after finishing radiation and patients will also rate any symptoms and side effects.</summary>
