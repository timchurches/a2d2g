  <interventions>
    <interventions>For single dose study, volunteers will be assigned to 3 treatment groups of Nebivolol Hydrochloride: 5, 15, 30mg. After a 10-hour overnight fast, volunteers will receive a single dose of  Nebivolol Hydrochloride oral tablet at approximately 8 a.m. on the following morning with 200mL water.
For repeated dose study, volunteers will received a single dose of  Nebivolol Hydrochloride oral tablet 10mg at approximately 8 a.m. for 7 consecutive  days.
Physical examinations, routine laboratory test(i.e., serum chemistry. hemotalogy and urinalysis), electrocardiogram, blood pressure and heart rate will be measured,adverse events will be recorded throughout the trial. </interventions>
    <comparator>No control treatment for single dose study. Placebo control treatment for repeated dose study. The placebo tablets do not contain nebivolol. Other ingredients in the placebo tablet are exactly the same with test nebivolol tablets.  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic of nebivolol enantiomers</outcome>
      <timepoint>For single dose study, blood will be sampled pre-dose, and 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 26h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h, 268h, 240h.
For repeated dose study, blood samples will be collected  at the following timepoints: pre-dose; 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h after the first consecutive dose;before the 5th,6th,7th consecutive dose; 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 26h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h, 268h, 240h after the 7th consecutive dose.   
The concentrations of nebivolol enantiomers are determined with HPLC-MS/MS. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of nebivolol enantiomers are calculated by phoenix winnolin sofeware.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the impact of CYP2D6 genotype on the pharmacokinetic behavior of nebivolol enantiomers.

The assessment will be performed after all the pharmacokinetic parameters in this study are calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Genotype test of CYP2D6 will be performed at screening. Volunteers with CYP2D6*1*1 or CYP2D6*10*10 will be involved in this study. Pharmacokineitc profile difference will be evaluated between the two genotypes within dose group and between dose groups. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: Adverse events (including bradycardia, Low blood pressure, dizziness and headache), clinical laboratory data(i.e. serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), vital signs, electrocardiogram(ECG), ventilation status, physical exam.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study based on spontaneous reports by volunteers, questioning by investigators, physical examinations, ECG results, vital signs and clinical test analysis. Adverse events information will be recorded in terms of intensity (mild, moderate, or severe), duration, outcome, and relationship to the study drug. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Physical examinations and routine laboratory profiles(i.e., serum chemistry. hemotalogy and urinalysis) will be performed before and 24h after the administration during the single dose study; and on day 1,2,5,8 pre-dose during the repeated dose study.
Holter(24h dynamic electrocardiogram) monitoring will be performed on the screening visit. 4 hour Holter will be performed after every dose.
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured pre- and 2h, 4h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h, 168h, 240h pose-dose  for the single and the last repeated dose  as well as pre- and 2h, 4h, 6h post-dose on day 1 to 6 during the repeated dose study.
ECG will be measured pre- and 24h post-dose and on day 4 during single dose study, and before dose on day1, 2, 5, 7, 8,10 during the repeated dose study.
Volunteers will be instructed to come back for a safety evaluation on vital signs and physical examinations 1 week after the last blood sample is collected. </timepoint>
