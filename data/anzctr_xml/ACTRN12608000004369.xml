  <interventions>
    <interventions>Does the use of novacontrol, an enteral nutrition formula which contains 22g/L of dietary fibre (partially hydrolysed guar gum) prevent diarrhoea.
Participants will recieve sufficient enteral formula to meet thier individual nutrition requirements, the formula contains 22g/L of partially hydrolysed guar gum. Participants will recieve continuous enteral nutrition for 10 days via a nasogastric or PEG tube. If enteral nutrition is ceased prior to being in the study for 4 days the patients data will be disregarded and a new participant will be selected. There will be no follow up period beyond the 10 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Isosource HN - a standard enteral nutrition formula which contains no fibre. Enteral nutrition provided will be individual and based on meeting 100% of the patients nutrition requirements. Participants will recieve continuous enteral nutrition for 10 days via a nasogastric or PEG tube. If enteral nutrition is ceased prior to being in the study for 4 days the patients data will be disregarded and a new participant will be selected. There will be no follow up period beyond the 10 days.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Feeding tube's areplaced into hopsital patient's gut so that liquid nutrition can be given when a patient is unable or unsafe to meet thier nutritional needs.  A common side effect of receiving liquid nutrition through a feeding tube is diarrhoea. There are many causes of diarrhoea, such as infection, the use of certain medications or antibiotics. Long lasting diarrhoea may lead to dehydration and inadequate nutrition.  This research project will test if a liquid formula containing a particular type of fibre given through a feeding tube can prevent diarrhoea. This new liquid formula is called Novacontrol

Studies show that the use of a fibre (called partially hydrolysed guar gum) found in Novacontrol can prevent diarrhoea in some patients. We would like to test this at Austin Health.  Currently there is no standard way to prevent diarrhoea in patients having liquid nutrition.  To provide the best care for our patients at Austin Health, we would like to find a suitable way to prevent diarrhoea in patients receiving liquid nutrition. Results from our study may also help other people who are receiving liquid nutrition through a feeding tube in the future.

Studies show that at least 20 grams of partially hydrolysed guar gum for every litre of liquid nutrition needs to be given to be beneficial in preventing diarrhoea in tube fed patients.     

Novacontrol contains this amount of fibre and is available for use in Australia.  There are no studies which have examined the use of Novacontrol in preventing diarrhoea in tube fed patients.</summary>
