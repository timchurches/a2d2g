    <interventions>The study evaluated the head posture of the subjects with and without temporomandibular disorder (TMD) by photogrammetry and electromyographic recordings of the masseter, anterior temporalis, upper trapezius and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) at rest and maximum intercuspal position were collected.The approximate duration of the assessments was two hours and the overall study was six months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the head posture and the electrical activity of masticatory and cervical muscles  at the mandibular rest and during maximal intercuspal jaw position in individuals with and without temporomandibular disorders. With the results of the study it will be possible to know the relationship between the masticatory and postural systems and this can contribute for a better diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.</summary>
