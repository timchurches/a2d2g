  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Surgery
Treatment: surgery - Surgery plus 2 adjuvant doses of BCG
Other interventions - best medical therapy

Active Comparator: Best Medical Therapy - The best medical therapy group will not initially undergo surgery, but will be treated with the therapy that medical oncologists or surgeons feel is best for the patient. This treatment may include standard or experimental therapies.

Active Comparator: Surgery Alone - The surgery alone group will undergo complete resection (surgical removal) of all known disease, if possible. After surgery, patients will be followed regularly and monitored for disease recurrence.

Active Comparator: Surgery + BCG - The Surgery + BCG group will first have a complete resection (surgical removal) of all known disease, if possible. After recovery from surgery, two doses of BCG will be given two weeks apart. Each dose is given as 8 separate injections into the skin (called intradermal injections).


Treatment: surgery: Surgery
surgical resection to remove all known disease

Treatment: surgery: Surgery plus 2 adjuvant doses of BCG
Patients in the surgical resection + BCG arm will have an additional two visits to receive BCG. The first dose of BCG will be given no earlier than 4 weeks after surgery, and the second BCG dose will follow 2 weeks later. The actual doses are determined by the patient's pre-study tuberculin-reactivity status. Patients with a pre-study PPD induration of =10 mm will be given half the normal dose of BCG. Those with PPD induration of =20 mm will be given 25% of the normal dose.

Other interventions: best medical therapy
Patients randomized to the Best Medical Therapy arm will decide on a course of medical therapy based on what the patient's medical oncologists feels is best for the patient. Best systemic medical therapy may include clinical trials of new agents or standard non-protocol treatments. Patients who progress on the best medical treatment arm may switch to a different medical therapy or, if still appropriate, may receive surgery.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will establish the role of surgical versus nonsurgical approaches in patients
      whose melanoma has spread to distant sites. Results will help clinicians develop a
      standardized initial approach that prolongs survival and optimizes quality of life. Results
      also will indicate whether Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) postoperative immunotherapy
      significantly improves the outcome of patients treated with surgery.</summary>
