    <designfeatures>This was a 2 Arm study. Participants were directed into either Arm based on serum 25OHD levels at baseline. Participants with 25OHD levels &lt;50 nmol/L were classified vitamin D deficient and  directed into Arm 1. Participants who were &gt;=50 nmol/L were classified as vitamin D sufficient and directed into Arm 2.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Bio-availability</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Standard statistical methods will be applied, i.e. establish whether variable is parametric/non-parametric and apply appropriate statistical test. Initially treatments arms will be analysed separately. Initial analysis will compare whether the primary outcome (12 month vitamin D levels) is significantly different between treatments for each arm and will be used to determine the outcome of the clinical trial. 
Secondary outcomes (Secondary outcomes are vitamin D level at 3, 6 and 9 months follow-up as well as serum calcium levels, serum and faecal inflammatory markers, disease activity scores QOL (IMPACT III) and growth parameters and all time points. Also when appropriate, analysis will be attempted by comparing variables between treatment arms when considered scientifically and/or clinically appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vitamin D has been increasingly recognised to play a part in immunomodulation and could have a possible role in IBD pathogenesis. However, only one randomised controlled trial has been conducted to date that used vitamin D supplementation as the main intervention in IBD paediatrics patients. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementations in vitamin D deficient pediatric IBD patient for 6 weeks. In this study patients were randomized into one of the three arms  2000IU vitamin D2 daily, 2000IU vitmain D3 daily and 50,000IU vitamin D2 weekly. The outcomes were determined by 25OHD levels and secondary change in parathyroid hormone and adverse events. Another similar study was undertaken in adult Crohns disease patients and investigated the effects of vitamin D on improved disease course.
This current proposal is unique in that it will compare vitamin D supplementation method (daily dosing vs a single high dose) in IBD, which has not previously been addressed in the literature. Further, the proposal will add to the literature in that there is a one year follow-up which will provide longer term observation of the effects of vitamin D supplementations in pediatric IBD. In addition this study will specifically address the question of whether additional vitamin D supplementation can improve disease activity in patients in a specifically defined Vitamin D sufficient group. In conclusion, vitamin D is generally well-tolerated and adverse effects in these clinical trials were mild and non-specific. None of the studies required withdrawal of subjects due to adverse events from vitamin D intake regardless of their 25OHD levels at the point of recruitment.
