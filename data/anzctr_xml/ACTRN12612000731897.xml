    <interventions>Arm 1: highly purified HMG;  
Arm2: recombinant FSH
HP-hMG administered by intramuscular (i.m.) injections,  rFSH subcutaneausly,
patients underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation following down-regulation with a gnrh agonist in a long protocol. leuprolide acetate, 1mg /days subcutaneausly  (lucrine; abbott) was initiated 5-7 days before the estimated start of next menses and continued as 0.5 mg/days until end of gonadotropin administration. gonadotropin administration was initiated when down-regulation was confirmed by using transvaginal ultrasound showing no ovarian cysts, and endometrium with a thickness of &lt;5 mm or serum estradiol &lt;50 pg/ml. the starting dose of HP-hMG or rFSH was 150 iu for the first three days, followed by according to the patients follicular response. choriongonadotropin alfa, 250 microgram subcutaneausly (ovitrelle; serono), was administered within a day of observing three or more follicles of greather than or equal to18 mm diameter to induce final follicular maturation.</interventions>
