    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - HMPL-523

Experimental: HMPL-523 - Oral administration, at a dose of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000mg once daily or 300mg and 400mg twice daily at Dose-escalation stage.
At the Dose-expansion stage, HMPL-523 will be dosed daily and the dose level will be based on the result from the Dose-escalation stage.
