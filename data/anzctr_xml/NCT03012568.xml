                  this protocol

               -  NOTE: MRI compatible mechanical, prosthetic, and bioprosthetic heart valves may
                  be included as long as the labeling of these devices allow for MRI scans
                  conducted per this protocol

    <summary>This is a clinical investigational plan (CIP) for the "Clinical Study to Confirm MRI Safety
      and Effectiveness Using SJM Cardiac Rhythm Management Systems (ASSURE MRI)". This study
      intends to enroll patients who meet standard bradycardia or tachycardia indications and have
      already been implanted with one of the SJM device/lead combinations listed in this protocol.
      The objective of this study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of each of the four
      SJM device/lead combinations in an MRI environment. This clinical investigation is sponsored
      by St. Jude Medical.</summary>
