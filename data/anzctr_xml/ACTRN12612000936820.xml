  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Congenital heart disease including patients who have had a Fontan procedure, repaired tetralogy of Fallot, arterial switch operation for transposition of great arteries (including Mustard and Senning procedures), as well as patients with uncorrected congenital heart morphology.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The exercise intervention will involve 12 weeks of exercise training involving aerobic and resistance modalities. Training will be performed for approximately one hour, three times a week. Initial sessions will be supervised by an exercise physiologist/physiotherapist and then the participant will exercise independently at a community gymnasium. Aerobic exercise will commence at 50% of the baseline VO2peak and progress to 70% of the VO2peak by the end of the intervention period. Resistance exercise will commence at 50% of the one-repetition maximum and progress to 70% of the one repletion maximum by the end of the intervention period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effects of exercise training in adults with congenital heart disease. Thirty patients with congenital heart disease will be randomised to either a 12 week exercise training program, or control group who will mainatin their usual activities, to review the effect on vascular function, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength  and quality of life.</summary>
