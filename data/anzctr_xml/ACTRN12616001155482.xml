  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children with disability and their families will receive multidisciplinary assessment and therapy, connecting to an occupational therapist and/or speech pathologist via a web-cam equipped laptop or tablet in the childs home, school, or other community setting (i.e., telepractice). The number, frequency, and duration of telepractice sessions will be negotiated with parents/legal guardians and determined according to childrens needs. Therapy services will be delivered via telepractice over a period of 12 weeks, or a shorter period as negotiated with parents/legal guardians.
The delivery of therapy supports will be tailored to children's abilities, interests, and attention levels. Materials used in therapy could include online activities and pictures, or physical books, toys, and activities from the child's own home environment. Similarly, informational materials for parents/legal guardians relating to intervention strategies, their child's disability, and technology requirements will be tailored to the unique needs and situation of each participating child and their family.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Quantitative data (i.e., therapy outcome data, telepractice process data and data on business model factors) will be analysed descriptively by researchers who have not been involved in the delivery of telepractice services. 
Qualitative analysis of interview data will identify key issues or themes relevant to each case. Key themes and issues will then be compared and contrasted across all cases, in order to identify commonalities and differences. 
Qualitative and qualitative analyses will be integrated with a detailed description of the service delivery model utilised for each case in order to provide a more complete understanding of the results and to identify important implications for the wider implementation of telepractice for therapy service provision. 
This project will involve only a small number of children and families in order to collect preliminary information on the feasibility of telepractice, including factors that promote its viability. The findings of this small preliminary study will be used to inform design of a larger Phase II trial of telepractice delivery of therapy services to answer group-based research questions.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with disability living in rural and remote communities often do not receive the allied health therapy services they need to live the best life possible. Telepractice, or the delivery of therapy services via videoconferencing, has much potential for spreading therapists reach into rural Australia. However, little is known about how telepractice can be used to work effectively with children with disabilities. 
In this study, we aim to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes of telepractice provision of allied health therapy services to children with disability living in rural and remote communities in Australia. Fifteen children and their parents/legal guardians will receive assessment and therapy services from an occupational therapist and/or speech pathologist via videoconferencing, connecting to therapists via web-cam equipped device in their home or other setting. Telepractice models will vary across children as negotiated with parents. e.g., location, number, duration, and frequency of sessions will be tailored to childrens needs. Case study methodology utilizing mixed methods will be used to gain insights into the unique settings and circumstances of each individual child, their family, and community, and how these impact on telepractice. We will collect data about (a) effectiveness of telepractice by examining childrens attainment of therapy goals after completing a telepractice therapy episode; (b) acceptability of telepractice delivery of therapy services to parents/legal guardians, allied health professionals, and other stakeholders, via interviews; (c) feasibility of telepractice by examining assessment and treatment process data routinely collected by allied health professionals throughout the duration of a telepractice therapy episode. This research will reveal the essential components of telepractice models needed to achieve outcomes for children and their families, and will demonstrate the potential of technology for addressing inequalities experienced by rural children in accessing quality allied health therapy services.</summary>
