  <interventions>
    <interventions>Caseload midwifery care:
Women allocated to the caseload intervention will receive antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care from a primary caseload midwife with one or two antenatal visits to be conducted by a backup midwife. Caseload midwives work in group practices of four full time midwives each working a cycle of 152 hours during each four week period. The primary midwife is on call for the womans labour and birth except in designated circumstances such as annual leave; sick leave; having more than one woman in labour; or if it is on one of the two days per week that the primary midwife is scheduled to not work or be on call. Care will then be provided by a back-up midwife. The primary midwife will collaborate with obstetricians and other health professionals as necessary, and will continue to provide caseload care in addition to care provided by obstetricians if complications develop.  In addition to providing care until after the birth of the baby, the primary midwife (or a back up midwife) will attend the hospital on most days to provide some postnatal care and will provide domiciliary care following discharge from hospital.  Care will be provided according to hospital guidelines and protocols for up to six weeks following birth.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard or routine maternity care:
Women allocated to the control group can choose from the standard hospital options for care which include midwives clinic antenatally; GP shared care antnatally; followed by general public hospital care in labour and in the postnatal ward. This may involve women seeing a different midwife for every visit; care by junior medical obstetric staff; or shared care with an accredited general medical practitioner (GP)  (i.e. the GP provides the majority of the womans antenatal care, usually nearer to her home, but  the woman is booked for labour, birth and postnatal care at the hospital). Women may see an obstetrician during pregnancy with other referrals or consultation as necessary. When women come into the hospital for labour, 
birth and postnatal care they will be cared for by whichever midwives and doctors are rostered for duty. Care will be provided according to the same hospital guidelines and protocols as for the women in the intervention arm.</comparator>

    <concealment>Women will attend the hospital antenatal clinic affiliated with the hospital for their booking visit. At the first visit (booking clinic) women will be seen by a research midwife who ascertains if the woman has previously received written information and if so, she will be invited to participate. Following written consent, the midwife will randomise the woman to caseload midwifery care with a named midwife or routine care via a central telephone randomisation service authorised by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)  method; and enter details on the Trial Register and Daily Log Book.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Restructuring maternity services to introduce caseload midwifery care involves radical changes to the organisation of conventional or routine midwifery and obstetric practices. All these changes make an impact on health planning and the allocation of finite resources.  Many innovations are introduced in a relative policy vacuum. Models of maternity care are no exception. In addition to evidence on the experiences of women receiving caseload midwifery care and the experiences of obstetricians and midwives offering caseload care, the outcomes of the proposed trial will contribute:
1.	Level 1 evidence of the safety and effectiveness of having a known caseload midwife for the continuum of pregnancy birth and postnatally. 
2.	Level 1 evidence of the safety and effectiveness of caseload midwifery care for women of all risk.
3.	Level 1 evidence on the cost effectiveness of caseload midwifery care and routine obstetric care for all women.
4.	Australian randomised controlled trial data to the Cochrane systematic review of midwife led care.</summary>
