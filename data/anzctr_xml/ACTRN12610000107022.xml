    <summary>Many people who have had a traumatic brain injury experience problems in processing information that can last for many years.Our pilot clincial trial will examine if a herbal supplement can improve memory and information processing if people who experienced a head injury 6-12 months ago and are experiencing persistent cognitive difficulties. The study hypothesis will that improvements in cognitive ability will  occur in participants taking the herbal supplement in comparison to the group taking the placebo.</summary>
