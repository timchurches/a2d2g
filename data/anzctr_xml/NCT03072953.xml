                  ophthalmologist), supported with optical coherence tomography, where available
                  (dependent on site capability) at screening.

             process (i.e. active attempt to let female partner to become pregnant or to
             impregnate, sperm donation, oocyte donation, in vitro fertilization) for at least 30
