Treatment: drugs - NRTI

Experimental: E/C/F/TDF (Cohort 1) - Participants who have not received prior antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and who are virologically unsuppressed at baseline will initiate treatment with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/TDF) single-tablet regimen (STR) for up to 96 weeks.
Following Week 96, participants continued their treatment until all participants discontinued from the study or commercial approval of E/C/F/TDF was received in the applicable country.

Experimental: COBI+PI+2 NRTI (Cohort 2) - Participants who have received prior ARV treatment and who are virologically suppressed at baseline will continue their treatment regimen, switching the regimen's pharmacoenhancer component from ritonavir to cobicistat (COBI), and continuing their existing protease inhibitor (PI; either atazanavir (ATV) or darunavir (DRV)) plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimen for up to 96 weeks.
Following Week 96, participants continued their treatment until all participants discontinued from the study or commercial approval of cobicistat was received in the applicable country.


Treatment: drugs: E/C/F/TDF
E/C/F/TDF (150/150/200/300 mg) STR administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: COBI
COBI 150 mg tablet administered with food orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: ATV
ATV 300 mg tablet administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: DRV
DRV 800 mg tablet administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: NRTI
Participants will receive 2 investigator-selected NRTIs, which may include abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV), didanosine (DDI), emtricitabine (FTC), ABC/3TC, 3TC, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), or FTC/TDF, administered according to prescribing information.
