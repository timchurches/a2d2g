  <interventions>
    <interventions> Each patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver  disease who is diagnosed erectile dysfunction (using the questionnaire IIEF-5 form) will be consultated to urology (andrology) department for further evaluation. The final opinion and diagnosis of the urology department will be collected for the primary outcome of this study. We plan to passively follow each patient for this purpose. and a maximum of 3 months of observation duration wiil be provided for each participant.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To define the causes of erectile dysfunction among nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The presence of erectile dysfunction will be diagnosed using a questinnaire called "IIEF-International Index of Erectile Function-5" which is validated in Turkish population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months following the andrology clinic consultation  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relationship between smoking and diagnosed cause of erectile dysfunction. Smoking status will be  determined by participant's self-report..de</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relationship between age and diagnosed cause of erectile dysfunction. Presence of any correlation between the increased age and the severity of erectile dysfunction scores using IIEF-5 questionnaire will be assessed with spearman's correlation test statistically.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relationship between the components of metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance dyslipidemia) and erectile dysfunction. Body mass index (using height and weight) and waist circumference, blood pressure will be measured by the physician in the baseline visit. Other lab investigations of insulin resistance and  lipid profile will be reviewed from the hospital medical records obtained in the past 6 months of the baseline visit. The numeric relationship between the erectile dysfunction scores and the above parameters of metabolic syndrome will be assessed using the statistical test of spearman's correlation test.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have shown that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in our previous study. The clinical causes of ED, however, are not known. We plan to recruite a new set of NAFLD patients with ED and will advice them to refer to andrology outpatient clinic. Our aim is to simply collect the outcomes of those patients from andrology clinic and investigate the correlation of those outcomes with clinical confounding variables such as age, cigarette smoking, history of hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, drugs used.. Therefore the aim of this study is to identify the causes of ED among the patients with ED.</summary>
