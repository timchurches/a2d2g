  <interventions>
    <interventions>Spinal fusion is surgery to permanently connect two or more vertebrae in your spine, eliminating motion between them.

Spinal fusion involves techniques designed to mimic the normal healing process of broken bones. During spinal fusion, the surgeon places bone or a bone-like material in the space between two spinal vertebrae. Metal plates, screws and rods may be used to hold the vertebrae together, so they can heal into one solid unit. The procedure takes approximate 1-3 hours to complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>A nonsurgical treatment program was constructed on a consensus basis to serve as a guideline within the study. The main component was physical therapy, which could be supplemented with other forms of treatment, such as information and education, treatment aimed at pain relief (TENS, acupuncture, injections), cognitive and functional training, and coping strategies. Thus, the treatment could vary within broad but commonly used limits reflecting the nonsurgical treatment policy in the society.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The size of the study was based on the following assumptions: 1) The primary aim was to compare nonsurgical and surgical treatment. 2). Outcome was estimated as either an essential improvement (1) or as no essential improvement (0) after 2 years. This was analogous to one of the primary outcome measures used in the study, where the result was assessed by the patient as an improvement expressed as either much better or better(1), or as no improvement expressed as unchanged or worse(0); 3) Essential improvement was assumed to occur in 5% of the patients in the nonsurgically treated group; 4) The probability of detecting a statistically significant difference (power) between the main groups should be at least 80%; 5) Calculations were performed with the Fishers exact test (two-sided) and a significance level of 0.05; and 6) We decided to include 225 in the surgical group and 75 in the control group (3:1)). This size basically implied that we would achieve a significant difference (with 80% power) even if only 18% of the patients in a surgical group compared with 5% in a nonsurgical group should be essentially improved. Thus, we considered the suggested sample size being sufficient to detect an assumed clinically relevant difference or 13% (18-5) expressed as essential improvement between the two main groups.</statisticalmethods>
