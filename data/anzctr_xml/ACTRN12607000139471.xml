    <interventions>The latest technique for placing dental implants on edentulous patients (no teeth) is called All-on-Four, and this involves placing a full arch restoration fixed onto four implants in each jaw at the same day. The prospective study will involve the selection of 20 randomly selected patients (10 male and 10 female patients) who are edentulous in both maxilla and mandible. The patients will be followed for 3 years.</interventions>

      <outcome>Prospectively evaluate the success rate of All-on-Four implant rehabilitation. The patients will be put on a recall program which involves:
Microbiological analysis which will be conducted as follows:
Prior to placing the implants, baseline microbiological samples of the oral cavity will be taken as 1) salivary sample and 2) swab from the area of the edentulous ridge. At each review period and using standard techniques, samples will be taken from:
1. salivary sample
2. swab from the edentulous area under the prosthesis
3. swab from the prosthesis
4. sample from around each of the implants</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recently, an All-on-4 (NobelBiocare) concept has been advocated as a possible solution for complete edentulous rehabilitation involving placement of full fixed acrylic bridgework immediately loaded on four implants located in the anterior mandible or maxilla of edentulous patients. This treatment modality has expanded the indication for dental implant therapy to include cases that otherwise could be contraindicated for implant-supported fixed prosthesis. Furthermore, the treatment concept is a very cost-effective rehabilitation for completely edentulous patients which make dental implant therapy affordable for a broader range of these patients.The aims of this clinical trial are to:
·	evaluate the success rate of All-on-Four implant rehabilitation
·	Develop simplified surgical guides and prosthodontic techniques to allow accurate implant placement and provision of functional full arch rehabilitation immediately after implant placement.  
·	Evaluate patients satisfaction before and after treatment.
·	Analyse the development of the microbial flora associated with this implant/prosthesis system
·	Relate the microbial flora to the health of the implant 
The hypothesis is:
·	The All-on-Four implant rehabilitation will provide a high degree of patient satisfaction
·	The All-on-Four implant rehabilitation will show high success values with respect to implant survival, and function and aesthetics of the prosthesis
·	Health of tissues surrounding an implant will be associated with a non-pathogenic bacterial flora.</summary>
