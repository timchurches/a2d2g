    <interventions>Behaviour - Alcohol approach/avoidance task
Behaviour - Sham approach/avoidance task

Experimental: cognitive bias modification training - Participants complete four sessions of the alcohol approach/avoidance task.

Sham Comparator: sham training - Participants complete four sessions of the sham approach/avoidance task.


Behaviour: Alcohol approach/avoidance task
The approach-bias modification is a computerised alcohol approach/avoidance task (alcohol-AAT) in which participants are instructed to respond with an approach movement (pulling a joystick) to pictures in landscape orientation and an avoidance movement (pushing a joystick) to pictures in portrait orientation. The size of the image is increased and decreased by pulling and pushing the joystick respectively, generating a sensation of approach or avoidance. Pictures include images of 20 alcoholic and 20 non-alcoholic drinks presented in a fixed orientation such that participants are in effect instructed to respond to pictures of alcohol by making an avoidance movement (pushing the joystick) and to pictures of non-alcoholic soft drinks by making an approach movement (pulling the joystick).

Behaviour: Sham approach/avoidance task
The computerised training for the sham condition is the same as for the experimental condition, except that in the sham approach/avoidance task, both landscape and portrait pictures all contain neutral (non-alcohol related).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well-established that many substance misusers experience impairment in cognition
      (thinking skills), particularly those needed to regulate and monitor behaviour and ensure
      that goals are achieved. According to the dual-process model, addiction arises from an
      imbalance in 'bottom-up' processing i.e., overactive automatic (impulsive) processes that
      drive behaviours and impaired 'top-down' controlling processes that stop behaviours
      associated with negative consequences. As a result, the individual becomes more sensitive to
      cues in their environment (e.g., alcohol images) that trigger the addictive behaviour.
      Cognitive-bias modification (CBM) is a novel, computer-based training paradigm that trains
      the brain to pay less attention to negative/harmful cues and more attention to positive or
      neutral cues. This approach minimizes the overactive 'bottom-up' processes and improves the
      'top-down' control processes of unhealthy behaviors which enables the addicted individual to
      make better decisions. Recently, CBM has been used with addicted population to alter the
      tendency to approach alcohol, with one German study showing that a 4-session training
      programme was associated higher rates of abstinence at one-year (Wiers et al., 2011). The
      current study examines whether a novel computer based training programme alters cognitive
      biases (the tendency to approach alcohol related stimuli) in alcohol-dependent inpatients,
      and examine whether this enables them to be better at decision-making more generally, and its
      impact on craving and post-discharge abstinence rates. The study will also explore whether
      individual differences in impulsivity and sensitivity to reward and punishment determine
      response to the training programme. This will be achieved using a parallel-groups randomized
      superiority trial design involving approximately 80 patients attending inpatient withdrawal
      programmes in Victoria. The findings are likely to have implications for the design and
      delivery of psychosocial interventions delivered during early recovery from
      alcohol-dependence to optimise treatment effectiveness.</summary>
