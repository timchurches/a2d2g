    <studytitle>Hidden fat in young New Zealand women  what are the metabolic risk and predictive factors?</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>To investigate whether different body fat profiles (hidden versus apparent) of young (16-45 year old) New Zealand European, Maori and Pasifika women are associated with an increased metabolic disease risk, and whether dietary and physical activity patterns are predictors of these body fat profiles and associated with the expression of microRNAs related to energy expenditure/storage.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>A comparative cross-sectional study design will be used to develop different body composition profiles in New Zealand women of three ethnicities (NZ European, Maori, Pasifika). The exposure relevant in this study is total and regional body composition which will inform their belonging to a specific profile. Three main body composition profile groups will be explored:
Normal weight/fat group  normal BMI (&lt;25), normal BF% (&gt;/=22%,&lt;30); 
Hidden Fat group  normal BMI (&lt;25), high BF% (&gt;/=30%); 
Overweight, Overfat group  high BMI (&gt;/=25), high BF% (&gt;/=30%).

The association between body composition profiles and metabolic risk factors will be determined. Predictors of body composition profiles that will be explored include: dietary patterns, physical activity patterns, micro RNA expression, taste perception, eating behaviour.

In total, participants will spend about 3 hours on this project, including all 3 stages over a time frame of about one month. More specifically:
Stage 1 (screening)- about 15-30 minutes. If recruited, participants will be booked for a Stage 2 - research visit to collect data. Each visit will take about 1.5 - 2 hours for blood sampling, blood pressure assessment, anthropometric measurements, dietary questionnaires, taste testing and guidelines for stage 3. 
For stage 3, participants will need to wear an accelerometer for the seven days just after their visit. This will involve daily use of the apparatus, but no additional time required. At the end of seven days, they will need about 30-60minutes to complete questionnaires.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation is based on ANOVA test. A total sample size of 225 women (75 per profile group) per ethnic group will provide 80% power at significance levels of 0.05 to detect a medium effect size f of 0.25 (G*Power 3.1.2). Thus, a total of 675 women will be recruited. For the logistic regression analysis, to detect an odds ratio (OR, two-tailed) of 2 (twice the risk), a total sample size of 225 will provide 98% power at 5% significance. Based on our pilot study that showed a prevalence of 21% of women having a hidden fat profile, a sample of ~1140 women will have to be screened (380 per ethnicity) to find ~75 women per body composition profile group.
Primary statistical analyses will involve ANOVA tests comparing body composition profile groups regarding metabolic risk markers and dietary and physical activity patterns; logistic regression analysis to determine odds ratios of having a hidden body fat profile based on dietary and physical activity patterns; and miRNA expression profiles; and Pearson correlations to determine correlation coefficients between dietary and physical activity patterns and gene expression profiles.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Looks can be deceiving. Individuals that appear slender and healthy may actually have significant and unhealthy fat stores. Previous pilot data identified women with normal body mass index, but an excessive amount of body fat. They appeared lean and healthy, but could have increased risk of inflammatory and metabolic disorders. Genetic make-up may predispose women to this phenomenon; however environmental changes, like diet and activity may change the consequences. 
A significant proportion of young women (~20%), usually classified as having normal BMI (43.0% of the NZ population), may in actual fact have a hidden fat profile with related higher metabolic risk. Since BMI is often used as an indicator for health body size, these women will remain unidentified and will be excluded from early intervention or prevention practices in the public health system. Adolescent BMI values peak at 16 years, are higher in girls, and continue to rise until the age of 34 to 44 years. Therefore this research will target this vulnerable group of post-menarche, premenopausal women, potentially practicing risky eating or lifestyle behaviours that contribute to excessive fat deposition affecting metabolic profiles that may benefit from preventive action.
We hypothesise that the hidden fat profile is associated with increased metabolic disease risk in New Zealand (NZ) European, Maori, and Pasifika women aged 16 to 45 years. We also believe that dietary and physical activity patterns are predictors of body composition profiles by modulating gene (microRNA) expression associated with energy expenditure/storage. Variations in taste perception may further be associated with metabolic phenotypes and/or food preference. This has never been investigated in the multi-ethnic New Zealand population. In addition, we are intrigued to find out whether our nature (genes) is influenced by our nurture (dietary intake and physical activity) when accumulating body fat, and if it differs between ethnicities, particularly in this new emerging at risk group of women carrying hidden fat. These findings may guide evidence-based practice to improve health outcomes, reducing health care costs.
