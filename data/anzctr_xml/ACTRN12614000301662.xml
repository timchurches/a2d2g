    <interventions>Carfilzomib is a proteasome inhibitor and protease inibitors have been shown to be particularly effective in patients with renal failure, with an increased incidence of reversal or amelioration of renal impairment, and have been considered treatment-of-choice in MM patients presenting with renal failure.

Carfilzomib (IV) will be given on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 of a 4-week cycle for Cycles 1 to 9, followed by days 1, 2, 15, 16 in a 4-week cycle from Cycle 10. For the first 10 patients enrolled, the dose of carfilzomib will be 20 mg/m^2 on Cycle 1 Day 1, escalated to 27 mg/m^2 from Cycle 1 Day 8. Safety data will be analysed in these 10 patients, and if well tolerated the next 26-30 patients will be treated with a higher dose escalation, with 20 mg/m^2 on Cycle 1 Day 1, escalated to 56 mg/m^2 from Cycle 1 Day 8. In all patients carfilzomib will be administered in combination with dexamethasone 20 mg PO on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of each cycle. 

For newly diagnosed patients who become transplant-eligible according to the assessment of the investigator, stem cell mobilisation may be performed after 4 cycles followed by autologous transplantation using the institutional protocol.

For newly diagnosed patients who are not eligible for transplant, after 10 cycles of carfilzomib, treatment is ceased when response assessment has indicated CR for 2 consecutive monthly assessments, or if CR is not achieved carfilzomib is continued until progression or toxicity.

For relapsed patients carfilzomib is continued until progression or toxicity.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The efficacy of proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib) in reversing or ameliorating renal impairment in myeloma patients has been demonstrated. The response to myeloma therapy can often be better gauged by the reduction in serum free light chains which have a shorter half-life of 3 to 5 hours, as compared with the full immunoglobulin paraprotein. The initial, very early impact on the level of free light chains is therefore likely to be critical in the effectiveness of carfilzomib in reversing renal failure. We aim to assess the effect of carfilzomib therapy on serum free light chains at very early time-points (24 and 48 hours after the day 2 dose and 24 hours after day 9 dose) following dose administration, with the aim of assessing the value of these measurements as a marker of efficacy and, in future trials, the basis on which to modify treatment regime to maximise the improvement in renal function.</summary>
