    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be identified by nursing staff or treating doctors on presentation to the Emergency department with symptoms of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis. They will all receive standard antiemetic therapy and fluids. They will be provided with an information sheet and the oppourtunity to ask questions. If they agree to participate they will sign a consent form. The nursing staff will open a pre-randomised study pack which will tell them to which group the patient belongs. The allocation is concealed from the medical and nursing staff until the point of entry into the trial by pre-randomisation and sealed opaque envelopes. A label in the pack bearing the study number will be the only identification on the fluid bag. The chlorpromazine will be charted in the notes as per standard practice.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to identify whether the use of chlorpromazine is more effective than standard therapy at treating vomiting associated with Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome. The cause of this condition is unknown but similar syndromes of Adult Cylclical vomiting are thought to be related to migraines. Chlorpromazine has been chosen because it is both an antiemetic and anti-migraine therapy.</summary>
