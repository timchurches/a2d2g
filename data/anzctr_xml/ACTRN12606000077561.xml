    <interventions>IBCSG 32-05 / BIG 1-05 (CASA) is coordinated by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG). The trial will be conducted in Australia and New Zealand by the ANZ Breast Cancer Trials Group.
The overall aim of the CASA study is to investigate the role of PLD as adjuvant chemotherapy for older postmenopausal women for whom chemotherapy is indicated, but standard regimens, derived from trials in younger women, are assumed to be too toxic or inconvenient. Some investigators are likely to choose no adjuvant cytotoxic therapy as a standard for frail patients at advanced age, while others will prefer to offer SOME treatment for all patients with endocrine nonresponsive disease. In order to take into consideration both attitudes towards the same problem, the IBCSG has designed two individual complementary randomized options in order to investigate the role of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy for postmenopausal women at advanced age with endocrine nonresponsive early breast cancer.
Option 1 (designed for patients who, according to the treating physician and/or to the patient's preferences, are candidates to receive no adjuvant therapy):
a. PLD
b. No treatment
Option 2 (designed for patients who, according to the treating physician and/or to the patient's preferences, should receive some adjuvant treatment):
a. PLD
b. low dose metronomic cyclophosphamide and methotrexate (CM)
Note: Caelyx速 (Doxil速), a PLD, is the experimental treatment.

PLD (Caelyx, Doxil) is administered intravenously at a dose of 20mg/m2 every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (total of 8 doses).  Low-dose, metronomic cyclophosphamide and methotrexate (CM) is administered for 16 weeks.  C = cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day orally continuously for 16 weeks; M = methotrexate 2.5 mg/twice a day orally days 1 and 4 of every week for 16 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Breast cancer free interval (BCFI) - BCFI  is defined as the time from randomisation to local (including recurrence restricted to the breast after breast conserving treatment), regional, or distant relapse, or contralateral breast cancer.  In calculating BCFI, second (non breast) malignancies are ignored and deaths without cancer event are censored at teh time of death.  Appearance of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS) either in the ipsilateral or in the contralateral breast is not considered a BCFI event.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three interim and one final analysis are planned with the timing of the interim efficacy analyses based upon both the number of breast cancer events and the median time that patients have been followed.  The expected number of events for the overall pooled, final analysis is 258. The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed as soon as possible after 64 events have been reported, approximately two years after trial initiation. The three other analyses will be performed approximately annually.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerability (percent of patients treated according to the protocol and completing the adjuvant program and percent protocol treatment received)</outcome>
      <timepoint>In order to evaluate short- and medium-term treatment effects, a longitudinal design is used including a baseline assessment (prior to randomisation), and assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Tolerability will also be assessed during three interim and one final analysis. The timing of the interim efficacy analyses will be based upon both the number of breast cancer events and the median time that patients have been followed.  The expected number of events for the overall pooled, final analysis is 258. The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed as soon as possible after 64 events have been reported, approximately two years after trial initiation. The three other analyses will be performed approximately annually.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be assessed at follow-up visits occurring every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for years 2-5 and yearly thereafter until death. Adverse events will also be assessed during three interim and one final analysis. The timing of the interim efficacy analyses will be based upon both the number of breast cancer events and the median time that patients have been followed.  The expected number of events for the overall pooled, final analysis is 258. The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed as soon as possible after 64 events have been reported, approximately two years after trial initiation. The three other analyses will be performed approximately annually.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>In order to evaluate short- and medium-term treatment effects, a longitudinal design is used including a baseline assessment (prior to randomisation), and assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease-free survival (includes second malignancies and deaths)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Disease-free survival will be assessed during three interim and one final analysis. The timing of the interim efficacy analyses will be based upon both the number of breast cancer events and the median time that patients have been followed.  The expected number of events for the overall pooled, final analysis is 258. The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed as soon as possible after 64 events have been reported, approximately two years after trial initiation. The three other analyses will be performed approximately annually.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sites of failure</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sites of failure will be assessed during three interim and one final analysis. The timing of the interim efficacy analyses will be based upon both the number of breast cancer events and the median time that patients have been followed.  The expected number of events for the overall pooled, final analysis is 258. The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed as soon as possible after 64 events have been reported, approximately two years after trial initiation. The three other analyses will be performed approximately annually.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Second (non-breast) malignancy</outcome>
      <timepoint>Second (non-breast) malignancy will be assessed during three interim and one final analysis. The timing of the interim efficacy analyses will be based upon both the number of breast cancer events and the median time that patients have been followed.  The expected number of events for the overall pooled, final analysis is 258. The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed as soon as possible after 64 events have been reported, approximately two years after trial initiation. The three other analyses will be performed approximately annually.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival will be assessed during three interim and one final analysis. The timing of the interim efficacy analyses will be based upon both the number of breast cancer events and the median time that patients have been followed.  The expected number of events for the overall pooled, final analysis is 258. The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed as soon as possible after 64 events have been reported, approximately two years after trial initiation.
