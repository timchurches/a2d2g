  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anthropometric, respiratory muscle evaluation to compare the respiratory muscle strength of institutionalized women with the predicted values for the Brazilian population.
First, women will be submitted to anthropometric evaluation constituted by height and weight measurements (utilizing a stadiometer and a calibrated balance). On the same day, and in just a single session the respiratory muscle strength will be evaluated by measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure values, utilizing an aneroid manovacuometer. For this, each maneuver it will be made at three repetitions with an interval of one minute between each repetition.The forced inspiratory maneuver was performed from residual volume and the forced expiratory maneuver was performed from total pulmonary capacity.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the respiratory muscle strength of institutionalized women and to compare with the predicted values for the Brazilian population. The respiratory muscle strength will be inferred through measurement of the sub and supra atmospheric pressure generated by inspiratory and expiratory muscles respectively, for this will be utilized an aneroid manovacuometer. The inspiratory and expiratory pressures evaluated through the mouth, reflect the pressure that is being generated in the alveolus by the action of respiratory muscles. This technique has been widely utilized to be characterized noninvasive method and its objectives are to identify possible weakness, fatigue and respiratory muscle failure, as well as to quantify the effects of respiratory training.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Evaluation of respiratory muscle strength by maximal respiratory pressure (maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure) is of great clinical importance because it is a quick, simple, non-invasive and low cost procedure that has great diagnostic and prognostic potential for innumerous pulmonary disorders, furthermore is associated to general state of the individuals health. Moreover, studies report that the respiratory muscle strength is linked to the level of physical effort during daily living activities. Based on this fact, we hypothesized that the maximal respiratory pressure of the institutionalized elderly is lower when compared to the normal values predicted to Brazilian population. 
Thus, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the respiratory muscle strength through measurement of maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures, in institutionalized women from 60 to 89 years of age and compare this data to the predicted values for the Brazilian population.</summary>
