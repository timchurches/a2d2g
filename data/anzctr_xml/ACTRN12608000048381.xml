  <interventions>
    <interventions>A diagnostic test (uRNA) that quantitates four messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecules in unfractionated urine. Patients provide a single urine sample prior to cystoscopy. The sample is put into a buffering solution, then the levels of mRNAs in the sample determined.</interventions>
    <comparator>The test will be applied to a prospective series of patients presenting with macroscopic hematuria. The same urine samples will be tested with the FDA-approved urine tests NMP22 ELISA and NMP22 BladderChek. The uRNA and NMP22 tests will be compared with the standard of care which is cystoscopy combined with urine cytology.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prior case-control studies on selected samples showed highly promising levels of sensitivity and specificity for uRNA.
The next phase in the evaluation of the uRNA tests is to carry out a nested case-control study in a clinical population in which uRNA could potentially be useful. This would enable more accurate estimations of sensitivity and specificity as well as estimations of positive and negative predictive values for this population. This study would also enable a formal comparison of sensitivity and specificity for uRNA and each of the FDA-approved NMP22 tests.
The clinical population chosen for this phase is patients with no history of TCC who present with a history of gross haematuria. This is the most common presentation for TCC and forms a relatively well defined population. In this studys patient population, the potential use of uRNA is in conjunction with cystoscopy, where it would aim to identify TCCs which were missed during initial cystoscopy. Currently cytology is routinely used for this purpose and an alternative non-invasive assay NMP22 (Matritech) is also FDA approved for use, although it is not in routine use. 
The nested case control study described here will explore the value of uRNA as an adjunct to cystoscopy and in particular compare the performance of uRNA to that of cytology and the NMP22 tests for the detection of primary TCC in patients with a history of gross haematuria. Of particular interest are the relative sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, the variation in sensitivity and specificity by grade and stage of disease, and the ability of the tests to identify invasive TCC.</summary>
