    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - fluocinolone acetonide intraocular implant
Treatment: drugs - oral corticosteroid with immunosuppressive agents as needed

Active Comparator: 1 - Immunosuppressant medication implant

Treatment: drugs: fluocinolone acetonide intraocular implant
RETISERT (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.59 mg is a sterile implant designed to release fluocinolone acetonide locally to the posterior segment of the eye at a nominal initial rate of 0.6 µg/day, decreasing over the first month to a steady state between 0.3-0.4 µg/day over approximately 30 months.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (Change in the Numbers of Letters Read From a Standard ETDRS Eye Chart) From Baseline to 24 Months in Eyes With Uveitis - Best-corrected visual acuity was measured as the number of letters read from standard logarithmic visual acuity charts by study-certified examiners who were masked to treatment. Visual acuity was measured at all study visits. The primary outcome was eye-specific change in visual acuity from baseline to 2-year follow-up. Positive change values indicate improved vision while negative change values indicate vision has gotten worse. A change of 7.5 letters is considered clinically meaningful.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Macular Edema - center point macular thickness &gt;= 240 micrometers assessed on OCT (Stratus OCT-3 [Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA]) as graded by Central Reading Center</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Uveitis Activity - Uveitis activity was determined by clinician assessment at each study visit. The study ophthalmologist evaluated each eye as active, inactive/never had uveitis or cannot assess.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intraocular Pressure - Incident IOP Greater Than or Equal to 30 mm Hg</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intraocular Pressure (IOP) - Incident Use of IOP-lowering Medical Therapy (Percentage of Eyes With Uveitis That Were Not Being Treated With IOP-lowering Medical Therapy at Baseline and Underwent IOP Lowering Therapy During the 24 Month Follow-up. - The percentage of subjects who used topical or systemic treatment for elevated IOP at any time during the 2 year follow-up and were not on IOP-lowering therapy at baseline is reported.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Self-reported Vision-related Function as Measured by the National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ 25) Vision Targeted Composite Score From Baseline to 24 Months - The NEI-VFQ 25 measures the effect of visual disability/symptoms with generic health and task-oriented domains. The range for the composite score is 0 to 100; higher scores are associated with better visual function. A change of 4 to 6 points is considered to be a clinically meaningful difference.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in SF-36 Mental Component Score From Baseline to 24 Months - Self-reported health related QoL was measured with the SF 36 survey. The mental component score for the SF 36 is a summary measure of mental health primarily based on the social functioning, role emotional, mental health and vitality domains. The score is scaled to a population norm with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores represent better outcomes. The mean change in scores between baseline and 24 months was calculated for each treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in SF-36 Physical Component Score From Baseline to 24 Months - Self-reported health related QoL was measured with the SF 36 survey. The physical component score for the SF 36 is a summary measure of physical health primarily based on the physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain and general health domains of the survey. The score is scaled to a population norm with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores represent better outcomes. The mean change in scores between baseline and 24 months was calculated for each treatment group. A 3 to 5 point difference is considered to be clinically meaningful.</outcome>
