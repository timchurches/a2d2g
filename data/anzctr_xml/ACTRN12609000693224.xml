    <interventions>Therapeutic education and protective footwear. Education class was given by the examiner on 4 group sessions of one hour, once a week for a total of 4 weeks. Special games were used as a teaching tool. During the individual follow up examination (three-months intervals reevaluations), instruction for foot care were reinforced. The protective footwear  was supplied according to individual prescriptions to be worn daily for, at least, 6 hours. Two pairs were supplied during the 2 years follow up.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>53 patients from a public health center in Porto Alegre/RS, with diabetes and neuropathy, were enrolled in a clinical trial and followed up for two years. Subjects were randomly allocated in either intervention  or control group. Therapeutic education was provided in group sessions, and a protective footwear supplied according to individual prescriptions. Statistical analysis using Mann-Whitney non-parametrical test was performed to determine differences in incidence and relapses of ulceration between groups. An analysis of life table and Kaplan-Meier method were used to measure survival time without any ulcers.</summary>
