  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will be a randomised controlled trial with the intervention strengthening and conditioning programs (progressive resisted exercises for upper and lower limb, abdomen and trunk), per usual clinician practice, being informed by a participant preferences questionnaire. The questionnaire is a one-off assessment and takes less than 5 minutes to complete. The population group are those with non-specific chronic low back pain. There will be two 1 hour sessions per week for 6 weeks.  

A 2.5 hour qualitative focus group study of exercise instructor feedback about the exercise preferences instrument will be embedded in the research design. Two 2.5 hour qualitative focus group studies will also be conducted for participants in the intervention and the control groups. It will obtain feedback about participants experiences of the two types of exercise programs. The focus groups will be conducted after completion of the randomised controlled trial. The qualitative research is not a measure of outcome but of experience.</interventions>

    <concealment>Clinics and clinicians
Melbourne metropolitan primary health care clinics that provide exercise programs for rehabilitation of musculoskeletal conditions. The contact details used will be those publicly available in the telephone directory or online at professional association websites. The clinics will be approached by telephone or email/mail advertisement seeking expressions of interest in research participation. This advertisement will contain a summary of the research project and will ask interested clinics to contact the researcher for more information.  After receipt of signed Clinic Consent an in-service/ information session will be scheduled to inform clinicians of the research background and aims. They will be given an Explanatory Statement to read and keep and a Consent Form to sign and return to the researcher if they wish to participate.
Patients
The opportunity for patients seeking back pain therapy to participate will be offered to every eligible consecutive patient in order of contact until adequate numbers of participants are achieved. Clinic reception staff, who are not aware of the research protocol or aims, will ask or advise all consecutive new patients who have non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) and are attending the clinic for exercise prescription. If patients are interested, the reception staff will give them the Explanatory Statement to read and keep and a Consent Form that they will sign and return to the receptionist. Following patient completion of the Consent Form the participants will then complete the set of outcome measures and questionnaires contained in consecutively numbered folders, put these in the accompanying envelopes and return them sealed to the receptionist.  All completed forms, except the exercise preferences questionnaire, will be put into an envelope and returned to the researcher. The completed exercise preferences questionnaire will be put in a sealed envelope, marked EQ, addressed to the researcher and forwarded to the treating clinician. The envelope will only be opened by the clinicians allocated to the questionnaire group and those clinicians allocated to the control group will put this sealed envelope into a sealed box with a slit in the top for collection by the researcher. Reception staff and patients will not know to which exercise prescription group (with or without an exercise preference questionnaire) participants have been allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>Clinicians who have consented to participate will be randomly allocated, by computer-generated codes in sealed opaque envelopes, to one of two groups with stratification to allow equal representation of qualifications. These codes will be generated by an independent Monash staff member who is not part of the research project (Code: exercise questionnaire group (EQ); no exercise questionnaire group(NQ)). Group EQ will open the EQ envelope, keep the completed exercise preferences questionnaire and use it to inform their exercise prescription.  
Group NQ clinicians will not open the EQ envelope and therefore will not receive the completed exercise preferences questionnaire. They will put the sealed EQ envelope in the sealed labeled box, via a slit in the top, for collection by the researcher. These clinicians will prescribe the exercise program as is their usual practice.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The two groups of clinicians have already agreed in their consent forms not to disclose their group allocation. They will be reminded not communicate to which group they have been allocated or any details or findings of the questionnaire. 
To maintain patient blinding, the plain language statement and consent procedures will inform participants that they have an equal chance of receiving one of two valid exercise prescription methods. A blinded examiner will perform all outcome assessments. Participants will also be asked to refrain from discussing their treatment with the outcome assessor. Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted, last data point moved forward.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research hypotheses:
People with chronic low back pain are likely to prefer and participate in exercise programs that are designed with consideration of their preferences, circumstances and past experiences. 

Research Aims:
1. The primary aim of this study is to test the effect of a mechanism for systematically recruiting information about patient exercise program preferences using a questionnaire developed from previous focus group research on exercise adherence and health outcomes compared to designing an exercise program without the assistance of the questionnaire

2. The secondary aims are to obtain feedback from clinicians who have utilized the instrument  to assist with instrument refinement. 

Research Questions:
1. Does participant-informed exercise design improve program engagement and adherence? 

2. Does participant informed exercise design improve health outcomes of exercise programs for chronic low back pain and other musculoskeletal conditions?</summary>
