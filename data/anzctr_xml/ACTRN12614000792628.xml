  <interventions>
    <interventions>The programmed biologic behaviour (ie. rapid growth and slow but inevitable regression involution) of infantile
haemangiomas is precisely controlled by the interaction between cells and their niche. We intend to use freshly
excised and frozen, and parrafin fixed vascular anomaly tissues to further investigate the cellular mechanisms
leading to these lesions. We are also looking for further evidence to substantiate our recent published findings on
biologically significant pathways, such as the effect of hormonal systems including the renin-angiotensin
system on biological processes including haematopoiesis, in the regulation of these vascular anomalies.
The patients in this study after signing a consent form, have their vascular anomaly tissue excised under general anesthetic. It is then entered into our onsite tissue bank - in either snap frozen or paraffin blocked form. As hypothesis surrounding the mechanisms and biology of vascular anomalies are postulated, tissue is taken from the tissue bank for analysis.  The is a broad ranging study and is ongoing, and has an ethics approved end date of 01.01.2023</interventions>
    <comparator>There is not control group as we are looking at excised tissues.  Our control tissue however is Placenta.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Freshly removed tissue samples will be cultured using methods previously used by our laboratory to obtain cells which will be; 
1. Characterised using standard immunocytochemistry,
real time PCR, and western blot.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ongoing, the tissue samples will be obtained on a single occasion for most participants, however for participants who have a revision of their vascular anomaly at any point in time, a second sample will be collected, and the patients will be re-consented at each occasion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Grown in conditioned growth media using cytokines to determine their effect on cellular differentiation. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Ongoing, the tissue samples will be obtained on a single occasion for most participants, however for participants who have a revision of their vascular anomaly at any point in time, a second sample will be collected, and the patients will be re-consented at each occasion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3.Propagated and investigated for their ability to reform these lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ongoing, the tissue samples will be obtained on a single occasion for most participants, however for participants who have a revision of their vascular anomaly at any point in time, a second sample will be collected, and the patients will be re-consented at each occasion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of the key cellular components and their spatial and temporal expression patterns will be studied using paraffin embedded tissues by applying techniques such as immuno-histochemistry. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Ongoing - an anticipated end time-point as stated on our ethics application is 10 years - 2023.  We endeavor to publish information as it comes to light regularly throughout this time.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Any patient undergoing surgical excision of a vascular anomaly who and/or their caregiver/parents give consent for the specimen to be stored in the tissue bank and used for research. Lesions including vascular tumours (such as
haemangioma) and vascular malformations including capillary, venous and lymphatic.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Any patient/caregiver who does not wish to give consent for their specimen to be used for research, and any
specimen that is deemed inappropriate (too small) for research by the pathologist receiving that specimen.
If a patient consents to donate their tissue to the tissue bank, but declines to donate the requested serum and/or
urine samples, their tissue will still be added to the tissue bank as per their consent.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will use frozen and formalin fixed tissues from our tissue bank, freshly excised surgical specimens and up to 10mls of patient serum and urine from both patients treated surgically and medically, to investigate the cause of vascular anomalies including vascular tumours (such as infantile haemangioma) and vascular malformations including arterial, venous, lymphatic malformation and arteriovenous malformations. Recent research by our group has found the involvement of stem cells and the Renin Angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of infantile haemangioma proliferation and involution. We seek to continue to explore the cellular and biological pathways that govern the growth of these vascular tumours and apply our knowledge in the investigation of other vascular anomalies, including expression of haematopoietic, vascular
endothelial growth factor and the RAS pathways.</summary>
