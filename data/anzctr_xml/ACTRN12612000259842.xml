  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Because of the questionable immunogenicity of OPV in moderate to severe chronically malnourished children in a country which is having a hard time ensuring each and every child receives more than 7 doses of OPV, a transitional strategy comprising of OPV and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) may be effective in boosting intestinal and serological immunity in selected high risk populations such as in areas with a high proportion of moderate to severe chronically malnourished children. There is limited evidence to show if OPV and IPV given together results in a sufficient antigenic load to induce enhanced immunogenicity (intestinal and serological) in moderate to severe chronically malnourished children.</summary>
