  <interventions>
    <interventions>This injection is done by vaginal way, on both sides in the operating theatre under sedation. We inject 10ml of Ropivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, at a concentration 0.75% in each Alcocks canal. We observed that after the block, the different symptoms return at different times after the block.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify precisely how long a pudendal nerve block lasts. The questionnaire is based on the seven most commonly observed pain symptoms( rectal pain (irrespective of defaecation), perineal pain, dysuria, vaginal pain, clitoral or labial pain, pain during arousal and pain in the sitting position) in patients, scored using the standardised Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Form a half hour before surgery, then 30 mins, 6 hours, 12 hours, 20 hours, 28 hours 36 hours, 44 hrs and 52 hours after block.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine  how the different symptoms of pudendal neuralgia presented by the patient, evolve following the pudendal nerve block. This will be done  by questionnaires( Visual Analogue Scale (VAS))completed by the patients before and then at regular intervals after the block</outcome>
      <timepoint>The questionnaires will be completed at 6hrs, 12hrs, 20 hrs and 28hrs, 36hrs 44hrs and 52 hrs after block.
If later on the patient undergoes the pudendal nerve release surgery, the same three part questionnaire will be used to observe the evolution of the symptoms after surgery. The
patient will fill in that questionnaire at different times:
1. 3 months after surgery.
2. 6 months after surgery.
3. 1 year after surgery.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The firsrt aim of the study is to identify precisely how long a pudendal nerve block lasts and to find out how the
different symptoms of pudendal neuralgia presented by the patient, evolve during the 52 hours following the pudendal
nerve block.
The second aim is to find out, for patients undergoing afterwards the pudendal nerve release surgery, if there is a
correlation between the particular response to pudendal nerve block and the outcome after surgery.
This will be a prospective study based on questionnaires.
It will include a minimum of 50 women aged 18 or more, who had been referred to the Pudendal nerve Clinic in the
Endogynaecology Department at the Royal Hospital for Women, who meet the entry criteria and who already
consented to undergo a pudendal nerve block as part of their assessment.
The participant will be asked to fill in a questionnaire, always the same, about her symptoms before, just after and then every 6 then 8 hours for 52 hours after the pudendal nerve block.
If the patient undergoes a surgery to release the pudendal nerve entrapment, we will ask her to fill in that same
questionnaire again 3, 6 and 12 months after the surgery.</summary>
