  <interventions>
    <interventions>A one year randomised controlled trial to examine the long-term effect of chronic walnut consumption delivering higher polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intakes in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Participants will be randomised to either  a low fat (30 %E) , low saturated fat  (10%E) based on 2000kcal/day diet or a similar low fat diet,  but inclusive of 30g/day walnuts.</interventions>

    <concealment>An advertisement was placed in the local media.  A screening questionnaire was applied after which subjects attended an information evening where they underwent a diet history assessment and received an accelerometer and physical activity diary.A researcher, independent of the subject interface undertook the randomisation of subjects into diet groups and the code was concealed from the researchers collecting data, as well as from subjects. Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was off-site or at central administration site.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study investigates if the inclusion of a high PUFA food, walnuts, shows favourable trends in body composition in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus over the long term (12 months). We assumed that dietary fat-driven changes in body composition take time. Further we examined how the dietary change occurred through food patterns and whether these changes might impact on clinical (glucose homeostasis, lipids), and metabolic (resting energy expenditure and leptin levels) variables.</summary>
