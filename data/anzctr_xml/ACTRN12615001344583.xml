    <statisticalmethods>The study sample size is based on the baseline values from two randomised studies of good quality  (Tsang et al 1998, Amer J Resp Crit Care Med; Stockley et al 2013, Resp Med) whose participants were broadly similar to ROBUSTs, except in regard to ethnicity. The pooled baseline geometric mean and coefficient of variation of sputum IL-8 in these studies were 15,300 pg/ml and 1.58 respectively. The correlation between baseline and 4-week IL-8 log-concentrations implied by Stockleys results exceeded 0.9 in both arms. We expect this correlation to be about 0.8 at 8 weeks. Clustering by site yields an ICC estimated at 0.12 (the observed ICC for FEV1% in the ROBUST study). The maximum expected attrition is 5%, observed over 12 months for the EMBRACE study. The effective sample size from these three considerations is 40x2.8/2.4x0.95 greater than or equal to 43, and is sufficient to detect a relative reduction of 46% in sputum IL-8 with 80% power. This can be compared to a relative reduction of approximately 55% in IL-8 afforded by erythromycin and of 66% afforded by a 4-week treatment with fluticasone.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchiectasis is a troublesome disease characterised by productive cough, airway inflammation, and repeated bacterial infections requiring antibiotics. The main aim of this study is to assess whether Clonidine can reduce inflammation in the lungs. We will also assess whether similar effects are seen in the bloodstream. We are
interested to see if (transdermal) skin patches of Clonidine are better than oral tablets in controlling inflammation, and which treatment is better tolerated. This study will provide important information for the development of a larger study to assess whether Clonidine treatment can prevent symptom flareups(exacerbations) in patients with bronchiectasis.
Participants will attend 4 study visits over the 8 week study where they will have their health assessed (vital signs,lung function, sputum and blood samples taken), complete questionnaires and study diaries.</summary>
