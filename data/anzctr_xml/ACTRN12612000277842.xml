  <interventions>
    <interventions>Non-invasive brain stimulation will be offered for 5 sessions each lasting for 20 minutes on 5 consecutive days and digital hearing aids will be fitted after the 5th stimulation session.Participants will be followed up for 6 months.

Non invasive brain stimulation (tDCS) involves delivering a low-intensity current with two damp sponge electrodes placed on scalp. One electrode will be positioned over the auditory area on one side of brain. The other one will be placed on the forehead. participants will experience a slight tingling sensation under the electrodes for up to 2 minutes, after which the sensation diminishes and may become imperceptible. There is no need to shave head and the area under the electrode on forehead will be cleaned using an alcohol wipe. Participants will be asked to sit quietly during the period of stimulation. If they feel uncomfortable at any time during the stimulation, will be asked to notify the experimenter immediately.  

Digital hearing aids will be given to participants for long term use (even after 6 months). They will not be taken back.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham tDCS (non invasive brain stimulation) will be delivered through the NeuroConn stimulator (by choosing study mode and putting the special codes for sham stimulation, there will be 8 second initial ramp up and down time, however no stimulation will be delevered between these ramp up and ramp down thought the equipment)

Digital hearing aids will be provided to control group participants as well</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is aimed to study the impact of non invasive brain stimulation (tDCS) and digital hearing aids usage on tinnitus. tDCS leads to transient tinnitus suppression. When multiple sessions of this stimulation are combined with amplification targeted towards tinnitus, we hypothesise that multiple tDCS sessions at the beginning of hearing aid use will result in greater reduction of tinnitus symptoms than hearing aid use alone.</summary>
