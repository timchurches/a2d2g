Patients receiving chemotherapy will be given 0.5 ml of the trivalent seasonal flu vaccine for 2011, intramuscular or deep sub cutaneous, approximately 7 days before the next dose of chemotherapy. This will be a once off intervention. Blood will be drawn at baseline, 3-4 weeks, 6-7 weeks and 6 months after the vaccine dose and will be analysed for Influenza antibody levels.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to study the efficacy of flu vaccine in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, by assessing the antibody response to flu vaccination to see if they reach 'protective' levels

Who is it for?

You may join this study if you are over 18 years of age, have a histologically or cytologically confirmed neoplasm, and are about to start chemotherapy or currently already on chemotherapy.

Trial Details

Patients receiving chemotherapy will be given 0.5 ml of the trivalent seasonal flu vaccine for 2011, intramuscular or deep subcutaneous, approximately 7 days before the next dose of chemotherapy. This will be a once off intervention. Blood will be drawn at baseline, 3-4 weeks, 6-7 weeks and 6 months after the vaccine dose and will be analysed for Influenza antibody levels.

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of flu vaccine in cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy.</summary>
