  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, bilateral, open-label, parallel group, daily wear (DW) study where 80 participants will be randomised to bilaterally wear either senofilcon A or lotrafilcon A contact lenses on a daily wear basis in conjunction with OPTI-FREE [Registered trade mark] EverMoist [Registered trade mark] multipurpose disinfecting solution (MPDS)  for 3 months. There will be 5 scheduled visits: baseline, 2 hour visit, 2 week visit, 1 month visit and 3 month visit. These visits will involve assessment of visual acuity, ocular response by examination with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (a specialised microscope for viewing the eye) and assessment of ocular comfort using questionnaires employing a 1-10 numeric rating scale. Lenses will be worn a minimum of 5 days per week, 6 hours per day. EverMoist will be used after lens removal and as per manufacturers recommendation: Rub lenses with EverMoist (20 seconds), rinse lenses with EverMoist (10 seconds) and store in EverMoist for at least 6 hours. Solution is not to be re-used.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparisons will be made between the 2 lens types and also with the following published data:

Be experienced or inexperienced at wearing contact lenses.
Be able to insert and remove contact lenses.

    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. 
N.B.: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is first used.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Contraindications to contact lens wear.
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.
Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for dispensing studies and 48 hours between in-house studies.
Pregnancy* (either at enrolment or during the course of the trial).
The Investigator may, at his / her discretion, exclude anyone who they believe may not be able to fulfil the clinical trial requirements or it is believed to be in the participants best interests.
*Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient.</exclusivecriteria>
