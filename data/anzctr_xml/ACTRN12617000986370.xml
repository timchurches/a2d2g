  <interventions>
    <interventions>Building Bridges Triple P (BBTP) is a parenting program which aims to promote parent skills and reduce parent reported behavioural and emotional problems of adolescents with a developmental disorder, addressing relationships within the family, and improving outcomes for teens and parents. The sample will therefore consist of parents who have an adolescent child with a developmental disability such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder and others. Eligible participants will be asked to complete the pre-measures in an online format. They will also be asked to complete these questionnaires again at two predetermined times following the Building Bridges program (post-measures). The questionnaires are estimated to take participants approximately 60-75 minutes to complete. 

After questionnaires are completed, participants (parents) will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group (IG) or the waitlist control group (WCG). Participants in the IG will initially complete the Building Bridges Triple P program consisting of five 120-minute face-to-face group sessions held at the UQ Psychology Clinic and three 30-minute follow-up telephone sessions held once per week following the 5 face-to-face sessions. Phone sessions will also be held with the lead researcher and aim to check in with how participants are progressing with implementing the program strategies and assist them in problem solving any issues or barriers in the implementation of the strategies/skills. All sessions (group face-to-face and individual telephone sessions) are held over eight consecutive weeks. The program is manualised and topics covered include understanding teenagers behaviour, promoting positive parenting behaviours and assisting teenagers to manage their emotions. Each participant will receive a workbook (Ralph, Mazzucchelli, &amp; Sanders, 2016) outlining key learning principles covered in each session. All sessions will be facilitated by the lead researcher (a postgraduate provisional clinical psychologist) and trained postgraduate clinical psychology students at the University of Queensland. At the completion of the eight-week program, IG participants will complete the post-measures. At 3 months post intervention, participants in the IG will then complete the follow-up measures. 

Intervention adherence will be monitored via participant reported monitoring with monitoring worksheets provided as part of the program. During the 3 phone sessions, researchers will discuss intervention adherence with participants and any difficulties participants may be having with adherence. 

Intervention fidelity will be ensured as all facilitators will receive training in the program and weekly supervision with Associate Professor Kate Sofronoff, and there will be a fidelity checklist for each session. Required improvements in fidelity will be discussed with the supervisor and addressed accordingly. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the WCG will complete the pre-measures prior to commencing the program, immediately after the IG have completed the program. Approximately 8 weeks after the IG group completes the intervention, the WCG will commence the program. The WCG will complete the Building Bridges Triple P program in the exact same structure as the IG program. This will also be facilitated by the lead researcher and trained postgraduate clinical psychology students.  At the completion of the eight-week program, participants in the WCG will complete the post-measures. IG scores at pre- and post-intervention will be compared. Follow-up scores will be analysed to assess for maintenance effects. IG scores at post-intervention will be compared to WCG scores at pre-intervention to assess treatment effects. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to explore the effectiveness of Building Bridges Triple P in promoting parent skills and reducing the parent reported behavioural and emotional problems of adolescents with a developmental disorder, addressing relationships within the family, and improving outcomes for teens and parents. Parenting programs have been shown to have significant benefits for both parents and children. Parenting programs centered on social learning principles have been recognized by the World Health Organisation (2009) as the gold standard in preventing behavioural problems and promoting healthy childhood development and wellbeing. While research has supported the efficacy of parenting programs for teens and children with disabilities, there is an absence of parenting-based intervention programs tailored to parents of adolescents with a developmental disability. This is particularly concerning given the increased vulnerability of teenagers to a range of factors during this developmental period relative to earlier periods of childhood and the difficulties faced by parents to manage these. The current project aims to evaluate the efficacy of the Building Brides Triple P program, a parent skills training program specifically targeting the unique needs of this population.</summary>
