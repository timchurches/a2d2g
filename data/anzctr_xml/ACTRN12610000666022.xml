    <studytitle>Pharmacotherapy for the Different Phenotypes of Airways Disease</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In a random community sample of people 18-75 years with wheeze and dyspnea, does the response to salbutamol 400 mcg once, iprotropium 80 mcg once or budesonide 800 mcg daily for 12 weeks differ between airways disease phenotypes in lung function, disease control and quality of life?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Ipratropium 80 mcg inhaled single dose
2.Salbutamol 400 mcg inhaled single dose
3. Budesonide 400 mcg inhaled twice daily for 12 weeks 

All participants will receive all interventions in the sequence 1, 2, 3. Interventions 1 and 2 to be administered 1-4 weeks apart. Intervention 3 to be administered over the 12 weeks immediately following intervention 2.</interventions>
    <comparator>The effect of each of the three interventions will be compared across phenotype groups. All participants will receive the same three interventions in the same order; effectively there will be three independent uncontrolled trials. No control intervention or comparison between interventions is planned.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are the most common respiratory diseases in the community. People with these diseases differ in the way the disease manifests itself and some people have features of both diseases. We know that the best medications for asthma and COPD are different but we do not know if best treatment differs between the different types of asthma, COPD and the overlap of the two conditions. This study will answer this question by identifying people in the community with respiratory disease, assessing how the disease manifests in individuals and the effectiveness of three different standard inhaled medications. We will then group individuals into different clusters (types or patterns of disease manifestation) and determine which clusters respond to which different medication. This information will guide doctors who are treating these diseases.</summary>
