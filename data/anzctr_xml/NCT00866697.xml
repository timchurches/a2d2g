  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Investigator-assessed Progression-free Survival (PFS) - PFS is the interval between the date of randomization and the date of progression, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), or death due to any cause. Per RECIST, for target lesions (TLs), disease progression (PD) is defined as &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of TLs, taking as a reference, the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions. For non-target lesions (NTLs), PD is defined as the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Participants (par.) who did not progress/die were censored at the date of last adequate assessment (LAA). Par. who started a new anti-cancer therapy (ACT) prior to radiological progression/death were censored at the date of LAA prior to the new ACT. Par. who progressed/died after an extended period (&gt;=12 months) without adequate assessment (AA) were censored at the date of their last visit with AA prior to progression/death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of randomization until the date of progression or death due to any cause (median time of follow-up was 17.9 months for pazopanib and 12.3 months for placebo)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall surival is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. For participants who did not die, the time to death was censored at the time of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause (median time of follow-up was 24.3 months on pazopanib and 24.2 months on placebo)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival Per Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Criteria - Progression-free survival by GCIG criteria is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per GCIG criteria or death due to any cause. Progression is defined according to RECIST but can also be based upon serum CA-125. Progression or recurrence based on serum CA-125 levels are defined on the basis of a progressive serial elevation of serum CA-125, according to the following criteria: (1) participants (par.) with elevated CA-125 pretreatment and normalization of CA-125 must show evidence of CA-125 &gt;=2x the upper normal limit (UNL) on two occasions at least one week apart or; (2) par. with elevated CA-125 pretreatment, which never normalizes, must show evidence of CA-125 &gt;=2x the nadir value on two occasions at least one week apart or; (3) par. with CA-125 in the normal range pretreatment must show evidence of CA-125 &gt;=2x the UNL on two occasions at least one week apart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of randomization until the date of progression per GCIG criteria or death due to any cause (median time of follow-up was 16.8 months for pazopanib and 11.9 months for placebo)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3-year Progression-free Survival - 3-year progression-free survival is defined as the percentage of participants who are progression-free at 3 years from randomization. Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of disease progression (defined by RECIST) or death due to any cause. Per RECIST, for target lesions, disease progression (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 Global Health Status Score on Day 1 of Week 13 and Months 7, 10, 13, 16, and 25 - The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a self-reported, 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses 15 domains: 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global health status, or quality of life. Global health status is assessed using a 7-item Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 7 ("poor" to "excellent"). Participants were asked to respond to the following questions using the 7-item Likert scale: "How would you rate your overall health during the past week"; "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?" Data are transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent better functioning (better quality of life). Mean changes from Baseline were calculated via mixed model-repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</outcome>

Data are transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent better functioning (better quality of life). Mean changes from Baseline were calculated via mixed model-repeated measures ANCOVA.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the EuroQOL EQ-5D (Five Dimensions) Thermometer Score at Week 13 and Months 7, 10, 13, 16, and 25 - The EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a 2-page, generic, preference-based quality of life measure comprised of a 5-item health status measure and a visual analogue scale (VAS) and is used to generate two scores: the utility score and the thermometer score The thermometer score is based on a vertical VAS. The VAS is designed like a thermometer scale on which the best health state the participant can imagine is referenced at 100, and the worst health state the participant can imagine is marked by 0. Based on how good or bad the current health state is, the participant is asked to draw a line across the thermometer scale. For example, a line drawn across 46 on the scale of 0 to 100 would be coded 46. A negative adjusted mean change from Baseline represents a worsening of quality of life. Mean changes from Baseline were calculated via mixed model-repeated measures ANCOVA.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the EQ-5D (Five Dimensions) Utility Score at Week 13 and Months 7, 10, 13, 16, and 25 - The EQ-5D utility score captures health status across five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety and/or depression. Participants indicated the level of perceived problems in each of the five dimensions on three levels: 1, no problems; 2, some problems; 3, an extreme problem. Unique health states were defined by combining response levels from each of the five dimensions. For example, state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the five dimensions, whereas state 11223 indicates no problems with mobility or self-care; some problems with performing usual activities, moderate pain/discomfort; and extreme anxiety/depression. Responses are typically converted into health utilities or valuations on a scale ranging from 0 (worst health) to 1 (perfect health). A negative adjusted mean change from Baseline represents a worsening of quality of life. Mean changes from Baseline were calculated via mixed model-repeated measures ANCOVA.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Any Adverse Event - An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgement was to be exercised in deciding whether reporting was appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.</outcome>
