  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of HBeAg Positive Participants With Hepatitis B Virus-deoxy Ribonucleic Acid (HBV-DNA) Less Than (&lt;) 100,000 Copies Per Milliliter (Copies/mL) - HBV-DNA was assessed in plasma samples using quantitative Roche polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Taqman tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of 24-weeks follow-up (Week 72)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With HBV-DNA &lt;20,000 Copies/mL - HBV-DNA was assessed in plasma samples using quantitative Roche PCR or Taqman tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of 24-weeks follow-up (Week 72)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With HBV-DNA &lt;400 Copies/mL - HBV-DNA was assessed in plasma samples using quantitative Roche PCR or Taqman tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48 (end of treatment) and Week 72 (end of follow-up)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Seroconversion - HBsAg seroconversion was defined as the absence of HBsAg (a negative result for HBsAg) and the presence of anti-HBs (a positive result for anti-HBs). Both HBeAg positive and negative participants were HBsAg positive at baseline and absence of HBsAg (seroconversion) was analyzed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48 (end of treatment) and Week 72 (end of follow-up)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Normalization of Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Level - ALT is an enzyme found mainly in liver and is measured to check if the liver is damaged or diseased. In case of liver damage or disease, the liver releases ALT into the blood stream and the ALT level increases. Normal ALT level = less than upper limit of normal (40 units per liter).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48 (end of treatment) and Week 72 (end of follow-up)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With HBeAg Seroconversion - HBeAg seroconversion for HBeAg positive participants was defined as the loss of HBeAg (a negative result for HBeAg) and the presence of anti-HBe (a positive result for anti-HBe).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48 (end of treatment) and Week 72 (end of follow-up)</timepoint>
