  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients from Royal Perth hospital with osteoarthritis of the knee will be asked to have some blood tests, an ultrasound examination of their knee and fluid withdrawn from the knee to look for evidence of kallikren kinin proteins involved in inflammation. Consenting participants will undergo a single examination incorporating these tests over a duration of approximately 1 hour.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
