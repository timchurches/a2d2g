    <studytitle>The effect of changing sleep posture on spinal symptoms</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>An uncontrolled intervention study examining the ability of the participants' (aged 18-45 years) who have morning symptoms of neck or back pain, to change their sleep posture and the effects of changing sleep posture on their spinal symptoms and quality of sleep.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention in this study will be the instruction and explanation of the benefits of particular sleeping postures.  
This will involve;
1. Explaining the rationale for why some sleep postures may aggravate spinal pain and stiffness and hence why modification may reduce symptoms
2. Investigator placing participant in the prone and 3/4 prone postures and emphasizing the extension and rotational stress being placed on the lumbar and cervical spine
3. The investigator then placing participants in supine and support side lying to demonstrate preferred postures for the lumbar and cervical spine
4. Providing an A4 printout summarizing the preferred postures and benefits with pictures and text details.

Approximate instructional period will be 30 minutes and provided on an individual basis in the persons home at same time as previously installed cameras are removed.

Participants will be asked to not change medications, or bedding or commence spinal treatment over the intervention period of one month.

Participants will be provided with an email link to Survey Monkey questionnaires to be completed online. If unable to access online, printed copies will be provided for manual completion.

2 infrared cameras will be temporarily installed on stands in the bedroom and activated automatically to record from 8PM to 8AM. Recording will occur for 3 consecutive nights.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spinal pain is associated with risk factors that commonly relate to daytime posture; sitting, bending and lifting. Nighttime is commonly associated with rest and recovery, yet a percentage of healthy adults wake in the morning with spinal symptoms.
The hypothesis of this study is that sleep posture may be a contributing factor to morning spinal symptoms. The purpose of this study will be to explore the ability of a person to change their sleeping posture and determine if changing the sleep posture results in a change in spinal symptoms and quality of sleep.</summary>
