  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive the self-management support Flinder Program for six months.
Flinders Program is a one-to-one self-management support program. It involves a 1-hour face-to-face session during which a trained nurse and the participant identify and prioritise the issues due to the chronic condition(s) the participant has. They then agree on a care plan based upon goals established for prioritised issues. 
Adherence to the intervention is monitored by weekly/fortnightly (based on a mutual agreement) phone calls.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will receive the standard care from the hospital. Standard care involves services provided by physios and general practitioners at the hospital, and also services provided by nurses at the hospital such as introducing the community services.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be chosen from the Repatriation Hospital knee or hip arthroplasty waiting list who have a BMI of 30 or above. They will be sent the patient information sheet, and will be contacted by phone a week after to arrange a visit time if interested. During the arranged visit time, the investigator will explain the purposes, methods, possible risks and benefits of participating in the study. A biostatistician will generate randomised sequences, and the clinical trial pharmacy at Repatriation Hospital will perform the allocation. Allocation involves contacting the holder of the allocation schedule -at the clinical trial pharmacy- who is off-site.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be blocked using varying block sizes, and will be stratified for BMI groups (30-34.9, 35-39.9, 40 and above), and gender.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Self-management support Flinders Program is a safe intervention, and little harm in the application of such a program is expected, therefore, the consequences of a type I error are not severe. Based on a type I error of 0.1, power of 80% and effect size of 0.6 and a two tailed test, the sample size is calculated to 72. With an anticipated drop out rate of 30%, the total sample size is calculated to be 94.</statisticalmethods>
