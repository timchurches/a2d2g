    <summary>This parallel group, open label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pegasys
      (peginterferon alfa-2a) versus untreated control in children (age 3 years to &lt;18 years at
      baseline) with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B. Children without advanced fibrosis and
      without cirrhosis will be randomized 2:1 to treatment Group A, receiving Pegasys 45-180 mcg
      subcutaneously weekly for 48 weeks, or to the untreated control Group B. Children with
      advanced fibrosis will be assigned to treatment group C and receive 48 weeks of treatment
      with Pegasys. Children in the untreated control Group B who have not experienced
      seroconversion 48 weeks after randomization may enter the Switch Arm to receive 48 weeks of
      Pegasys treatment. This offer will be available for 1 year following 48 weeks from
      randomization. Anticipated time on study treatment is 48 weeks. All subjects will be followed
      up for 5 years after the end of treatment (A,C,Switch)/principal observation (B) period.</summary>
