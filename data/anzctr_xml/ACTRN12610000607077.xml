    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Pregnant women will be recruited while attending a routine antenatal visit. The research nurse will ask eligible women to participate, explain the trial and obtain informed consent, collect baseline data and ask women to self-collect a vaginal swab. Women who are culture positive for Candida will be randomised to receive active treatment with clotrimazole or no treatment and the screening result is not revealed. The women randomised to clotrimazole treatment will be notified by phone by a research nurse. A central pharmacy will be responsible for dispensing the study medication which will be sent to participants by mail from the coordinating centre.  This approach has been acceptable and successful in a pilot study.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be prepared by a researcher not involved with treatment allocation, and will use random permuted blocks and 1:1 randomisation.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>We will use a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) study design. Here (as in our pilot study) the strict randomisation and allocation concealment procedures are maintained but women will be randomised to open-label treatment (Canestan (Registerd Trademark)), or no treatment and the screening result is not revealed (consistent with current clinical practice).</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Being born too early is a leading cause of perinatal death and morbidity. This trial seeks to determine whether screening for and treating asymptomatic candidiasis in pregnancy reduces the risk of this serious health problem. The trial will discover whether a simple treatment in pregnancy can reduce preterm birth. If positive, the results will be relevant to the management of every pregnancy.</summary>
