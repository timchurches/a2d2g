  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) incorporates acceptance, mindfulness, values clarification and committing to behavioural oriented goals.   ACT is based on the view that many maladaptive behaviors are produced by unhealthy attempts to avoid or suppress thoughts, feelings, or bodily sensations (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006; Hayes, Wilson, Gifford, Follette &amp; Strosahl, 1996).
The brief (4 session) form of ACT intervention used in this study (Guadiano &amp; Herbert, 2006) will follow the following specifications:
a) the duration of therapy sessions; one hour;
b) the frequency of therapy sessions: 2- 3 per week;
c) the mode of administration:  one-on-one therapy sessions with a psychologist;
d) total duration of the therapy program: 4 sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (TAU) varies for each individual patient, but can include medication, participation in the ward groups and activities, individual sessions with a psychologist (average duration of sessions 60 minutes, frequency of sessions ranging 1-3 times per week); the average duration of the usual treatment program 14 days.  After discharge, TAU includes case-management services.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of the project are:
-to evaluate Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as a form of therapy in treating psychotic symptoms in an Acute Inpatient Service
-to develop and administer a four-session intervention of ACT to treat psychotic symptoms in an Acute Inpatient Service
-to evaluate the long-term effects of an ACT intervention in an Acute Inpatient Service
-to replicate the findings of previous research in an Australian population

The aims of the ACT treatment are:
-to reduce rehospitalization rates for people with psychotic disorders
-to reduce believability of positive symptoms
-to increase commitment to value-based behavioural goals by people with psychotic illnesses</summary>
