    <statisticalmethods>We expect 20% of patients in each arm of the study to require a top up iron infusion, regardless of whether they are in the 1000mg or 500mg arm.
A difference greater than 5% would indicate that one was better than the other (ie if one had rates either less than 15% or greater than 25%) it would be better/worse than the other dose. If these assumptions are correct, then we need 128 in each arm as a baseline. If we then expect 15% drop out, we would need 150 in each arm of the study

Data will be analysed using a range of computerised statistical methods. Specific analyses will depend upon the data. The primary outcome (requirement for additional iron infusion) will be compared between the two groups using Chi Squared analysis. The blood test data will be compared using t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA for analysis of time effects within participants. The mental health data will be analysed using t-tests, analysis of variance, correlational analysis, regression, chi-square, validity and reliability checks on Cronbachs alpha, and principal components analysis where appropriate. Non-parametric tests will be undertaken if data sets are not suitable for parametric analysis. 
To ensure both safety data and efficacy data an interim analysis is going to be performed once 50% of the calculated sample size is reached (or in the event that greater than expected adverse outcomes are observed). This will be assessed by an independent third party, including a statistician and an expert in the field. This will involve interpretation of the analysis, in order to determine if it is imperative to act and initiate a data-dependent stopping of the trial. This can be done based on the following two aspects:
*Treatments are found to be convincingly different by impartial knowledgeably experts 
*Side effects or toxicity are too severe to continue treatment in light of potential benefits
