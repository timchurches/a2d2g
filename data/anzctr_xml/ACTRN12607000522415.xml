    <interventions>Attendance at standard circuit class run three times per week at the brain injury rehabilitation unit at Liverpool Hospital, with the use of a heart rate monitor and physiotherapist to provide auditory, visual and verbal feedback of exercise intensity with the aim to work within the training heart rate zone (50-70% heart rate reserve). The intervention phase will last for 2 weeks (6 sessions)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to investigate if the currently run circuit class at the brain injury rehabilitation unit at Liverpool Hospital currently fulfills one of its aims, that is, to provide a fitness effect. For patients who are currently not working at a sufficient heart rate intensity for a fitness effect, we are investigating if the use of heart rate monitors increases the intensity that patients are able to work at.</summary>
