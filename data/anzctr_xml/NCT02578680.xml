  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Pembrolizumab 200 mg
Treatment: drugs - Cisplatin
Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin

Other interventions - Folic acid 350-1000 µg
Other interventions - Vitamin B12 1000 µg
Treatment: drugs - Dexamethsone 4 mg
Treatment: drugs - Saline solution

Experimental: Pembrolizumab - Participants receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) PLUS pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 (with vitamin supplementation) IV PLUS cisplatin 75 mg/m^2 IV OR carboplatin AUC 5 IV on Day 1 every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg IV PLUS pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 IV Q3W until progression.

Active Comparator: Control - Participants receive saline placebo IV PLUS pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 (with vitamin supplementation) IV PLUS cisplatin 75 mg/m^2 IV OR carboplatin AUC 5 IV on Day 1 Q3W for 4 cycles followed by saline placebo IV PLUS pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 IV Q3W until progression. If progression occurs, participants may be able to receive pembrolizumab Q3W for the remainder of the study or until documented progression.


Other interventions: Pembrolizumab 200 mg
IV infusion

Treatment: drugs: Cisplatin
IV infusion

Treatment: drugs: Carboplatin
IV infusion

Treatment: drugs: Pemetrexed
IV infusion

Other interventions: Folic acid 350-1000 µg
Orally; at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken during the 7 days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and folic acid dosing must continue during the full course of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed.

Other interventions: Vitamin B12 1000 µg
Intramuscular injection in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and once every 3 cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given the same day as pemetrexed administration.

Treatment: drugs: Dexamethsone 4 mg
For prophylaxis; orally twice per day (or equivalent). Taken the day before, day of, and day after pemetrexed administration.

Treatment: drugs: Saline solution
IV infusion

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combined with
      platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy versus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy alone in
      participants with advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
      have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab combined with pemetrexed and platinum
      (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin), OR pemetrexed and platinum (Investigators
      choice of cisplatin or carboplatin).

      The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-pemetrexed
      chemotherapy prolongs Progression Free Survival (PFS) compared to platinum-pemetrexed
      chemotherapy alone.</summary>
