    <concealment>Invitees are randomised to a screening program with preliminary notification letter or without. Invitations to participate are sent by mail, there is no direct interpersonal contact. Help line calls are answered without knowledge of intervention group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Group sizes of 600 each were determined by power analysis assuming that an intervention that produces a 10% increase in participation over control is a significant program improvement. All eligible people were assigned a random number using the MicroSoft Excel RAND function. The listing was ordered by ascending random number. The first 600 people were assigned to the intervention group, the second 600 to control group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Improved participation in screening for bowel cancer is desirable. Currently population scale bowel cancer screening program delivery is by mailed offer, without prior warning, from a central screening service and invitations include a occult blood kit. Invitees may reject this process as they are unprepared to receive such an offer. One approach is to improve communication between screening providers and invitees through improved population scale interpersonal contact. 
We have developed a preliminary letter to precede an postal invitation to bowel cancer screening. The letter simply informs invitees that they will soon receive a screening invitation and provides them with some basic information about bowel cancer screening. We will randomly select invitees from the electoral roll and compare population screening participation between groups with or without the preliminary letter to determine which program results in the greater participation rate. Improved participation in screening will ultimately reduce deaths from bowel cancer</summary>
