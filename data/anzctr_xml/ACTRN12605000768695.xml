  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
Patients randomised to surgery will proceed to their planned surgery within three weeks of radiotherapy. Post operative radiotherapy may be given if indicated. Patients randomised to chemotherapy will be given chemotherapy by intravenous infusion for 4 days, repeated at 21 day intervals. Radiotherapy will commence following the 3rd course of chemotherapy. If required surgery will be conducted at this time. Chemotherapy will then be given simultaneously with the radiotherapy and an additional chemotherapy will be given after the radiotherapy.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Assessments will be 9 weeks following surgery and then every 3 months for 1 year. For patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy assessments will be made on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after 3 cycles and then 3 monthly for the first year. After the first year all patients will be followed up on a 6 month basis.</timepoint>
