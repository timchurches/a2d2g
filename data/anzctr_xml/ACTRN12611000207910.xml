  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>No effective standard treatment of advanced progressive neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) exists, but over the past decade at Fremantle Hospital, we have developed new radiopeptide therapies with encouraging results using Lutetium-177 octreotate.  Recently, we have combined this radioisotope with radiosensitizing chemotherapy to achieve stabilization of disease in over 90% of patients and tumour shrinkage in over half the NETs.  We now seek to combine Lutetium-177 octreotate with a new targeted agent, Everolimus which has proven, although minor suppressive effect on NET progression.  We propose to combine a standard activity of 177Lu-octreotate with escalating doses of Everolimus to define the maximum safe dose achievable. We will then design a study to define the efficacy of this novel radiopeptide Everolimus combination in NET patients with progressive disease.</summary>
