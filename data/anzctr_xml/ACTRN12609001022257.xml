  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participating clinicians from practices randomised to the intervention arm will receive an implementation strategy, underpinned by behavioural theory, designed to address the modifiable barriers to implementing an evidence-based guideline for acute low back pain (LBP) by physiotherapists and chiropractors. 
The intervention will be one full-day interactive workshop (8 hours duration) led by trained facilitators (practising clinicians and academic researchers) and a single follow-up telephone call 2-4 weeks after the workshop. The behaviour change techniques utilised in the workshop include: (a) social processes of encouragement, pressure and support; (b) persuasive communication; (c) information regarding behaviour and outcome; (d) feedback; (e) increasing skills, (f) rehearsal of relevant skills, (g) information provision; (h) prompts, triggers and cues; and (i) action planning and self monitoring.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment/care: Participating clinicians from practices randomised to the comparator treatment will receive a hard copy of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)-endorsed Evidence-based management of acute musculoskeletal pain clinical practice guideline in the mail and a written reminder of how to access the electronic copy of the guideline.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Practices meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to receive either the intervention or control. Restricted randomisation will be used to reduce the probability of baseline imbalance. Within stratum, one-half of the practices will be randomised to the intervention group, and the other half to the control using computer-generated random numbers. Two strata will be defined: type of practice (physiotherapy or chiropractic) and location of practice (rural or metropolitan). A statistician independent of the study will implement the randomisation. They will be provided with only practice codes and stratification variables. Randomisation of practices will be undertaken at one time. Allocation will be concealed from the investigators until baseline data has been collected from practitioners.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random number will be generated using the statistical package Stata/MP 10.1 for Windows (StataCorp. 2007. Stata Statistical Software: Release 10. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Within stratum, practices will be sorted by the random number. The first half of the practices within each stratum will be allocated to the intervention, and the second half to the control.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Little is known about ways to promote informed and effective treatment by providers other than medical practitioners. Expanding evidence demonstrates that interventions to change practice should be targeted at specific clinical behaviours and underpinned by appropriate behavioural theory. Existing research into behavioural change in medical practitioners may not be generalisable to other professionals. Acute low back pain (LBP) is common and chiropractors and physiotherapists provide most care for the condition in Australia. The NHMRC clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for acute LBP provides recommendations with potential to improve quality of care and safety for people with LBP. Relevant CPG recommendations are that x-rays are rarely needed and that patients should be advised to remain active. We are currently investigating the effectiveness of a targeted, theory-based implementation strategy to implement CPGs in general practice (NHMRC project grant 334060). Whether implementation strategies are transferable between professional groups is not known. This project allows us to build on our completed work to date, incorporating qualitative interviews and surveys of physiotherapists and chiropractors to explore barriers and enablers to CPG uptake (NHMRC project grant 436767) in order to develop a targeted implementation strategy for use in physiotherapy and chiropractic clinics. 
A cluster randomised controlled trial will then be conducted to determine the effects of the strategy. Practices (n=136) will be randomised to receive either the developed implementation strategy, including strategies targeted at clinicians and patients, or to a control group receiving access to the CPG alone. We plan to recruit 2720 patients from the 136 practices. The outcomes of the implementation strategy will be assessed at the level of the practitioner (did the strategy result in a change of practice?) and the patient (did the practice change result in improved patient outcomes?). Subgroup analyses will investigate effects specific to chiropractors and physiotherapists.</summary>
