    <interventions>Tracheal and esophageal intubations in randomised patients requiring general orotracheal anaesthesia to elicit Farrukh Airway Swing Test.
Description of intervention (FAST Maneuver)
 After the patient is anaesthetized and paralysed with a neuromuscular blocker, the physician(operator) performs lyrangoscopy and intubates the trachea. Withount moving the larygoscope or inflating the tracheal cuff, the operator ,with the flick of middle finger of the right hand (free hand) displaces the thyroid cartilage towards right. The tracheal tube swings back towards left and touches the thumb of the left hand holding the laryngoscope. This swing creates an angle of 30 degrees to 90 degrees from horizontal direction in the line of angle of mouth . The movement of the tracheal tube is smooth and in one direction.
In case the tube is not in trachea but in esophagus ,When the thyroid cartilage is displaced with the flick of the middle finger of the right hand, the ETT does not swing back but it sluggishly rises 10-20 degrees  and falls back. Some times it does not rise at all. 
The observer can clearly differentiate that the ETT is endo tracheal or in esophagus.
Capnography will be used as a gold standard in this trial for the confirmation of tracheal intubation. Farrukh Airway Swing Test will be assassed for senstivity and specificity against capnography for the confirmation of tracheal intubation.
Positivity criterion
The ETT touches the thumb of the hand holding the laryngoscope or swings to an angle 30 degrees to 90 degrees when the thyroid cartilage is flicked.

 Approximate duration of FAST (Test)

One to two seconds</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in Group A ( control)in whom tracheal intubation will  be performed and the test elicited .
In the intervention group (Group B), oesophageal intubation will be done and the test elicited.
The ability of the blinded observer to differentiate between tracheal or oesophageal intubation after eliciting the FAST will determine the efficacy of FAST against gold standard i.e capnography.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>sensitivity and specificity of Farrukh  Airway Swing Test for confirmation of tracheal intubation.After the FAST is elicited and the observer detects it as tracheal intubation, it is further confirmed by end tidal capnography as true positive. So end tidal capnography is the standard tool against which the sensitivity and specificity of Fast will be assessed.
True Positive (TP) will be the patients with ETT in trachea as confirmed by end tidal capnography who will be correctly identified as tracheal intubation by the new test.(FAST)
False positive( FP) will be patients with oesophageal intubation as done under direct vision by the operator who will be falsely labelled as tracheal by the observer. After  eliciting the test they will be tracheally intubated and confirmed by capnography.
True Negative (TN )will be the patients in whom oesophageal intubation will be performed under direct vision by the operator who will be correctly identified as oesophageal by the test .
False Negative (FN) will be the patients with ETT in trachea as confirmed by end tidal capnography who will be falsely identified as oesophageal  intubation by the new test.(FAST)
sensitivity,specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of FAST will be calculated

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A decreased time to detection of esophageal intubation, utilizing Farrukh Airway Swing Test, will allow for the re-positioning of the tracheal tube in the trachea during the same laryngoscopy. This will save precious time in hypoxaemic conditions.

    <summary>Objective
To determine the efficacy of "FARRUKH  AIRWAY SWING TEST" to confirm tracheal intubation
Study Design
Prospective validation study for the diagnostic test.A randomized controlled trial
Settings
A 1000 bedded tertiary care hospital-Department of Anaesthesia and pain management

Patients
ASA1,MP1,Both genders,18-40 years old
GP A- 28 patients,GP B-27 patient volunteers
Main outcome measures
sensitivity, specificity,positive predictive value,negative predictive value for tracheal intubation confirmation test(Farrukh Airway Swing Test).
Method- Technique of Farrukh Airway Swing Test (FAST)
Group A
After GA,muscle relaxation ,laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by the operator, during the same laryngoscopy, FAST Iis elicited. The tracheal tube jumps to the left.The degrees of swing to the left is noted by the observer.
Group B
In patient volunteers,The esophagus is intubated first,FAST elicited. The degrees of rise or jump of tracheal tube is noted by the observer and compared to group A. During the same laryngoscopy a new endotracheal tube is placed in the trachea. The whole procedure should not take more than 50 seconds.
All the patients will be preoxgenated for three minutes in both the groups.
ECG,Spo2,NIBP, Will be monitored. Capnography will be used as a "Gold standard " for tracheal intubation confirmation.
