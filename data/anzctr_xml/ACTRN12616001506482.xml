  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive three different interventions in random order: (1) application of red Kinesio tape; (2) application of blue Kinesio tape; and (3) application of beige (skin colour) Kinesio tape.
Kinesio tape will be applied by a registered physiotherapist to the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis muscles of the dominant limb, in longitudinal strips from proximal to distal. The tape will be applied with 50% tension on the middle of the strip, and no tension on the ends. The rectus femoris tape will extend from 10 cm below the anterior superior iliac spine to the superior boarder of the patella. Tape applied to the vastus lateralis will extend from the greater trochanter to the lateral boarder of the patella, while the vastus medialis tape will extend from the middle third of this muscle to the medial boarder of the patella. Tape will be applied while the participant is standing on the foot of the non-taped leg, with the hip of the taped limb in neutral positioning and the knee flexed to 90 degrees. The tape will be kept for the duration of the assessment (about 20 minutes). Once the first assessment is completed, participants will be given at least 5 minutes to rest and will need to rate No exertion at all on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale before the new assessment commences. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will undergo assessment on two different control conditions, allocated in random order: (1) application of beige (skin colour) Kinesio tape without tension, which will be a sham intervention; and (2) no tape.
The application of the beige Kinesio tape will follow the same procedures however no tension will be added on application.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Maximising performance and facilitating recovery following injury are important goals for athletes. An ever-expanding industry is dedicated to the provision of therapeutic products designed to optimise function. One example of such product is the Kinesio tape, which is claimed to promote healing and facilitate neuromuscular activity, leading to an improved performance. There is also suggestion that the colour of the tape may influence performance. 
This crossover randomised study will determine if lower limb performance is influenced by (1) the application of Kinesio tape and (2) by the colour of Kinesio tape in healthy individuals. For that aim, healthy participants will be assessed in 5 conditions that will be allocated in random order: (1) red Kinesio tape; (2) blue Kinesio tape; (3) beige colour Kinesio tape; (4) beige colour Kinesio tape with no tension (sham); and (5) no tape (control). The tape will be applied to vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and rectus femoris muslces of the dominant leg. The primary outcome will be the performance of participants on the horizontal jump test. Secondary outcomes include: (1) knee extensor torque and (2) neuromuscular function (motor evoqued potentials of the rectus femoris muscle).</summary>
