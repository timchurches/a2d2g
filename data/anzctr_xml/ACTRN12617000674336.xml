  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomized to either the mobile phone or control condition. All will be asked to do a walking route around Auckland Domain for approximately 12 minutes. The walking route is on grass over park-like grounds. Those randomized to the mobile phone condition will be asked to read information about the Auckland Domain on a mobile phone while they are walking.  All participants will receive verbal and visual instructions about the route for the walking task and will be fitted with the wrist worn fitness and heart rate monitor (Garmin vivosmart HR) to record heart rate, step count and walking speed. During the walking task a stationary digital video recorder will video each participant on the same stretch of the walking loop. These behavioural data will later be analysed for information on adherence to the assigned condition, posture and gaze behaviour. </interventions>
    <comparator>Those in the control condition will complete the walking task without looking at a phone.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>An ANCOVA with between subject factor of group allocation (mobile phone or not) will be used to analyze the data, controlling for baseline scores of measured variables. 
Hackford (2015) found an effect size of partial eta squared =.06 of posture (slumped versus. upright) on both low arousal negative affect and high arousal affect during walking in a standardized stressful situation. G power indicates that to find a similar intermediate sized effect, using power of .80, alpha of .05 and an ANCOVA controlling for baseline measures, 125 participants would be required overall.
Other relevant studies which also found medium size effects are Andrews-Smith (2016), who found an effect size of partial eta squared of =.073 of eye gaze direction on overall mood in a non stressful situation, and Miller &amp; Krizan (2016) who found an effect size of d=.57 of walking on positive affect.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate whether looking at a mobile phone can moderate the positive effect of walking on mood. An experiment will be conducted with 125 participants randomised to walk for approximately 12 minutes either while looking at a mobile phone or while not looking at a mobile phone.
The investigators hypothesize that walking with a mobile phone will result in lower overall mood, less positive and more negative mood, more negative affect and lower feelings of power compared to those who walk without a mobile phone. We expect that this will be mediated by slumped posture with downward eye gaze and/or by lower connectedness with nature and/or by lower physiological arousal. We expect that the group with the mobile phone will take longer to complete the walk, and will have a shorter stride-length, and smaller arm-swing, lower heart rate and blood pressure. Results will be analysed with SPSS software. </summary>
