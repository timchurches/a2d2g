    <studytitle>Comparison between the stripping technique and the combined excisional/ablative technique for the treatment of bilateral ovarian endometriomas: a multicentric, randomized study</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Patients with bilateral endometriomas underwent laparoscopy cystectomy by two different surgical techniques (stripping vs combined technique), using patients themselves as their own controls, to evaluate ovarian reserve as primary outcome.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each patient with bilateral endometriomas underwent to a single laparoscopy to remove the cysts. In the same laparoscopy  two different techniques were performed: excisional stripping technique on one side versus combined technique (partial stripping and bipolar coagulation on last part on hilus) on the other side. Each patient received both surgical techniques performed at either side after random assignment. The mean duration of surgery was comparable between the two techniques and it was approximately 20 minutes.
Duration of study: one year.</interventions>
    <comparator>The standard treatment was laparoscopic stripping of endometrioma while the comparator treatment was combined technique (partial excisional cystectomy followed by ablative surgery with bipolar coagulation of the final part on the hilus). Each patient received both surgical techniques on different sides. Patients were used as their own controls</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size needed for the study was calculated based on the assumption that the recurrence rate after endometrioma excision is 34% (Vercellini P et al, Acta Ob Gyn Scand 2012;92(1):8-16), and a change of one third in the recurrence rate was considered clinically significant, with an alpha value of 0.05 and a beta value of 0.80. 
T student or Mann-Whitney U-test was used for continuous data and chi-square for categorical variables.</statisticalmethods>
