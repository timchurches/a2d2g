  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a double-blind, randomized, single-dose study to assess the safety and efficacy
      of FX006 for the treatment of pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Approximately 450 patients with OA of the knee will be randomized to one of the three
      treatment groups (1:1:1) and treated with a single intra-articular (IA) injection of:

        -  32 mg of FX006

        -  40 mg of Triamcinolone Acetonide Injectable Suspension, USP (referred to as TCA IR in
           protocol)

        -  Normal Saline

      Each patient will be evaluated for a total of 24 weeks following a single IA injection.
      Following screening, safety and efficacy will be evaluated at 7 out-patient visits (Days
      1[Baseline], Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24).</summary>
