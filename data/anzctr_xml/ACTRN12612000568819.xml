    <interventions>A natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin

A natural oil-based emulsion, as known as Moogoo Udder Cream (Registered Trademark), is a Queensland owned product that comprises allantoin, purified water, sweet almond oil, olive oil, rice bran oil, emulsifying wax, milk protein, aloe vera, vitamin E, glycerol caprylate, piroctone alamine and guarsilk. 

Patients will be asked to start topical application of their allocated cream on the area of skin being irradiated at the onset of radiotherapy, twice a day or more as needed depending on the occurrence of RISR and pain, until the skin reaction subsides. The amount of cream dispensed to each patient will be recorded throughout treatment. If moist desquamation occurs, the topical preparation will be discontinued in the area of skin breakdown and dressings will be applied until the wound heals as per standard care. Patients will be asked to still continue with the topical preparation onto irradiated area that has no breakdown. All participants are given written instructions on how to apply the allocated treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Aqueous cream

Aqueous Cream is a light, paraffin-based emulsion that contains liquid paraffin, white soft paraffin, purified water, emulsifying wax containing sodium lauryl sulphate, cetostearyl alcohol, chlorocresol.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of skin reaction (assessment by the clinician). The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE- Version 4.0) will be used to assess the severity of skin reactions. This scale ranges from 0-5, lower scores representing less severe skin reactions, and higher scores representing more severe skin reactions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (i.e. day-7 to day 0 of radiation treatment), weekly during radiation treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 of radiation treatment), 4 weeks after radiation treatment (i.e. Day 28 post radiation treatment).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life (skin specific) (self-administered by the patient), as assessed with Skindex-16. 
- Skindex-16 is a 16-item self-administered survey instrument to measure the effects of skin condition on quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed at baseline (i.e. day-7 to day 0 of radiation treatment), weekly during radiation treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 of radiation treatment), Week 1,2,3 post treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15 post radiation treatment), 4 weeks after radiation treatment (i.e. Day 28 post radiation treatment).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Modified Brief Pain Inventory (self- administered by the patient)
- This study will use three measures from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), those of the average, best, and worst pain, and pain relief scores from the preceding seven days. The participant will be asked to rate their pain level at the irradiated area. The time of interest of the original BPI is modified from the past 24 hours to the past 7 days for the specific purpose of this study. The scale of 0 to 10 is simple for patients to use and reflects common clinical assessment of pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed at baseline (i.e. day-7 to day 0 of radiation treatment), weekly during radiation treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 of radiation treatment), Week 1,2,3 post treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15 post radiation treatment), 4 weeks after radiation treatment (i.e. Day 28 post radiation treatment).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Itching (self- administered by the patient)
- Itching will be scored on a numeric analogue scale of 0-10 in the treated skin (0= no itching at all), (10= itching as bad as you can imagine).</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed at baseline (i.e. day-7 to day 0 of radiation treatment), weekly during radiation treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 of radiation treatment), Week 1,2,3 post treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15 post radiation treatment), 4 weeks after radiation treatment (i.e. Day 28 post radiation treatment).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment interruptions (as determined by the treating medical staff)
- Yes/ No</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed at baseline (i.e. day-7 to day 0 of radiation treatment), weekly during radiation treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 of radiation treatment), Week 1,2,3 post treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15 post radiation treatment), 4 weeks after radiation treatment (i.e. Day 28 post radiation treatment).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events. Any adverse events will be reported by the investigators. Adverse events will include allergic reactions (e.g. redness or blisters) from the allocated treatment and will be assessed using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. (CTCAE v4)</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed at baseline (i.e. day-7 to day 0 of radiation treatment), weekly during radiation treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 of radiation treatment), Week 1,2,3 post treatment (i.e. Days 5, 10, 15 post radiation treatment), 4 weeks after radiation treatment (i.e. Day 28 post radiation treatment).</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment and blinding 
After the research nurse has obtained the patientâ€™s consent. The research nurse will then allocate participants to either receive Cream 1 (Group 1), or receive Cream 2 (Group 2) according to the generated sequence. This proposed study is a double-blind study. Blinding will be accomplished by not disclosing to the research nurse, medical officers, radiation therapists, nurses or participants which preparation used for skin treatment for each of the participants. 

Both topical preparations: Moogoo Udder Cream (Registered Trademark) and aqueous cream are white in colour, have similar consistency, and have no distinct odour. There are no other differentiating features. Both topical preparations will be provided and coded as Cream 1 or Cream 2 by the manufacturer in identical containers. The manufacturer will only disclose what Cream 1 and Cream 2 are at the completion of data collection. Subsequently, baseline data will be collected.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation
Blocked randomisation will be performed by a computer generated random number list prepared by an investigator who has no clinical involvement in the trial. Stratification by irradiated sites (breast, lung or head and neck), BMI categories (underweight &lt;18.50, normal = 18.50-24.99, overweight =25-29.9, obesity&gt;30) and smoking status (smoking and non-smoking) will be carried out.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the efficacy of two different creams for the management of radiation-induced skin reactions in patients with cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 and are scheduled to undergo radical radiotherapy for lung cancer, breast cancer or head and neck cancer at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital. You will not be eligible if you have any pre-existing skin conditions or have any known allergies towards any ingredient of either of the creams. 

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two treatment groups. Participants in one group will apply a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin to their skin twice a day or more as needed depending on the occurrence of radiation-induced skin reactions. Participants in the other group will use an aqueous (water-based) cream instead. Participants will not know which cream they are using until the end of the trial. 

Participants will be assessed prior to radiotherapy, weekly during radiotherapy, and four weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, in order to determine the effects of both creams in reducing radiation-induced skin reactions, improving pain, itching and quality of life.</summary>
