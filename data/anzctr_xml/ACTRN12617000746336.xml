  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will receive a 6-week activity program to be performed independently, and a wrist-worn accelerometer. They will attend a weekly 60 minute one-on-one review session where a physiotherapist will review accelerometer data and assist the participant to develop goals and strategies to increase daily step count (up to 10,000 steps/day) and progressively increase the number of 10-minute moderate intensity activity bouts (up to 30minutes/day). Participants will wear a FitbitCharge HR continuously for 24-hours each day during the 6-week intervention period, which will provide real-time feedback on steps and heart rate to assist them in meeting daily activity goals. 

At each weekly session, the investigator will review accelerometer data and assist the participant to develop goals and strategies to progressively increase daily step count and the number of 10-minute moderate intensity activity bouts. Strategies to increase volume and intensity of activity will be discussed. At each weekly session, the participant will perform a supervised exercise session that addresses their goals and strategies. The mode, volume and intensity will be individualized.

All participants in the intervention group will receive usual care and therapy prescribed by the rehabilitation team.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive a weekly 60 minute one-on-one session with a physiotherapist to match dose of supervised sessions. During this session, the control group will receive education on stroke and discuss experiences in rehabilitation and returning home. These sessions will occur in a private consulting room at the hospital, or if discharged early, within the patient's home. Themes will include: patient-centred therapy, communication, readiness for discharge, and life after stroke. 

Participants in the control group will not be wearing a FitbitCharge HR device. 

All participants in the control group will receive usual care and therapy prescribed by the rehabilitation team.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date, there are no evidence-based and feasible physical activity interventions for reducing fatigue and risk of chronic disease within the hospital inpatient setting after stroke. This pilot study has been based on (1) published results that identifies a relationship between low levels of activity and increased fatigue in people with stroke (2) known benefits of physical activity on risk of chronic disease and (3) low levels of daily activity observed across all phases of stroke recovery. This pilot study explores an intervention which uses commerical accelerometer feedback within the hospital inpatient setting to assist stroke survivors in achieving activity guidelines for health benefits. 

30 mild-moderately disabled stroke survivors will be randomised into an experimental or control group 2 to 28-days after their stroke. Participants in the experimental group will complete a 6-week activity program with a weekly review by a physiotherapist. At the review, activity goals will be set to gradually increase daily step count (based on the participants daily step count from the preceding week) and increase time in moderate intensity walking bouts &gt;10minutes duration via a graded protocol (i.e. gradual increase in time spent in moderate intensity activity per day). Participants will wear a FitbitCharge HR daily, which will provide real-time feedback on steps and heart rate to assist participants in meeting daily activity goals. Participants in the control group will receive a weekly one-on-one 60-minute session with a physiotherapist to match dose of supervised sessions. This session will be a face-to-face session either within the rehabilitation gym, or when discharged home prior to the 6th week, within the participants home with a registered physiotherapist. Outcomes including fatigue severity, daily activity, risk of disease and functional recovery following stroke will be measured at baseline, post-intervention and 1-month follow-up. Feasibility of intervention and measurement protocols, participant adherence and satisfaction, adverse effects and ease of implementation will be determined.</summary>
