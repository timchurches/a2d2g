  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with angina and no obstructive coronary disease on angiogram will undergo comprehensive invasive coronary haemodynamic studies at the time of diagnostic coronary angiogram to evaluate possible coronary  disorder leading to patient's symptoms and then relating the testing results to outcome, which in this study is ongoing chest pain at one and 12 months follow up.
Haemodynaamic studies will include the assessment of resting angiographic contrast flow, coronary microvascular hyperaemic function, coronary endothelial function and provocative coronary spasm testing. This comprehensive testing will add 30-45 minutes to the diagnostic coronary angiogram procedure.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size is calculated on the principle of a minimum of 10 events per each predictor variable. Results will be expressed as mean +/- SD for normally distributed data and median (25th75th percentiles) for data that were not normally distributed. Fisher Exact test will be used to assess for differences between categorical variables. Student t tests or Mann Whitney rank-sum tests will be used to assess for differences between groups for continuous variables. Logistic regression model will be fitted to identify the determinants of recurrent chest pain. Variables that are significantly associated with chest pain at p&lt;0.20 in univariate analysis will be selected for inclusion in multivariate logistic regression. The final independent predictors were identified using backward elimination. P value of = 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>About 20-30% of patients with angina have no obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiogram (NoCAD). Despite no significant obstructive CAD most of these patients continue to experience recurrent chest pain without any definitive diagnosis. Main aim of this study is to investigate patients with angina and NoCAD with a comprehensive invasive coronary and peripheral haemodynamic studies at the time of diagnostic coronary angiogram and to evaluate the prevalence of various vasomotor disorders in these patients. Further we aim to relate the results of testing to outcome by determining the clinical and coronary haemodynamic predictors of recurrent chest pain on one and 12 months follow up.</summary>
