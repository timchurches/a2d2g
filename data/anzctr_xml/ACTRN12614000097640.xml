  <interventions>
    <interventions>All exercise interventions will be conducted 3x per week over 6 weeks, with approximately 45-60mins of exercise per session, including warm up and cool down. All exercise is supervised and conducted in individual format. Intensity is calculated via an initial VO2max test.



Arm 1 - Moderate Intensity Steady State Exercise - Participant performs steady state stationary cycling at a moderate intensity (60-65% VO2peak).
 
Arm 2 - High Intensity Interval Training - Participant performs repeated short bouts of high intensity exercise (e.g. 1min @ 95-100% VO2peak) followed by lower intensity recovery exercise (e.g. 4mins @ 40-45% VO2peak) on a stationary cycle.</interventions>
    <comparator>All exercise interventions will be conducted 3x per week over 6 weeks, with approximately 45-60mins of exercise per session, including warm up and cool down. All exercise is supervised and conducted in individual format.

Moderate Intensity Personal Preference Exercise - Participant chooses from either treadmill running, stationary cycling, stationary rowing or resistance training conducted at a moderate intensity (60-65%VO2max or 60-65% 1RM).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The propsed study will investigate the suitablity (particularly enjoyment, motivation to continue) of three formats of exercise intervention (Moderate Intensity Personal Preference; Moderate Intensity Steady State; and High Intensity Interval Training) for overweight or obese individuals with clinical depression. In essence, the proposed research will act as a feasibility/pilot study for a later study, which will be based on the results of the proposed research. In this future study a 12 week exercise program will be implemented (based on the proposed study outcomes) which will be compared to and used alongside a gold standard treatment of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for depression. It is important to understand exercise preferences and motivation to continue exercise in this population prior to designing this treatment protocol. We expect that the format of exercise (high intensity vs moderate intensity; interval vs steady state vs personal preference) will differentially affect motivation and enjoyment as well as markers of inflammation, appetite, symptoms of depression and sleep quality.</summary>
