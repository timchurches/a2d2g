  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome  will be asthma exacerbations in people with non-eosinophilic asthma (NEA).
Asthma exacerbations will be defined as severe or moderate according to the ATS/ERS Asthma Outcomes Taskforce guidelines. 
A severe exacerbation will be defined as a participant who requires:
	Use of systemic corticosteroids, or an increase from a stable systemic corticosteroid maintenance dose, for at least 3 days.  (Courses of corticosteroids separated by 1 week or more will be treated as separate severe exacerbations);
	Hospitalisation or an emergency department visit requiring systemic corticosteroids.
A moderate exacerbation will be defined as a participant who has/requires:
	Emergency department visit for asthma, not requiring systemic corticosteroids OR;
	A temporary change in preventer treatment (ICS, OR ICS/LABA) or commencement of antibiotics 
AND at least one of the following:
	Deterioration in asthma symptoms for at least 2 days;
	Deterioration in lung function for at least 2 days;
	Increased rescue bronchodilator use for at least 2 days
Total number of exacerbations will constitute severe plus moderate exacerbations.  Asthma exacerbation data will be collected at 6-weekly clinical assessments, follow-up phone calls, patient diary and by review of medical records.

      <timepoint>Assessed at randomisation, 6-weekly clinical assessments and 3-weekly follow-up phone calls during treatment (48 week period).  Assessed during 48-week follow-up period by 12-weekly clinical assessment and 6-weekly phone calls.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health status, assessed using the Juniper Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at randomisation and 6-weekly clinical assessments during 48-week treatment period and 12-weekly clinical assessments during 48-week post-treatment period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety - Monitoring for occurrence of sensorineural deafness</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment by questioning at 6 weekly clinical assessment and 3-weekly phone calls during treatment. Initially, a small subset of patients will be subject to audiometry before and after treatment if previously sustained significant hearing loss is indicated at screening.  Hearing status in all other participants is to be monitored by questionning.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Symptoms, assessed using a symptom diary and the Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ(6)]</outcome>
      <timepoint>Symptom diary will be issued at randomisation and reviewed at 6-weekly clinical assessments.  ACQ(6) will be assessed at randomisation, 6-weekly clinical assessments and 3 weekly follow-up phone calls during treatment period and at 12-weekly clinical assessments and 6-weekly phone calls during 48-week post-treatment period.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety - Microbiology surveillance and monitoring for clinically significant azithromycin resistance. Assessed via culture of induced sputum and throat/nose swabs.  Colony counting and identification by Pathology Service.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Certain types of asthmatics do not respond well to usual medications.  It is likely that this is due to the type of inflammatory cells found in the airways.  Asthmatics with low levels of eosinophils and high levels of neutrophils may respond better if treated with a class of antibiotics called macrolides.  Long-term use of macrolides helps people with a variety of types of inflammation in the lung.  As yet, it is unknown whether this will help in asthmatics.  The main purpose of this study is to see whether taking two Azithromycin (a macrolide) tablets three times per week for 48 weeks will help people with asthma.  It is hypothesised that taking the Azithromycin will reduce the number of asthma exacerbations (or 'attacks'), decrease the general daily symptoms experienced and improve health status.</summary>
