  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study has three Phases 
1.	Open label within-subject ascending single dosing of ketamine (dose range 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC)) in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Social Phobia (SP) (n=6/diagnosis). Unless there are individual toleration problems, it is anticipated all patients will receive all doses. There will be approximately 1 week between doses.
2.	Double-blind within-subject ascending single dosing of ketamine (dose range 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg subcutaneously) plus double blind active control (midazolam 0.01mg/kg SC) in a separate group of patients with GAD or SP (n=6/diagnosis). The timing of the midazolam dose will be randomized within the ascending ketamine doses. There will be approximately 1 week between doses. 
3.	Patients will be eligible to enter Phase 3 once they have completed either Phase 1 or Phase 2; entry to Phase 3 will be immediately after completing Phase 1 or Phase 2. They must also have had at least 50% reduction in anxiety ratings in response to any dose of ketamine are eligible to receive 1-2x weekly ketamine dosing for up to 3 months to help maintain improvement in anxiety symptoms. The Phase 3 dose will be individualized based on the balance between optimal tolerability and efficacy.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in anxiety rating scales (GAD: Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A); SP: Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI) plus Fear Questionnaire (FQ) items 3, 7, 9, 11, &amp; 14h) predose, 1h, 2h, 24h, 72h, 168h. Primary endpoint is change at 24h.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, O2 sats)  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening and predose, 0:15, 0:30, 0:45, 1:00, 1:30, 2:00h and 24h post-dosing at each dose.  
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerability: reported adverse events. Most commonly patients report feeling woozy or dissociated 10-20mins post dosing. These can be assessed by self-report, or via use of the CADSS scale.  
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Wooziness and dissociation will be assessed predose until 1h post dose. Adverse events will be  recorded throughout the study.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>In Phase 1 dosing will be sequential (lowest dose first, then ascending doses); in Phase 3 the most effective and best tolerated dose from Phase 1 will be used. There is no allocation concealment in Phases 1 and 3.

In Phase 2 dosing will be sequential (lowest ketamine dose first, then ascending doses), with a dose of midazolam (active control) randomly inserted within this sequence. Allocation concealment will be managed by having medication prepared by a pharmacist who is not involved with dosing or rating patients.</concealment>

    <summary>The glutamate antagonist ketamine has rapid onset antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Patients with OCD and PTSD have had similarly rapid improvement in symptoms when administered ketamine. This study will assess if similar improvements occur in patients with GAD and SP.  </summary>
