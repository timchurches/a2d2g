  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will look to assess the response of symptomatic medial knee compartment osteoarthritis to different dosing and injection protocols of mesenchymal stem cells in comparison to accepted conservative management. 30 participants will be enrolled in the study and randomly separated into 3 study groups.
- Group 1. Single intra-articular injecton of 100million stem cells at 0months.
- Group 2. Intra-articular injection of 100million stem cells at 0 and 6 months (total of 200million cells)
- Group 3. Control Group - conservative management.

Autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells will be used due to the ease of harvest (liposuction) and safety in comparison to allogeneic cells.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Conservative management of symptomatic osteoarthritis.  This includes :
- simple analgesia
- weight loss education
- regular exercise
- biomechanical adjustment

The control group will be offered cross over to the most successful treatment protocol at no charge after completion of 12 months follow-up.  Timing of this treatment will be determined by time of completion of data collection for all patients and when the most successful treatment protocol has been clearly determined.  This would be anticipated to be within 2months of completion of data collection.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.	Radiological diagnosis of osteoarthritis using the American College of Rheumatology criteria (Altman, 1986).
2.	Radiological grading of Grade II-III OA of the knee as determined by a qualified radiologist using the Kellgren and Lawrence system (Kellgren and Lawrence 1957).
3.	Medial Compartment OA as determined above.

4.	Primary OA treatment already undertaken defined as: analgesia/anti-inflammatory medication, supplements approved by the treating clinician (eg glucosamine sulphate), an attempted exercise program prescribed by a physiotherapist or medical practitioner for at least 8 weeks (Petrella 2000), weight loss and nutritional management as prescribed by a dietitian or medical practitioner for at least 8 weeks, and biomechanical management including bracing if appropriate as prescribed by a physiotherapist, podiatrist or medical practitioner.  Autologous MSC is an invasive treatment and guidelines recommend trialling conservative measures as the first line of treatment in knee OA (Thompson, Gordon et al. 2009).

5.	A minimum pain score of 5 on an 11-point numerical rating scale.


6.	Single symptomatic  knee osteoarthritis.

8.	Less than 5 degrees varus or valgus knee deformity as measured by the long mechanical axis of the knee on X-Ray.
9.	Sufficient English skills to complete the questionnaires required for the study, as well as to understand the instructions given by the study doctors. This is required as no funding is available for translation or interpreters, and the outcome questionnaires to be used have only been validated in English language.

While involvement in the project will not strictly prevent participants from undertaking such interventions if required, we will exclude volunteers who already have such procedures scheduled.

After direct enquiry from a possible participant and after an initial phone based screen, participants will be invited to attend for a formal assessment to ascertain their suitability for the trial.  If suitable they will be invited to enrol in the study and then complete a formal informed consent.

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis will focus on detecting the between-group treatment effect (with 95% confidence intervals) at each of the follow-up points (1-month, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months following randomisation). Analyses will be conducted using SPSS Version 21, with alpha set at 0.05 using a two-tailed hypothesis. Continuous data will be analysed using linear mixed models (with the group x time interaction estimating the treatment effect). These were chosen for their strength in analysing longitudinal biological data and accounting for correlations associated with repeated measurement. The mixed models will adjust for the baseline score of the outcome of interest as recommended by the revised CONSORT statement. Ordinal data will be analysed using the Mann Whitney U test.
At each follow-up point, participants in each group will be dichotomised according to whether they achieved the minimum clinically important difference of the outcome or not, and then the risk ratio, risk difference and number needed to treat will be calculated along with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance will be evaluated using Chi square analysis. For these purposes, the minimum clinically important difference will be defined as 10/100 for the KOOS, 2/10 for the NRS pain scales, at least much improved on the global rating of change scale and very satisfied on the treatment satisfaction scales. It has been argued that these values for minimum clinically important difference may be too low in some contexts, hence we will repeat this analysis using a threshold of 50% reduction in KOOS scores and NRS pain scores based on empirical validation studies suggesting that this may be a more suitable threshold for important differences.
All data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis, in that all participants will be analysed in the treatment group to which they are initially allocated regardless of their compliance with that treatment. All participants who withdraw from treatment for any reason will continue to be contacted for follow-up assessments and informed that their data are still required. Missing data will be handled via restricted maximum likelihood estimation within the linear mixed models. Given the popularity of simple data imputation methods we will undertake a secondary sensitivity analysis to determine whether the results would differ if missing data were replaced using the last observation carried forward method.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis is a major cause of pain and disability world wide. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of autologous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injections in treating OA. This study involves the use of autologous MSC, autologous meaning that the cells are taken from and injected back into the same person. Based on previous animal studies and initial human patients, these MSCs are expected reduce pain and assist in bone and cartilage tissue repair, supporting their potential in the treatment of osteoarthritis. </summary>
