  <interventions>
    <interventions>Name of intervention being studied:
Bendamustine Hydrochloride (administered in combination with Rituximab)

Patients will be randomly assigned to either investigational treatment (BR) or standard treatment (R-CVP or R-CHOP). Six cycles of treatment are planned, with a maximum of eight treatment cycles permitted as the discretion of the investigator and after discussion with the sponsor or sponsor's designee.

If randomised to the investigational treatment arm, patients will receive Bendamustine Hydrochloride at 90mg per metre squared (body surface area) intravenously on days 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle. Additionally, patients will receive Rituximab at 375mg per metre squared intravenously on day 1 of every cycle of treatment.

The Bendamustine and Rituximab are infused separately:
* Bendamustine: approximately 30 minute infusion
* Rituximab: Infusion duration will vary depending on the size (height and weight) of the patient:
- Cycle 1 - approximately 3-5 hours
- Cycle 2 onwards - approximately 2-4 hours (if Cycle 1 was well tolerated)</interventions>
    <comparator>If randomised to the standard treatment arm, patients will receive either R-CVP or R-CHOP. Each investigator must select the standard treatment clinically appropriate for the patient.

R-CVP
Patients treated with R-CVP will be administered Rituximab at 375mg per metre squared intravenously, Cyclophosphamide at 750 or 1000mg per metre squared intravenously, and Vincristine at 1.4mg per metre squared (2mg maximum) intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and Prednisone at 100mg/day orally on days 1 through 5.

R-CHOP
Patients treated with R-CHOP will be administered Rituximab at 375mg per metre squared intravenously, Cyclophosphamide at 750mg per metre squared intravenously, Doxorubicin at 50mg per metre squared intravenously, and Vincristine at 1.4mg per metre squared (2mg maximum) intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and Prednisone at 100mg/day orally on days 1 through 5.

In both R-CVP and R-CHOP, all intravenous drugs are infused separately. For all drugs, infusion duration will vary depending on the size (height and weight) of the patient:
* Rituximab: approximately 1-4 hours
* Cyclophosphamide: approximately 10-60 minutes
* Doxorubicin: approximately 10-30 minutes
* Vincristine: approximately 5-30 minutes</comparator>

    <concealment>Screening will occur within 30 days prior to start of treatment with study drug, after the patient has provided informed consent. During screening, the investigator will determine the most appropriate standard treatment regimen (R-CVP or R-CHOP) for the patient. After screening, the Eligibility Verification Fax should be completed and faxed to the study monitor for medical monitor review and assessment of eligibility.

Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the investigational treatment group (BR) or the standard treatment group (R-CVP or R-CHOP) in a 1:1 ratio.

If the investigator has preselected R-CVP as the standard treatment, the patient will be randomly assigned to either BR or R-CVP. 

If the investigator has preselected R-CHOP as the standard treatment, the patient will be randomly assigned to either BR or R-CHOP.

The randomisation code will be generated by the Cephalon Development Manufacturing Group following specifications from the Biometrics Department. A statistician not assigned to the study will be responsible for review of the randomisation code, and the final randomisation code will be maintained by the Development Manufacturing Group.</concealment>
    <sequence>An Interative Voice Response System (IVRS) will be used for screening and for randomisation.

Randomisation will be performed centrally, stratified by lymphoma type (indolent NHL or MCL) and by the investigator selection of standard treatment regimen during screening. The patient will be randomly assigned to either the investigational treatment group or standard treatment group in a 1:1 ratio.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness and safety of the chemotherapy drug Bendamustine in treating advanced slow-growing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma.

Who is it for? 
You may be able to join this study if you have advanced indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. 

Trial details 
Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive a combination of the drugs Bendamustine and Rituximab (BR). The other will receive standard treatment with either Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, and Prednisone (R-CVP) or Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone (R-CHOP). 

The study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of Bendamustine and Rituximab (BR) to the current standard treatments.</summary>
