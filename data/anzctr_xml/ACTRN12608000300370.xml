  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assessment on high-heeled female shoes influence in the adolescent posture and gait, which took 23 months. The subjects wore the high heels three times a week at least, for 4 hours consecutively per day, for a period of a year at least. The measurements were taken while the subjects were barefoot and then the same measurements were taken when the subjects were wearing high heels, after being with those shoes for one hour. All the subjects in this group had their posture, gait and plantar impression analysed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group is composed by adolescents who do not wear high heels frequently. All the subjects of this group had their posture, gait and plantar impression analysed as well as in the experimental group (subjects who wear high heels frequently).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postural alterations measured by Software de Avaliacao Postural (SAPO) - in English, 'Postural Evaluation Software' - using marked anatomic points.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For each subject, the measurements for posture were collected in one single day (with the subject barefoot and wearing high heels) and the recordings were repeated after one week.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gait alterations measured by a Force Platform.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For each subject, the measurements for gait were collected in one single day (with the subject barefoot and wearing high heels) and only one recording with 2 different conditions was made for each subject.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Longitudinal Plantar Arch analysis of the sample in both assessed groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For each subject, the measurements for plantar impression were collected in one single day with the subject barefoot (without wearing the high heels during that day) and barefoot again however, after wearing high heels for one hour. Only one recording with 2 different conditions was made for each subject.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The phases before puberty and during puberty are crucial for the development of a good posture. However, they are influenced by internal and external factors that cause postural alterations in these phases, resulting in the structuration of a bad posture that may get worse during the adult phase. Nowadays, among these factors, high-heeled shoes are, and getting more and more precocious and frequent in the adolescent population. The influence of this kind of shoe, despite of changing their postural pattern, changes the gait pattern either. With this data, the present study aim to analyse the influences of high-heeled shoes wearing on the adolescent posture and gait dynamics. For that, we will deal with female adolescents, high-heeled shoes wearers and not-wearers. They will be submitted to an anthropometric assessment and the wear historic of these shoes. For the postural analysis, we will use the Biophotogrametry Method in the sagittal and frontal plane, and these data will be analysed and quantified by Coreldraw 13.0 Software, and we will perform the dynamic analysis by the force platform.</summary>
