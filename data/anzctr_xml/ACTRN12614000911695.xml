  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1
1. effect of a training intervention versus no-training on the test-retest precision and reliability of 2 hr post-prandial satiety evaluation after consumption of a standard breakfast. 

Standard breakfast (total weight 228g) containing cereal flakes (15g each of Kelloggs 'registered trademark' Branflakes 'registered trademark' , Cornflakes 'registered trademark' and Special K 'registered trademark' , sultanas (8g) and whole milk (175g) with an energy content of 1261 kJ

Panelists will be instructed to fast overnight for 10 hours and consume only water prior to consumption of the standard breakfast. Panelists then complete the labeled magnitude satiety scale. Panelists are tested on 4 occasions with a 3 to 7 day washout.

All breakfast bowls are checked to ensure the entire meal was consumed.

During the training intervention fasted panelists will consume the standard breakfast meal at time point 0 and complete the LMS. All LMS results will then be transcribed on a whiteboard and the results discussed. Through discussion consensus will be reached by the panelists on the meaning of the descriptor words and an agreed set of more detailed definitions of the descriptors will be generated by the panel through a process of voting. The training session will occur once during the study, seven days before the 4 test occasions and will be for 1 hour. It will be administered by a primary researcher using a pre-defined scripted protocol. 
Arm 2
2. The trained panelist from arm 1 will complete arm 2. Panelists will fast for 10 hours. A standard breakfast meal with 5g of viscous fibre PGX (A) will be consumed in random order with the control consumed 5g of inulin (B).

Panelists will mark their fasting level of hunger/fullness on the labeled magnitude satiety scale (LMS) over a 2 hour period. Panelists will arrive for breakfast at 8am and must consume the meal in 12 minutes. Panelists will be tested on 8 occasions (the controls of inulin and wheat dextrin will be tested twice, PGX granules will be tested twice and PGX gels tested twice) with a 3 to 7 day washout. Blood sample taken at the 7 time points over 2 hours will be used to determine if a relationship with the satiety rating at the same points exists</interventions>

      <outcome>The training study will be conducted to determine the effect on the reliability of the satiety panel. Intra-class correlation (ICC) between test and retest will be used to determine the effect of training on the reliability of the panel. Satiety will be assessed using a 190mm labeled magnitude satiety scale (LMS). Postprandial glycaemia will be assessed using finger prick blood samples and a Glucose analyser.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Satiety will be assessed twice before the intervention and twice after the intervention. Hunger and fullnes will be assessed at time 0 then panelists consume breakast within 12 minutes, 15 minutes after commencement of eating panelist again mark the LMS, then every 15 minutes for 1 hour and every 30 minutes for the second hour a total of 2 hours.Time 1,2,3,4 have a 3 to 7 day washout between test. Postprandial glycaemia will be measure by finger print bloods at each time point over the 2 hours. </timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the staff and student population of Curtin University (Perth, Australia). All the participants will be recruited through flyers, posters, information sessions. Flyers will be distributed at public places around Curtin University. Completed screening questionnaires will be assessed for compliance  to selection criteria prior to acceptance of participants into the study. Acceptance letters will  be sent to eligible candidates that will contain information on the times and venue for the test days and all the tasks required to be performed on the test days.</concealment>
    <sequence>The person determining if the subject will be eligible for inclusion in the study will be unaware to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation will be concealed by central randomised computer and each subject will be allocated a three digit code at this point. Randomisation will be generated using a computer generated three digit code. Each panelist will be allocated a 3 digit code using computerised sequence generation.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be performed using Stata statistical software (SE 12.1, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and values of p &lt; 0.05 will be considered as significant.
Each panelists satiety score (n=23) at each test time point (baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes), will be used to generate postprandial satiety curve for each test occasion and the area under the postprandial satiety curve (AUC) will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Test-retest reliability will be determined using intraclass correlation (ICC). Differences in postprandial satiety response and postprandial glucose response after the consumption of fibre will be determined from AUC.
14 panelists are needed for a power of 0.9 (Flint et al 2000).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The effect of training on the reliability of a satiety panel has not previously been reported. The aim was to compare the effect of a training intervention in the correct use of a satiety labeled magnitude scale versus no-training on the test-retest precision and reliability of 2 hr post-prandial satiety evaluation after consumption of a standard breakfast.The training exercise will enable the selection a panel to evaluate differences in the satiety of different fibres.
The primary aim of this study is to investigate if training satiety panelists in the interpretation and use of the satiety line-scale could improve the test-retest precision and reliability of satiety response to a standard breakfast meal using a parallel intervention of either (i) training or (ii) no-training. A secondary aim is to compare the postprandial glycaemia and satiety effect of a breakfast meal containing  viscous  fibre PGX or two non-viscous dietary fibres, inulin and wheat dextrin using the trained satiety panel from arm 1. </summary>
