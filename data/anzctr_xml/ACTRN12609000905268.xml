  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will ask mothers who have had a whooping cough booster vaccine in the last 5 years and with their permission check with your local doctor the date this was given.
If parents agree to their baby participating in this study, he or she will be randomly placed into one of two groups. One group will be given two vaccines monovalent acellular pertussis vaccine (Pa vaccine 0.5 ml) and Hepatitis B vaccine ( 0.5 ml) shortly after birth. The other group will only be given the Hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Both groups will then be given the recommended vaccines at 6 weeks, 4 and 6 months old according to the Australian Standard Vaccination Schedule. Although the first vaccine dose is currently recommended at 8 weeks, all vaccines are approved for use from 6 weeks of age.</interventions>

    <sequence>Stratification:  This will be by maternal immunisation status in 2 groups: 
Group 1 - tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine(dTpa)  within last 5 years
Group 2 â€“ no previous dTpa vaccine or dTpa vaccine &gt; 5 years pre pregnancy. 

Randomisation: Neonates will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:
1. Birth group (early vaccination) Pa vaccine at birth, 6 weeks, 4 months and 6 months. 
2. Control group (standard vaccination) usual vaccinations at 6 weeks, 4 months and 6 months.

Simple randomisation by using a randomisation table created by a computer software will used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Australia, many hospitalisations and deaths from whooping cough (pertussis) occur in babies less than 2 months old. Currently when babies are between 6-8 weeks old they are given a vaccine against pertussis. The aim of this study is to see if giving babies the pertussis vaccine (Pa vaccine) earlier than 6 weeks old means that they are better protected.

This study is looking at just how early antibodies to protect against pertussis develop and whether babies given either one dose at birth and again at 6 weeks old or just at 6 weeks will make antibodies earlier than the current schedule. 

This study is also being conducted in Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth.</summary>
