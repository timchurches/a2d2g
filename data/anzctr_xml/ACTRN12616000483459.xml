    <statisticalmethods>n=20 participants per group will be required for this study. We will recruit a total of 25 AAA patients to the treatment group and 25 AAA patients to the placebo group, allowing for 20% attrition over the course of the 12 week treatment period.
Preliminary analyses of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress using blood samples from a related project that has recruited patients with small AAA. Using this pilot data, we have carried out power analyses to determine the number of participants that are required for this trial.
8-Isoprostane: In AAA participants, 8-isoprostane concentration was 52.0 pg/ml (SEM, 3.5, n=10). To detect a decrease in 8-isoprostane concentration by 10 pg/ml (to 42.0 pg/ml) with Power of 0.80 and significance level 0.05 (two-sided), 20 participants need to be recruited to the treatment group and 20 participants to the placebo group (total 40 participants). For comparison, we measured 8-isoprostane levels in non-AAA participants and found the levels to be 17.5 pg/ml lower than in AAA participants (34.5 pg/ml; SEM=2.5, n=28).
Catalase activity: In AAA participants, catalase activity was 70.0 nmol/min/ml (SEM, 9.7, n=10). To detect an increase in catalase activity by 30 nmol/min/ml (to 100.0 nmol/min/ml) with Power of 0.80 and significance level 0.05 (two sided), 18 participants need to be recruited to the treatment group and 18 participants to the placebo group (total 36 participants). For comparison, we measured catalase activity in non-AAA participants and found the levels to be 46.0 nmol/min/ml higher than in AAA participants (116.0 nmol/min/ml; SEM=9.2, n=28).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplementation will reduce blood biomarkers of inflammation and improve blood vessel function in patients with a small abdominal aortic aneurysm. We hypothesize that 12 week dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids will reduce the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers in the blood, and improve indices of arterial stiffness. We will recruit 50 patients who have small abdominal aortic aneurysm (maximal diameter of 3.0-4.9 cm, determined by non-invasive imaging techniques). Participants will visit the laboratory for testing on 4 separate occasions (Day 0 and Weeks 3, 8, and 12). Blood and urine collections, and testing of vascular function will carried out during the Day 0, Week 3 and Week 12 visits. Participants will be randomized to receive fatty acid capsules (active or placebo), and will take 3/day for 12 weeks. Participants and investigators will be blinded to the treatment groups. Unused capsules will be returned by the participant at their next visit. The research team include vascular surgeons and fundamental scientists.</summary>
