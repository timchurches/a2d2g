    <interventions>Method of Study
Day of Presentation
 Diagnosis of tubal ectopic pregnancy on TVS
 Serum hCG, full blood count (FBC), group and save (G&amp;S), liver and renal function tests
 Providing patient fulfils above criteria, for possible inclusion in the study
 Information leaflets given and advised to return in 48 hours for repeat hCG

48 hours later
 If still asymptomatic and fulfilling the above criteria for possible participation in the study
 If patient agrees to participate in study, consent form to be signed
 Repeat hCG, FBC, liver and renal function tests to be taken.
 If the hCG has decreased over the 48 hours for randomisation to either expectant (wait and see) management or medical management in the form of intramuscular methotrexate
 If the hCG has increased over the 48 hours for randomisation to either medical management in the form of methotrexate or surgery

 Medical Management
 On this second visit intramuscular methotrexate will be given at a dose of 50mg/m2
 Repeat visits will then be required on days 3,4,5 and day 7 post methotrexate to measure the serum hCG.  In addition on day 7 FBC, liver and renal function tests will be checked.  (Day 1 = day of methotrexate)
 If the hCG decreases by more than 15 % between days 4 and 7, the hCG will then be checked on a weekly basis until less than 15 IU/L
 If it does not decrease by more than 15 % the woman will be rescanned and provided she is still asymptomatic and there are no changes on TVS, a second dose of methotrexate will be given.  She will then be followed up with the same blood tests on days 3,4,5 and 7 post the second injection.
 Regardless of the hCG change, if at any point the woman becomes symptomatic of there are any changes on USS such as haemoperitoneum, fetal cardiac activity or an increase in the size of the ectopic mass, she will be assessed with regard to laparoscopy and subsequent surgical treatment.

Expectant Management
 Blood tests to measure hCG will continue to be repeated every 48 hours, as long as they are not increasing until the hCG decrease is more than 15%.
 Then blood tests will be repeated weekly until the levels are less than 15 IU/L
 If at any point the woman becomes symptomatic of the hCG is increasing she will be assessed to see whether or not she should receive methotrexate and be followed up as above, or should undergo surgery.

Surgical Management
 In the majority of cases surgery will be laparoscopic, but occasionally a laparotomy will be required
 If a laparoscopy is performed this will probably be done as a day case and therefore an over night stay avoided.
 Either a salpingectomy or salpingostomy will be performed depending on the findings at the time.
 Serial hCG follow up will be needed if a salpingostomy is performed or the ectopic pregnancy is ruptured. Levels will be taken weekly until less than 15 IU/l.  If the levels plateau, methotrexate may need to be given.


Subsequent Follow Up
 Those treated surgically will be seen in clinic 2 weeks after the operation
 Those treated expectantly or medically will be seen at 3 months</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is successful conservative (non-surgical) management of ectopic pregnancy.  This is defined as successful resolution of the pregnancy measured by a decrease in serum hCG levels to less than 15 IU/L without the need for surgical intervention, whether after treatment with methotrexate or just expectant management.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serum hCG measurements will be performed every week following implementation of the conservative management strategies. The weekly measurements will continue until the serum hCG levels are less than 15 IU/L; this could take as little as 14 days or as long as 65 days and depends on the starting serum hCG level.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Time to resolution; i.e. when the serum hCG is less than 15 IU/L. This may take as many as 65 days depending on the starting serum hCG. Please refer to primary outcome field.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Number of follow up visits  blood tests and ultrasound scan needed</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Need for second dose of methotrexate. This is determined at day 7; if the serum hCG fall is less than  15% between days 4 and 7, then a repeat dose of methotrexate is given. </outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Need for methotrexate in those initially managed expectantly. This would be the case if the serum hCG levels began to rise in a woman whose hCG levels were noted initially to fall at 48 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Reasons for surgical intervention. Signs of tubal rupture can occur at any time during the treatment and even in the presence of falling serum hCG levels. Under these circumstances, i.e. worsening lower abdominal pain, clinical instability or signs of blood in the pelvis on ultrasound scan, surgical intervention would be instigated.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Subsequent reproductive outcome. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured in the first twelve months after the treatment has been completed.</timepoint>

    <summary>Hypothesis

The null hypotheses are:

1.	In women with an hCG ratio &lt; 0.8 (fall in serum hCG over 48 h of  more than 20%) there is no difference in success of conservative management whether managed expectantly or medically with methotrexate.
2.	In women with an hCG ratio &gt; 0.8 surgery is needed whether or not methotrexate is given as first line management.</summary>
