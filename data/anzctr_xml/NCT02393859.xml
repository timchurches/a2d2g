  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Blinatumomab
Treatment: drugs - Conventional Consolidation Chemotherapy

Experimental: Blinatumomab - Subjects will be randomized to receive either blinatumomab or standard consolidation chemotherapy.

Active Comparator: Conventional Consolidation Chemotherapy - Subjects will be randomized to receive either blinatumomab or standard consolidation chemotherapy.


Treatment: drugs: Blinatumomab
If the patient is enrolled in the initial phase of the study, he/she will receive one cycle of blinatumomab. If the patient is enrolled in the adaptive phase of the study, the patient will receive three cycles of blinatumomab.

Treatment: drugs: Conventional Consolidation Chemotherapy
If the patient is enrolled in the initial phase of the study, he/she will receive one block of standard consolidation chemotherapy. If the patient is enrolled in the adaptive phase of the study, the patient will receive three blocks of consolidation chemotherapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>B-precursor ALL is an aggressive malignant disease. Therapy is usually stratified according
      to risk characteristics to ensure that appropriate treatment is administered to patients with
      high-risk of relapse. In general, pediatric treatment regimens are more intense than those
      employed in adults and include courses of combination chemotherapy. Standard of care
      chemotherapy is associated with considerable toxicity. There is a lack of novel treatment
      options for subjects who relapse or are refractory to treatment. Therefore, innovative
      therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Blinatumomab is a bispecific single-chain
      antibody construct designed to link B cells and T cells resulting in T cell activation and a
      cytotoxic T cell response against CD19 expressing cells. This study will evaluate the
      event-free survival (EFS) after treatment with blinatumomab when compared to standard of care
      (SOC) chemotherapy. The effect of blinatumomab on overall survival and reduction of minimal
      residual disease compared to SOC chemotherapy will also be investigated.</summary>
