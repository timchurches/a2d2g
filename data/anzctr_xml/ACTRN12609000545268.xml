    <interventions>This is a national, multi-centre, observational study. The aim is to prospectively and longitudinally measure cognitive function in patients being treated and followed for testicular cancer to determine whether there is an association between changes in cognitive function and chemotherapy as compared to patients with the same cancer who do not receive chemotherapy.  
Patients will complete a computerized assessment of cognitive function (CogHealth), the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy  Fatigue questionnaire (FACIT-F) on seven occasions.  Patients will be assessed before surgery and at the following intervals after surgery: 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post surgery. Patients who receive chemotherapy will be assessed before the start of treatment, 1 month post chemotherapy and 12 months post chemotherapy.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in patient cognition from baseline assessments over the period of treatment and follow-up as assessed by the standardised, computerised measure CogHealth.This change in cognitive ability will be assessed after controlling for disease and treatment-related specifics, self-perceived cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and fatigue.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed before surgery and at the following intervals after surgery: 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post surgery.
For patient who will receive chemotherapy will be assessed 0-30 days before starting chemotherapy, 1 month post chemotherapy (21-60 days) and 12 months (10-14 months) post chemotherapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measures for this study include the assessment of patient symptoms over time.
Assessments will include the following: cognitive function, self-perceived cognitive function, psychological factors, aspects of treatment over the last month and physiological factors.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to implement a national longitudinal study of cognitive impairment in men diagnosed with testicular cancer. Those who go on to have chemotherapy after surgery will be compared to those who do not have chemotherapy. Mounting evidence suggests that chemotherapy may lead to cognitive impairment in patients with cancer, such as learning, memory, and attention deficits. However, methodological limitations of previously published research raise questions about the accuracy and validity of results. The current study has been designed to minimise these methodological problems and therefore provide a more conclusive outcome regarding the effect chemotherapy has on cognitive function (a) over time, (b) with a group of patients other than breast cancer patients, (c) using an appropriate control group, (d) after controlling for known confounding factors, and (e) using an appropriate measure of cognitive function that allows easy, serial assessment. If cognitive impairment is observed in the chemotherapy group over time, as compared to the group of patients not undergoing chemotherapy, outcomes will be more conclusive, and acute versus cumulative effects can be theorised. This research on the extent of cognitive impairment post-chemotherapy has implications for informed consent and the way future clinical trials are investigated, and is especially important given that cancer survivors are living longer due to advances in medical care and may suffer long-term effects of treatment.</summary>
