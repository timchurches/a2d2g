  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention  consisted of a 90 minute, peer-led, small group education session. The session content included teaching the recommended intakes and serving sizes for fruit and vegetables; the amount of the food budget that should be spent on fruit and vegetables and the health benefits of fruit and vegetables for the family. The budgeting aspects of the sessions helped to enhance the participants' motivation to purchase and consume more fruit and vegetables, whilst recipe modification and strategies for including fruit and vegetables throughout the day helped to define an action phase of how to make the changes. The sessions were supported with printed educational materials including a cookbook. The sessions were followed by a newsletter mailed to participants at week 2 and 5 after attending the session. The newsletters were designed to reinforce what was learnt at the sessions, to provide further educational information and to motivate participants to make the required changes in consumption.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control participants were enrolled with the expectation that they would be offered the intervention, but the delivery to the control group was delayed for a period of six weeks to allow them to complete their post-program surveys (waitlist control).</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Eligible participants  included parents or carers of primary school-aged children residing in the Hunter region of Australia who were not consuming the recommended daily intake of fruit and vegetables at the time of the trial . Participants had to be willing to undertake the complete Fruit &amp; Veg $ense Program and intend to remain in the Hunter region for the 6 months subsequent to their enrolment in the trial.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Recruitment of participants to the trial was from free-living community members using newspaper advertisements and other advertising, word of mouth, recruitment presentations or recruitment through schools, sporting clubs, shopping centres and other community organisations. There were no incentives offered for participation. Participants were not charged to attend the educational sessions and all resources were provided at no cost.
 Participants were screened for inclusion using a pre-defined telephone script by Project Officers or Project Volunteers. Eligible participants were then posted written informed consent forms and were asked to complete the pre-program surveys. Once participants returned their forms by mail, they were allocated to either the intervention or the control group in order of receipt of the envelopes by mail. The trial continued until a sufficient sample size had been attained.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Cancer Council NSW has implemented the Eat It To Beat It Program designed to decrease cancer risk, with the focus on changing individual food purchasing decisions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. Strategies  target
parents and carers of primary school aged children in the Hunter region of NSW.
The goals of this nutrition intervention program are to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables by the target group by 0.4 serves per day by the end of 2010.

The Eat It To Beat It Program has a number of strategies to achieve its aims. One of the strategies for the program is
The Fruit &amp; Veg $ense Program. This program  consists of:
* The Shopping and Budgeting session.
* Two newsletters sent to participants at weeks 2 and 5.

The randomised controlled trial will determine the efficacy  of the Fruit &amp; Veg $ense Program.  

The research hypothesis is that Compared with the control group, the participants who complete the Fruit &amp; Veg $ense Program will consume more fruit and vegetables.</summary>
