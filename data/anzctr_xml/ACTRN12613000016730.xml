  <interventions>
    <interventions>Researchers will pilot two differing educational interventions on fourth year medicine students. One intervention will provide traditional educational information on anorexia nervosa (i.e., emphasising the influence of multiple factors in the development of anorexia nervosa). The second intervention will have a stronger biological and genetic focus, providing more emphasis on the biological and genetic contributions and maintaining factors to anorexia nervosa. Both interventions will go for approximately 1-1.5 hours (in a lecture style class) once over an eight week rotation (i.e., one intervention will be piloted in the first eight week rotation, the second intervention will be piloted in the next eight week rotation, and the control group the last eight week rotation).
</interventions>
    <comparator>Control treatment will be a wait-list control (no treatment), consisting of students on a wait-list to attend the intervention/seminar with their allocated rotation group. Students will be offered one of the two interventions after a period of 8 weeks (i.e., during their fourth eight week rotation block)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is frequently reported that clinicians across a range of professional disciplines experience strong negative reactions toward patients with eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different educational interventions in reducing negative attitudes and blame-based stigma (in fourth year medicine students) toward patients with AN. 

The current study will compare the effectiveness of a traditional intervention (emphasising the contribution of multiple factors in the development of anorexia nervosa), a more biologically-based intervention (emphasising the biological, neurobiological and genetic factors in the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa), and a wait-list control group (no intervention/education).

Attitudes and stigma will be measured pre-intervention, immediately following the intervention, and eight weeks later.   </summary>
