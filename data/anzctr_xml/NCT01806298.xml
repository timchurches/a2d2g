  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Developing Binding Antibodies (BAbs) to Saizen® - Percentage of subjects developing BAbs = (Number of BAb positive subjects / Total number of subjects) x 100.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 39</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With Binding Antibodies (BAbs) Who Became Positive for Neutralizing Antibodies (NAbs) - Percentage of subjects with BAbs who become positive for NAbs = (Number of NAb positive subjects / Number of BAbs positive subjects) x 100</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 39</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) Levels - Growth Hormone (GH) biomarker levels were summarized by GH treatment status at study entry (that is subjects were classified as GH treatment-naïve subjects or subjects with prior GH treatment for adult growth hormone deficiency [AGHD]).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 2, 8, 16, 29, 39 and 41</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3 (IGFBP-3) Levels - Growth Hormone (GH) biomarker levels were summarized by GH treatment status at study entry (that is subjects were classified as GH treatment-naïve subjects or subjects with prior GH treatment for adult growth hormone deficiency [AGHD])</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 2, 8, 16, 29, 39 and 41</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin-like Growth Factor-I Standard Deviation Score (IGF-I SDS) - Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 SDS was calculated based on the actual value of IGF-1 minus reference value of IGF-1 divided by reference standard deviation of IGF-1. SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) a subject's value was relative to the mean of the reference population. The scores were centered around zero. Negative score indicated that the IGF-I value was lower compared to the reference population.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment Adherence Rate as Documented Using EasypodTM Connect - Treatment adherence rate was measured by: (total dose received divided by total dose prescribed) multiplied by 100. Saizen solution for injection was administered using the easypod device and treatment adherence information was obtained from the device using the easypod connect software.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 2, 8, 16, 29 and 39</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Male and female subjects, 18-65 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signature of
             informed consent

          -  Documented AGHD i.e. childhood onset (CO) or adult onset (AO), either by a stimulation
             test as described in the GH Research Society's 2007 guidelines for the diagnosis and
             treatment of AGHD, or in the Saizen® label, whichever is more stringent, or by
             confirming the presence of at least 3 pituitary hormone deficiencies and an IGF-1
             level below the reference range of the laboratory where testing is performed.
             Stimulation test as described in the 2007 GH Research Society guidelines and
             applicable to all subjects who underwent or will undergo a stimulation test:

               -  Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT) or glucagon stimulation test: Peak GH less than 3
                  nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL);

               -  GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) plus arginine test, peak GH depends on body mass
                  index (BMI):

                    -  BMI less than 25 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) indicates a peak GH less
                       than 11 ng/mL microgram per liter [mcg/L]).

                    -  BMI 25-30 kg/m^2 indicates a peak GH less than 8 ng/mL (mcgg/L).

                    -  BMI greater than 30 kg/m^2 indicates a peak GH less than 4 ng/mL (mcg/L).

        Clonidine, l-dopa, and arginine alone are not acceptable as stimulation tests for
        determining eligibility in this trial. Stimulation tests remain under the Investigator's or
        the subject's physician's responsibility, including the selection of the GH assay. Saizen®
        label: in Europe, only one single test is required; in Australia, 2 stimulation tests
        showing a peak GH less than 2.5 ng/mL are required. The inclusion criteria were chosen
        based on the approved label for Saizen® in the countries where the trial is being
        implemented, as well as in respect of the most current international guidelines for AGHD.
        There is no limit in time prior to the Screening visit for the stimulation test(s), as long
        as documentation is available and the stimulation tests comply with the GH Research Society
        2007 guidelines, and as such, there is no need to repeat the test for subjects having
        stopped their GH therapy prior to the Screening visit. No stimulation test is required for
        subjects with 3 or more pituitary hormone deficiencies

          -  GH treatment-naïve or prior GH treatment for AGHD stopped at least 1 month prior to
             Screening visit. Whereas any prior use of GH is permitted, providing an adequate
             wash-out period is respected to secure the interpretation of the biomarkers, the
             reason for stopping the GH therapy should neither be safety- nor efficacy-related, and
             documentation should be present in the source information

          -  Negative BAbs from the Screening visit sample

          -  Body mass index (BMI, Weight in kilograms / Height in square meters) measured at
             Screening visit as less than or equal to 35 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2)

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening for women of childbearing potential and
             subject is not lactating

          -  Understanding and willingness of the subject to comply with the procedures of the
             study
