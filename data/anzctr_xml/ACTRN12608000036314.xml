  <interventions>
    <interventions>To determine if daily replacement of lenses during continuous (or extended) wear reduces contact lens related ocular adverse events compareed to adverse event rates in historical control trial. Worn lenses are to be removed and discarded each day prior to sleep and new lenses inserted immediately afterwards. Participants will then sleep in their lenses.</interventions>
    <comparator>Historical control trial (conducted in 2005/2006). Participants wore lenses on a 30 night, 31 day continuous wear schedule. At the end of this schedule lenses were disposed (i.e. monthly disposal) and new lenses inserted. The duration of the study was for 6 months. Only the ocular adverse events that arose in the first 3 months of the historic control trial will be used for comparative purposes.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if daily replacement of lenses during continuous (or extended) wear reduces contact lens related ocular adverse events compareed to adverse event rates in historical control trial. Examples of CL-related ocular AE's include infectious (microbial keratitis [MK]), inflammation of the cornea (contact lens induced peripheral and non-infection corneal ulcer [CLPU], contact lens induced acute red eye [CLARE], infiltrative keratitis [IK]), inflammation of the conjunctiva (contact lens induced papillary conjunctivitis [CLPC]), corneal erosion, superior epithelial arcuate lesion (SEAL). Adverse events will be assessed with a slit lamp biomicroscope (including corneal and conjunctival staining with fluorescein).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The duration of the study is 3 months. Participants may be assessed for adverse events at scheduled visits (1 week daily lens weart [neophytes only], 1 week extended wear (EW), 1 month EW and 3 months extended wear) and at unscheduled visits.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the trial is to reduce the incidence of microbial keratitis and other ocular adverse responses related to extended contact lens wear. The hypothesis is that regular renewal of the lens surface during extended wear exposes the eye to a clean lens surface thereby reducing bacterial build-up on the lens surface resulting in less bacterially driven ocular adverse events.</summary>
