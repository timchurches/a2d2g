Communication intervention will be provided in the format of a structured parent-training program based on key concepts for speech and language development. Parents will be able to practise these activities with their children within the group context and brainstorm ways to implement these activities in the ward environment. To monitor adherence, case notes will be kept by the treating Speech Pathologist. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction:
Children who are hospitalised for an extended time frame are often cared for in a ward environment that does not
provide input to promote speech and language development. These children are at an increased risk for language delay. Other barriers to early communication development for children who are hospitalised for a long stay include limited opportunities to develop early language skills and learn to make sounds.

Speech Pathology services at the Royal Childrens Hospital are provided in order of priority to the most urgent and
severe cases first. This often means that the assessment and treatment of children with feeding and swallowing
disorders are prioritised first, and there is little time left to provide early speech and language therapy for children who are hospitalised for a long stay. Early intervention is important to give children the best chance of developing speech and language skills. It is important for Speech Pathologists to use their time wisely when providing services to children on the wards, so a new model of providing language therapy has been developed. Group therapy and parent education sessions will be trialled to see how beneficial they are for parents and children.

Aims:
This project aims to compare the usefulness of individual speech-language therapy with group therapy
for children who are hospitalised for an extended stay (longer than 5 weeks). Specifically the aims are:
(a) To trial a new group speech-language therapy model for young children admitted to hospital for a long stay. This will be compared individual speech-language therapy.
(b) To provide parents of children admitted to hospital for a long stay with strategies and support to encourage their
childs speech and language development.

Methods:
Two groups of participants will be invited to be involved in this study: approximately 34 infants who are admitted to
the Royal Childrens Hospital for a long stay (5+ weeks) and referred to the Allied Health Infant Team or the Speech
Pathology Department. After consent has been gained, both groups will be asked to complete an age appropriate
communication screen (including assessments of early language skills, receptive and expressive language and
early speech sound production). Parents interaction style with their child will be formally measured and parents will
be asked to complete a survey about how confident they are in encouraging their childs early speech and language development.

After initial assessment, children on the general medical ward will be allocated to participate in group speech-language  therapy. Children who are from other wards will be provided with individual speech-language therapy because they will be unable to freely mix with other patients due to infection control rules. Each group will receive 5 weeks of therapy 2 x a week.
After the therapy, childrens speech and language will be assessed again, using the same tests as before. Parents interaction style with their child will be formally measured again and parents will be asked to complete a survey about how confident they are in encouraging their childs early language development and how beneficial they found the
therapy.</summary>
