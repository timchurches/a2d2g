    <summary>This study is to evaluate the antiviral effect, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      presatovir in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive adults who have been hospitalized
      with acute respiratory infectious symptoms.

      Participants will receive 1 dose of presatovir and followed for 28 days postdose. Nasal swabs
      will be collected at each study visit (excluding Day 28) and assayed for change in viral load
      as the primary endpoint.</summary>
