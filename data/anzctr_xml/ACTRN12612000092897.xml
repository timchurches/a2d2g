  <interventions>
    <interventions>Satiereal is a single patented C sativus stigma extract (Inoreal Ltd, Plerin, France). Satiereal is notified and registered as food supplement in France by the National Trade and Fraud Authority (Direction Generale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Repression des Fraudes). 88.25 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. The supplement will come in a gelatin capsule</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Snacking Frequency (Food Frequency Questionnaire): To determine the effects of the supplement on habitual diet, participants will complete questions regarding frequency with which food items or specific food groups are consumed over a reference period</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 6 and 12 weeks with a 6 week follow up following supplementation cessation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Food Preference Questionnaire:The Food Preference Questionnaire (FPQ) assesses hedonic ratings or ratings of liking for foods in a 2 (High Fat, Low Fat) by 3 (High Simple Sugar, High Complex Carbohydrate, Low Complex Carbohydrate/High Protein) design and will be administered at each testing session. The FPQ consists of 72 foods, with 12 foods in each of six cells: High Fat/High Simple Sugar (HF/HS), High Fat/High Complex Carbohydrate (HF/HC), High Fat/Low Carbohydrate/High Protein (HF/LC/HP), Low Fat/High Simple Sugar (LF/HS), Low Fat/High Complex Carbohydrate (LF/HC), and Low Fat/Low Carbohydrate/High Protein (LF/LC/HP). The HF/HS subscale is composed of foods that are similar to cheesecake, such as chocolate ice cream and fudge brownies. Participants rate each food hedonically on a 9-point Likert scale, with 1 = dislike extremely, 5 = neither like nor dislike, and 9 = like extremely. The FPQ was designed to assess preference for fatty foods by calculating the mean hedonic rating of all high fat foods divided by the mean hedonic rating of all low fat foods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 6 and 12 weeks with a 6 week follow up following supplementation cessation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Three Factor Eating Questionnaire: The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) is a 51-item self-report inventory that assesses Dietary Restraint, Disinhibition, and Perceived Hunger and will be administered at each testing session. Dietary Restraint is conceptualized as the intent and ability to restrict dietary intake, and scores on this subscale have been associated with differences in food intake. Disinhibition refers to the tendency to episodically overeat, often in response to external cues, and Perceived Hunger refers to the subjective state of hunger.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 6 and 12 weeks with a 6 week follow up following supplementation cessation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body Composition Assessments:Total body mass (kg) and waist circumference will be determined with a standard digital scale (Ohaus Champ II) and with standard anthropometric measurements, respectively. Body composition (Fat Mass, Fat Free Mass and Bone Density) will then be determined using a calibrated Hologic Discovery (W) dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DEXA) by qualified personnel. The DEXA body composition test will involve having the subject lie down on their back in a standardized position in a pair of shorts/t-shirt or a gown.  A low dose of radiation will then scan their entire body for approximately six (6) minutes. The DEXA segments regions of the body (right arm, left arm, trunk, right leg, and left leg) into three compartments for determination of fat, soft tissue (muscle), and bone mass. Radiation exposure from DEXA for the whole body scan is approximately 1.5mR per scan. The radiation from a total body composition scan is equivalent to less than half a day of natural background radiation. The maximal permissible x-ray dose for non-occupational exposure is 500 mR per year. Total radiation dose will be less than 5mR for the entire study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 6 and 12 weeks with a 6 week follow up following supplementation cessation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum concentrations of cortisol, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin and melatonin and serotonin will be determined in duplicate and the average concentrations reported using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX; Biosource, Camarillo, CA).  Standard curves will be generated for using specific control peptides.  Concentrations will be determined at an optical density of 450 nm with a microplate reader (Wallac Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer, Boston MA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>0 and 12 weeks with a 6 week follow up following supplementation cessation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dietary Analysis and Exercise Activity:To monitor dietary intake and exercise activity during the study, participants will be required to keep four-day dietary records prior to each testing session throughout the duration of the study.  The dietary records will be analysed with the Food Processor dietary assessment software program (ESHA Research Inc., Salem, OR). Participants will also complete an exercise diary for each day of the intervention.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants expressing interest in participating in this study will be interviewed on the phone or in person to determine whether they appear to qualify to participate in this study (Please refer to Key inclusion criteria). Participants believed to meet eligibility criteria will be given a letter to have signed by a physician clearing them to participate in the study. Furthermore, participants will be required to complete blood tests to screen for diabetes and/or abnormal liver/ kidney function. Once physicianâ€™s approval and blood tests are complete, participants will be invited to attend a familiarization session. Participants will be familiarized with the study purpose and design and the risks and benefits associated with their participation in this study.  They will then read and sign the Informed Consent document (if agreeing to participate) and medical history questionnaires.  Participants will then have their body mass and height measured to ensure that they meet the BMI requirements. Supplements will be packaged in identically colored capsules.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomized block design will be utilized where participants will be matched by body composition and reported snacking frequency and randomly divided into 2 groups to ingest either Satierea (Registered Trademark) (88.25 mg; n = 42) or microcrystalline cellulose placebo (88.25 mg; n = 42), twice daily for a period of 12 weeks.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 12 Weeks supplementation of a novel extract of saffron stigma, Satiereal (Registered Trademark) on food cravings and preferences, body composition, satiety and appetite regulatory hormones, and clinical safety markers in overweight/obese individuals. We hypothesize that oral supplementation with Satiereal may reduce snacking and enhance satiety through its suggested mood-improving effect, and thus contribute to weight loss and/or maintenance.</summary>
