  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether priming the brain before rehabilitation therapy will produce a better outcome after stroke.  The priming technique being studied is called Active Passive Bilateral Therapy (APBT).  This involves using a simple device which uses movement of the better hand to drive movement of the stroke-affected hand.  Using this device for around 15 minutes prior to physical therapy is thought to promote beneficial changes in the stroke-affected side of the brain, so that the therapy is more effective.  A previous study with chronic stroke patients has shown that people who used APBT before practicing using their affected hand 3 times per day had greater improvements in function than those who practiced without priming with APBT first.  This study aims to replicate these findings in people as they take part in rehabilitation soon after stroke.</summary>
