  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - LDE225

Experimental: LDE225 200 mg - The study is double blinded and will enroll at least 50 evaluable patients in the 200 mg LDE225 arm. The efficacy and safety of LDE225 will be analyzed separately in each group. Patients who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be treated with 200 mg LDE225 daily until disease progression, occurrence of intolerable toxicity, start of another anticancer treatment or withdrawal of consent.

Experimental: LDE225 800 mg - The study is double blinded and will enroll at least 100 evaluable patients in the 800 mg LDE225 arm. The efficacy and safety of LDE225 will be analyzed separately in each group. Patients who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be treated with 800 mg LDE225 daily until disease progression, occurrence of intolerable toxicity, start of another anticancer treatment or withdrawal of consent.


Treatment: drugs: LDE225
LDE225 was administered orally, on a continuous once daily dosing schedule and was supplied as 200 mg hard gelatin capsules in bottles. Every 4 weeks on the day of study visit, patients received a prescription of an adequate drug supply for self-administration at home. The 800 mg dose patients received 4 capsules of LDE225 and 200 mg dose arm patients received 1 LDE225 capsule + 3 placebo capsules.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Central Review According to mRECIST (for Locally Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma (laBCC)) and RECIST 1.1 (Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma (mBCC)) Per Full Analysis Set (FAS). - ORR is the proportion of patient's objective response (ORR) by 6 months after starting LDE225 treatment. A responder will be defined as a subject with confirmed partial response (PR) or confirmed complete response (CR) 6 months after starting LDE225 treatment.Treatment with sonidegib was to be considered sufficiently efficacious if the observed ORR on any treatment arm at the end of the study was 30% or higher.</outcome>

      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Central Review According to mRECIST (for Locally Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma (laBCC)) and RECIST 1.1 (Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma (mBCC)) Per Primary Efficacy Analysis Set (pEAS) - ORR is the proportion of patient's objective response (ORR) by 6 months after starting LDE225 treatment.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DoR) Per Central Review Using mRECIST for laBCC and RECIST 1.1 for mBCC -Per pEAS - Duration of response is the time from the first observed confirmed response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death due to any reason.
Median DoR for patients with laBCC was non-estimable for both treatment arms as limited numbers of progressive disease (PD) or deaths were observed as of the 28-Jun-2013 data cut-off date. Median DoR was non-estimable for patients with mBCC receiving treatment with sonidegib 200 mg.
Duration of response was for participants with ORR.</outcome>
