  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. A two-compartment model of the extracellular and intracellular fluids is created using patient anthropometrics and serum laboratory results. 
2. The duration of infusion will take place from admission until discharge from the unit.
3. The device has two components. A sensor attached to the urinary collection system and a central processor. These devices communicate to determine a rate of infusion.
4. To ensure adherence, the nurse caring for the patient will monitor the intravenous line as per standard clinical care.
5. The device will administer intravenous 5% dextrose at a variable dose, dependent on the need for water.
</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Standard care, as defined by the traditional decision making process of the clinician in determining the need for water and the subsequent administration of intravenous 5% dextrose.
2. The control data was obtained for the de-identified medical records of patients in the same unit during the 12 months prior to the study. The controls are historical.
3. In the initial phase of the study no active controls will be allocated to receive standard care.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Control of serum sodium as defined by the convergence of the serum sodium. The target rate of change of serum sodium during correction of derangements is defined as 0.5mmol/L/hour. The target sodium is 140mmol/L.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serum sodium samples are taken at intervals (approximately 4-6 per day) during the length of stay in intensive care unit</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Precision of control of serum sodium, as defined by a reduction in the variability of the serum sodium as compared to traditional therapy.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to develop a method to safely and accurately control the water state of patients in a minimally invasive and reliable fashion. The ultimate goal is to reduce complications of inappropriate fluid administration that result in patient harm. An intermediate step is to develop a model of water balance that can inform clinicians of current water state and hence recommend appropriate rates of intravenous 5% dextrose.
