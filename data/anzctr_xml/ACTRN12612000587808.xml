  <interventions>
    <interventions>Electronic Personal Administration of Cognitive Therapy (ePACT) is a 10 week x 10 module (1 module per week) psychological treatment based largely on cognitive behaviour principles with the addition of some positive psychology and mindfulness principles.  ePACT is designed to be delivered electronically and supplemented with either or both telephone and email clinician contact should they require some additional support.   Each module should take around 45mins to complete.  Additional activity/homework tasks designed to personalise the focus of each module will be also be undertaken each week.  The delivery of ePACT will be via autorun CD-ROM on computers that are also connected to the internet.</interventions>
    <comparator>ePACT is designed to augment treatment as usual therefore the control will be standard treatment/business as usual.   Waitlist control will be eligible to begin ePACT at the post-intervention equivalent time (~10wks) if they are still meet qualifying criteria.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous research has shown that many people living with spinal cord injury demonstrate great resiliency and lead happy, productive lives.  However, there are also many others who experience emotional difficulties such as depression or anxiety.  Of particular concern is that the majority of people experiencing those difficulties do not receive any specific treatment or psychological support.
To address this problem, a new flexible psychological treatment has been developed - ePACT.  ePACT is delivered electronically and supplemented with personal contact by email and/or phone with a mental health clinician.  The recent pilot of ePACT was well received, easily accessible and effective for participants who each found it acceptable and helpful.  This current study will expand the distribution of ePACT to provide further evidence supporting the effectiveness of ePACT.  This aim of this study is to build on the previous pilot study by investigating the suitability and effectiveness of ePACT on a larger body of people.</summary>
