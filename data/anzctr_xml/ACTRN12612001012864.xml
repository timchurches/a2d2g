  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment A:  Co-administration of a single oral dose of etoricoxib 90mg (tablet) and tizanidine MR 6mg (capsule)

Treatment B: Administration of a single oral dose of etoricoxib 90mg (tablet) alone

Treatment C: Administration of a single oral dose of tizanidine MR 6mg (capsule) alone

All participants will receive single oral doses of each treatment in a 3 way crossover fashion with a minimum of 7 day washout period in between.

MK0663B (combination treatment) is being developed for the treatment of acute pain in musculoskeletal conditions with swelling and muscle spasm. However, this study is in healthy volunteers only.</interventions>
