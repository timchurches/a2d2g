      <outcome>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in the EQ-5D - The EQ-5D questionnaire is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. It consists of 2 parts: the first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 3 possible levels of response (no problem, some problem, or extreme problem). These dimensions are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score. The EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK) score ranges from -0.59 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health and negative values are valued as worse than dead. The second part consists of a visual analog scale (VAS) on which the participants rated their perceived health state on that day from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health). Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted by treatment, country, metformin use, and baseline.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in the Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living (IW-ADL) - The Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (renamed the Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire [APPADL]) contains 7 items that assess how difficult it is for participants to engage in certain activities considered to be integral to normal daily life, such as walking, standing and climbing stairs. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = "not at all difficult" and 1 = "unable to do". The individual scores from all 7 items are summed and a single total score is calculated and may range between 7 and 35. A higher score indicates better ability to perform activities of daily living. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country, treatment, and metformin use as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in the Impact of Weight on Self-Perception (IW-SP) - The Impact of Weight on Self-Perception (IW-SP) questionnaire contains 3 items that assess how often the participants' body weight affects how happy they are with their appearance and how often they feel self-conscious when out in public. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = never and 1 = always. A single total score is calculated by summing the scores for all 3 items. Total score ranges between 3 and 15, where a higher score is indicative of better self-perception. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country, treatment, and metformin use as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in the Low Blood Sugar Survey (LBSS) - The Low Blood Sugar Survey (LBSS) contains 33 items comprised of 2 subscales (behavior and worry), each of which is rated on a 5-point numeric rating scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). It captures behavioral changes associated with the concerns and experiences of hypoglycemia and the degree to which participants are worried about certain aspects associated with hypoglycemia during the previous 4 weeks. The behavior (or avoidance) subscale has 15 items, and the worry (or affect) subscale has 18 items. Subscale scores are calculated by summing participant responses to items (behavior range 0-60; worry range 0-72). A total score is calculated as the sum of both subscales (range 0-132). Higher scores indicate greater negative impact on subscales and total score. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country, treatment and metformin use as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate.</outcome>
