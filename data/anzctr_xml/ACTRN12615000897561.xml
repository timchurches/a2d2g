    <interventions>The avoidance of endotracheal (ETT) suction in patients undergoing planned cardiac surgery,who are ventilated for less than 12 hours.  ETT suction is normally performed "as required". It is at the discretion of the bedside nurse and can vary from 2 hours to 4 hours. The aim of ETT suction is to maintain pulmonary hygiene, clear any secretions that the patient cannot remove by coughing. It also aims to maintain integrity of the the ETT. 
Those patients in the intervention group, i.e. no suction, will have all the usual care of the post operative cardiac patient, however with no ETT being performed. All the usual ICU monitoring will be in use and there are no plans for earlier extubation of this group. There are predefined criteria for the non-suction group to receive suction if required and for patient safety. 
It is intended that a data safety committee will be established and review the first 20 patients to ensure protocol compliance and patient safety. </interventions>
    <comparator>ETT suction is performed on all ventilated patients. A suction catheter, attached to a negative pressure vacuum, is inserted into the ETT and any excess secretions are removed. This is performed "as required" and can vary from 2 to 4 hours. "As required" is usually influenced by the training and experience of the bedside nurse. Suction is also frequently performed at the point of extubation, the aim being to prevent aspiration during the procedure. The bedside nurse usually decides upon when suction is performed as well as doing the intervention.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PaO2/FiO2 ratio 6 hours after extubation. This is 6 hours after extubation, as long as the patient is extubated within 12 hours of return to ICU. The outcome will be measured from the results of arterial blood gases, these provide data about the PaO2 and FiO2 that the patient is receiving. The primary outcome is the difference between the two groups. </outcome>
      <timepoint>6 hours after extubation. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Complications at extubation; defined as laryngeal spasm, vomiting, aspiration, oxygen de-saturation (SaO2 &lt;90%). This data is recorded on the ICU chart and in the patient record. The data will be collected by research nurses who are also ICU nurses and familiar with ICU practice and procedures. When required that outcome will be assessed by the treating intensivist. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be collected from the time of extubation, up to 6 hours after extubation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Requirement for the escalation of oxygen therapy; this is defined as increasing dyspnoea, tachypnoea (respiratory rate&gt;25 breaths per minute) in the first 6 hours after extubation. This outcome will be assessed by reviewing the ICU chart and patient record. Any desaturation and action taken will be documented on the ICU chart. The number of episodes will be collected. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be collected from the time of extubation, up to 6 hours after extubation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Oxygen saturation &lt;90%. This will be the number of episodes of oxygen saturation below 90% from the time of extubation to 6 hours later. The patients have continuous pulse oximetry measured and recorded on the ICU chart. The data will be collected from reviewing the ICU charts and patient records.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be collected from the time of extubation, up to 6 hours after extubation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. Tachycardia (&gt;100 bpm), this is the number of episodes of tachycardia during the 6 hours following extubation. This will be assessed from the ICU chart. The patients have continuous ECG monitoring while in the ICU.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be collected from the time of extubation, up to 6 hours after extubation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5. Increased mean arterial pressure (&gt;85mmHg). This is part of the routine monitoring for patients in ICU and is recored on the ICU chart. The number of episodes of increased MAP in the 6 hours after extubation will be collected. The outcome will be assessed from reviewing the ICU chart. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be collected from the time of extubation, up to 6 hours after extubation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>6. Re-intubation rates. This will be assessed from a review if the ICU chart and the patient record. It will be documented on both records. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be collected from the time of extubation, up to 6 hours after extubation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <concealment>Patients will be screened and seen preoperatively to gain consent for participation in the study. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either ETT suction or no ETT suction. Randomisation will be performed once the patient is admitted to the ICU post operatively. Patients will not be randomised if on admission to the ICU it is thought likely that they will remain intubated for &gt; 12 hours.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation sequence will be generated using computer software. This will provide computerised sequence generations and allocation concealment will be achieved through the use of sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The envelopes will contain the unique patient identifier code and the allocated treatment group. Block randomisation will ensure even allocation across both groups and minimise predictability of the allocation sequence.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was reviewed in light of the non-inferiority margin being reduced from 10% to 5%. The margin was rediced following feedback from reviewers and following review by the statistian supporting the study. To ensure adequate power the sample size was increased to 100 participants in each arm of the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiac surgery utilising cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is one of the most common forms of major surgery, with more than 1 million patients undergoing this surgery worldwide each year, including around 2500 in New Zealand (MOH 2008). After cardiac surgery the patients are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where they remain until ready for transfer to the surgical ward. The uncomplicated patient is ventilated for between 3-12 hours and woken up once they are cardiovasculary stable. When patients are ventilated part of the routine care includes nurses performing endotracheal suction (ETT Suction). The principle of ETT suction is to maintain pulmonary hygiene in patients who have lost the natural ability to cough and protect their airway as a result of the ETT being in place. Other principles include maintaining patency of the ETT tube, preventing aspiration and removing secretions. One of the main complications of the ETT is the increased risk of infection, e.g. pneumonia, but it can also lead to trauma to the lung tissue, hypoxia, bradycardia and hypertension. The bulk of the current evidence for performing ETT suction in ICU has been based upon patients who have been ventilated for longer than 3 days and frequently have underlying lung disease or injury. Both these conditions require long-term ventilation and have specific oxygenation requirements.
The uncomplicated postoperative cardiac patient is ventilated for a few hours after surgery, usually until they are warm and cardiovascularly stable. The aim is to extubate these patients as soon as it is safe and appropriate to do so. There is some recent evidence that the effect of ETT suction is longer lasting than anticipated particularly in the spontaneously breathing patient
ETT suction causes a loss of lung volume and positive end expiratory pressure.
There appears to be no evidence about the safety and efficacy of not performing ETT suction in this group of patients. This study aims to determine if avoiding ETT suction in the routine postoperative cardiac patient ventilated for less than 12 hours has a deleterious effect. 
Hypothesis: Avoiding ETT suction in patients following cardiac surgery is not inferior to usual care of mandated suction prior to extubation.
