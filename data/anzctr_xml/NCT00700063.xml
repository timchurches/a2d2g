      <outcome>Incidence Rate and Severity of LSRs Following Study Medication Application - The treatment area was assessed at baseline, Day 1 (pre-dose), and at each subsequent study visit for the presence and grade (0 to 4) of the following LSRs: erythema; flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration. A composite LSR score (0 to 24), reflecting the sum of each individual LSR grade, was calculated for each patient at each visit.
The actual value and change from baseline in the composite LSR score were also summarized.</outcome>
