    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Brain Anaesthesia Response (BAR) monitor system is designed to non-invasively monitor brain function in response to anaesthetic and sedative agents. The system consists of a terminal, a data acquisition module (DAM) and a disposable electrical sensor array. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are collected using the sensor which is applied to the patients? forehead. The signals are processed to calculate two BAR indices, Cortical State (CS) and Cortical Input (CI). The displayed indices are designed to assist the anaesthetist to estimate the levels of consciousness and analgesia of a patient during general anaesthesia. This study is designed to detect varying levels of anaesthetic agents in an operating room environment where the presence of multiple sources of artifacts are known to complicate the EEG assessment of anaesthetic action.</outcome>

    <concealment>All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be approached and written informed consent will be obtained. This will occur in the pre-admission clinic or on the ward the day before surgery. Randomisation results will be concealed in envelopes that will be allocated squentially to consented patients. The envelope will be opended and study drug drawn up by doctor who in not involved in the study or the intra-operative care of the patient</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be determined using a computer-generated list using the program PC-Plan. The randomisation allocation will be sealed in an envelope by a person who is not a member of the research team or who will be invovled in care of any intra-operative cardiac patient.</sequence>

    <summary>The Brain Anaesthesia Response (BAR) monitor system is designed to non-invasively monitor brain function in response to anaesthetic and sedative agents. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are collected using the sensor which is applied to the patients forehead. The signals are processed to calculate two BAR indices, Cortical State (CS) and Cortical Input (CI). The displayed indices are designed to assist the anaesthetist to estimate the levels of consciousness and analgesia of a patient during general anaesthesia. The study is designed to investigate whether the BAR indices recorded in the operating room environment can distinguish between two groups of patients anaesthetised with either a low or a moderate dose of fentanyl and show clinically meaningful correlations with levels of hypnosis.</summary>
