    <statisticalmethods>We plan to recruit 100 healthy participants without documented gout; 50 participants of Maori or Pacific ancestry, and 50 participants of European Caucasian ancestry.  We have chosen to pool Maori and Pacific participants into a single group of Polynesian ancestry, as the allele frequencies for SLC2A9 and SLC22A11 are very similar in these two groups, and our previous data also indicate similar renal responses to hyperuricaemia in Maori and Pacific participants.  We have included a one week period of salt restriction prior to the study visit to standardise the renal urate responses to frusemide and reduce variation due to non-genetic factors.  

Yu et al (1981) provide a point estimate of the mean FEUA 3 hours after a 40mg frusemide bolus dose (5.5 SD 1.3).  Using this estimate of variability the proposed sample size would have 90% power at the 5% significance level to detect a scientifically relevant absolute mean difference of at least 1 FEUA unit between those with (n=30) and without (n=70) the protective SLC2A9 SNP (rs11942223)  three hours post frusemide treatment (the primary endpoint).  Although there are two co-primary hypotheses in this study (SLC2A9 and SLC22A11), it is proposed that each will be treated independently with no adjustment for multiplicity (ie the critical significance level will be 0.05 for each).   In practice recalculation of the sample size with alpha set to 0.05/2 (ie P split between the two primary hypotheses) increases the difference that could be detected by 0.1 - a scientifically trivial amount.

Whilst the primary analysis will be performed on the change from baseline no adequate estimate of the variability of this is available and so the conservative approach of modelling the difference between groups at a single time point was chosen to validate the sample size. Removing between patient variability by using the change from baseline as the dependent variable is likely to offer increased power which should more than offset the very small number of samples which may not be adequately genotyped.  Sample size calculations were performed using PASS 2002 (Hintze, J (2006) Kaysville, Utah).

Data will be presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR) for descriptive purposes. Measures of effect will be presented with the appropriate 95% confidence interval.

The primary endpoint will be a comparison of the FEUA response to frusemide in the entire group based on the presence or absence of the rs11942223 protective allele and independently the presence or absence of the rs2078267 protective allele.  A mixed models approach to repeated measures (analysis of covariance, ANCOVA) will be employed modelling the change from baseline in FEUA as the dependent variable and including baseline FEUA as a covariate.  Time, the presence or absence of the protective allele and their interaction will be modelled independently for each allele.  Significant main and/or interaction effects will be explored using the method of Tukey to preserve the overall 5% significance level within each analysis.  No adjustment for multiplicity will be performed.

Secondary analyses will include the comparison of the hyperuricaemic response to frusemide between each of the alleles in serum urate concentration, and a comparison of the change in FEUA level between ancestral subgroups.  In exploratory analyses the interaction between ancestral subgroup and ethnicity will be explored for each genotype for both FEUA and serum urate concentration.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>High blood urate levels lead to gout (the most common form of inflammatory arthritis), and may also contribute to development of heart and kidney disease.  This problem is of great relevance to Aotearoa New Zealand due to the very high rates of high urate levels and severe gout in Maori and Pacific people. A number of risk factors contribute to increased urate levels in the blood.  Recent research has identified a number of genes that contribute to urate levels. Diuretic medications, frequently used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, also increase blood urate levels.  This short-term intervention study will examine the way that genes and diuretic medications interact to influence the persons ability to clear urate from the body.  Understanding these interactions may, in time, allow individualized treatment decisions; for example, the presence of certain gout risk genes may guide selection of therapies for heart failure and hypertension.</summary>
