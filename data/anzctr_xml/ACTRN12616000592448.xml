  <interventions>
    <interventions>Based on what was learned from evidence-based studies, we have developed a novel model named Developmental and Sequenced one-to-one educational Intervention (DS1-EI) to deliver 5-9 years children with co-occurring ASD and ID a treatment protocol adapted to school implementation. The treatment protocol was adapted for school implementation by designing it using an educational agenda. The intervention is based on intensity, regular assessments, updating objectives, encouraging spontaneous communication, promoting skills through play with peers, supporting positive behaviours rather than tackling challenging behaviors, providing supervision, capitalizing on teachers unique skills, and providing developmental and sequenced learning.

More specifficaly:
(1) Participants randomized in the specific experimental protocol (DS1-EI group) receive 4 mornings per week (each session=2h30) of DS1-EI, while the rest of the week they continue to receive the usual protocol of each site. Given the school holiday calendar in France, participants will receive a maximum of 48 sessions by trimester and 150 sessions per year for a 3-year duration.
(2) The setting is implemented in small classroom with 4 pupils and an adapted environment is proposed. Each child is offered a desk, two chairs (one for the child, one for the adult working with the child), a screen where pictures of the childs schedule and activities are provided, and a locker with his picture.  In contrast to TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication handicapped CHildren), The child is sitting with his back close to the wall where the screen stands.  The setting includes also (i) a large table for mid-session group collation; (ii) a place offering benches and carpets where to group participants (both children and adults) at the beginning and ending of a session. 
(3) The program includes 10h of DS1-EI plus other therapeutic proposals according to each institution (e.g. occupational therapy; speech therapy; social skill group activities).
(4) The program follows developmental rules meaning that training is focused on the nearest expected activity/skill of a given childs development according to the considered domain.
(5) In terms of timing, the program is sequenced in two ways. The 2h30 sessions follow an anticipated and structured agenda that is presented for each child on the screen.  When a novel activity starts, the corresponding pictogram is shown on the childs desk. Second, teachers are asked to change activities every 10-15 minutes to keep attention from the child and to help him improving in challenging sameness needs.
(6) The program is also personalized and curriculum based and has specific educational objectives. Since DS1-EI is a program implemented in classrooms, both curriculum and objectives follow academic recommendations from the French Ministry for National Education. The curriculum was adapted from the French program for nursery and primary schools and handiscol principles (http://eduscol.education.fr). Performed activities are those recommended for persons with special needs and handicap. They are grouped in 4 domains: mathematics (e.g. organizing stickers), language (e.g. naming objects) and communication (e.g. improving joint attention), intermodality (e.g. using various tools such as paint, pastels, markers...) and autonomy (e.g. waiting ones turn). 
(7) Each classroom for N children is under the responsibility of one ID-specilist teacher helped by (N-1) educational assistants according to the 1 to 1 need of the program. When activities change every 10-15 minutes, the adult supervising the child changes as well. So during a single session, each child interact in average 2 times with each adult.
(8) Adherance and fidelity to the programme is monitored through a one week initial training and monthly supervision of each classroom teacher, assistants and childrens' educational agenda.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group are receiving treatment as usual (TAU). TAU is defined as all therapeutic interventions given to a specific child (e.g. occupational therapy, speech therapy, behavioral therapy, medication etc as provided by each site). We recommend not to change children therapeutic protocol in the TAU-group during the study period unless medical requirement. </comparator>

The school assessment score follows the curriculum that was adapted from the French program for nursery and primary schools and handiscol principles (http://eduscol.education.fr). It lists a series of abilities that are checked and define as acquired (2 points), being aquired (1 point) and not aquired (0 point).
Regarding academic/educational objectives, they are grouped in four domains: mathematics, language and communication; intermodality and autonomy leading to four scores that are the sum of all the points generated by the specific skills belonging to the corresponding domain.</outcome>

    <concealment>Before randomization, each site is requested to assess the IQ of the participants based on the KABC-II or, failing that, Vineland scores. Based on these results, dyads of participants matched for sex, age, and DQ are formed to limit the risk of bias between groups. Randomization before group allocation to TAU or DS1-EI group will be performed by drawing lots in each dyad per site so that each site could have a TAU group and a DS1-EI group of 3 to 4 participants each. Randomization will be performed by the methodological coordinating team at the Salpetriere Hospital that is independent from local inclusion sites. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>From previous treatment studies in ASD that showed significant results in terms of efficacy it appears that the minimal number of patients in parallel design was 50. This was the case for behavioural ABA approach (e.g.  [Smith et al. Am J Ment Retard 2000; 105:269285]) or for developmental ESDM approach (e.g. [Dawson et al. Pediatrics 2010,125:e17e23.]). The number of patients to enrol has been based on the following theoretical statistics estimation: for a moderate effect size (a=0.6), a power fixed at 80%, and a level of significance for a p value fixed at &lt; 0.05, 80 patients randomized into two groups are required for a student-t test. Given our choice to use linear mixed models (see below) to take into account participants effect, we planned to recruit from 70 to 80 participants.

Statistical analyses will be performed using R Software, Version 2.12.2. To assess whether improvement occurs in both primary and secondary variables, we will use linear mixed models with change in a given variable explained by group exposure (DS1-EI vs. TAU), time (baseline vs. 18 months vs. 36 months) and their interaction (group exposure x time). We will also include a random effect and a site effect. This should account for individual heterogeneity, site heterogeneity, variable scores at inclusion and change specific to DS1-EI within the same statistical regression. For missing data when available, we will use the last observation carried forward. In case of a non-Gaussian distribution, we will study the log transformation (or other transformation when appropriate) to achieve a normal distribution. Lost or drop-out patients will also be compared between groups using a separate nonparametric comparison.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite improvements in the early treatment of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), there are still many challenges to face in particular in individuals with ASD that also exhibit severe to moderate ranges of intellectual disability (ID).  Based on previous research and the need to offer treatment in natural context such as school, we have developed a novel model named Developmental and Sequenced one-to-one educational Intervention (DS1-EI) to deliver 5-9 years children with co-occurring ASD and ID a treatment protocol adapted to school implementation because it is based on educational agenda (autonomy, communication, fine motor skills, mathematics). The major objectives of the study are (1) to select at least 10 French institutions to implement the treatment model; (2) to test the model during a randomized controlled trial over a period of 18 and 36 months.
Each institution will recruit participants per dyads matched for age, sex and developmental quotient. Then patients will be randomized to DS1-EI group or Treatment as usual (TAU) group. During the rehabilitation period, only half of the children will participate in the experimental (DS1-EI) group model designed to improve their developmental abilities and decrease their autism symptoms. Controls will  be allocated to TAU. Participants will be assessed at T12, T18, T24 and T36  with a selection of variables. We hope to show a better improvement in the experimental group.</summary>
