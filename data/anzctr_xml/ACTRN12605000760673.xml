  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assigned to receive both sms and email messages.
SMS - The intervention group will receive messages on their mobile phones at different times and on different days of the week. Message content and style will match the technology and age group. 
Email - The intervention group will receive email messages such as: "If you have recently had unprotected sex with a new partner, you may be at risk of chlamydia infection and should consider being tested." SMS and email messages will also include contraception information, relevant web pages, and phone numbers for sexual health services.
The intervention will last for 12 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Australia has rising numbers of sexually transmissible infections, high levels of unprotected sex among young adults &amp; a high teenage abortion rate. To address these public health priorities, we will use mobile phone text messaging (aka SMS) &amp; email to send sexual health &amp; contraception information to young men &amp; women. A randomised controlled trial of the impact of text &amp; email messages on sexual risk-taking will enable rigorous analysis of their efficacy and cost-effectiveness, &amp; provide valuable data about how these cheap technologies could be used on a larger scale.</summary>
