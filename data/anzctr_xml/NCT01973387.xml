  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Progression-free survival was defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death, whichever was first reported. International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria for progressive disease (PD): New enlarged nodes greater than (&gt;)1.5 centimeter (cm), new hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other organ infiltrates; greater than or equal to (&gt;=)50 percent (%) increase from nadir in existing lymph node or &gt;=50% increase from nadir in sum of product of diameters of multiple nodes; &gt;=50% increase from nadir in enlargement of liver or spleen; &gt;=50% increase from baseline in lymphocyte count (and to &gt;=5*10^9/L) unless considered treatment-related lymphocytosis; New cytopenia (Hemoglobin b [Hgb] or platelets) attributable to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation to a more aggressive histology.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death, whichever was first reported (Up to 3.7 years)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate (ORR) - ORR defined as number of participants achieving a complete response (CR), complete response with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), nodular partial response (nPR) or partial response (PR). IWCLL 2008 criteria: CR- No lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, no constitutional symptoms, neutrophils &gt;1.5*10^9/liter (L), platelets &gt;100*10^9/L, Hgb &gt;11 gram per deciliter (g/dL) and absolute lymphocyte count &lt;4000/microliter (mcL); CRi- CR with incomplete recovery of bone marrow; nPR- participants meet criteria for CR, but the bone marrow biopsy shows B-lymphoid nodules, may represent a clonal infiltrate; PR- &gt;=50% drop in lymphocyte count from baseline or &lt;=4.0*10^9/L with following: &gt;=50% decrease in sum products of up to 6 lymph nodes, no new enlarged lymph nodes, When abnormal, &gt;=50% decrease in enlargement of spleen from baseline or normalization and a response in 1 of following: Neutrophils &gt;1.5*10^9/L, Platelets&gt;100000/mcL and Hgb&gt;11 g/dL or &gt;=50% improvement over baseline in all.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of randomization to disease progression (Up to 3.7 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>From the date of randomization to the date of death (Up to 3.7 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Sustained Hematologic Improvement - Sustained hematologic improvement was defined as hematological improvement that was sustained continuously for greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 56 days without blood transfusion or growth factors: 1) Platelet counts greater than (&gt;)100* 109/liter (L) if baseline less than or equal to (&lt;=) 100*109/L or increase &gt;= 50 percent (%) over baseline; 2) Hemoglobin &gt;11 gram per deciliters (g/dL) if baseline &lt;= 11 g/dL or increase &gt;= 2 g/dL over baseline.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Disease-Related Symptom Improvement - The most common disease-related symptoms associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (fatigue, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort/splenomegaly) were reported by grade.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of randomization to disease progression (Up to 3.7 years)</timepoint>
