    <interventions>SWOG 0230 / IBCSG 34-05 is being conducted internationally by the South West Oncology Group (SWOG). The study is coordinated in Australia and New Zealand by the Australia and New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group (ANZBCTG) who are participating in the study in conjunction with the International Breast Cancer Studies Group (IBCSG) collaboration. This study will evaluate the worth of ovarian function suppression (achieved by use of LHRH (lutenising hormone-releasing hormone) analogue (Goserelin)) in preventing premature ovarian failure in premenopausal patients receiving either standard chemotherapy or neo adjuvant chemotherapy as treatment for hormone receptor negative early breast cancer.

SWOG 0230 / IBCSG 34-05 is an international, multicentre, randomised phase III clinical trial of 416 premenopausal women who have had histologically or cytologically confirmed, receptor-negative primary breast cancer. Women will be randomised in a 2-arm design to receive either of the following: a. Standard cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant b. LHRH analogue (Goserelin) plus Standard cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant Patients are stratified according to:
* age (&lt;40 verses 40-49)
* Chemotherapy regimen: 3 months / 4 cycles of anthracycline-based verses 6 months / 8 cycles of anthracycline-based verses 6 months / 8 cycles of non anthracycline-based. Goserelin (Zoladex) 3.6mg depot, administered subcutaneously by injection, commences one week prior to the first chemotherapy dose and is administered once every 4 weeks for the duration of chemotherapy (3-6 months depending on chemotherapy regimen).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Ovarian Failure at two years from initiation of chemotherapy.  Ovarian Failure is defined as amenorrhea (absence of menstrual bleeding) for the preceding six months and the presence of Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the post menopausal range.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the one and two year timepoints following initiation of chemotherapy, patients will be evaluated for the presence or absence of menstrual bleeding in the preceding three and six months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Ovarian Dysfunction at 1 and 2 years from initiation of chemotherapy. Ovarian dysfunction is defined as amenorrhea for the preceding three months and the presence of FSH, estradiol and/or inhibin B levels in the post-menopausal range.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the one and two year timepoints following initiation of chemotherapy, patients will be evaluated for the presence or absence of menstrual bleeding in the preceding three and six months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ovarian Reserve. Measurements of ovarian reserve will consist of "Day 2 - 4" levels of
FSH, estradiol and inhibin B during Month 12/13 and Month 24/25 (or if amenorrheic,
anytime during Month 12/13 and Month 24/25).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the one and two year timepoints following initiation of chemotherapy measurements of ovarian reserve will consist of 'Day 2-4' levles of FSH, estradiol and inhibin B during Month 12/13 and Month 24/25 (or if amenorrheic, anytime during Month 12/13 and Month 24/25). Fertility during the five year follow-up period will be described for the two groups.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fertility information</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fertility information, including percent of successful pregnancies (number of pregnancies with no complications/number of pregnancies) and percent miscarriages (number of miscarriages/number of pregnancies), will be compared between the two arms at one, two and five years. Tests of binomial proportions will be used to assess differences in fertility measures between the two arms at both assessment times.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants must be premenopausal (defined as the presence of cyclic menstruation within 6 weeks prior to randomisation or FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and Oestradiol levels in the premenopausal range), have histologically confirmed diagnosis of operable stage I, II or IIIa hormone receptor negative disease. The planned treatment must include 3-8 months/cycles (pre or post operatively) of an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide) that can be anthracycline based or non-anthracycline based. Participants receiving pre-operative chemotherapy can not be planned to receive post-operative chemotherapy. Participants receiving post-operative chemotherapy must be randomised within 84 days of definitive surgery.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants can not have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (for this breast cancer or other condition), oestrogens, antiestrogens, selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors or hormonal contraception in the 3 months prior to randomisation.Participants can not have had prior malignancies accept for adequately treated basal cell (or squamous cell) skin cancer, in situ cancer or other cancer for which the patient has been disease free for 5 years after treatment with curative intent.Women who are pregnant or lactating will be excluded from participation.</exclusivecriteria>
