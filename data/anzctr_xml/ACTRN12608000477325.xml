  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aggressive behaviours are common issues in young people accessing mental health services.  Fish oils are popular treatments and are sometimes marketed for behavioural problems.  However, no research has specifically examined fish oils for aggressive behaviour in young people.  This study will examine whether fish oil is able to reduce the frequency and severity of aggressive behaviour in children and adolescents.</summary>
