  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Analysis of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygenation using complementary focal and global
      monitoring techniques will permit the delivery of more informed individualised and 'targeted'
      therapy on the patient with severe head injury, reduce episodes of secondary brain injury and
      therefore improve outcomes.

      Aims

        -  To develop a deeper understanding of Cerebral Blood Flow and auto-regulation for TBI
           patients based on the results of data collected in patients post TBI.

        -  To establish the basis for further multi modality clinical trials in severely brain
           injured patients in the future.

        -  To improve understanding of the various secondary processes that continue to cause
           neuronal damage after the initial injury, and therefore affect patient outcome.

        -  To proceed to the second phase of the study, with the introduction of algorithms for
           treatment.</summary>
