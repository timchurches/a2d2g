    <interventions>This trial will be a prospective, bilateral, randomised, double-masked, cross-over clinical trial.
Participants will wear four lens types for 5 consecutive days on a single-use, daily wear basis with a minimum two day wash-out between lens types. The four lens types comprise:
Commercially-available single vision lenses made from comfilcon A: Base curve = 8.6 mm, Diameter = 14 mm, Power Range = -0.75 to -6.00 D
Commercially-available lenses utilizing digital zone optics made from comfilcon A: Base curve = 8.6 mm, Diameter = 14 mm, Power Range = -0.75 to -6.00 D
Two prototype extended depth of focus (EDOF) which utilize deliberate manipulation of multiple higher-order spherical aberrations terms to extend depth of focus made from Poly-HEMA material. Base curve = 8.4 mm, Diameter = 14 mm, Power Range = -0.75 to -6.00 D
Minimum wearing time will be 5 days and 6 hours/day with no maximum wearing time provided lenses are not slept in overnight.
There will 9 visits comprising Baseline and two visits for each of the 4 lens designs (Fitting and Assessment). Each visit will be approximately 45 minutes in duration. 
Baseline visits will comprise auto-refraction, subjective refraction with visual acuity measurement and ocular assessment with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (a specialized microscope for viewing the eye).
Fitting visits will be performed by unmasked investigators and comprise contact lens fitting, assessment of contact lens visual acuity and assessment of contact lenses on eye with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (a specialized microscope for viewing the eye). 
Assessment visits will be performed by masked investigators and comprise assessment of contact lens visual acuity, distance and near heterophoria, monocular accommodative facility and subjective ratings of vision questionnaire utilizing a 1-10 numeric rating scale, and the validated Computer Vision syndrome Questionnaire. 
In between Fitting and Assessment visits, participants will complete a subjective ratings of vision take-home questionnaire utilizing a 1-10 numeric rating scale. 
A minimum 2-day wash-out will be observed between Fitting and Assessment visits where study lenses are not worn. Participants will wear their habitual vision correction in between wearing study lenses
All contact lenses will be prescribed and all assessments will be carried out by an optometrist. Participants will be instructed to return all unused contact lenses.</interventions>

    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: A minimum of 30 participants are required in order to demonstrate a statistically significant paired difference between lens designs in visual acuity of 0.1 +/- 0.15 logMAR units and subjective ratings of 1 +/- 1.8 units at the 5% level of significance and 80% power. The sample size of 30 participants is adjusted for a low drop out of 10%. 

Analysis: Visual acuity will be recorded on a logMAR scale. Data will be summarised as means +/- standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Visual acuity will be compared between each lens design and control lens types. The significance of lens design will be determined for each visit. Repeated effects linear mixed model with subject random intercepts or paired t tests will be employed for the analysis of visual acuity. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the visual performance (defined by visual acuity measurements and subjective ratings0 between a new commercially-available contact lens design which utilise digital zone optics (DZO), two prototype Extended Depth-of-Focus (EDOF) contact lens designs which utilise higher-order spherical aberration terms and a commercially-available single vision contact lens (SV).
To achieve this, participants will wear each of the 4 lens designs for a minimum of 5 days. Outcome measures will comprise visual acuity and subjective ratings.
Our hypotheses are there will be no difference between lens designs for either visual acuity or subjective ratings.
