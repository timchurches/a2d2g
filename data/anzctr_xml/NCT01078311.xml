          -  Histologically or cytologically diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma, or diagnosis on at
             least one cross-sectional imaging with the characteristic appearance of HCC (i.e.
             liver lesion with arterial enhancement and portal venous washout)

          -  Decision to treat with single agent sorafenib at 400mg bid (dose reductions or
             interruptions are permitted if side effects occur during treatment)

          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy

          -  Child-Pugh liver function class A or B

          -  At least one untreated target lesion that can be measured in one dimension according
             to RECIST

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Prior systemic chemotherapy or molecularly targeted therapy

          -  Concurrent active malignancy

          -  Concomitant strong CYP3A4 induced or inhibitor at a therapeutic dose (see section
             6.4.1)

          -  Medical or psychiatric conditions that compromise the patient's ability to give
             informed consent

          -  Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt; 150/100 mmHg despite optimal
             medical therapy)

          -  History of, or known brain metastases (skull metastases allowed), carcinomatous
             meningitis, or leptomenigeal disease

          -  Major surgery (e.g. open abdominal therapy, pelvic, thoracic, orthopaedic or
             neurosurgery) within 4 weeks of the date of first dose

          -  Local-regional treatment (i.e. percutaneous and trans-arterial procedures) within 4
             weeks. Restaging CT or MRI scan must be repeated at least 4 weeks after local-regional
             treatment and within 3 weeks before the date of first dose

          -  For patients treated with Yttrium (90Y) radiotherapy, a washout period of 2 months is
             required.

          -  Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease or any concurrent condition which
             in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in
             the study or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sorafenib improves overall survival and progression free survival in advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma. Wide interindividual pharmacokinetic variability was observed. Data from early
      phase trials in solid tumours showed trough sorafenib levels were associated with incidence
      of skin rash and hypertension. Rash, hypertension and higher trough levels were moderately
      predictive of progression free survival.The trough level of sorafenib may be predictive of
      survival and response in patients treated with sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma.</summary>
