  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the intervention group will complete a 12 week individualised exercise program based around the Randomised Exercise Augmentation for PTSD Patients (REAPP) exercises, involving exercise bands and body weight as resistance. Participants will have one supervised session of approximately 30 minutes duration per week and will be asked to complete an additional two unsupervised sessions per week of approximately the same duration. Exercises are mostly  compound, and focus on the major muscle groups. A walking component will also be included within the intervention. All sessions will be held at St John of God Healthcare's Richmond Hospital and will be supervised by an Exercise Physiologist or a nurse trained in delivering the exercise program. 
Motivational interviewing, goal setting and exercise diaries will be used in order to facilitate adherence and encourage adoption of the intervention program.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effects of a 12 week individualised exercise program on PTSD symptoms, physical parameters such as blood pressure, sleep patterns and medication useage. It is hypothesized that by adding this structured exercise program to usual care, patient outcomes will improve.</summary>
