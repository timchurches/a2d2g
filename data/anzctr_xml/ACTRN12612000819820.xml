  <interventions>
    <interventions>All procedures will be performed under general or locoregional anaesthesia. Approximate duration is about 60-90 minutes. Prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics will be administered before surgery. During surgery the internal fistula tract opening will be identified. For LIFT: a probe is inserted into the external opening exiting through the internal opening. The intersphincteric groove is then identified, and a small circumanal incision (2 cm) overlying the fistula tract is made to enter the space between the internal and external sphincters. Diathermy and blunt dissection is used to dissect the intersphincteric plane and reach the probed fistula tract. The dissection is kept as close as possible to  the internal anal sphincter (IAS), and two small retractors were used to open the space, gently separating the sphincters. The fistula tract is then encircled using a right-angle clamp, and two absorbable sutures (3-0 vicryl) were used to doubly secure and close the fistula tract as close as possible to the lateral margin of IAS and the medial margin of the external anal sphincter (EAS). At this point, the tract between these two sutures is divided, excised for few millimetres and sent for pathologic examination. In order to confirm the closure of both the internal and external fistula tract, H2O2 was injected from the internal and the external orifices. The intersphincteric plane is then irrigated with H2O2 and saline, checked for haemostasis and closed in two layers (muscle approximation and skin) using interrupted 3-0 vicryl. The external and internal orifices are left open to allow drainage. Antibiotic prophylaxis consists of second-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole for 5 days after surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>The rectal advancement flap was done according to the following technique. Approximate duration is about 60-90 minutes. Prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics will be administered before surgery.The internal opening was excised followed by mobilization of the mucosa, submucosa, and a small amount of muscular fibers from the internal sphincter complex. A rectal flap with a 2 to 3 cm broad base was mobilized. The rectal flap was mobilized sufficiently to cover the internal opening with overlap. Hemostasis was performed to prevent a hematoma under the flap. The fistula tract was curetted. The internal opening was not closed before advancing the flap over the internal opening. Finally the flap was sutured in the distal anal canal.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A perianal fistula is a common condition. It has an incidence of 5.6 per 100.000 in women and 12.3 per 100.000 in men [1]. The disease occurs predominantly in the third and fourth decade of life [2]. It is believed that infection of the intersphincteric glands is the initiating event in fistula in ano, in a process known as the 'cryptoglandular hypothesis' [3]. Parks et al. [4] developed a classification system in which fistula are divided into intersphincteric fistula, transsphincteric fistula, suprasphincteric fistula and extrasphincteric fistula. However the type of treatment depends not on the location of the fistula tract but of the level of the internal opening in the anal canal. Low transsphincteric fistulas comprising less than 1/3 of the external sphincter complex are easy to treat by fistulotomy with a high success rate. High transsphincteric fistulas remain a surgical challenge. Surgical procedures include advancement flaps, loose-seton placement, fistula plugn and the installation of fibrin glue Usually, less invasive approaches do not jeopardize continence, but healing rates can be very low. Nowadays, flap repair remains the gold standard for the treatment of high trans-sphincteric perianal or complex fistulas even though a recurrence rate of approximately 30% can be commonly observed, leaving much room for improvement [5,6].
Recently, a novel sphincter-saving technique consisting of ligation of the intersphincteric tract (LIFT) has been added to the armamentarium for the management of complex anal fistulas. The initial report in 2006 from Rojanasakul et al. [7] showed a 94% healing rate with a 3-month follow-up. Since then, only a few studies of the use of this technique have been reported  with variable success rates from 57 to 89%. (8,9)
These results call for a prospective randomised controlled trial. Since mucosal flap advancement is the preferred treatment for high cryptoglandular perianal fistula, the anal fistula LIFT will be compared with mucosal flap advancement in a randomised setting.
