  <interventions>
    <interventions>Seventy-two patients will be randomly selected and divided into one of two groups.
Arm1 will be consisted of 37 participants both sexes with aged 18 to 60 years. In this group 4 week (10 session)  physiotherapy programme before ACL reconstruction will be applied.
In this group physiotherapy will be applied by physiotherapist who has 10 years of experience in ACL injury treatment. The physiotherapy program will be applied in medical sport injury clinic. Each of 10 sesion will be applied by 2 hours of kinesiotherapy (special individual exercise for ACL injury patients based on EBM - Evidence Based Medicine).
The aim of kinesiotherapy before ACL reconstruction will be to resolve knee impairments related to swelling and ROM (range of motion) deficits, restore muscle strength and adequate neuromuscular responses (prioprocepition). Both single and multiple joint exercises, open and closed kinetic chain exercises, as well as concentric, eccentric,  and isometric strength exercises, will be included. the intensity of the exercise performed, will be 12-14/16 RPE (The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion). The kinesiotherapy program will be individualized based on the specific needs of each patient. All patients will be supervised 2-3 times a week throughout the program to assure that the intendent quality  of performance and correct level of dificullty was achieved. Compliance will be monitored through medical records of each subject and register of attendance at exercise sessions.

Arm2 will be consisted of 35 participants both sexes with aged 18-60. In this group there will not be the physiotherapy before ACL reconstruction.
In this group patients will have only instructions on home-based physiotherapy (self exercise at home). This instructions will be applied  face to face (physiotherapist-patient).

The two study groups will be comperable in term of BMI, age side of injury, activity level, time from injury to operation and functional status by Lysholm Scale.


</interventions>
    <comparator>In this group there will not be the physiotherapy programme before ACL reconstruction.
In this group patients will have only instructions on home-based physiotherapy (self exercise at home). This instructions will be applied  face to face (physiotherapist-patient) about ACL injury and physiotherapy before and after ACL reconstruction (based on EBM).
This information will be applied in simply way that the exercise of ACL injury knee could be done at home but no specific instructions will be given. Approximate duration of the instruction session will be about one hour.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The experimental (Arm1) and placebo group (Arm2) allocations will be determinated according to randomized codes. 
Main coordiantor who will allocate the particpants to groups will have opaque, sealed envelopes. Each will be contained a piece of paper marked with code 1 or code 2</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using procedures like coin-tossing and dice-rolling
The experimental group (Arm1) will receive code1 and code2 for placebo group (Arm2). The particpants would select and open an envelope in the presence of a physiotherapis to see the symbol and would then direct the patient to the corresponding group.</sequence>
