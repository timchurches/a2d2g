    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adjudicated Composite of Symptomatic, Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or All-Cause Death During the Intended Treatment Period - Randomized Population With Imputation - VTE included: nonfatal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE). All index events, DVT and/or PE were adjudicated/confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment. DVT assessed by compression ultrasound and/or venography; PE assessed by spiral computed tomography scanning, pulmonary angiography, and/or ventilation/perfusion lung scan. Event rate (proportion of participants with event) calculated as n/N (n=number of events; N=number of participants). Intended treatment period: longer of the dosing period plus 2 days (completed treatment) or 355 days (discontinued early). Composite endpoint included events at any time from randomization until end of the intended treatment period, regardless whether drug treatment was received. For missing endpoint data, participants were imputed as having had a primary efficacy outcome event.</outcome>
