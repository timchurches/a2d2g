  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>I

          1. Subject has provided written consent.

          2. In the Investigator's opinion, the subject is able to understand and comply with
             protocol requirements, instructions, and protocol stated restrictions and is likely to
             complete the study as planned.

          3. Male or female, 18-70 years of age.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) 18-35 kg/m^2, inclusive.

          5. A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (ß-human chorionic
             gonadotropin) pregnancy test at screening.

          6. Female subjects must either:

               -  not be of childbearing potential defined as: i. Postmenopausal for at least 12
                  months (i.e., 2 years of amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause) and a
                  serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (per
                  reference laboratory), OR ii. Surgically sterile (e.g., underwent total
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal
                  clips without reversal operation), or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant,
                  OR

               -  be of childbearing potential AND

               -  not heterosexually active (e.g., abstinent or homosexual) from screening until 6
                  months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by local
                  regulations), OR

               -  if heterosexually active

                    -  have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile per verbal account of the
                       subject), OR

                    -  using an acceptable method of birth control from screening and agree to
                       continue to use the same method of contraception throughout the study and
                       for 6 months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by
                       local regulations). Oral hormone based contraceptives are not allowed from
                       14 days before the planned study drug administration until 6 months after
                       the last dose of treatment due to the potential for drug-drug interactions
                       which might undermine their efficacy. An IUD, being either hormonal (i.e.,
                       IUS*) or non-hormonal, is considered highly effective and reliable;
                       therefore subjects using an IUD/IUS are not required to use additional
                       contraceptive methods (no double-barrier method is required). Other non-oral
                       hormone-based contraception methods (e.g., injectable, implants, transdermal
                       system, vaginal ring) may be continued, but as the interaction of the study
                       drug with hormone-based contraception is unknown, these methods are not
                       considered to be reliable and therefore subjects should use a double-barrier
                       method (e.g., male condom+either diaphragm or cervical cap with or without
                       spermicide).

                         -  An IUS does not rely on systemic plasma concentrations and is therefore
                            not expected to be impacted by a potential DDI.

             Note 1: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated
             with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
             relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject.

             Note 2: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of breakage
             or damage caused by latex friction.

          7. A post-menopausal female who is receiving hormone replacement therapy and is willing
             to discontinue hormone therapy 30 days before study drug dosing and agrees to remain
             off hormone replacement therapy for the duration of the study may be eligible for
             study participation.

               -  Male subjects must either:

               -  be surgically sterile (had a vasectomy), or otherwise incapable of fathering a
                  child, OR

               -  not be heterosexually active (e.g., abstinent or homosexual) from enrollment (Day
                  1) in the study until at least 6 months after study drug administration, OR

               -  if heterosexually active:

                    -  have a partner who is postmenopausal (2 years amenorrhea), surgically
                       sterile (e.g., has had a total hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                       bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clips without reversal operation),
                       or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant OR

                    -  be practicing an acceptable method of birth control from enrollment in the
                       study (Day 1) and agree to continue to use the same method of contraception
                       throughout the study and for at least 6 months after study drug
                       administration (or longer, if dictated by local regulations). An acceptable
                       method of birth control for male subjects is a double-barrier method (e.g.,
                       male condom+either diaphragm or cervical cap with or without spermicide).

             Note: Male subjects with a female partner who uses hormonal contraceptives (oral,
             injectable, implants) or a hormonal (IUS) or non-hormonal IUD and male subjects who
             are vasectomized or otherwise incapable of fathering a child are not required to use
             additional contraceptive methods.

             Note 1: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated
             with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
             relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject.

             Note 2: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of breakage
             or damage caused by latex friction.

             NOTE: Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations
             regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects participating in clinical
             studies if these are stricter than what is proposed in these inclusion criteria

          8. Subjects must agree to refrain from sperm/egg donation from start of dosing through 6
             months after the completion of study drug administration.

          9. GT1a or 1b or GT2 or 3 CHC, depending on cohort, with positive HCV antibody and a
             positive HCV RNA at screening including documentation of CHC infection for at least 6
             months. Genotype testing must occur at a screening visit. NOTE: GT1 patients are
             eligible for inclusion even if they cannot be successfully subtyped unless a specific
             subtype is required for a cohort.

         10. Screening HCV RNA viral load =50,000 IU/mL, except for subjects with compensated
             cirrhosis (Child Pugh Class A) who may have HCV RNA viral load =10^4 IU/mL.

         12. Fibroscan, collected within 6 months of baseline visit, with liver stiffness score
             =12.5 kPa to be eligible (except for subjects with cirrhosis, see below).

              Subjects with compensated cirrhosis must meet the Child-Pugh Class A definition (see
             Appendix G) and at least one of the following criteria: i. Liver biopsy result
             indicating the presence of cirrhosis (e.g., Metavir F4; Ishak &gt;5) or ii. Fibroscan

          9. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the study's
             objectives or the well-being of the subject or prevent the subject from meeting the
             study requirements.

         10. Participation in an investigational drug trial or having received an investigational
