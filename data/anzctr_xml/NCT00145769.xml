  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All of the following must apply:

          -  Pathologically documented and clinically resectable adenocarcinoma of the rectum.

          -  The patient must be considered by the surgeon to be suitable for a curative resection.

          -  The patient must be considered by the radiation oncologist to have no contraindication
             to pre-operative radiotherapy.

          -  Clinical T3 stage tumour on endorectal ultrasound or MRI. When endorectal ultrasound
             cannot be performed satisfactorily due to a technical reason, such as stenosis or
             proximity of the tumour, and MRI is not available, infiltration of perirectal fat on
             CT scan is also acceptable.

          -  Tumour with lower border within 12 cm from anal verge on rigid sigmoidoscopy.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function with neutrophil count at least 1.5 x 109/L and platelet
             count at least 100 x 109/L.

          -  Adequate liver function with bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 1.5 times
             the upper limit of normal.

          -  Adequate renal function with serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Accessibility for treatment and follow-up.

          -  Evidence of distant metastases.

          -  Recurrent rectal cancer.

          -  Unstable cardiac disease or clinically significant active infection.

          -  Other cancer in the last 5 years except treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females or female patients of childbearing potential who have
             not been surgically sterilized or are without adequate contraceptive measures.

          -  Contraindication to insertion of a suitable indwelling venous catheter e.g.
             implantable central venous device (infuse-a-port), Hickman catheter or peripherally
             inserted central catheter.
