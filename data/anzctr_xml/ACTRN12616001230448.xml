      <outcome>Comparison of adverse events related to vaccination between study arms.

All study participants will be given a hand-held paper diary or those who prefer so, a web-based diary to complete online with their iPhones over a period of one week following vaccination. In addition, participants will be actively followed up with a telephone call to enquire about any adverse reactions (e.g. systemic side effects: fever, myalgia, lethargy/fatigue; local reactions: redness, pain, swelling, any other adverse events requiring medical attention) over the one week period following vaccination. All serious adverse events will be reported and managed according to the practice guidelines. Within 60 days after their return from Hajj, the participants will be enquired about their health including details of any illness particularly major ones requiring hospital admission. Additionally, their family physicians will be kept informed of their participation in the study and requested to report all visits and hospital admissions to the study team throughout the follow up period to identify any related adverse events, and breakthrough meningococcal disease.
The rates of adverse events in both vaccine arms will be compared by Pearson's chi-squared test in order to determine if the prevalence of adverse events in Hajj pilgrims receiving quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine is different from that in pilgrims receiving quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Mean difference and 95% Confidence Interval (CI)  between study groups will be calculated in the proportion of participants with documented pharyngeal carriage of groupable meningococci within sixty days after completion of Hajj (visit 2) for each serogroup contained within the vaccines.

Sample size per arm under a range of assumptions for prevalence of carriage in polysaccharide arm and a range of vaccine efficacy expectations (for the conjugate vaccine) is calculated. Conjugate meningococcal C vaccine is known to reduce carriage by at least 75% (Maiden et al. 2008); assuming 3% carriage (against any one serogroup) among Hajj pilgrims immunised with a polysaccharide vaccine, and a carriage rate of 0.75% in those receiving a conjugate vaccine a sample size of 567 per arm would be needed to achieve 80% power with 95% confidence level (2 sided alpha = 0.05) and 75% reduction in carriage in the conjugate vaccine arm compared to the polysaccharide vaccine arm. 

Assuming that 20% of pilgrims will have received antibiotics at the Hajj and or a MenACWY-C in the past, and another 20% will be lost to follow-up, a total of 1780 pilgrims will be recruited for the study.

It is likely that pilgrims given the polysaccharide vaccine will not remain at the theoretical carriage rate of 3% but actually acquire carriage of meningococci during the Hajj, so that the measured colonisation rate in this arm may exceed 3% - as was demonstrated with pilgrims returning to Singapore after the 2001 Hajj and to Turkey after the 2010 Hajj (Ceyhan et al. 2013; Wilder-Smith et al. 2002).  Hence this is a conservative power estimate and significant differences may well be shown with fewer participants.

In summary, over 2000 pilgrims will be screened from Muslim dominated areas of Australia, and major cities in Saudi Arabia to achieve a sample size of 1780 participants, of these 1400 will be recruited from Saudi Arabia, 200 from Australia and 180 from Qatar.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intense congestion, including shared accommodation and compromised hygiene, during mass events such as Hajj pilgrimage amplify the risk of invasive meningococcal disease. Intercontinental spread of serogroup A meningococcal disease in 1987 and serogroup W135 disease in 2000 and 2001 affected thousands of Hajj pilgrims globally. Quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide (serogroups A, C, W135 and Y) vaccine was able to bring these epidemics under control, but the vaccine is not effective at reducing pharyngeal carriage of meningococci. A conjugate vaccine can reduce long term meningococcal carriage; for example, the quadrivalent conjugate vaccine has been shown to reduce carriage over 12 months from vaccination in adults aged 18-24 years old. However, the impact of conjugate meningococcal vaccines on meningococcal carriage status among Hajj pilgrims, most of whom are older than 24 years, is not known. 
We, therefore, believe that a well-powered carriage study in Hajj pilgrims is an urgent need. During the Hajj 2017, we plan to conduct a single-blinded, randomised, controlled trial of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine for head-to-head comparison with quadrivalent polysaccharide among pilgrims from Australia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. 
Pilgrims from participating countries, planning to attend Hajj in Makkah in 2017 will be randomised to receive either a conjugate vaccine or a polysaccharide vaccine. Following informed consent, pharyngeal swabs will be collected from pilgrims in both arms a few months before their travel to Hajj. The participants will then receive their respective vaccines (observers will remain blind to this selection), a second set of pharyngeal swabs will be collected within sixty days after completion Hajj, preferably within 7 days and a third set of pharyngeal swabs will be collected at 6 to 11 months. 
Pharyngeal swabs will be processed by standard culture methods to detect meningococcal carriage; isolates will be characterised by serogroup, subtype, serosubtype, and sequence type. The pharyngeal swabs will also be tested for any antimicrobial resistance elements present. Data will be anonymised and analysed for the following end points: a) comparison between the study arms with respect to pharyngeal carriage rates of meningococci after return from Hajj, b) change in pharyngeal carriage rates of meningococci from before to a few months after vaccination, and c) comparison of long term carriage rates at 6 to 11 months after vaccination between study arms, and d) comparison of adverse events related to vaccination between study arms. This research could inform renewed policy on meningococcal vaccination for Hajj pilgrims as well as for attendees of other large events.
