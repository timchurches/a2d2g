  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part 1:  Single Ascending Dose
Participants will be randomised to receive a single dose of PTG-200 or placebo capsule.  Three cohorts of eligible participants are planned:
Cohort 1:  150 mg PTG-200 or placebo
Cohort 2:  300 mg PTG-200 or placebo
Cohort 3:  900 mg PTG-200 or placebo. Participants, in Cohort 3 only, will return to the clinic after at least 7 days and will be administered a second single dose of 900 mg PTG-200 immediately following the consumption of a standard high fat meal.  
Part 2:  Multiple Ascending Dose
Participants will be randomised to receive oral administration of PTG-200 or placebo capsule daily for 14 days.  Participants are not required to fast for dosing purposes.  Four cohorts of eligible participants are planned:
Cohort 4: 150 mg PTG-200 or placebo once daily
Cohort 5a: 300 mg PTG-200 or placebo once daily
Cohort 5b: 150 mg PTG-200 or placebo twice daily
Cohort 6: 900 mg PTG-200 or placebo once daily; or 450 mg PTG-200 or placebo twice daily.  Cohorts 5a and 5b will be conducted in parallel and the dose of Cohort 6 will be based on their results.

Part 3:  Formulation Cross-Over
Part 3 will be a cross over of 2 formulations (tablet and capsule) consisting of the same active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Part 3 will evaluate the bioavailability of the capsule formulation compared to the tablet formulation. Approximately 10 participants will be enrolled into a single dose cross-over cohort. Participants will be randomized to receive either PTG-200 300 mg capsule formulation or PTG-200 300 mg tablet formulation (5 participants to receive each). Participants will remain in the clinic until Day 3. A minimum of 7 days after the first dose, they will return for the second dosing period and receive a single dose of the alternate formulation of PTG-200, i.e., participants who received the capsule formulation for the first dose will then receive the tablet formulation, and vice versa.
The duration of Part 3 is approximately 14 days. Part 3 is not double-blind and does not include placebo.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo capsule - Hydroxylproply Cellulose, Mannitol, Colloidal Silicone Dioxide, Magnesium Stearate

In Part 1: Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in 3 Cohorts.  In each Cohort, 8 participants will receive PTG-200 and 2 participants will receive Placebo. 
In Part 2: Up to 40 participants will be enrolled into 4 Cohorts. In each Cohort, 8 participants will receive PTG-200 and 2 participants will receive placebo. 
In Part 3 (Cross-over): Approximately 10 participants will be enrolled into a single dose cross-over cohort to evaluate the bioavailability of the capsule formulation compare to the tablet formulation.  This is not a double-blind cohort and does not include placebo.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of PTG-200 after single and multiple ascending oral dose administration in normal healthy participants. 

Plasma PTG-200 non-compartmental analysis (NCA) PK parameters time of the maximum plasma drug concentration (Tmax), maximum observed drug plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC) from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUC0-t) apparent terminal elimination (disposition) rate constant (Kel), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC0 inf), apparent elimination (disposition) half-life (t1/2), apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution at the terminal phase (Vz/F) will be estimated (where data are sufficient for parameter determination).  In addition, minimum concentration (Cmin), AUC over the dosing interval (AUCtau), apparent clearance at steady-state (CL/Fss), average steady-state concentration (Cssave) and accumulation index (AI) will be calculated for Part 2 (MAD).

Faecal PTG-200 NCA PK parameters amount recovered and %Dose recovered will be estimated.

Individual PTG-200 concentration data will be listed and summarised by treatment group with descriptive statistics (sample size [N], arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, maximum and geometric mean). Individual and mean PTG-200 concentration-time profiles for each treatment group will also be presented graphically.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The PK samples will be analysed approximately within two to four weeks of collection. 

Part 1: 
Pre-dose, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, and 8 hours. 

Part 2: 
Dose 1: Pre-dose, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, and 32 hours post dose.
Dose 2: Pre-dose, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, and 32 hours post dose. 

Part 3: 
Pre-dose, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 32 hours, and 48 hours post dose.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the PK of PTG-200 in stool and urine samples of participants after multiple ascending oral dose administration.

PK of PTG-200 is measured in plasma, stool, and urine by using LC Mass Spectrometry method. 

PK parameters will be summarized by cohort using descriptive statistics (arithmetic means, SD, coefficients of variation [CV], sample size [N] minimum, maximum, median and geometric mean). 
No value for kel, t1/2, AUC0-inf, CL/F, Vz/F, as appropriate, will be reported for cases that do not exhibit a terminal log-linear phase in the concentration versus time profile or do not contain sufficient data during this phase for parameter estimation.
Additional analyses will be performed as deemed necessary upon review of the data.

These are not composite endpoints.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>PK in stool and urine will be assessed at the end of the study.  Approximately within two to four weeks after the end of the study. 

Part 2:  Urine PK Day 10 to Day 11 post dose, pooled at 6 hour intervals for 24 hours. 
Faeces PK Day 11 to Day 12, pooled over 24 hours.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effect of a high fat meal on the plasma PK of a single oral dose administration of PTG-200 in normal healthy participants.

Relative Bioavailability of Capsule and Tablet Formulations
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed on the ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax (tablet vs capsule). The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of the geometric means of the tablet formulation data compared to the capsule formulation data will be obtained, based on the least-squares means (LSM) from the ANOVA of the ln-transformed parameters. The ratios and confidence intervals will be expressed as a percentage relative to the capsule formulation.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The PK on patients who received high fat meal will be assessed approximately within two to four weeks post sample collection.

Relative Bioavailability of Capsule and Tablet Formulations
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed on the ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax (tablet vs capsule). The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of the geometric means of the tablet formulation data compared to the capsule formulation data will be obtained, based on the least-squares means (LSM) from the ANOVA of the ln-transformed parameters.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PTG-200 is an experimental drug being developed by Protagonist Therapeutics as a treatment for moderate to severely active Crohns Disease (CD) which is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CD causes gastrointestinal signs and symptoms such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss and passing blood or mucous. Current treatments for this highly complex disease have unacceptable side effects or cannot be used long term as they suppress the immune system and may increase the risk of serious infection or cancer. 

PTG-200 is believed to reduce the swelling that contributes to CD by blocking a specific part of your immune response pathway. There are a number of new treatments for CD which have been approved for use in other countries . PTG-200 is thought to be a better treatment for CD compared to these other medications as PTG-200 is restricted to the gut and very unlikely to spread to other parts of the body, meaning it would have fewer side effects and remain in the gut.

The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug referred to as PTG-200 in healthy individuals using single or multiple dose over number of days. The study will also evaluate how the PTG-200 is absorbed, spread in the body, and the bodys response to the drug.  </summary>
