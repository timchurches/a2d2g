  <interventions>
    <interventions>A standard of care protocol for Acute Exacerbation of COPD patients with Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory failure (AHRF) with acidosis will be agreed upon with Emergency Department staff. Patients presenting with an Acute Exacerbation of COPD will have an Arterial blood gas (ABG) as per current guidelines and venous blood gas (VBG) as per standard hospital practice.   

Patients with a PaCO2 greater than 45mmHg and pH of greater than or equal to 7.25 and  less than 7.35 will be enrolled into the observational study using a deferred consent model. A deferred consent model is required as people with COPD and acute hypercapnic respiratory failure have impaired capacity. All participants will receive standard medical therapy, including oxygen therapy titrated to oxygen saturations of 88-92%, bronchodilators and steroids as appropriate. After the 60 minute optimisation period participants will have a paired ABG and VBG and need for non-invasive ventilation will be assessed. Subsequent care will be determined by the treating physician.

During the 60 minute observational period the treatments received will be recorded to allow comparison of treatment received with the agreed standard care protocol. All participants will have their oxygen saturations and heart rate recorded by a pulse oximeter. This data will be downloaded after the 60 minute period completes.

As an observational study there is no intervention and all participants will receive standard medical care throughout. Participants will undergo one additional venous blood test that they would not normally require.

Deferred consent for the use of data will be obtained from patients once they are well enough to give informed consent. This will usually be within 48 hours of admission. If participants do not give consent their data will not be used in the study analysis.

    <statisticalmethods>Estimates of proportions will be by small sample technics e.g. Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals. The Standard Deviation for the Hydrogen ion concentration will have a confidence interval estimated using the Chi-square distribution. The proposed sample size of 40 for the Feasibility Study has 80% power, alpha 0.05, to rule out a baseline treatment failure rate of &lt;60% assuming this is 80%. The sample size will also give reasonable precision for estimates of the SD of the Hydrogen ion concentration. Note: We will be completing an initial pilot of 15 patients at Wellington Hospital while we confirm funding for the proposed feasibility Study of sample size of 40.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This feasibility study aims to determine whether the planned full randomised controlled trial is feasible with the current design, timescale and number of sites. The feasibility study will not directly use the NHF device but instead test parts of the full study design. It comprises 2 parts:
Part 1: A usual care protocol for use of NIV in AECOPD with AHRF will be agreed upon between Wellington, Waikato and Christchurch Hospitals.
Part 2: Participants will be able to be enrolled in a deferred consent model according to the eligibility criteria in the full RCT and the protocol devised in Part 1 is able to be adhered to in 90%, but at least 75% of cases.
Patients presenting with an Acute Exacerbation of COPD will have an Arterial blood gas (ABG) and Venous blood gas (VBG) done as well as usual investigations. If Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory failure (AHRF) with acidosis, defined as PaCO2 greater than 45mmHg and pH of 7.25 - 7.34,  is confirmed on ABG, standard medical treatment including Oxygen therapy titrated to oxygen saturations of 88-92% over 60 minutes will be implemented. We will use monitoring equipment with a downloadable function to assess compliance with the agreed standard of care. .A repeat ABG and VBG will be done after 60 minutes. Deferred consent for the use of information will be obtained from patients within 24-48 hours of admission. 
We intend to run a pilot of 15 patients at Wellington Hospital only while we wait to hear about funding for the full 40 patient feasibility study. This will follow the same protocol as the feasibility study. If funding is secured the target sample size will be increased to 40.
