  <interventions>
    <interventions>A robot is to be placed in the apartment of each resident for 2 months. Depending on the needs of the participant, the robot can do:medication management, blood pressure reading, telecommunication (with relatives, friends, staff), brain fitness software, show videos and photos, lifetime health diary (shows health records), and give access to web content such as information about the retirement village. The participants can use the robot at their discretion. THere is a washout period of three weeks. THis is in addition to standard care.</interventions>
    <comparator>no robot - standard care. Residents in independent living facilities are  independent and do not receive extra care on a regular basis.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate whether robots can improve quality of life for people in a retirement village. This trial is a cross-over randomized controlled trial with 26 independent living residents with their own robot in their apartment. The robots can take blood pressure, remind about taking medication, provide entertainment and brain fitness games. They can also provide information about activities at
the village. The outcome measures are resident quality of life, depression, adherence to medication, and perceptions of the robots, after 2 months.</summary>
