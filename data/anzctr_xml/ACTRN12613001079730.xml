  <interventions>
    <interventions>We are studying the effectiveness of a non-robotic assistive device (the Smart Skate) used in conjunction with computer games (virtual reality) in improving arm function in stroke survivors. The Smart Skate is a unilateral exercise device which is operated on a table top, similar conceptually to traditional sliding board exercises to allow reaching while supported against gravity. The Smart Skate comprises a tray that supports the lower arm, with Velcro straps to hold the arm on the tray. Embedded within the support, beneath the hand, is a standard computer mouse that controls a cursor on a computer screen. Participants play a range of specially developed computer games which encourage reaching movements. The intervention last for 4 - 6 weeks, with participants playing 45 - 60 min of computer games 4 days per week until a 16 hours of intervention is completed, based on the findings of Kwakkel et al (2004). Participants are supervised and the amount of time spent playing computer games is recorded to determine adherence.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle strength: isometric strength of the shoulder and elbow were measured with an IRL hand held dynamometer (Janssen and Le-Ngoc 2009). The following measures were taken: Shoulder flexion, extension, abduction, external rotation (dynamometer placed immediately proximal to the elbow joint: anteriorly, posteriorly, and laterally, respectively); shoulder internal and external rotation (elbow at 90 degrees, dynamometer placed  immediately proximal to the wrist joint, with the lower arm in mid pronation); and elbow flexion and extension (elbow at 90 degrees, dynamometer placed  immediately proximal to the wrist joint: anteriorly and posteriorly, respectively, with the lower arm in full supination). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Tested at start of the study (T0), 4 weeks later after no intervention (T1), after a 4 - 6 week intervention (T2), 4 weeks after intervention is complete (T3)</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>This research can be seen as a preliminary/pilot study. A power calculation based on data of Prange et al. (2008) showed that using a within-subject design (Power calculation for a paired T-test) n=14 is sufficient to show clinically relevant changes in Fugl-Meyer scores. To account for dropout, 15 participants will be recruited. 

A repeated measures ANOVA is used to analyse data to test for differences between all 4 time points.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed research study will trial an arm skate embedded with a computer mouse (the Smart Skate) and virtual reality (VR) to establish the effectiveness as therapeutic table-top rehabilitation for the weakened upper limb of subjects who have suffered a stroke. VR is where a computer displays task-based games that direct and prompt the user to exercise whilst providing feedback on performance. This will be done by comparing the outcomes of 4 - 6 weeks of 4 sessions per week Smart Skate + VR therapy in a group of people with hemiparesis as a result of stroke (chronic stroke participants). Assessment using an established physical outcome measure (the Fugl-Meyer assessment) and strength testing will occur before and after the intervention. </summary>
