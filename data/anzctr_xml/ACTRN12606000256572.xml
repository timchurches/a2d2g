      <outcome>The primary outcome was change in health related quality of life measured by the Short Form 36 Health Survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, four and seven months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Older peoples physical, mental, and social wellbeing were measured using standardised scale measurements. Specifically, the following were assessed: functional mobility (measured by the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living questionnaire and the Timed Up and Go test); sense of control (measured by the Mastery scale); and social support network (measured by the Duke Social Support Index).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, four and seven months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Focus groups were held with support workers to ascertain their opinions of the service.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline and fourteen months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Informal carer stress was assessed with the Carer Reaction Assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, four and seven months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Coordinator perceptions were established via one-on-one interviews.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at 14 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A basic comparison of costs for the two groups was undertaken</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Cluster randomisation method is used. Ten clusters of approximately 20 older people are determined. These clusters are then randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Eighty percent of the older people within one cluster are chosen for participation. Thus allowing for each older person within a cluster to have equal chance of being chosen for participation. This also allows for a 25% refusal rate. This is to be undertaken by a researcher otherwise not involved with participants and data will be held by this researcher at a separate site. The outcome assessor will remain blinded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently home-based services in New Zealand have a number of issues and are failing to provide appropriate and reliable services for older people. They are based on a dependency model and have a standardised rigid focus with defined responses to the identified needs of elderly. In response to these issues, restorative home care aims to improve flexibility of service delivery to meet the needs of older people living at home. For this research study, the restorative service will be implemented and compared to the current usual care for older people living at home using a randomised control trial research design. It is hoped that the restorative treatment group will have improved physical, psychological and social wellbeing when compared to usual care for older people living at home. Outcome data will be collected at baseline, four and seven months</summary>
