  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Sugammadex
Treatment: drugs - Neostigmine

Active Comparator: ModNMB - Moderate Neuromuscular block: participants will receive moderate neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium aiming for TOF 0-2 twitches, with neostigmine reversal when the TOF at least 3 twitches. The depth of neuromuscular block may be reduced after completion of the majority of surgical excision to TOF 3 or more
Neostigmine

Active Comparator: DeepNB - Deep Neuromuscular block: participants will receive DNB aiming for a post tetanic count of 1-2, which will be maintained until removal of the laparoscopic ports, with reversal using sugammadex


Treatment: drugs: Sugammadex
Reversal of neuromuscular block Sugammadex dosage will be adjusted to body weight and PTC/TOF count at the time of reversal, and not administered until PTC at least 1. Dosage will be 4mg/kg if TOF = 0 and PTC = 1; and 2 mg/kg if TOF =1.

Treatment: drugs: Neostigmine
Neostigmine 50 micrograms/kg coupled with atropine 20 micrograms/kg or glycopyrrolate 5 micrograms/kg, to a maximum dose of neostigmine of 5.0 mg. The neostigmine should not be administered until the TOF has at least 3 twitches present.

  <outcomes>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Surgical conditions - Surgical operating conditions measured by maximal inflation pressure required for surgery, and number of times that organ movement occurred (due to diaphragmatic movement or abdominal wall tone), and overall surgical satisfaction using a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = very unacceptable, 2 = unacceptable, 3 = acceptable, 4 = good, 5 = excellent).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Trial summary: deep neuromuscular block is proposed as a technique to improve operative
      conditions for laparoscopy. Early clinical data would suggest that there may also be patient
      benefits beyond the operative period related to lower intra-abdominal pressure, and improved
      surgical exposure. In order to safely conduct deep neuromuscular blockade, it is essential to
      use Sugammadex to reverse the neuromuscular block. Conventional practice is to provide
      moderate neuromuscular block and reverse with neostigmine. It is not possible to safely
      reverse deep neuromuscular block using neostogmine, as the majority of block must have worn
      off for neostigmine to be effective. in order to identify whether deep neuromuscular block
      improves quality of recovery after surgery, the investigators will conduct a randomised trial
      of deep versus moderate neuromuscular block, whilst minimising variance in other anaesthetic
      techniques and drugs used. the outcome measured will be the post-operative quality of
      recovery over multiple time periods using the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale
      (PostopQRS). 350 patients will be enrolled over 4 centres.</summary>
