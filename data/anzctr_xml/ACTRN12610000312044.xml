  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of treatment with the drug PF-804 in patients with incurable non-small cell lung cancer, where standard therapy for advanced or widespread disease has not been successful. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have a confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, described as incurable stage IIIB or IV, where standard therapy has not been successful. 

Trial details 
Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive a non-active (placebo) treatment, and the other will receive treatment with the drug PF-804, both taken orally (in cycles of 28 days)until the disease progresses or toxicity is unacceptable. The aim is to compare the overall survival between the two groups, and to monitor the effects of the treatment. PF-804 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</summary>
