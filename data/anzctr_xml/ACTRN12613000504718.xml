  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible participants will be initially enrolled in the starting cohort dose level of 1 microgram/kg body weight of PSA-EPO given as a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for 8 doses (15 weeks). The injection will be given by study site staff experienced in administering  subcutaneous injections. Once the haemoglobin levels reaches a target level of 10-12g/dL, dosing may be changed to every 4 weeks. After review of the Week 8 safety data of six or more subjects  in this cohort and if no safety concerns are identified, enrolment of the next cohort of 12 subjects at either a higher dose level or lower dose level. Two dose level cohorts are initially planned to be sequentially enrolled. Depending on the observed safety profile and pharmacological response, up to four additional open-label cohorts (up to 6 treatment cohorts in total) of 12 participants per cohort may be subsequently added  to study additional and/or repeat (confirmatory) dose levels of PSA-EPO, as determined by a safety review committee (SRC). A higher or lower dose level will be determined by the review of haemoglobin levels and safety data by the SRC.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the range of doses of PSA-EPO administered subcutaneously that increases and maintains a haemoglobin levels at 10-12 g/dL in CKD subjects not on dialysis. This will be done by monitoring haemogloblin levels in participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Haemoglobin levels will be assessed once a week for up to 15 weeks from the first study drug dose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety profile of up to 8 doses of PSA-EPO administered subcutaneously in CKD subjects not on dialysis. This will be done by monitoring safety (presence of adverse events, changes in laboratory data, changes in physical examination and vital signs) in participants. Possible adverse events may include: increase in blood pressure, headache, irritation at injection site, nausea, vomiting, fever and diarrhoea.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety will be assessed once a week during the treatment period (15 weeks) and fortnightly during the follow up period up until all adverse events have stabilised. In case of severe adverse events (SAEs), if any, safety will be assessed hourly/daily by local principal investigator during the treatment period until SAEs have stabilised.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of up to 8 doses of PSA-EPO administered subcutaneously in a subset of CKD subjects not on dialysis. This will be assessed through the collection and analysis of blood samples collected from participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for pharmacokinetics will be collected from a subgroup of participants each time they receive PSA-EPO and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days after the day they receive the first dose of PSA-EPO. A maximum of 15 samples of 3mL each at each time points up to 15 weeks from the first study drug dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of up to 8 doses of PSA-EPO administered subcutaneously in a subset of CKD subjects not on dialysis. This will be assessed on the data collected for safety evaluations including weekly haemoglobin level, weekly reticulocyte level, red cell count, haematocrit and iron studies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Haemoglobin, reticulocyte, red cell count and haematocrit will be assessed weekly during the treatment period (15 weeks). Iron studies will be assessed monthly during the treatment period (15 weeks).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anaemia associated with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is due to the inability of the diseased kidneys to produce adequate amounts of endogenous erythropoietin (EPO), as well as, the shortened lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs), iron and other nutritional deficiencies, infection, and inflammation. The prevalence of anaemia increases with progressive deterioration of renal function, and affects more than 90% of people with end stage renal disease.
Anaemia is associated with increased mortality, increased likelihood of hospitalization, reduced cognitive function and exercise capacity, and increased left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Treatment of anaemia reduces morbidity and  may improve quality of life (QoL). Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents have been established as an effective treatment for anaemia associated with CKD and have improved the management of anaemia over alternatives such as blood transfusion. The first approved recombinant human erythropoietin, epoetin alfa, is administered 2-3 times/week for maximum efficacy. Darbepoetin alfa, has a longer half life allowing for less frequent dosing. Methoxy-polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is a pegylated product that can be administered once monthly.
PSA-EPO is a polysialylated form of erythropoietin (EPO), which is being developed for the treatment of anaemia of CKD. It is thought that polysialylation might produce an improved form of EPO, requiring a lower frequency of injection, have a slower onset of action than EPO, and potentially avert some of the side effects noted for EPO (e.g., thrombotic cardiovascular events).
This is a phase 2, open-label, multi-centre and sequential dose finding trial with up to 6 treatment cohorts of 12 pre-dialysis participants per cohort will enrol between 24 and 90 participants &gt;18 years of age with anaemia secondary to CKD, and not had treatment with an ESA in the prior 10 weeks.
Two dose level cohorts are initially planned to be sequentially enrolled. Depending on the observed safety profile and pharmacological response, up to four additional open-label cohorts of 12 participants per cohort may be subsequently added to study additional and/or repeat dose levels of PSA-EPO, as determined by a safety review committee. Each participant will receive an open-label dose of PSA-EPO every 2 weeks in the correction phase, and every 4 weeks once the target haemoglobin level has been achieved, for a total of up to 8 doses. The first cohort will receive a starting dose of 1 microgram/kg body weight administered subcutaneously every two weeks.
Each participant who completes the study is expected to participate for at least 17 weeks following the screening and attend weekly visits (unless advised differently by the local principal investigator) during that time.</summary>
