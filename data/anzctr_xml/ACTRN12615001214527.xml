    <studytitle> Intrauterine local anaesthetic after hysteroscopy to reduce post operative pain - A Randomised controlled trial                </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>women undergoing hysteroscopy for diagnosis, insertion of mirena and or removal of a polyp will be randomised to receive intrauterine installation of a local anaesthetic solution or saline at end of procedure to assess any difference in pain and return to normal activity  </scientifictitle>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Women will be seen at the Gynaecology clinic where a decision is usually made to perform hysteroscopy. At the time of consenting for the operation women will also be provided information regarding the study. After discussion demographic characteristics of the women consenting to participate will be recorded on the data sheet. This is purely to demonstrate that the two groups were comparable. 

Randomisation will be using a computer generated variable block of random numbers. Allocation to treatment or control group will be by opening a sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope available in theatre and opened towards the end of the procedure. The envelopes and randomization schedule will be prepared by a member of the research team not involved in the care of the woman.
