  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study plans to measure mild difficulties in thinking (also known as cognitive impairment) in patients undergoing a coronary angiogram (which is an investigation using x-rays to look at the blood vessels in the heart). It will take measurements of thinking ability before and after the test to see if  having the test leads to any changes in thinking ability. We will also ask about health problems related to heart disease such as high blood pressure and smoking.Patients who have heart disease are more likely to have problems with thinking compared with other people of similar age. Studies have also shown that having an angiogram may result in the release into the bloodstream of small particles which may be carried to the brain, potentially worsening thinking ability.We plan to  ask 50 patients to participate.  We will ask patients who are aged 65 years or older whose doctor has recommended that they have an angiogram,.  We will use a computer test called Cogstate to test patients before and after the procedure.  The computer tests have been shown to be easy and quick - just like playing a computer game.  The testing will take 15 min or so and is done while the patients are waiting for the angiogram to be done.  The tests will also be done a week after the angiogram to see if there is any change in thinking ability that may have been caused by the angiogram.</summary>
