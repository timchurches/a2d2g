    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Consent Rate - This will be calculated as the overall proportion of consented patients of those substitute decision makers (SDMs) approached (with 95% CI).
A successful consent rate will be defined as =70% of SDMs approached to consent.</outcome>

      <outcome>Recruitment Rate - A successful recruitment rate will be defined as achieving enrolment of 90 patients, conventionally expressed as 2 patients per center per month over 12 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Protocol Adherence - This will be calculated as doses of study drug administered as a proportion of doses prescribed and associated 95% confidence intervals.

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Invasive mechanical ventilation &gt;72 hours before randomization.

          2. Patients who must receive PPI due to active bleeding or increased bleeding risk (e.g.,
             patients with acute GI bleeding, recent severe esophagitis, Zollinger Ellison
             syndrome, Barrett's esophagus, peptic ulcer bleeding within 8 weeks [mild dyspepsia or
             mild gastroesophageal reflex disease will not be excluded])

          3. Receiving dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin and clopidogrel prior to randomization

          4. Palliative care or decision to withdraw advanced life support (patients with a
             decision to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation will not be excluded)

          5. Previous enrolment in this or a related trial

          6. Pregnancy

          7. Physician, patient, or substitute decision maker (SDM) declines

          8. Two or more 'daily doses' of prophylaxis with H2RA or PPI (one day of a single PPI
             dose is not an exclusion criterion if once daily dosing of PPI prophylaxis was
             administered; one day of bid [twice daily] dosing of an H2RA is not an exclusion
             criterion if twice daily H2RA prophylaxis was administered; one day of tid [thrice
             daily] dosing of an H2RA is not an exclusion criterion if thrice daily H2RA
             prophylaxis was administered).</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the this Pilot Trial is to determine the feasibility of conducting a large
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), that aims to examine the efficacy and safety of using
      pantoprazole compared to placebo for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill mechanically
      ventilated patients in the ICU.</summary>
