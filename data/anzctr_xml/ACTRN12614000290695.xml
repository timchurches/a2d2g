  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients will undergo myeloablative conditioning consisting of total body irradiation 8 Gy (lung shielded to 4 Gy) on day -9, intravenous thiotepa (5 mg/kg/day) on days -8 and -7; intravenous fludarabine (40 mg/m2/day) from day -7 to day -3; and intravenous rabbit antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobuline; 1.5mg/kg/day) on days -5 to -2.  
Donor mobilised peripheral blood stem cells are CD34+-selected and infused fresh on day 0 without post transplant immunosuppression.
On day +21 or later, patients are given a single intravenous infusion of iCasp9-transduced T cells, which are generated from unmobilised donor peripheral blood using a clinical grade retroviral vector. The iCasp9 T cell dose is increased in cohort size of two: 5x10e5/kg, 1x10e6/kg, 5x10e6/kg and 1x10e7/kg. Patients who develop grade II or above acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)are treated with an intravenous infusion of AP1903.  AP1903 is a chemical dimeriser that triggers the apoptotic death of iCasp9-transduced T cells.  Up to four doses of AP1903 can be given if necessary.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose
This study is evaluating the safety of haploidentical stem cell transplantation using high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with the infusion of donor stem cells followed by the infusion of genetically modified donor T cells. The genetic modification involves the insertion of a safety switch, called iCasp9, into the donor T cells, which allows the cells to be removed with a drug, AP1903, if the patient develops graft-versus-host disease, which is a life-threatening complication of stem cell transplantation.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you have a poor risk haematological malignancy (leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome) that requires treatment with an allogeneic stem cell transplant but do not have a suitable conventional donor, meaning you do not have a fully-matched or single-antigen mismatched (9/10 matched) related or unrelated donor. You should be aged 18 to 59years old and have adequate organ function to undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant. You should have a suitable first, second or third degree relative who can be your donor.
Trial details
Participants in this study will undergo myeloablative conditioning which involves high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This consists of total body irradiation, thiotepa, fludarabine and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobuline). Donor mobilised peripheral blood stem cells are CD34+-selected and infused fresh on day 0 without post-transplant immunosuppression. On day +21 or later, patients are given a single infusion of iCasp9-transduced T cells, which are generated from unmobilised donor peripheral blood using a clinical grade retroviral vector. The iCasp9 T cell dose is increased in cohort size of two: 5x10e5/kg, 1x10e6/kg, 5x10e6/kg and 1x10e7/kg. Each patient will receive only a single dose. Patients who develop grade II or above acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) are treated with an infusion of AP1903. AP1903 is a chemical dimeriser that triggers the apoptotic death of iCasp9-transduced T cells.
Participants will be required to undergo regular assessment to evaluate the safety of this study treatment. </summary>
