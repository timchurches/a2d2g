  <interventions>
    <interventions>Double-blinded randomised control trial
Arm 1: Saline with mometasone irrigation (2mg/240ml) &amp; a placebo spray
Arm 2: Mometasone nasal spray (1mg metered dose) with placebo irrigation

Irrigation is with a 240ml nasal rinse bottle, with saline solution plus either mometasone (Arm 1) or placebo (Arm 2) (base solution only) added.
Patients follow this irrigation with a metered dose nasal spray, one spray/nostril, containing either placebo (Arm 1) (base solution only) or mometasone (Arm 2).

Due to the volume of irrigated solution retained in the sinuses following positive pressure nasal irrigation, the effective dose of mometasone is the same for both arms of the study.  

Treatments are administered directly by patients once daily over a 12 month peroid. Patients begin treatment one day post-operatively.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe safety and adverse risks of long-term corticosteroid irrigation

There are only the risks of drug exposure and a subsequent additional low-dose conical beam volumetric tomography scan of the sinuses that are incurred.
This study will use MiniCAT low-dose conical beam CT scanning (Xoran Technologies, Ann Arbor, MI) to generate radiologic scores. The effective dose estimate for a 20-second sinus scan with 600 projection frames taken with the MiniCAT scanner is ~0.17mSv. In total, participants will be exposed to ~0.51mSv over the course of 24 months, which is well within the dose constraints required by ARPANSA.
Nasendoscopy is performed as part of routine post-operative care. Transient minor discomfort is occasionally felt during these routine post-operative evaluations.
Extensive clinical trials investigating the safety and tolerability of Mometasone in topical spray and lotion, have shown that is it well tolerated. Epistaxis, headache and pharyingitis are the most common adverse effects associated with its use in adults. The majority of local adverse effects have been reported as being mild and self-limiting, and generally do not require discontinuation of therapy. It is expected that side effects from the use of Mometasone irrigation will be similar to those experienced with Mometasone spray (Nasonex).
Patients will receive Augmentin Duo, a widely used and well tolerated antibiotic, every day for 10 days (standard post-operative care). Side effects include transient, asymptomatic increases in bilirubin and liver enzymes (common) and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (rare). Patients in this study will have a maximum course of 20 days Augmentin Duo, in order to decrease risk of the above.

Patients will be asked to self-report adverse events as they occur by contacting their treating doctor via telephone or email. These reports will be recorded by the study coordinator.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether nasal irrigation with a topical corticosteroid (mometasone) additive, is more beneficial in controlling the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) post-operatively,  than the treatments currently used. 

Irrigation with with a solution that contains mometasone may provide better control of CRS symptoms, compared to the simple intranasal steroid sprays that are currently used in conjunction with salt water irrigation. 

Patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery as part of the management of their CRS are eligible to participate. Patients who choose to participate in the study will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. This is a double-blinded trial, so neither the patient, nor the patient's treating surgeon will know which treatment group the patient has been allocated to.</summary>
