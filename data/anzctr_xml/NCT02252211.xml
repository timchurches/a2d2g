Cohort Number 4; No. Pts.: 3-6; Day 1 89Zr-DS8895a dose: 0.2 mg/kg

Treatment: drugs: DS-8895a
Cohort Number: 1; No. Pts: 3-6; DS-8895a dose rest of cycle: 1 mg/kg
Cohort Number 2; No. Pts.: 3-6; DS-8895a dose rest of cycle: 3 mg/kg
Cohort Number 3; No. Pts.: 3-6; DS-8895a dose rest of cycle: 10mg/kg
Cohort Number 4; No. Pts.: 3-6; DS-8895a dose rest of cycle: 20 mg/kg
Patients will receive an initial 89Zr trace labelled infusion of DS-8895a. DS-8895a will then be infused on Day 8, and second weekly infusions of DS-8895a, for a further two infusions, will subsequently occur. The day 36 infusion of DS-8895a will also be trace labelled with 89Zr, with subsequent PET imaging and pharmacokinetic sampling. Four dose levels (1, 3, 10 and 20mg/kg) will be evaluated, with 3-6 patients entered at each dose level.
