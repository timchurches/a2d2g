  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prospective, participant-masked, multiple arm, crossover dispensing clinical trial where participants will wear up to 6 pairs of lenses [up to 4 prototype (test) and up to 2 commercial (control)] lenses bilaterally. All 4 prototype lenses will be multifocal designs and each test lenses will have different amount of add power (+1.25, +1.50, +1.75, +2.00). Participants will be stratified based on their refractive error into either presbyopic or non-presbyopic group. Each of the stratified group will have a maximum of 4 parallel arms. Test lens designs will be assessed against the control/s in each parallel arm in a randomized cross over fashion, with a minimum 2 day washout period between the lens types. Lenses will be worn on a daily wear basis  and each lens assessment will require 2 scheduled clinic attendances  a fitting visit on Day 1 and an evaluation visit between Day 5 to Day 7 with 2 take-home questionnaires to be completed between the fitting visit and evaluation visit. </interventions>
    <comparator>In the presbyope group, the control contact lenses will be Air Optix Aqua Multifocal and Acuvue Oasys for Presbyopia contact lens to be worn for five days on a daily wear, single use basis. In the non-presbyope group, the controls will be Air Optix Aqua and Acuvue 1 Day Moist single vision contact lens to be worn for five days on a daily wear, single use basis. </comparator>

Be at least 18 years old, male or female.
Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator.
Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses.
Correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses.
Be willing to not wear contact lenses for a minimum of 2 days before each stage of the clinical trial (after informed consent).

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. 
NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Contraindications to contact lens wear.
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The minimum number of participants is 10 for each parallel arm for both the presbyopic and non-presbyopic groups. Enrolment will take place over 6 months.

Participants will be screened for general clinical trial suitability by way of a routine eye examination which includes refraction, visual acuity and general eye health.  Informed consent will be obtained prior to any clinical trial procedures. Neophyte and experienced contact lens wearers will be enrolled into lens wear.
Participants will be allocated to a group, contact lens designs differ within the groups and the order of contact lens wear will be randomised.
</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation plan for cross-over lens allocation (within each stratification group) will be generated from http://www.randomization.com/. The websiteâ€™s second random generator will be used to create a random permutation of all lens types for each participant. The generated randomisation list will be copied from the website by the biostatistician and applied through the Clinic Data Management system.
		
The randomisation code will be applied (and broken if required) by a Clinical Coordinator (CC), and clearly documented.  The Investigator will not have access to this randomisation code until the trial is completed and final data analysis performed.

    <statisticalmethods>A minimum of 10 participants in each arm of both the groups (presbyope and non-presbyope) are required in order to demonstrate a statistically significant paired difference of 0.1+/-0.1 logMAR visual acuity between test and control lens types at the 5% level of significance and 80% power. The sample size within each arm is not adjusted for dropouts due to the short duration of the study. Participants will need to be replaced if drop outs occur within an arm.</statisticalmethods>
