Treatment: drugs - isotretinoin
Treatment: drugs - thiotepa
Treatment: surgery - autologous bone marrow transplantation
Treatment: surgery - peripheral blood stem cell transplantation

Experimental: Arm I (high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR) - Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days -8 to -6; thiotepa IV over 3 hours and etoposide IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3; and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or SC once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover. Autologous PBSC or bone marrow are reinfused on day 0.

Experimental: Arm II (intermediate-dose chemotherapy and ASCR) - Patients receive intermediate-dose chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 4 hours and thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days 1-2 and G-CSF IV or SC once daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover. Autologous PBSC or bone marrow are reinfused on day 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 3 courses.

Experimental: Arm III (isotretinoin) - Patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 6 courses.

No Intervention: Arm IV (no isotretinoin) - Patients do not receive maintenance therapy.

Treatment: surgery: autologous bone marrow transplantation
Peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow will be reinfused about 72 hours following completion of the last dose of chemotherapy (Day 0)

Filgrastim is to be given daily in the afternoon for 4 days prior to the first harvest and continued until the completion of the daily harvests. The daily PBSC harvesting should be started prior to the fifth dose of filgrastim.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, thiotepa, and etoposide, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher
      doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. Isotretinoin may be effective in
      preventing recurrence of glioma. It is not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy plus
      autologous stem cell transplantation with or without isotretinoin is more effective in
      treating recurrent high-grade glioma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying high-dose chemotherapy or
      intermediate-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation to see how
      well it works compared to high-dose chemotherapy or intermediate-dose chemotherapy followed
      by autologous stem cell transplantation and isotretinoin in treating young patients with
      recurrent high-grade glioma.</summary>
