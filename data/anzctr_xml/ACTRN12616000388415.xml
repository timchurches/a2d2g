  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oral administration comprising the dose of 90mg Ticagrelor or Placebo twice daily for a total period of 8 weeks (4 weeks each) to assess the effect of ticagrelor on angina frequency in patients with Coronary Slow Flow who experience angina at least 3 times/week.

After the first 4 weeks (Phase 1) completed, two weeks washout period is allowed, patients will not need to take any study tablets specifically for this trial in the washout period.

The investigational product will be packed in bottle covering the period from one visit to the next. Each patient will receive and return the designated bottle at the regular site visits.
</interventions>
    <comparator>This study is designed as a double-Â­blind, placebo controlled, crossover study. Placebo drug will involve taking a drug (for 4 weeks) that looks similar in appearance to Ticagrelor but will not affect the patient in any way.

Placebo consists of lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate. The composition of the film- coat is identical to that of the corresponding strength of ticagrelor active tablets.

      <outcome>To assess the effect of ticagrelor 90mg bd on angina frequency in patients with Coronary Slow Flow who experience angina at least 3 times/week.

Patients will maintain an angina diary throughout this study period. This diary will describe the frequency and characteristics of chest pain (i.e. the time of day, severity, triggers, etc.). In addition, we will administer Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) at screening and at the end of each phases.  </outcome>

Based upon previous experience, the mean total angina episodes expected in this study population is 28+/-31 episodes/month. This study showed 56% of reduction in total angina frequency. Thus using a crossover study design to detect a 50% change in frequency with ticagrelor, 29 patients would be required for 80% power at alpha =0.05. Accounting for dropouts, 35 will be patients recruited.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Ticagrelor in Coronary microvascular dysfunction (TIC) program is an extensive research program investigating the potential therapeutic benefits of ticagrelor in patients with a condition referred as slow flow phenomenon, speculating that its benefits extend beyond its anti-platelet effects and suggesting that it may have an important role in the management of these patients. Ticagrelor has been developed as an anti- platelet agent and is currently utilised in the management of heart attack and unstable angina.  Slow flow means heart muscle does not receive blood quickly enough and as a consequence patient may experience chest pain.  Medical treatment is directed towards controlling the angina pain. Taking Ticagrelor orally twice a day, which has the ability to relax the small microscopic blood vessels in the heart, may lead to better blood flow to the heart muscle and reduce the associated symptoms of chest pain. However, at present, there is no scientific evidence available demonstrating how effective ticagrelor is in patients with slow flow. The aim of this study is to investigate whether taking ticagrelor (90mg twice daily for 4 weeks) can reduce frequency of chest pain in these slow flow patients.
