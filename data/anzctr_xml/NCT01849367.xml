    <exclusivecriteria>1. Diagnosis (as defined by DSM-IV) of: any psychotic disorder (lifetime); eating
             disorder (current or within the past year); obsessive compulsive disorder (lifetime);
             post-traumatic stress disorder (current or within the past year); mental retardation.

          2. History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (as per DSM-IV criteria) within the

          3. Inadequate response to ECT in the current episode of depression.

          4. Participant is on regular benzodiazepine medication which is not clinically
             appropriate to discontinue.

          5. Participant requires a rapid clinical response due to inanition, psychosis or high
             suicide risk.

          6. Neurological disorder or insult, e.g., recent stroke (CVA), which places participant
             at risk of seizure or neuronal damage with tDCS.

          7. Participant has metal in the cranium, skull defects, or skin lesions on scalp (cuts,
             abrasions, rash) at proposed electrode sites.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel treatment approach for depression
      that has shown promising efficacy in four recent double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled
      trials (RCT) and a meta-analysis. Mood, cognitive test performance and biomarkers will be
      measured during the trial.</summary>
