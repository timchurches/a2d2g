  <interventions>
    <interventions>Biomarkers, electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram will be done at baseline (before chemotherapy), after cycle1, cycle 3 and 6 month post start day of chemotherapy. Cardiac biomarkers are study specific blood tests taken to assess and correlate changes in heart function with changes in heart function as measured by TDI or as measured by ejection fraction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical activity of the heart. The test takes about 10 minutes. Patients are usually given 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. One cyle lasts 3 weeks. Chemotherapy treatment may vary depending on patient's treatment plan. Some of tha drugs that may be administred are: Epirubuicn, 5-Fluorouracil, Cyclophosphamide, Taxotere.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The risk of cardiomyopathy as a side-effect is related to the total dose of anthracycline given to a patient.  Cardiomyopathy may in turn cause symptoms of heart failure such as shortness of breath, increased tiredness, swelling of your ankles, inability to keep up your usual level of activity.  These symptoms may be serious and even permanent.  

Current practice is to ensure normal heart function before starting anthracycline therapy.  This is done using one of two available techniques:  echocardiogram or gated cardiac blood pool scan (GCBPS).  An echocardiogram uses ultrasound whereas a GCBPS uses a radioactive isotope.  Use of a radioactive isotope means exposure to a small amount of radiation and a small risk of allergic reaction to the isotope.  Current practice is to repeat one of these two tests only if the patient later experiences any symptoms of heart failure.  

The aim of this study is to assess whether a newer technique using Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) is more sensitive in detecting early changes in heart function. The study also examines whether changes in specific blood tests (known as cardiac biomarkers) correlate more closely to changes in heart function as measured by TDI or as measured by echocardiogram..  

The use of TDI measurement as a technique is not proven in the monitoring of patients that receive anthracycline therapy and so is investigational in nature.  For the purposes of this study heart function for all patients will be measured using echocardiogram and TDI.  This will be done as one procedure.</summary>
