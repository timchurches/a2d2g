Experimental: Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG) - All participants were to receive LCIG, via the NJ tube during the nasojejunal (NJ) Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J) during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour), in most instances.


Treatment: drugs: Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel
Infusion should be kept within a range of 0.5-10 mL/hour (10-200 mg levodopa/hour) and is usually 2-6 mL/hour (40-120 mg levodopa/hour).

The total AIMS score was calculated by summing items 1-10, with a possible range of 0-40; a negative change indicates improvement. The AIMS was to be performed at consistent times, when the subject was experiencing his/her worst "On" time (dyskinesia [involuntary muscle movement]).</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Average Daily "Off" Time at Endpoint - Based on the Parkinson's Disease Symptom Diary. "On" time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. "Off" time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. The diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected clinic visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e. 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. Negative change from baseline for "off" time indicates improvement.</outcome>
