    <statisticalmethods>In this observational study with a convenience sample  of 470 infants we want to describe HR (Dawson et al Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed 2010 May;95(3):F177-81).  and SpO2 (Dawson et al Pediatrics. 2010 Jun;125(6):e1340-7)  centiles in newly born infants. In our previous study  we obtained data from 429 infants &gt;=32 weeks gestation to construct HR and oxygen centiles. Many of the babies in the first study were born following early cord clamping.  In the current study  we will recruit a similar number of infants  to allow for comparisons between the previous and current study. To account for post enrollment exclusions (for example an obstetric emergency or the need for neonatal resuscitation), an additional 10% will be enrolled. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the womb, blood flows to and from the baby through blood vessels in the umbilical cord which connects the placenta (lining of the womb) to the developing baby (fetus). After the birth of a baby blood continues to flow back and forth whilst the umbilical cord remains unclamped allowing some remaining blood from the placenta to flow to the baby. It is routine to clamp and cut the cord after birth. At present, we do not know the ideal time for the umbilical cord to be left unclamped and uncut.
The aim of our study is to find out how cord clamping affects the normal adaptation a newly born baby has to make in adjusting circulation of their blood and their breathing patterns and effort. We intend to do this by measuring newly born babies oxygen saturation levels and their heart rate using a monitor (pulse oximeter) we use routinely in the nursery. 
We know that it takes a few minutes after birth for babies to adapt to life outside the womb and would like to document the changes in oxygen levels and heart rate in the first 10 minutes after birth and to investigate if the timing of cord clamping affects these values.  This information will help us to determine the best time to cut the umbilical cord.
What the study involves: We  place a pulse oximeter sensor on a babys right hand, and for some infants place 3 sensors on their chest to measure heart rate) In a small subgroup of infants we will place sensors on the babies head to measure cerebral oxygenation.  
As soon as possible after a baby is born and while she/he is on their mothers chest we dry babys hand and place the sensor on their right hand. We can do this without disturbing parents from  cuddling their new baby. It does not interfere with the midwife caring for the women whilst waiting for the placenta to be delivered. 
The sensor on a  babys hand stays in place for the first 10 minutes after babys birth. The researchers do not interfere with the normal care given to a newly born baby. 
Our aim is to combine measurements from many babies to get a picture of what happens to oxygen levels and heart rate in normal healthy babies in the first minutes after their birth. </summary>
