    <interventions>Prevalence Of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.  Prevalence of PCOS is the proportion of a population found to have a PCOS among study group. Fertile and  infertile patients attending infertility clinic fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria over 16 months duration were recruited.PCOS was diagnosed by the presence of two or more of the following; clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual disorders and polycystic ovaries in transvaginal ultrasound. The clinical assessment of hirsutism is subjective, and it is important to consider the patients perception of unwanted hair growth in addition to the perceived rate and timing of hair growth onset. Hirsutism was referred to the growth of coarse, dark hair in areas without hair at all or where fine hair typically grows or, and takes male pattern distribution; above the lip and on the chin, chest, abdomen, and back. Free testosterone (free T) was used to assess hyperandrogenism. Polycystic ovaries were identified by vaginal ultrasound, conducted in the follicular phase or when hormonal assessment showed no follicular activity. A positive finding of polycystic ovaries required either 12 or more follicles measuring 29 mm in diameter, or increased ovarian volume (10 cm) in at least one of the ovaries.
