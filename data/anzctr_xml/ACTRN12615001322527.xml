  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. The intervention group, on top of standard antihypertensive medication (calcium channel blocker, alpha and beta blocker) will receive ARB (losartan) among post dialysis euvolumic hypertensive patients. 

2. The ARB used for current RCT is Losartan. The selection of Losartan was based on availability, cost effectiveness and expert opinion of a Nephrologist and a cardiologist. Starting dose of 50 mg/day of losartan oral tablet will be given to recruited patients. Persistent high post dialysis blood pressure  of &gt;160mmHg or unable to attain targeted blood pressure of 140mmHg for a period of four months, upon consultation with a cardiologist and nephrologists the dose of losartan will be titrated up to 100mg/day. Moreover, based on patient response to initial 50mg/day dose, cardiologist may titrate the dose up to 100mg/day before 4 months so as to avoid any detrimental effect on subject health.(NKF KDOQI guideline 2004, to be followed for dose titration) 

A person in family of the patient will be asked to monitor the adherence of given medication. contact number and frequent meeting with the designated person will be arranged with the investigator to closely monitor the adherence of medication.

3. The maximum study duration is 8 months. Since there are two intervention dose of losartan, a 4 month period of each dose (50mg/day, 100mg/day) will be allowed to note patient response. Failure to achieve and maintain targeted systolic blood pressure of &lt;140mmHg for three weeks with 50mg/day dose during the first 4 months, the subjects will be titrated to 100mg/day for next 4 months or if study end point achieved (maintaining&lt;140mmHg for three weeks)

4. Dose of losartan to be administered at morning after breakfast except on dialysis session days, to avoid any incidence of hypotension. </interventions>
    <comparator>the control group include standard antihypertensive therapy among post dialysis euvolumic hypertensive patients. the standard antihypertensive therapy includes calcium channel blocker(felodipine 10mg/day oral tablet till the study end point or maximum period of 8 months), and beta blocker (metoprolol 50 mg/day oral tablet till the study end point or maximum period of 8 months)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the primary end point includes attaining post dialysis systolic blood pressure of &lt;140mmHg and maintaining it for three weeks. Outcome will be assessed on proportion of patients achieving systolic blood pressure of &lt;140mmHg for three weeks within 8 months of study duration
outcomes will be monitored by blood pressure monitoring device (automatic sphygmomanometer). Blood pressure will be monitored 30 minutes post dialysis till study end point is achieved or maximum duration of 8 months</outcome>
      <timepoint>All End stage renal failure patients undergoing dialysis thrice a week will be recruited for current study.. Blood pressure reading will be taken 30 mins post dialysis after every session ( thrice/week) till study end point or maximum period of 8 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary point will be all cause of mortality.
A validated data collection tool will be formed to record all patient finding related to study. in case of mortality, all patient records and consultation with the doctor will be assured to confirm the cause of mortality

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Euvolumic patients with blood pressure more than 140/90 mmHg post dialysis will be included for the study. 
On basis of expert opinion from nephrologists, patient 30-80 years were included for current study.

    <statisticalmethods>Results will be expressed as mean or percentage. Comparisons between treatment groups were made by using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test when applicable for continuous variables and using test for categorical variables. Cumulative event curves will be created by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis, and differences between the 2 treatment groups were analyzed by using log-rank test.
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses will be performed for comparison of the 2 treatment groups after adjustment for the dynamic stratification variables (age, sex, years on dialysis, and diabetes) and center effect. These data will be presented as hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was set at P less than 0.05. All statistical calculations will be performed using SPSS version 20.

The equation for statistical superiority 

N = 2 x{(Z1-a/2   +  Z1-ÃŸ )/d}2 x S

N=size per group; p=the response rate of standard treatment group; p 0= the response rate of new drug treatment group; z = the standard normal deviate for a one or two sided x; d= the real difference between two treatment effect; a clinically acceptable margin; S= Polled standard deviation of both comparison groups. power 80%, effect size is 3, statistical significance is 95%.

Calculating the sample size using mentioned equation
N= 2x((1.96+0.845)/3) 2 x 20.48
N= 35 


Sample size for current study was based on statistical superiority trial (continuous data) design of Randomized control trial. Statistician helped in calculating sample size based on statistical superiority trial. The sample size for current study was 70, a 25 %  drop out rate was added , hence a total of 88 patients were recruited for current study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Since there is a constant volume variation during hemodialysis session, there is a strong possibility for the activation of RAAS system. The activation of RAAS system leads to narrowing of the lumen of blood vessels thus leading to rise in blood pressure even if the patient is euvolumic. Considering the importance of RAAS system in euvolumic hypertensive patients, the role of drugs blocking RAAS system needs further investigation. Hence the current randomized control trial is based on role of ARBs  (losartan) in managing blood pressure among euvolumic hemodialysis patients</summary>
