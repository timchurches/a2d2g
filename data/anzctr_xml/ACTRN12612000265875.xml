  <interventions>
    <interventions>This investigation includes four groups (1. printed letters support + usual care, 2. telephone support + usual care, 3. Email support + usual care, 4. Usual care only. All participants continue to receive their usual health care. No usual treatment is withheld from any participant. Each of the three intervention options (intervention 1, 2 &amp; 3) run for a period of approximately 12 weeks commencing with a face to face motivational interview (and joint goal setting based on patient preferences to meet the prescribed physical activity requirements). This interview will be between 30 to 60 minutes duration. Following the initial interview, support is more frequent at the start (e.g. 3 support phone calls during the first week) and becomes less frequent over the remaining 11 weeks (e.g. 1 support phone call during the final fortnight). The support is provided by a suitably qualified health professional (e.g. physiotherapist or psychologist). The mode of support differs between each of the 3 intervention groups (printed letters, phone or email).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this investigation is to investigate three modes of supporting our outpatients to undertake the physical activity prescribed by their treating health professional (e.g. physiotherapist). This four group randomised study will investigate the merit of three modes of offering personalised support to patients (via the telephone, letters in the mail or email) in comparison to usual care. 

Potential participants will be identified by their clinical team who will also provide the research team with a list suitable activities they have prescribed for their patients based on their level of fitness and any health conditions they may have. These participants will then be randomised into one of four groups. The first group will only receive their routine care and no additional support (usual care control). The second group will receive support via the telephone. The third group will receive support via letters sent in the mail. The fourth group will receive letters sent via email. The interventions will last for a period of 12 weeks. They start off with intensive support, gradually reducing to less frequent support over the 12-week period. The support is provided by a suitably qualified health professional (e.g. Physiotherapist) as prescribed by the patients usual treating team.

Data from this investigation will provide important information about the feasibility, costs and effectiveness of these interventions. This information will be used to inform future service delivery improvements and future research investigations.</summary>
