  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fluid challenge consisting in 500 ml of intravenous crystalloids (both saline 0,9% or Ringer Acetate or Lactate were allowed), administered in 10 minutes.
The Fluid challenge is administered by the attending physician to correct hemodynamic instability.
All the patients received hemodynamic monitoring with the MostCare system which provides all the hemodynamic variables evaluated in the study before and after fluid challenge administration (cardiac output, stroke volume, arterial elastance (Ea), cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE)).
In a previous pilot study a model including baseline pulse pressure variation, the variation of systolic arterial pressure - dicrotic pressure and CCE showed the greater AUC (0.92), and correctly identified the efficacy of FC in 87% of patients (84.2% of responders and 92.5 of non-responders). The following formula describes this latter model:
0.039+1.042*(DELTASAP- Pdic 5min)+1.278* DELTACCE5min+1.159*PPVbaseline</interventions>
    <comparator>The pulse pressure variation, a dynamic index of fluid responsiveness, has been considered as the gold standard. Off line evaluation of PPV before and after the fluid challenge was the used as control treatment</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To consider the fluid responsiveness (i.e increase in cardiac index after fluid challenge administration) of the patient by means of model application. Fluid responsiveness is assessed by means of Mostcare system and is defined as the increase of at least 15% of the cardiac index after the infusion of a fluid challenge of 500 ml of crystalloids in 10 minutes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Minutes 1 2 3 4 5 after fluid challenge infusion</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the area under the curve (AUC) of the model with the AUC of baseline pulse pressure variation.
The ROC curve is calculated considering the variations of the hemodynamic parameters assessed by means of Mostcare system and the response to fluid administration.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi centric study aiming to test the reliability of a novel algorithm including the analysis of baseline pulse pressure variation (PPV), cardicac cycle efficiecy (CCE) and the difference between systolic pressure and dicrotic pressure (SAP-Pdic). In a previous pilot trial we found that this dynamic approach could predict the outcome of a fluid challenge better than purely baseline assessment of PPV. This could spare inappropriate fluid administration in those patient who should not receive fluid despite hemodynamic instability. To test our hypothesis will be studied 2 groups of patients in ICU (septic and non septic patients). All the patients will receive fluid as part of standard care and all the hemodynamic variables will be recorded by means of MostCare system. The reliability of the model will be evaluated post hoc (after fluid administration), and compared to the PPV value before fluid administration.</summary>
