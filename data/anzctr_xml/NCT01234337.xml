Treatment: drugs - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Capecitabine

Experimental: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006) + Capecitabine - Capecitabine was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) twice daily (12 hours apart) on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-day cycle. Sorafenib was administered orally at a dose of 600 mg (200 mg in the morning, 400 mg in the evening) daily, continuously (that is, Days 1 to 21, inclusive). A treatment cycle consisted of 21 days. If tolerability criteria were met for a subject, capecitabine dose was escalated to 1,250 mg/m^2 twice daily and sorafenib dose to a total daily dose of 800 mg for that subject.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo + Capecitabine - Capecitabine was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg/m^2 twice daily (12 hours apart) on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-day cycle. Placebo matching to sorafenib was administered orally, 3 tablets (1 tablet in the morning, 2 tablets in the evening) daily, continuously (that is, Days 1 to 21, inclusive). A treatment cycle consisted of 21 days. If tolerability criteria were met for a subject, capecitabine dose was escalated to 1,250 mg/m^2 twice daily and placebo dose to a total daily dose of 4 tablets (2 tablets twice daily) for that subject.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessed by the Independent Review Panel According to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 - PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to disease progression, radiological or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST version 1.1, progressive disease was determined when there was at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest sum on trial). In addition to a relative increase of 20%, the sum had demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of new lesions and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions was also interpreted as progressive disease. Participants without progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of evaluable tumor evaluation. Median and other 95% confidence intervals (CIs) computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first participant until approximately 3 years or until disease radiological progression</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Participants still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last known alive date. Median and other 95% CIs computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first participant until approximately 3 years later</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Progression (TTP) by Central Review - TTP was defined as the time from date of randomization to disease radiological progression by central review. Per RECIST version 1.1, progressive disease was determined when there was at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest sum on trial). In addition to a relative increase of 20%, the sum had demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of new lesions and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions was also interpreted as progressive disease. Participants without progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of evaluable tumor evaluation. Median and other 95% confidence intervals (CIs) computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first participant until approximately 3 years later or until disease radiological progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Central Review - ORR was defined as the best tumor response (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) observed during treatment or within 30 days after termination of study treatment, assessed according to the RECIST version 1.1. CR=all target lesions disappeared, and any pathological lymph node, whether target or non-target, had a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. If any residual lesion was present, cyto-histology was made available to unequivocally document benignity. PR=at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR=CR+PR. CR and PR were confirmed by another scan at least 4 weeks later.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first participant until approximately 3 years later or until disease radiological progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Control Rate (DCR) by Central Review - DCR was defined as the proportion of participants whose best response was CR, PR, stable disease (SD) or Non-CR/Non-PD. Per RECIST version 1.1, CR=all target lesions disappeared, any pathological lymph node, target/non-target, a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR=at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters. PD=at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference smallest sum on study. Appearance of new lesions and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. SD=neither sufficient shrinkage qualified for PR nor sufficient increase qualified for PD, taking smallest sum of diameters as a reference. Non-CR/Non-PD=persistence of 1/more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits. DCR=CR+PR+SD or Non-CR/Non-PD. CR and PR confirmed by another scan at least 4 weeks later. SD and Non-CR/Non-PD documented at least 6 weeks after randomization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first participant until approximately 3 years later or until disease radiological progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DOR) by Central Reader - DOR was defined as the time from date of first response (CR or PR) to the date when PD is first documented, or to the date of death, whichever occurred first according to RECIST version 1.1. CR=all target lesions disappeared, and any pathological lymph node, whether target or non-target, had a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. If any residual lesion was present, cyto-histology was made available to unequivocally document benignity. PR=at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Participants still having CR or PR and have not died at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation. DOR defined for confirmed responders only (that is, CR or PR). 'NA' indicates that value could not be estimated due to censored data. Median and 95% CIs were computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this phase-III trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in
      combination with capecitabine versus capecitabine in combination with placebo in the
      treatment of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer who are
      resistant to or have failed prior taxane and an anthracycline or for whom further
      anthracycline therapy is not indicated. After signing consent there can be up to 28 days
      before starting the treatment during which time a number of tests will be carried out which
      will include tumor evaluations and medical history. The following tests and evaluations will
      have to be done within 7 days of the start of treatment,on Day 1 of every cycle and at the
      end of study: Electrocardiogram, blood tests, patient quality of life questionnaires and a
      complete physical exam and vital signs. Treatment will be given in 21 day cycles with
      sorafenib/placebo to be taken every day for 21 days and capecitabine to be taken for the
      first 14 days. Patients will come in weekly for the first 6 weeks and then on Day1 for every
      cycle after the first 2 cycles. During the weekly visits the subjects will be check for any
      side effects and blood draws will happen for the study on Day 1 of each cycle. Subjects will
      be followed for overall survival.</summary>
