  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Embolization

Experimental: Embolization - The intervention arm will perform SAE as a central embolization of the splenic artery.
Additional peripheral embolization is left to the discretion of the interventional radiologist.
The study does not interfere with local diagnostic work-up and treatment protocols.

No Intervention: Observation - The control arm in this randomized controlled trial will include only NOM patients diagnosed with splenic injuries OIS grade 4 or 5 and suitable for observation alone, and will comprise clinical observation according to local routines and protocols.


Treatment: surgery: Embolization
The intervention arm will perform SAE as a central embolization of the splenic artery.
Additional peripheral embolization is left to the discretion of the interventional radiologist.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Failure of NOM - The primary objective is to compare the failure rate due to splenic bleeding between the patients undergoing pre-emptive SAE as part of NOM and the patients not undergoing SAE. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects failing NOM due to spleen related bleeding within 7 days of injury. All analyses will be based on an intention to treat analysis.</outcome>

    <summary>The primary objective is to compare the failure rate due to splenic bleeding between the
      patients undergoing pre-emptive splenic arterial embolization (SAE) as part of non-operative
      management (NOM) and the patients not undergoing SAE. We hypothesize that the use of
      pre-emptive SAE will decrease the delayed bleeding rate and increase the success rate of NOM.</summary>
