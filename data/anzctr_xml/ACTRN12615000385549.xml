  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preliminary evidence from human intervention studies support a potential role of berries and their processed products in risks mitigation of inflammatory diseases (Joseph et al., 2014) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (Rodriguez-Mateos et al., 2014).
Despite these, owing to limited studies that assessed the absorption and metabolism of berry (poly)phenols, at present, it remains unclear whether it is the native (unmetabolized) berry polyphenols, their in vivo metabolic breakdown products, or a combination of the two, that are responsible for attributing the cardiovascular health benefits associated with consumption of berry products. As such, to enable the establishment of potential cause-and-effect relationships, the current literature recommends the need for more research efforts to clarify which specific berry (poly)phenols are directly responsible for the observed in vivo beneficial actions on cardiovascular health.
In addition, it is unclear whether consumption of berry species with some subtle differences in (poly)phenol composition would give rise to some common in vivo plasma and/or urinary metabolite profiles. This information is critical as it would help explain whether observed differences in some measurable clinical endpoints of CVDs derived from consumption of different berry species is fundamentally associated to differences in the in vivo (poly)phenol metabolite profiles.
Our Hypothesis: Based on information from the current literature, we hypothesize that some (poly)phenolic breakdown products are common in vivo metabolites that are formed postprandially, regardless of subtle differences in  berry (poly)phenol composition, and that these (poly)phenolic metabolites (as opposed to the native polyphenols found in berry extracts) are partly responsible for upregulating in vivo mechanisms that lead towards some measurable beneficial cardiovascular health outcomes in humans.
