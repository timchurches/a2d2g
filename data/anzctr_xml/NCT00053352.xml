  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - conventional surgery
Treatment: drugs - cisplatin
Treatment: drugs - etoposide
Other interventions - bleomycin sulfate
Other interventions - laboratory biomarker analysis

Experimental: Arm I - Patients enrolled with gonadal tumors of stage II or greater or extragonadal tumors of any stage receive cisplatin IV over 90 minutes &amp; etoposide IV over 90 minutes days 1-3 and bleomycin sulfate IV over = 10 minutes day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks, 3 courses (weeks 0,3 &amp; 6).
After completion of compressed induction chemotherapy, patients with no change in disease status or disease progression are removed from study. Patients with no evidence of disease receive no further therapy. Patients with a partial response or abnormal tumor markers proceed to conventional surgery (second-look) and/or 3 more courses of compressed consolidation chemotherapy.
After surgery, patients with pathologic complete response and have normal tumor markers receive no further therapy. Patients who remain with a partial response after surgery receive compressed consolidation chemotherapy.
Patients receive cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin as induction chemotherapy in weeks 10,13, &amp; 16.

No Intervention: Arm 2 - Patients who are enrolled with stage I gonadal tumors receive no further anticancer therapy until evidence of tumor recurrence or the diagnosis of a second malignant neoplasm.
Observation only for recurrence or development of an SMN

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free survival (EFS) of at least 92% (for intermediate-risk tumors only) defined as the first occurrence of relapse, progressive disease, second malignancy, or death after the start of protocol-specified chemotherapy - A piecewise exponential failure rate model for the theoretical EFS time for both the low and intermediate risk patients will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS) of at least 95% (both low-risk and intermediate-risk tumors) - The model for OS will also be derived from a piecewise exponential failure rate model. The distribution of the complementary log-log transformation of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the four-year survival will be used to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true death rate.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying surgery followed by combination chemotherapy to see how well
      it works in treating children with germ cell tumors that are not located in the head. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Combining more than one drug, and giving them after surgery, may kill any
      remaining tumor cells following surgery. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy
      is effective in decreasing the recurrence of childhood germ cell tumors.</summary>
