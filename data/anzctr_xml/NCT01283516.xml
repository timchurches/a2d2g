  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - LDK378

Experimental: LDK378: Arm 1A and Arm 1B - NSCLC patients previously treated with an ALK inhibitor

Experimental: LDK378: Arm 2 - NSCLC patients not previously treated with an ALK inhibitor

Experimental: LDK378: Arm 3 - Patients with other tumors that are ALK positive other than NSCLC


Treatment: drugs: LDK378
LDK378 is a selective and a potent inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) activity, is a capsule and is administered orally.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) - The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose for a given schedule that was expected to cause DLTs in no more than 33% of patients during the first cycle of treatment. A patient with multiple occurrences of a DLT under one treatment is counted only once in the AE category for that treatment. MTD was determined at 750mg.</outcome>
      <timepoint>33 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on Investigator Assessment - Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.0. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI, CR is the disappearance of all target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters. Both CR and PR had to be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR = at least two determinations of CR, at least 4 weeks apart before progression. PR = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression (and not qualifying for a CR).</outcome>
      <timepoint>33 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DOR) Based on Investigator Assessment - As per Kaplan-Meier estimate. Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from first documented response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)) to the date of first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, among patients with a confirmed PR or CR per RECIST 1.0.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  ECOG Performance Status of = 2 and life expectancy of = 12 weeks.

          -  Diagnosed with a locally advanced or metastatic malignancy that has progressed despite
             standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy exists. Only patients
             with tumors characterized by genetic abnormalities in ALK were enrolled.

          -  For NSCLC, an ALK translocation must be detected by FISH in = 15% of tumor cells.

          -  In patients with diseases other than NSCLC, ALK translocation is not required and
             overexpression of ALK protein may be considered indicative of a genetic abnormality in
             ALK.

          -  Patients with measurable or non-measurable disease as determined by modified RECIST
             version 1.0 in dose-escalation phase, and patients with at least one measurable lesion
             as determined by RECIST 1.0 in expansion phase.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who were
             neurologically unstable or required increasing doses of steroids to control their CNS
             disease were excluded.

          -  Patients with a prior or current history of a second malignancy, impaired GI function,
             history of pancreatitis or increased amylase or lipase, known diagnosis of HIV, and
             clinically significant cardiac disease were excluded.

          -  Patients treated with chemotherapy or biologic therapy or other investigational agent
             &lt; 2 weeks prior to starting study drug for compounds with a half-life = 3 days, and &lt;
             4 weeks prior to starting study drug for compounds with a prolonged half-life were
             excluded.

          -  Further, patients treated with medications that were known to be strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 that could not be discontinued at least a week prior to start of
             treatment with LDK378 and for the duration of the study were also excluded.
