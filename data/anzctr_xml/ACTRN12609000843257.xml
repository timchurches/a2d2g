  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study introduces a vocational rehabilitation intervention (self management) to the vocational rehabilitation sector. The model will add self-management training to usual care for injured workers with subacute or chronic compensated musculoskeletal conditions.
Self-management is a process that involves engaging individuals in activities and practices that sustain and promote health and well-being. It has been shown to be effective in chronic illness care through improving self-efficacy and wellness behaviours. The well-established Lorig self-management program (developed by the Stanford University in the USA) shall be used as the intervention in this study, but it has been adapted to cater more specifically for our study population. That is, modules concerned with managing return-to-work and navigating the compensation systems have been developed and will be added to the existing six module training program.  
Thus, the intervention being evaluated consists of eight 2-hour self-management training sessions. The sessions will be held weekly, over consecutive eight-week periods. The program will be delivered by health professionals and lay leaders who have been trained to conduct the sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will recieve usual care. Usual care in the context of Vocational Rehabilitation refers to any task which may assist a client return to employment. Tasks may include; retraining (up skilling), resume writing, job seeking, pain management, counselling, physiotherapy treatment, case management, functional capacity evaluation. Duration can vary greatly, from 4 weeks through to 12 months+.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary health outcome: Readiness for return-to-work will be evaluated with the Readiness for Return-to-Work (RRTW) scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at four time points: pre-intervention; immediately post intervention; 6 months post intervention; 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary health outcomes: 
(i) The Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) is a reliable measure of the impact of health education and self-management programs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at four time points: pre-intervention; immediately post intervention; 6 months post intervention; 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(ii) Return-to-work (RTW) status will also be employed as a health outcome measure. This will be defined in relation to Australian Government standards.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at four time points: pre-intervention; immediately post intervention; 6 months post intervention; 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(iii) Service and medication use will be collected (including vocational rehabilitation, healthcare, commonwealth services). Service and medication use data will be collected via telephone interview using a specially developed tool.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at four time points: pre-intervention; immediately post intervention; 6 months post intervention; 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(iv) A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted which involves measuring and comparing the costs and outcomes for the two study groups. Cost data will be estimated in relation to each participant's use of various health and vocational rehabilitation services, and any informal care/services they may receive during the study period. This will involve estimating costs to the clients, family members/carers, funders and the Government from their use of the various services and in relation to the time they spent attending the services. Outcomes measures to be used include health efficacy and return-to-work measures. 

In addition, a partial cost-benefit analysis will be conducted. This will not involve valuing the intervention in terms of the participant's 'willingness to pay' for it, but rather the benefits of the intervention will be measured and valued in terms of 'return-to-work' outcomes.  That is, wage rates will be used to value the quantity of paid (and unpaid) work time produced the study groups. This allows the dollar value of the cost of the program to be compared with the dollar value of one aspect of the benefits of the intervention.</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion Criteria: 
(i) Clients will be excluded if they demonstrate signs and symptoms suggestive of a red flag condition (eg tumor, systemic illness, inflammatory disease or infection screened using the criteria outlined in the Evidence based management of acute musculoskeletal pain (Australian Acute Musculoskeletal Pain Guidelines Group).
(ii) Clients whose primary condition is psychiatric

    <concealment>Recruitment and Randomisation: Identification and recruitment will be undertaken by Work Solutions practitioners in the participating clinics. Participation in the study will be voluntary. Volunteers once accepted into the study will be randomised into a treatment group or control group by an independent body, the Qld Clinical Trials Centre, external to the research team and Work Solutions. Randomisation will be within each state (SA and QLD) centre to cater for local conditions of workers compensation schemes and to build groups of 10 for participation in the self-management program. The recruitment period will be over 18 months, a time sufficient, based on the number of clients (participants) cared for in the Work Solutions network, to recruit all subjects for this study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this project a new intervention for the vocational rehabilitation of chronic compensated musculoskeletal disorders will be developed. The intervention will add self-management training to usual care for injured workers who have transitioned from the acute to chronic stage of their musculoskeletal condition. Study participants will be recruited through one of the industry partners, Health Services Australia, a national provider of occupational health services and vocational rehabilitation. The participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited from clinics in Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Tasmania or Adelaide. Participants will be randomised into two study arms: the new model for management or a control group who will receive usual care. Acceptability, effectiveness (job readiness, health efficacy and pain) and the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of the new model compared to usual care will be assessed using tools which have been pre-tested with this target group. 
Aims: 
1.	To develop and document, in care protocols, an intervention which adds self-management to vocational rehabilitation for patients with chronic compensated musculoskeletal disorders.
2.	To test the acceptability of the intervention to patients, their vocational rehabilitation providers, policy makers and regulators through qualitative research with representatives from each group.
3.	To test the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing readiness to return-to-work, health efficacy and pain in a group of patients who receive the intervention and a control group who receive usual care (single blind randomised controlled trial).
4.	To assess the cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefit of the intervention.
Hypotheses: 
1.	That adding self management to vocational rehabilitation will be acceptable to patients, health-care providers, policy makers and regulators.
2.	The proportion of workers who are classified as ready to return-to-work based on a validated scale (the Prepared for action - Self-evaluative or Maintenance-Uncertain or Maintenance-Uncertain category) will be significantly different for those participating in the self-management program. This will be achieved through an improvement in their health efficacy (as defined by the heiQ questionnaire).
3.	Adding self-management to active treatment and vocational rehabilitation will be worthwhile from an efficiency perspective, i.e. the productivity gains from adding the program shall be greater in dollar value than the societal costs of the program.</summary>
