    <interventions>The addition of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture to usual care for chronic low back pain.

All participants will be advised to continue their maintenance programme during the intervention period. This may include any pragmatic management (medications, or non-pharmacological therapy e.g. manual therapy) as directed by any health practitioner (e.g. general practitioner, physiotherapist, chiropractor, or osteopath). 

In addition to usual care as described above, participants will receive either 4 sessions, 7 sessions or 10 sessions of TCM acupuncture:
Arm 1 (n=15): 4 sessions of TCM acupuncture over 2 weeks;
Arm 2 (n=15): 7 sessions of TCM acupuncture over 3.5 weeks;
Arm 3 (n=15): 10 sessions of TCM acupuncture over 5 weeks. 

TCM acupuncture will be performed by a registered acupuncturist. Each participant will be treated with a combination of local and distant points, including BL 23 (Shenshu) and BL 25 (Dachangshu), which are needled bilaterally, low back Ashi points, BL 40 (Weizhong), and KI 3 (Taixi). Additionally, up to four supplementary acupoints for the possible concomitant buttock or leg pain are allowed, which may include BL 36 (Chengfu), BL37 (Yinmen), BL 54 (Zhibian), GB 30 (Huantiao), GB 31 (Fengshi), BL 57 (Chengshan), and BL 60 (Kunlun). 

Treatments will be performed twice weekly. Acupuncture will be administered with the participant in a prone position on the treatment couch. Alcohol swabs will be applied to the skin prior to needle insertion if necessary (e.g. immuno-compromised participants). Sterile filiform, single-used needles (0.25 mm x 40 mm, 0.30 mm x 50 mm, and 0.30 mm x 75 mm, Hwato brand, Suzhou, China) will be used to penetrate the skin. The depth of insertion will depend on the point location, the participants age and physical condition and response to the needles. Selected acupoints will be stimulated manually by gentle rotation of the needles with lift and thrust until the participant achieves a de qi sensation, and then every 5 minutes to ensure de qi is still present. A maximum of 10 needles will be inserted per session and left in place for approximately 20 minutes. Moxibustion and other interventions (e.g. cupping, scraping, and bloodletting) are excluded from this trial. </interventions>
    <comparator>There are 3 treatment groups being compared in this trial, as described in the 'Description of intervention' field above. All groups will receive an active intervention, and therefore none of the groups can be described as the standard, control or comparator.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Back specific function: Roland-Morris disability Questionnaire (RDQ) is used to measure the functional limitations experienced by participants, and the higher the score the more severe the impairment. It consists of 24 items, each addresses the individual's activity limitations due to low back pain (e.g. walking, standing, sitting, bending over, lying down, and other daily activities). </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, completion of intervention, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post randomization. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain intensity: measured by the standard 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), where 0 represents no pain and 100 is the worst pain ever. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, during intervention (pre and post each acupuncture session), completion of intervention, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post randomization.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain bothersomeness: participants will be asked to rate how bothersome their low back pain has been over the past week on a 0 to 10 scale where 0 indicates "not at all bothersome" and 10 "extremely bothersome".</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, completion of intervention, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post randomization.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Generic health status: the Short-Form 12 (SF-12V2TM) is a self-administered questionnaire used to assess the participants health status and quality of life with higher scores indicating a better level of functioning. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Activity disability: restriction of activity due to low back pain is measured with a questionnaire of three separate questions taken from the United States National Health Interview Survey about the number of days spent in bed, lost from work or school or cut down on usual activity during the past week.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, completion of intervention, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post randomization.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction: the simple question, All things considered, how satisfied are you with the care you received? is rated on an eight-point rating scale (1 = extremely satisfied, 2 = very satisfied, 3 = somewhat satisfied, 4 = mixed (approximately equal satisfaction and dissatisfaction), 5 = somewhat dissatisfied, 6 = very dissatisfied, 7 = extremely dissatisfied, 8 = not sure/no opinion). In addition, an open-ended question regarding participants comments on acupuncture treatment will be obtained. </outcome>
      <timepoint>On completion of intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse reactions: an adverse reaction is described as any undesired harmful sign, symptom or disease (e.g. needle-site pain, hematoma, or skin infection) resulting from acupuncture, which could reasonably be related to the procedure. Participants will be asked about any adverse reaction experienced from the previous session at each visit and 1 week after the final acupuncture needling session. Detailed information about the adverse reaction will be recorded on an adverse reaction form. </outcome>
      <timepoint>During intervention, and 1 week after the final acupuncture needling session.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the Dunedin community through posting flyers about the study around the university campus, community centres, waiting rooms in medical centres and in the School of Physiotherapy Clinics, as well as advertisements in university staff newsletters, local newspapers and social networking sites as appropriate.

Interested participants will be asked to contact the clinical research administrator for further information, and will be provided with the Information Sheet regarding the study procedure. If still interested, they will make the first appointment for a visit to the School of Physiotherapy. At this appointment, the participant will undergo a screening procedure to confirm the final eligibility for participation. The rationale of the treatment and any questions from participants will be explained in detail by the Primary Investigator before written informed consent is obtained. 

To ensure concealment of allocation from the Primary Investigator, who will determine eligibility of participants for entry in the trial, sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelops will be used. </concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation will be via a computer-generated random allocation sequence prepared prior to participant enrolment.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>As this study is a preliminary study to inform the feasibility of a powered randomized controlled trial, no sample size calculation has been carried out. Based on the results of a previous study, a sample size of 30 participants is considered appropriate and achievable in accordance with the time limitation. Taking into account the potential for withdrawal or incomplete data may be 30%, it is anticipated that 45 participants will be recruited.

Primary outcomes will be measured by summarising the relevant data at the end of the study. Secondary outcomes will be analysed using SPSS (version 22.0) on an intention-to-treat basis. Since this is a feasibility study, tests for significance will not be performed. Data will be reported as mean +/- standard deviation. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare pre-test and post-test mean scores between groups with the baseline outcome measure as the covariate. The Mann-Whitney U-test will be used to establish the differences between groups for difficulty in questionnaires completion, patient satisfaction and adverse reactions. In addition, a power analysis will be completed using the minimum clinically important change of 2.5 points between groups on the Roland-Morris disability Questionnaire (RDQ) scale, at an alpha of 0.05 and power of 90%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pragmatic parallel three-armed randomized controlled feasibility study to provide the rationale for and method to be used for a full scale trial.

Forty-five participants with chronic low back pain will be recruited from the Dunedin community, and randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to receive usual care plus either 4 sessions (n=15), 7 sessions (n=15), or 10 sessions (n=15) of acupuncture interventions. Primary outcomes include the acceptability of and adherence to different numbers of sessions of acupuncture treatment for chronic low back pain, and the feasibility of the recruitment approaches and completion of the outcome measures specific to the trial. Secondary outcomes include back specific function, pain intensity and bothersomeness, generic health status, activity disability, and patient satisfaction. Follow up questionnaires will be collected at discharge, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post randomization. 

The information obtained from this feasibility study will inform the decision to conduct a full-scale randomized controlled trial to definitively test the dose dependence of acupuncture. Findings will add to the current (limited) body of high quality evidence that is available on the optimal number of sessions of acupuncture in the management of chronic low back pain as well as being clinically relevant to clinicians, researchers, and policy makers.</summary>
