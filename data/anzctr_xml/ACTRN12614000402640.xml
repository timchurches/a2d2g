  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 12 week dietary intervention where participants fast (reduction to 25% of normal calorie intake) on 2 days each week.  The group will be randomised so that half fast on consecutive days each and the other half may chose any 2 days to fast within each 7 day period.  The participants will be provided with example meal plans for fasting days but no food is provided in this study.  Diet diaries are to be used at the start and end of the study period.  A pre-defined medication adjustment protocol will be used to adjust glucose lowering medications on fasting days.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is an active controlled study with 2 arms; one arm will fast on consecutive days within a week, whilst the other arm will fast on any 2 days within a 7 day period.  The participants will be provided with example meal plans for fasting days but no food is provided in this study.  Diet diaries are to be used at the start and end of the study period</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effectiveness of medication adjustment protocol on frequency of hypoglycaemia assessed through weekly contact with a research nurse.  Frequency of hypoglycaemia will be recorded through regular participant use of glucose meters, and self monitoring of glucose levels when symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia develop.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure between baseline readings and those at 12 weeks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in HbA1c, cholesterol profile, ghrelin, leptin measured on fasting blood samples taken at baseline and 12 weeks</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be identified from diabetes clinics at our local diabetes centre.  Informed consent will be obtained, and participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to one of the 2 previously described treatment arms.  Randomisation will be performed through the use of sealed opaque envelopes prepared by one of the study investigators.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sealed envelopes will be prepared by a study investigator with other investigators blinded to their contents.  Half of the envelopes will contain a statement that the participant is to be allocated to consecutive days fasting, whilst the other half will contain a statement that the participant is to be allocated to non consecutive days fasting.  At randomisation, each participant will select an envelope.  Both participant and study investigator will be unaware of the envelopes contents prior to opening.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We wish to confirm that the standard deviations of weight and HbA1c are as anticipated (20kg for weight and 10 mmol/mol for HbA1c based on published dietary intervention studies) and to estimate those for gut-peptide physiology variables. These standard deviations will be used to calculate sample size for a definitive randomised controlled study of this intervention.  The study design has 20 participants in each group.  This gives adequate degrees of freedom to determine the standard deviation of the main measurements and also will give reasonable precision to determine the tolerability of the diet with a margin of error of about plus or minus 15%.</statisticalmethods>
