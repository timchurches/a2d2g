  <interventions>
    <interventions>23 week randomised end-point blinded, controlled parallel study comparing Nicotinic Acid Prolonged Release (PR) orally daily (titrated to a maximum dose of 1500mg) with a No Nicotinic Acid PR group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Nicotinic Acid PR will commence at 500mg orally daily at bedtime and be titrated at weeks 5 and 9 to 1000mg and 1500mg respectively, according to the subjects maximum tolerated dose. The maximum tolerated dose will not exeed 1500mg orally daily. If a subject is unable to tolerate an increased dose level due to skin flushing episodes, their dose will be decreased back to the preceding dosel level. If a subject is unable to tolerate Nicotinic Acid PR 500mg orally daily, they will be withdrawn for the study. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with diabetes and atherogenic dyslipidaemia who are treated with statin medication may still be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and may require combination lipid regulating therapy to further reduce their risk. Endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness are present in early diabetic vascular disease and may be useful surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular risk. This 23 week, randomised single-blind, controlled, parallel group study in 50 participants with diabetes who have endothelial dysfunction despite optimal statin therapy, aims to investigate whether the addition of Nicotinic Acid Prolonged Release (titrated to a maximum dose of 1500mg orally daily) compared to a control group of no Nicotinic Acid Prolonged Release (Nicotinic Acid PR) improves endothelial dysfunction.</summary>
