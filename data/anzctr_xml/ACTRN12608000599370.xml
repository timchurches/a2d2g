  <interventions>
    <interventions>graduated three layer straight tubular bandaging system which consists of an elastic tubular bandage that is often used as a support bandage. 
In this study the investigational product will be used in graduated lengths of 3 layers of the tubular bandage system as follows: 
1.	from base of toes to just under knee (long layer)
2.	from base of toes to above calf pump (medium layer)
3.	from base of toes to mid gaiter (short layer)
participants will be bandaged weekly for 12 weeks and will keep this bandage on between treatment visits.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard short stretch compression bandaging system consists of:
1.	A padding layer 
2.	10cm inelastic short stretch compression bandage
3.	A tubular stocking. 
All layers of standard compression therapy will be applied from base of toes to just under the knee. Participants will be bandaged weekly for 12 weeks and will keep this bandage on between treatment visits.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess rate of percentage reduction of wound size from baseline compared to week 12 following randomisation. Wound size will be measured with planimetry wound measurement system Visitrak wound tracing: The ulcer outline will be traced and the ulcer area calculated to determine ulcer size</outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be assessed at baseline and end of treatment period at 12 weeks following randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the proportion of ulcers healed within the trial period. Complete healing is defined as full 100% epithelialisation or skin closure without drainage based on clinical assessment and digital photo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>end of treatment period at 12 weeks following randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life will be measured with SF 36 and Cardiff Wound Impact Schedue</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, end of 12 week treatment and at 3 month follow up</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of treatment related adverse events. Examples of an adverse event include:
1.	Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
2.	New conditions detected or diagnosed after graduated three layer straight tubular bandaging system administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Serious Adverse Event: A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
1.	Results in death
2.	Is life threatening (i.e. the study participant is at immediate risk of death at the time the event occurred; it does not refer to an event which might have caused death had it been more severe)
3.	Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
4.	Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
and serious adverse events. Serious adverse events will be assessed by site invetigator</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be randomised to receive either control or intervention group using a central computer generated random number generated by using a central computer generated randomisation sequence.
The randomization code will be sent to the Investigator (or designee) who will prepare treatments according to the randomisation code. 

To decrease bias and confounders the decision to accept or reject a participant will be made using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be obtained by participant without knowing the next assignment in the sequence. Independent clinicians will apply compression bandage systems according to the computer generated list allocation. The code will be revealed to the researchers once the recruitment, data collection and wound measurement analysis are completed. The allocation list will be stored within the Clinical Informatics and Data Management Centre of the Department of Epidemiology and Preventative Medicine (DEPM).</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be stratefied by study site and wound size. Patients will be randomised to receive either control or intervention group using a central computer generated randomisation sequence.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Venous disease is the most common cause of leg ulcers. The refractory nature of venous ulcers affects the quality of life and work productivity of those persons afflicted. This, in combination with the high costs of long-term therapy, makes venous ulcers a major health problem in developed countries. Management of venous leg ulcers is based on understanding pathophysiologic abnormalities. In recent years, identifying prognostic factors for healing and developing novel therapeutic approaches for venous ulcers have offered valuable tools for the management of patients with this disorder.
 
Compression increases ulcer healing rates compared with no compression. Multi-layered systems are more effective than single-layered systems. High compression is more effective than low compression but there are no clear differences in the effectiveness of different types of high compression(1).
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of graduated three layer straight tubular bandaging when compared to 4 layer compression bandaging in healing venous ulcers in patients with chronic venous ulceration.</summary>
