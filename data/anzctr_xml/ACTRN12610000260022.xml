  <interventions>
    <interventions>1 ml of 66% oral sucrose as a single dose is offered to the infant prior to the procedure and if sucrose remains, throughout the procedure. The speed of giving the sucrose depends on the infants eagerness to suckle. Most infants are expected to suckle the whole amount of sucrose within 30-60 seconds.The procedure commences EXACTLY 2 minutes after the giving of sucrose commences.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Alder Hey Pain score difference of more than 1.3 points</outcome>
      <timepoint>Procedure commences 2 minutes after sucrose commenced, pain score is assessed continuos from begin until end of procedure. Maximum pain score at any stage during procedure is recorded. Expected time of procedure is expected to vary between 30 seconds (heel prick) to 5 minutes ( placement of intravenous access device)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedure successfull/unsuccessful is defined by achievement of initial intent: 
'iv'- successful: placement of an intravenous access device( device in situ and patent)
'heel prick'-successful: obtained blood sample intended with one heel prick
'phlebotomy"- successful: obtained intended blood test with one phlebotomy attempt</outcome>

    <sequence>computer randomisation in batches. The computer randomly allocates  consecutive numbers to either group 'A' or group 'B'. These series of  codes are given to pharmacy who replace 'A' and 'B' with 24% or 66% sucrose and prepare sucrose doses accordingly. The patients and all investigators are blinded to the sucrose concentration , pharmacy is blinded to the outcome.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children aged 0-3 month presenting to a participating emergency department and have been found to require medically indicated interventions ( placement of an intravenous access device, phlebotomy, heel prick) are enrolled after parental consent. After consent , patients will receive 1 ml of a study drug ( either 1 ml of 24% sucrose or 1ml of 66% sucrose). This is offered by a nurse to the infant who is encouraged to suckle on a pacifier or glove and is swaddled by a parent or caregiver at the same time. 2 minutes after the sucrose commenced, the procedure commences. During the procedure the attending nurse scores the maximum pain response as measured by Alder Hey pain score</summary>
