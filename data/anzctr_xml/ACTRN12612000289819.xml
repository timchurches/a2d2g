  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with cirrhosis frequently experience painful muscle cramps which can affect the hands, legs, feet, neck, back, sides and abdomen. They may last for several hours, often occur at night and may require opiates or presentation to accident and emergency to control the pain.
The available therapies have limited efficacy. This study aims to determine the efficacy of oral taurine supplementation in reducing the frequency and intensity of painful muscle cramps in this group. It is a randomised control, crossover, blinded study where participants will receive either taurine supplements or placebo for a period of one month and then cross over to the other group. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about muscle cramps prior to entering the study, at the cross over (1 month after entry) and at completion of the study. Participants will be asked to keep a diary of cramps prior to entry into the study and for the duration of the study. In addition to the usual blood taken when attending clinic, a small amount of blood will be taken for amino acid analysis, taurine in particular, and TNF and IL-6</summary>
