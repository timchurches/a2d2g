Experimental: Post-operative knee replacement - Subjects that have had a hemi knee replacement of one knee at least 8 weeks ago had the post-operative knee scanned using the orthopedic hip application and the Lunar orthopedic knee application.


Treatment: devices: iDXA knee software
Following surgery, subjects who have undergone knee arthroplasty will have the knee that has undergone arthroplasty (post-operative) scanned at least 8 weeks after surgery.
During one visit, each subject will have the post-operative knee scanned 1 time using Lunar orthopedic application, and 3 times with the subject repositioned between scans using the Lunar orthopedic knee application (total of 4 scans). Lunar iDXA measurement procedures will be done
