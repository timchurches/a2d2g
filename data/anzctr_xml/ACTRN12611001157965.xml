  <interventions>
    <interventions>For the first 48 hours from the start of surgery, participants undergoing elective bowel resection will have their perioperative fluid management guided by a urine output target of 0.2 ml/kg/h. If a particpant's urine output falls below this limit, they will bolused with 500mls of intravenous fluid over 15 minutes to raise their urine output above the required target. Their urine output will be checked hourly and the processed repeated should it fall below the required target.</interventions>
    <comparator>For the first 48 hours from the start of surgery, participants undergoing elective bowel resection will have their perioperative fluid management guided by a urine output target of 0.5 ml/kg/h. If their urine output falls below this target they will be treated in the same way as the intervention group.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be approached at the time of their preoperative outpatient clinic. They will be given the Particiant Information Sheet and contacted after about a week to discuss the study further and decide whether they wish to be enrolled.

Participants will be randomised at the time of induction of anaesthesia. Assessors of the primary outcome will be blinded for group allocation, while the patient and clinical team cannot be blinded for logistical reasons.

Participants are randomised (allocation concealment by off-site randomisation by Macro Randomisation Module (MacroTM EDM, InferMed, London, UK) over the internet at induction of anaesthesia.</concealment>
    <sequence>The standard release of MACRO 3.0.50 (the EDC system being used) supports block randomisations to be set up for a study using stratification values. In our case, we will use renal function greater or less than 90ml/min/1.73m2 for stratification purposes.</sequence>
