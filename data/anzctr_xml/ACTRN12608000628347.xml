  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exposure involves receiving a screening questionnaire to complete in a pharmacy, and , having this questionnaire examined by a trained pharmacist immediately after completion, if identified at high risk of having/developing sleep disorder, completing a sleep diary log for every night for 2 weeks and a sleep home study using a nasal flow monitoring device for 3 consecutive night on any 3 consecutive nights during which the sleep log is being recorded. This recording will be done only once within the duration of the project. If at the time of screening,  there is no risk, simple counselling on healthy sleep practices will be provided.
The nasal airflow device is called the FlowWizardÂ® will be delivered directly to the patients house via express post, if the pharmacist determines that the patient needs further screening. 

It will take about five minutes to set up and is comfortable for
all night use. It will record for three nights. After use, the recorder is returned to the Woolcock Institute
of Medical Research via self-addressed postal pack for
immediate analysis.
A simple and clear report is then sent to via email/express letter to the pharmacist who can then attach this to their overall report to the General Practitioner (GP) nominated by patient to pharmacist who can then make a decision on what
other testing may be required for the patient or what type of treatment (if
any) should be started or if further referral to a sleep physician is needed.
Scientific information about the Flow Wizard appears in text below.
The FlowWizard is a single channel sleep apnea diagnostic device. A set of nasal pressure cannula are placed over the nostrils, and recordings can be made of airflow (breathing) are sampled for up to three 9-hour periods. The device is lightweight and can be despatched and returned in the post. Data stored in the device can be downloaded to a computer for automatic scoring to estimate the number of respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) per hour. The device is TGA-approved.</interventions>
    <comparator>Screening using a questionnaire only- the questionnaires are assessed by a trained pharmacist immediately or as soon as possible after the patient completes them. The pharmacist determines the risk of the patient having or being at risk of a sleep disorder and provides a referral to a physician or if there is no risk, simple counselling on healthy sleep practices. The pharmacist counsels on one occassion - for the control group this will be on the day of the screening and for the intervention group the counselling may occur either on the day of the screening or 15 days later when patients have completed a sleep diary and have results from the FlowWizard screening. The patient will be followed in both groups after 3 months to pursue outcomes of referral or counselling, and if there are no outcomes yet(eg awaiting specialist appointments etc), the patients will be followed after another 2 months (total follow up time = 5 months).</comparator>

    <designfeatures>Pharmacies supplying CPAP equipment in NSW/ACT will be approached using a conveniene approach. Once ~20 are recruited, they will be randomised either to a basic screening(control) arm or a comprehensive arm( intervention). They will be offered training.


Following a training, all pharmacists will be provided with promotional materials. Posters will target people with symptoms and risk factors for sleep disorders, and invite them to talk to their pharmacist. Collaborative initiatives between pharmacy and other health care professionals will be set up at this stage. The Sleep Awareness Campaign will be run for three months. This will help in patuent self selecting to partcyipate. If this process does not manage to recruit sufficient numbers of patients, pharmacists will also be asked to invite all adult patients who have a dispensed medication history for any medications related to cardiovascular symptoms, diabetes, asthma, rhinitis or COPD (a checklist of medications will be provided to pharmacists). Patients inquiring about products to help fatigue and energy levels or weight reduction will also be invited to participate in the study.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep disorders are a significant public health issue in Australia. The direct health care costs of sleep disorders account for only 2% of their estimated economic impact ($10.3 billion)  which suggests that there may be too little investment in the prevention and treatment of sleep disorders.  
 In a first of its kind, this project proposes to conduct a screening and awareness program to be run through community pharmacies by specially trained pharmacists. Further, the project aims to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of two sleep health models in the community pharmacy setting; a basic online screening tool for identification of sleep disorders versus a more comprehensive sleep screening and sleep health program for the diagnosis and reduction of patient risk factor profile for developing sleep disorders. 

Through the participation of pharmacists, patients with sleep disorders will have improved access to information about the diagnosis, treatment and management of their conditions, especially in rural settings. The increased awareness and education about sleep health amongst pharmacists and the general public will allow for improved identification of sleep disorders and disease management, and lead to cost savings for patients, providers and the health care system. Given previous success of pharmacy based screening and intervention programs by the research team, the project has a high likelihood of success, and will deliver very valuable outcomes. 

This will be the first project to test the effectiveness of community pharmacies as an alternative health care site for the improvement of sleep health outcomes in Australia, and one of the first globally.</summary>
