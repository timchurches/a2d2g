  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Gamma3 Intramedullary Nails (Stryker)
Treatment: surgery - Sliding Hip Screws

Active Comparator: 1 - Gamma3 Intramedullary Nails

Active Comparator: 2 - Sliding Hip Screws


Treatment: surgery: Gamma3 Intramedullary Nails (Stryker)
The Gamma3 nail is cannulated for Guide-Wire-controlled insertion, and features a conical tip for optimal alignment with the inner part of the cortical bone. A single distal Locking Screw is provided to stabilize the nail in the medullary canal and to help to prevent rotation in complex fractures.

Treatment: surgery: Sliding Hip Screws
The sliding hip screw is a single larger diameter partially threaded screw, which is affixed to the proximal femur with a side plate (with a minimum of two holes and a maximum of four holes) and no supplemental fixation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>

             femur.

          7. Operative treatment within 7 days after the trauma.(Operative treatment should take
             place as soon as possible as permitted by each institution's standard of care.)

          7. Patients with a pathologic fracture.

          8. Patients with a reverse oblique fracture pattern, fracture AO Type 31-A3.

         10. Off-label use of the implant.

         11. Patients with a previous history of frank dementia that would interfere with
             assessment of the primary outcome (i.e., EQ-5D at 1 year).

         12. Likely problems, in the judgment of the Site Investigators, with maintaining
             follow-up. We will, for example, exclude patients with no fixed address, those who
             report a plan to move out of town in the next year, or intellectually challenged
             patients without adequate family support.

         13. Patient is enrolled in another ongoing drug or surgical intervention trial.

         14. If the attending surgeon believes that there is another reason to exclude this patient
             from INSITE. This reason will be documented on the case report forms (CRFs).</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of Gamma3 intramedullary nails versus
      sliding hip screws on health-related quality of life as measured by the EuroQuol-5D at 52
      weeks in individuals with trochanteric fractures. Secondary outcomes include revision surgery
      rates, fracture healing rates, fracture related adverse events, and health-related quality of
      life, including the Parker mobility score and Harris Hip Score.</summary>
