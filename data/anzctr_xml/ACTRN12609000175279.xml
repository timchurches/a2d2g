  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of overweight/obesity is currently exploding with over 60% of Australian adults in this category, leading to a rapid increase in diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Increased dairy consumption has been demonstrated to significantly benefit weight loss. Initially, it was thought that diary calcium was the reason for these health benefits, but recent studies have shown that this is not the case. Attention is now focused to other dairy components, such as dairy proteins. Although there is no clinical evidence in humans to support this, exciting new research from animal studies have shown that dairy whey-protein isolate (WPI) can reduce body weight, lower plasma lipids, improve, blood pressure and insulin action. There is an urgent need to provide the scientific evidence to clarify whether the protein component is responsible for the observed association between dairy consumption and body weight. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate whether prolonged, chronic consumption of WPI will promote weight loss and improve CVD risk factors in the overweight/obese. The hypothesis for this study was that consumption of dairy whey-protein isolate will improve cardiovascular health/metabolic syndrome by reducing plasma lipids, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, inflammatory markers, enhanced glucose tolerance, endothelial function and insulin action.</summary>
