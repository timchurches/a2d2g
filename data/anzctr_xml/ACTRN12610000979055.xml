    <studytitle>Exercise or advice after ankle fracture</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients after immobilisation for ankle fracture, is a rehabilitation program consisting of exercises prescribed by physiotherapists more effective than a single session of advice in reducing activity limitation and improving quality-adjusted life years?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the treatment (rehabilitation) group will receive the advice intervention (see control treatment for details) plus participate in a program that is designed, monitored and progressed by a physiotherapist. The focus of this program is exercise. Three types of exercises will be prescribed - ankle mobility and strengthening exercises, stepping exercises, and exercises involving weight bearing and balancing on the affected leg. Participants will receive about five treatments (one or two treatment sessions in the first week then one session per week for the next 3 weeks). The first session will take up to 60 minutes and the subsequent sessions will take up to 30 minutes. Participants will be encouraged to perform a carefully structured exercise program at home between physiotherapy appointments, which they will record in an exercise diary.

The exact number of treatments and the timing of discharge are not mandated by the trial protocol. Participants will be discharged by their physiotherapists when they return to their previous level of function, reach a plateau in their progress, or choose to discontinue treatment.

Participants will also receive gait training and ongoing advice about returning to their usual work and leisure activities. Other physiotherapy interventions (e.g. manual therapy and passive stretching) may be administered in conjunction with the exercise program if deemed appropriate.

Where it is deemed appropriate, participants will be instructed to use ice for pain relief and compression and elevation for management of swelling. A compression bandage (i.e. tubigrip) will be provided if required.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the control group will receive the advice intervention. Advice will be provided in a single session in the fracture clinic, after cessation of immobilisation. A physiotherapist will instruct the participant to do exercises that focus on ankle movement in non-weight-bearing positions and will explain how to perform these exercises and how to progressively reduce the use of any walking aids at home. The advice session should be no longer than 10 minutes. The participant will be given a handout that summarises this advice with text and figures.
