    <exclusivecriteria>1. Baseline transcutaneous carbon dioxide of greater than or equal to 60mmHg
2. FEV1:FVC ratio &gt;0.7
3. Age under 16 years 
4. A diagnosis of bronchiectasis
5. Morbid obesity (with a body mass index of greater than or equal to 40)
6. Inability to match FEV1 percentage predicted to a participant that took part in the bronchiectasis oxygen study* 
7. Any other condition which, at the investigators discretion, is believed may present a safety risk or impact the feasibility of the study or the study results.

*This study is designed to allow for comparison of results to a study of similar design in patients with bronchiectasis (ACTRN12615000971538). Participants will therefore be matched by FEV1 to the participants in the bronchiectasis study (the COPD participant must have an FEV1 percentage predicted within an absolute value of 5% of the FEV1 percentage predicted for the bronchiectasis patient (values inclusive)). An exception to this is for the three bronchiectasis participants that had FEV1 percentage predicted values of 109% or higher, who are to be matched with COPD participants with an FEV1 percent predicted of 80% or over (i.e. participants in the mildest COPD severity category based on FEV1).</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Following explanation of the trial and consent, participants will be assessed for eligibility. If eligible, participants will be randomised to the order of interventions (21% oxygen and 50% oxygen). Allocation will be concealed using sealed opaque envelopes, opened at the time of randomisation. The unblinded investigator will make available the gas bottles and bags (containing either 21% or 50% oxygen) in the randomised order. The labels on the bottles will be covered to maintain the blinding of blinded investigator (who will record outcome data) and the participant. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study directly relates to the trial 
ACTRN12614000361606. As there is concern regarding the accuracy of the data collected by the specific transcutaneous probes used with that study (measuring carbon dioxide, oxygen levels and heart rate), the study is being repeated using a Sentec transcutaneous monitor. The Ethics approval number and UTN remain the same, however ANZCTR required a new trial registration number. Two new outcome measures have been added (end tidal carbon dioxide, to further assess the mechanisms behind any change in carbon dioxide, and drift corrected carbon dioxide (a function of the Sentec monitor to improve accuracy)). In addition, an arteriolised blood gas will be performed at the end of the study to validate the Sentec.

Oxygen therapy has been shown to increase carbon dioxide in the blood of patients with certain respiratory conditions. This study aims to find out if oxygen therapy increases carbon dioxide levels in patients with COPD, and compare data to that from patients with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. </summary>
