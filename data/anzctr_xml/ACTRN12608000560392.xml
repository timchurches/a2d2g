  <interventions>
    <interventions>nasal surgery :turbinoplasty
patients sedated with phentanyl 1.5 microgram/kg and midazolam 50 microgram/kg then with nasal endoscopy a sagital incision is made along anterior face of middle turbinate then straight forceps are used to remove the contents within the middle turbinate including internal mucosa.in the next step lateral and medial surfaces of middle concha approximate together so in addition to releive contact points,the middle concha becomes smaller.this is a simple endoscopic procedure  estimated one hour to complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>medical treatment with drugs:
fluticazone nasal spray(50mg,50microgm/puff) 2 puffs every 24 hours

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Headaches is extremely common and the etiologic factors are quite varied. Rhinogenic headache has recognized for many years. Contact points headaches are one of the subgroups of rhinogenic headaches. Any pneumatization of the hanging portion of the middle turbinate is classified as concha bullosa and has seen in 34% of patients with sinusitis and 15.9% of normal people. Prevalence of bilateral middle turbinate bullosa is reported in 16_45% of people. Middle turbinate bullosa can contact to the septum or the lateral nasal wall in the osteomeatal complex region so it may cause rhinogenic headache. This study has done to evaluate the efficacy of turbinoplasty in the treatment of rhinogenic headaches which caused by concha bullosa of middle turbinate.
 The study was conducted between the years 2001 to 2006 on 44 patients with periorbital or frontal headaches caused by concha bullosa who divided into two equal groups at random. One group was treated by surgical therapy and other group was treated by medical therapy and efficacy of two methods compared by visual analog scale in 1.5,3,6 months after operation.</summary>
