Blinded investigator will randomly select a pre-packed, numbered envelope containing two bottles of study medications (one bottle containing active medication, one bottle containing placebo which are marked as bottle A or bottle B and packed by a research staff not involved in this study), and this will be allocated to the participant and recorded in study medication logs.  </concealment>
    <sequence>block randomisation (half of the group getting placebo first, half of the group getting active medication first) was used in packing by non-investigator, followed by random allocation by a blinded investigator </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>According to a study, a sample size of 5 is required to show a significance at 0.05 with 80% power to detect change in BAT activity. 8-9 of 12 subjects is anticipated to be BAT positive, which will allow the effect of drug intervention to be examined. The sample size was further adjusted for a drop-out rate of 10% at each time point.
Paired t-test will be used to analyse the changes in study outcomes at each time point mentioned. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Brown fat, unlike ordinary 'white' fat , functions like  generators, burning fat to produce heat and dissipate energy.  Brown fat protects animals against cold and from developing obesity.  In humans it was previously believed that brown fat disappears after infancy. However, research including our own has shown that brown fat is present in most if not all adult humans and is located mainly around the neck. Brown fat activity in humans is detected by a PET scan based on uptake of glucose that is tagged with a small amount of radioactivity. This is a widely used diagnostic method in medicine. 
Brown fat is more abundant in lean than in obese individuals. Stimulating its activity may be a simple way of controlling body weight in humans. Apart from the cold exposure, very little is known about what can activate brown fat in humans. Our research aims to identify agents that can activate brown fat in humans. 
Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced from the adrenal glands. In animals, it was found that aldosterone suppresses the activity of brown fat and blocking aldosterone action by a medication called spironolactone increases brown fat activity. 
In this study, we will study the regulation of brown fat activity by spironolactone in humans and its metabolic significance
