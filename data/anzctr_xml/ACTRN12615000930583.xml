  <interventions>
    <interventions>Capsule containing 200 mg isoflavones (SoyLife 40) taken once daily for two menstrual cycles. Participants were asked to return unused capsules at each study visit in order for compliance to be monitored.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo capsule containing maltodextrin.
If in the positive control group of oral contraceptive users, any monophasic combined oral contraceptive could be used as long as it had been used for at least 3 months prior to entering the study. Contraceptive pill users were assigned placebo only due to the possibility of active treatment reducing efficacy of contraception.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aggression measured using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Across four phases of the menstrual cycle on any of the days included in that phase: menses (days 1-5), follicular phase (days 6-11), ovulatory phase (days 12-16), luteal phase (days 20-26) over two consecutive menstrual cycles, following a baseline cycle. Phase timings were calculated based on a 28 day cycle, where participants did not have a 28 day cycle the following formula was applied to estimate cycle phase:

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive function assessed using the COMPASS cognitive testing battery. The domains of working memory, executive function, secondary memory, attention and reaction time were assessed using the following tasks: immediate and delayed word recall; word recognition; picture recognition; corsi blocks forward and reversed; N-back; alphabetic and numeric working memory; simple, choice and four choice reaction time; sentence verification; peg and ball; card sorting; rapid visual information processing (RVIP); serial subtractions.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cognition and aggression were assessed during four phases of the menstrual cycle across one baseline cycle with no treatment, followed by two cycles with either 200 mg isoflavones daily or placebo. A comparison group of long term oral contraceptive users were also included and received only placebo during the treatment cycles. Brain activity was measured using electroencephalography (EEG) during the baseline and second treatment cycles.</summary>
