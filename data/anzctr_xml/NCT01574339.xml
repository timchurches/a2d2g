Treatment: devices: EndoStim LES Stimulation System
The EndoStim LES Stimulation System comprises three components: an electrical stimulation lead, an implantable pulse generator (IPG) and an external programmer.
The IPG and stimulation lead are to be implanted within the subject's body using conventional laparoscopy. The device programmer is to be used by the study investigator and/or a company technical representative.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Safety Endpoint - Safety will be assessed by incidence and severity of adverse events through 6 months follow-up. Included in this assessment will be the proportion of subjects with any of the following outcomes between device implant and completion of the month 6 evaluation: (1) death, or (2) medical morbidity associated with the device and/or implantation procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Efficacy Endpoints - Change in patient's GERD-HRQL from baseline to 6 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Efficacy Endpoints - Baseline pH values of % 24-hour esophageal pH&lt; 4.0, and number of reflux events &gt;1minute and &gt;5 minute duration with the same on-stimulation pH parameters at 6 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Efficacy Endpoints - Change in symptoms frequency and severity at 6 months Vs. baseline as measured by patient symptom diary and patients quality of life measured by SF- 12.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Efficacy Endpoints - Change in antisecretory medication use as evaluated during the two weeks prior to the month 6 follow up compared to baseline.</outcome>
