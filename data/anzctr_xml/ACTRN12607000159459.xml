  <interventions>
    <interventions>18-week, unsupervised  home-based progressive walking program performed at the convenience of paticipants schedule.

Feasibility trial. 
No control group. 
Two treatment groups:

Group 1: 18-week walking program, 3 days per week, starting with 1500 steps in the first week and finishing with 6000 steps by week 18, and 18-week oral glucosamine sulphate supplementation (1500 mg daily)

Group 2: 18-week walking program, 5 days per week, starting with 1500 steps in the first week and finishing with 6000 steps by week 18, and 18-week oral glucosamine sulphate supplementation (1500 mg daily)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of a walking program, especially the dose of walking necessary to elicit clinically significant improvements in well-being among individuals aged 40 to 75 years with early osteoarthritis (OA) and test whether walking combined with glucosamine offers improvements. Improvements in well-being are defined as reductions in pain, stiffness, depression and anxiety and increases in functional ability, and self-efficacy towards exercise.</summary>
