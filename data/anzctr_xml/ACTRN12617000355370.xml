  <interventions>
    <interventions>Local Acupuncture Group - This treatment group will receive routine care consisting of 5 minutes of scar massage, and a hand-out with general self-management, exercise and post-treatment management advice that has been specifically designed for this trial..
They will also receive 15 minutes of acupuncture treatment applied at 2cm intervals  locally around their scar with needle stimulation via bidirectional rotation at 5 and 10 minutes and immediately prior to needle removal.
Treatment will consist of 6 treatments over 4 weeks (2 per week for 2 weeks then 1 per week for 2 weeks).
Acupuncture treatment will be provided by a physiotherapist with 11years experience in private practice physiotherapy including 10 years dry needling and 2 years western acupuncture experience.</interventions>
    <comparator>Distant Acupuncture Group - This treatment group will receive routine care consisting of 5 minutes of scar massage, a hand-out with general self-management, exercise and post-treatment management advice, which is the same as the intervention group.
They will receive 15 minutes of acupuncture treatment with needles placed at distant points in the body that have no neuroanatomical links to the scar being treated. They will receive the same number of needles based on scar size as the intervention group. Needles will be stimulated at 5 and 10 minutes and immediately prior to removal via bidirectional rotation.
Acupuncture treatment points for this group have been selected so that they do not share any neuroanatomical links (eg. spinal segmental nerve innervation). For scars above the umbilicus the following points will be used: bilaterally: 2cm lateral to the spinous process of L3 and L4, midline of the posterior leg 5cm below the knee crease and 5 and 10cm above the knee crease. For scars below the umbilicus the following points will be used bilaterally: 1cm lateral to the spinous process of C7 and T2, the posterior surface of the arm at 5 and 8cm above the elbow and midway down the forearm. If more than 10 needles are required based on scar size measurements, then additional needles will be placed at 2cm intervals from the points used in the limbs, and recorded for consistency between treatments. 
Acupuncture treatment will be provided by a physiotherapist with 11years experience in private practice physiotherapy including 10 years dry needling and 2 years western acupuncture experience.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project will investigate the effect of physiotherapy treatments massage and acupuncture/dry needling on the symptoms of scars such as pain and itch.
This study will provide treatment for symptomatic scars. It aims to assess change in scar symptoms over a four week period, with follow up at one and two months after that time. This will help us to evaluate these methods are for treating scar symptoms, and guide future treatment improvements.
Participants will be randomly divided into two groups, both groups will receive scar massage, acupuncture and advice on self-massage, stretching and exercising. The only difference between the two groups will be the type of acupuncture/dry needling. 
During the study participants will be asked to complete surveys regarding their scar, and general wellbeing. They will also be asked to complete these one and two months after completion of physical treatments, and return the surveys by post or email.
We expect that the scar being treated may show changes in physical characteristics and symptoms, but this is not guaranteed as everyone responds differently to treatment. The outcomes of the research may guide treatment of future patients with scars.</summary>
