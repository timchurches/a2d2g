1 - Patients diagnosed with AAA who are considered candidates for Endovascular Repair and meet the study eligibility criteria and sign the Informed consent may be subsequently enrolled in the study.


Treatment: devices: Nellix Endovascular Aneurysm Sealing System (Nellix速-System)
The Nellix system is comprised of two independent flow channels, one to each iliac artery. Each flow channel consists of a balloon-expanded ePTFE covered stent surrounded by a Polymer-filled EndoBag which fills the blood lumen within the aorta, and seals the aneurysm from side-branch flow.
