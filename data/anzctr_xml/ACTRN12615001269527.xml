    <interventions>12-week exercise and lifestyle management
3 x sessions per week for 12 weeks of exercise. Week 1 through 6 is an aerobic only programme, weeks 7 - 12 are a combined aerobic and resistance training programme. sessions range in duration from a minimum of 20min to a maximum of 50mins dependent on each individuals capacity determined during the baseline assessment and as they progress through the 12 weeks. Intensity is based on an RPE on the borg scale between 13 and 16. Sessions are individually prescribed but participants attend as a group. All exercise sessions are supervised by a clinical exercise physiologist and participants are monitored before, during and 5min post exercise [heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation].
6 education sessions on topics decided by the participants that they feel is relevant to their health. Sessions are 1 hour in duration and occur at fortnightly intervals facilitated in a classroom setting in most cases by appropriately qualified and experienced individuals from the community. A register of attendance records adherence.
The overarching kaupapa Maori philosophy pervades all aspects of the project from methodological development, tool critique, results interpretation and dissemination. The project is lead by a Maori PI, with a Maori research assistant and Maori participants</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of premature death and disability for all New Zealanders. Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, are disproportionately affected and cardiovascular disease is the principle reason for the difference in life expectancy between Maori and non-Maori in New Zealand. Innovative approaches, focusing on prevention and management of CVD and using principles associated with a Maori worldview, are required to improve CVD health outcomes and life expectancy for Maori. The purpose was to trial a kaupapa Maori approach within an existing 12-week clinical exercise and lifestyle management programme. The aims of the project were to determine the effectiveness of a 12-week exercise and lifestyle management programme, imbedded with a kaupapa Maori philosophy, on cardiovascular disease risk factors and quality of life. </summary>
