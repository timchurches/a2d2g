All patients will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form.</outcome>

    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and a parent/guardian consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment doses will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of  artesunate+sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Jamame (Lower Jubba region), Janaale (Lower Shabelle region) and Jowhar (Middle Shabelle region), Somalia.

Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in Somalia to assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate+ sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The participants will be febrile people aged between 6 months and 60 years except female minors aged 12-18 and umarreied women. Patients will be treated with artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine once a day over 3 consecutive days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Somalia in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum.</summary>
