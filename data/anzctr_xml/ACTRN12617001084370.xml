    <interventions>Brief name: KIDNEYTEXT Intervention plus usual care

Materials and mode of delivery: Mobile phone text messages containing dietary and lifestyle advice will be sent to intervention participants. Text message content will include information pertaining to renal-specific dietary needs (potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and fluid), general healthy eating, physical activity promotion, medication reminders and symptom identification. 

Procedure: Mobile phone text messages will be sent three times a week to intervention group participants. Text messages are aimed at supporting a dietary pattern that reduces dietary electrolytes and fluid, whilst adhering to Australian Dietary Guidelines. Using a patient-centred approach, intervention delivery is based on empirical evidence that supports a focus on self-management and underpinned by behaviour change theory. 

Mode of delivery and number of contacts: Phase 1, Week 0-13: Three mobile phone text messages per week will be sent. These messages will be semi-individualised to a participants dietary intake and electrolyte biochemistry (serum potassium, serum phosphate) and fluid status (interdialytic weight gains). Phase 2, week 14-26: Three mobile phone text messages per week will be sent. These messages will be focused on providing general healthy eating, activity promotion, medication reminders and symptom identification.   Messages will be practical in nature, less than 160 characters in length and will be generic for varying age and sex.

Who and Location: Mobile phone text messages will be sent automatically using an automatic software program that has been developed for use in clinical trials at Westmead Hospital. Text messages will be sent at random times of the day on specified days of the week.  

Fidelity: Prior to study commencement, a bank of 190 messages will be developed based on scientific literature and multidisciplinary expert review and consumer feedback.

      <outcome>Feasibility 
The primary endpoint of this trial will be a composite outcome using quantitative and qualitative analysis of feasibility. We will measure feasibility using::  
	Adherence to dietary recommendations. This will be measured using the 24-hour pass methodology to assess dietary intake with particular focus on renal dietary components: protein, potassium, phosphorous and sodium intake compared to renal dietary guideline recommendations. 
	Recruitment rate 
	Drop-out rate 
	Participant satisfaction (using a 5 point likert scale)
	Semi-structured interviews to explore adherence to study procedures, rates of self-monitoring, decision making, problem solving and behaviour change (measured in group B only)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is increasingly being recognised as a global public health problem with increasing incidence and prevalence, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality.  Dietary intervention is a pivotal aspect of care for people with all stages of CKD and can significantly improve the morbidity and mortality of these patients. However, it is a complex diet that is frequently met with resistance from patients.  Improving patient engagement and education regarding diet and lifestyle is vital to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Using mobile phone technology, such as text messaging, offers a novel way of engaging with patients on dialysis. This randomised controlled trial aims to determine the feasibility and clinical impact of using text messages to improve nutrition-related behaviours in the haemodialysis population.

The primary aim of this study is to assess of the feasibility of using a mobile phone text message intervention to improve dietary adherence in a haemodialysis population.  </summary>
