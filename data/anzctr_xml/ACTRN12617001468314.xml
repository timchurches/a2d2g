  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of an immunotherapy combination of both durvalumab plus tremelimumab with or without chemotherapy on you and your lung cancer. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic squamous or non-squamous, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. 

Study details
Participants will be allocated by chance to one of two treatment groups. Participant in both groups will receive durvalumab and tremelimumab every 28 days for 4 cycles followed by durvalumab every 28 days until disease progression. Participants in one group only will also receive additional chemotherapy during the first stage which will be dependent on Squamous or Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Squamous Cell treatment will include gemcitabine and cisplatin or carboplatin while Non-Squamous Cell treatment will include pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin. 

Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to chemotherapy and has a favourable side effect profile in the treatment of a subset of patients with NSCLC.  Combining immunotherapies in the second-line setting has resulted in higher anti-cancer activity, but increases risk of immune-related side effects.  Combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy is a promising new approach, with early results indicating much higher anti-cancer activity then would be expected with either treatment alone with no additional toxicity.   The combination of two immunotherapy agents, with or without chemotherapy may be the best way to balance the chances of prolonged anticancer responses seen with immunotherapy against the risk of side-effects associated with treatment.
