  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence Rate of New Digital Ulcers (DUs) up to Week 16 - DUs were assessed at each visit starting with the screening visit. Only DUs from the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) distally (both on the dorsal and volar surface of the hand, including the digital tip) were recorded. The location of each DU was noted. At each subsequent visit the location of each new DU was noted. DUs that occurred and healed between visits and were reported by patients were not recorded as new DUs. The evaluation was performed by an experienced physician or a trained rater with expertise in the assessment of DUs in systemic sclerosis (SSc). For a given patient, DUs were assessed by the same rater at each visit, whenever possible. Any DU that developed over a previously healed ulcer was recorded as a new DU. Incidence rate is adjusted for 16 weeks of observation, hence is calculated as the number of new DUs/total number of observation days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Without a New DU up to Week 16 - DUs were assessed at each visit starting with the screening visit. Only DUs from the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) distally (both on the dorsal and volar surface of the hand, including the digital tip) were recorded. The location of each DU was noted. At each subsequent visit the location of each new DU was noted. DUs that occurred and healed between visits and were reported by patients were not recorded as new DUs. The evaluation was performed by an experienced physician or a trained rater with expertise in the assessment of DUs in systemic sclerosis (SSc). For a given patient, DUs were assessed by the same rater at each visit, whenever possible. Any DU that developed over a previously healed ulcer was recorded as a new DU. Numbers of patients with no new DU at Week 16 are imputed using the last observation carried forward method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With at Least One DU Complication - DU complications were defined as any one of the following:
resulting from DU worsening: critical ischemic crisis necessitating hospitalization; gangrene, (auto)amputation; failure of conservative management; surgical and chemical sympathectomy, vascular reconstructions, or any unplanned surgery in the management of hand SSc manifestations; use of parenteral prostanoids; use of endothelin-receptor antagonists; class II, III, or IV narcotics or a &gt; 50% increase in the existing dose compared with baseline; initiation of systemic antibiotics for the treatment of infection attributed to DUs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 95 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Hand Functionality Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Hand Component From Baseline to Week 16 - HAQ-DI assesses functional ability regarding fine movements of the upper extremities, locomotor activities in the lower extremities, and movements of the upper and lower limbs. Responses were extracted from the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire covering 8 domains of functional disability (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other daily activities). A mean score ranging from 0-3 was calculated for each domain, and a composite score by dividing the summed domain scores by the number of domains. The composite score was interpreted as 0 (no impairment in function) to 3 (maximal impairment of function). Hand functionality was assessed using a composite of 4 domains (dressing and grooming, grip, hygiene, and eating).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Overall Score From Baseline to Week 16 - HAQ-DI assesses functional ability regarding fine movements of the upper extremities, locomotor activities in the lower extremities, and movements of the upper and lower limbs. Responses were extracted from the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire covering 8 domains of functional disability (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other daily activities). A mean score ranging from 0-3 was calculated for each domain, and a composite score by dividing the summed domain scores by the number of domains.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Hand Functionality - Hand Disability in Systemic Sclerosis - Digital Ulcers (HDISS-DU) Score From Baseline to Week 16 - Patients were asked to answer 24 questions on the use of the hand(s) affected by DUs over the past 7 days on a 6-point scale from 0 (yes without difficulty) to 5 (impossible). The HDISS-DU score is the arithmetic mean of the valid non-missing items. The scores are interpreted as 1 (better ability in completing activities) to 6 (worst ability in completing activities)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The DUAL-2 study is designed as a multicenter, double-blind two-period study with an initial
      fixed 16-week Period 1, followed by a Period 2 of variable duration. All patients completing
      Period 1 continue on their original randomized treatment into Period 2, until the last
      randomized patient has completed Period 1.

      Patients are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (macitentan 3mg: macitentan 10mg: placebo).

      The primary objective is to demonstrate the effect of macitentan on the reduction of the
      number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcers
      (DU).

      Other objectives include:

        -  the evaluation of the efficacy of macitentan on hand functionality and DU burden at Week
           16 in SSc patients with ongoing DU disease.

        -  the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of macitentan in these patients.

        -  the evaluation of the efficacy of macitentan on time to first DU complication during the
           entire treatment period.</summary>
