  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a double blind, randomized controlled trial, young people with Autism Spectrum Disorders are randomly assigned to receive an 8-week course of oxytocin nasal spray  (Syntocinon) or a placebo nasal spray. Participants or their carers administer the nasal spray twice daily (morning and night). Participants aged between 12 and 15 receive 18 international units at each administration. Participants aged between 16 and 18 receive 24 international units. Participants are assess before the trial commences, 4-weeks into the trial (midpoint), at treatment completion (8-weeks from commencement) and three months following treatment completion. At each assessment point participants complete a range of assessments, including experimental tests and self-report measures. Participants also complete diagnostic assessments pre-intervention and 3 months post trial completion.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study tests whether a course of oxytocin over 8-weeks improves the social communication problems in young people with autistic spectrum disorders. It is predicted that individuals from the community diagnosed with autism or asperger's disorder and within ADOS assessment criteria for autism who receive a course of oxytocin nasal spray will show improved social functioning on self-report, diagnostic and experimental measures, in comparison to participants assigned to placebo admistration. Two single session assessment administered participants. All participants, therapists, assessors, and data entry staff are blind to condition.</summary>
