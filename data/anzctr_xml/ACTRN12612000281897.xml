  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will investigate the effect of restoration of transdermal Testosterone and Oestrogen on dry eye clinical indicators and biomarkers in post menopausal women. Association between these sex hormones levels and the measured parameters might be elucidated while suggesting for an option of dry eye treatment in this population.</summary>
