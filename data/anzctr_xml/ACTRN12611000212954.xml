    <interventions>Surgical excision of melanoma - this will occur before patient is recruited to trial.
Radiation - Patients randomised to the Investigational treatment arm, will receive adjuvant curative post-operative radiation therapy aiming to reduce the rate of local relapse.  This will be at a dose of 48Gy in 20 fractions.
Observation of affected area will be once every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 3 years.

Follow up frequency and overall duration for the observational arm is the same as for the radiation arm ie once every 3 motnhs for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for the next 3 years</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of the addition of radiotherapy to surgery on local relapse and survival in patients with neurotropic melanoma. Who is it for? You can join this study if you have neurotropic primary melanoma in the head or neck, and have had no previous surgery and you will be treated at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Queensland (Other sites around Australia will be opened within the next six months). Trial details Participants will be in two groups. Both groups will receive surgery to excise their melanomas, and then one group will be randomised to receive follow-up post-operative radiation therapy. The other group will be randomised to observation only after their surgery, with follow-up occurring every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 3 years. The aim of the study is to compare the local relapse rate, survival, side effects and quality of life between the two groups.</summary>
