  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participation in a 10 week cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation program run by an Aboriginal community controlled health service. The program was specifically designed for Tasmanian Aborigines by the Aboriginal Health Service using guidelines from the National Heart Foundation and Australian Lung Foundation. 
Participant assessments in weeks 1 and 10, with the baseline assessments being used to prescribe an individualised exercise program reviewed and upgraded on a weekly basis. The exercise assessments, supervision and review were done by an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist. Exercise equipment included stationary bikes, steps and weights. The exercise sessions were of one hour duration, twice a week.
The education session were coordinated by an Aboriginal health worker, were held for one hour once per week, and promoted self-management approaches to improving cardiovascular and pulmonary health.
Participation in exercise and education sessions recorded and analysed, along with measures of physical fitness and wellbeing.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypotheses were that the provision of culturally accessible cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation would increase participation and improve health outcomes for Aborigines with established disease, and would reduce risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity for people with risk factors.</summary>
