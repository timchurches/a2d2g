  <interventions>
    <interventions>New formulation of zanamivir, AWP-09VDB-S, to be administered in a gastric resistant capsule.
Participants will receive two doses in total.  Each dose is 2 x capsules of 150mg (300mg total) in feed and fasted state.  4-13 days washout between period 1 and 2
Compliance check of the mouth and hand at administration.

FED Cohort: Participants in the fed period will be dosed following a highfat, high-calorie breakfast. These participants will be required to fast overnight for at least 10 hours until 30 minutes prior to their scheduled dosing times, when they will be given a standard high-fat, high calorie breakfast which will be entirely consumed within 30 minutes. The breakfast will consist of two eggs fried in butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes (1 serving or approximately 114 gm) and 240 mL of whole milk. Participants will fast for at least 4 hours following dosing.  IP will be administered with 240 mil of water.  No food is allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. Water can be consumed as desired except for one hour after drug administration.
FASTED Cohort Participants : Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, participants will be administered IP with 240 mL of water. No food is allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. Water can be consumed as desired except for one hour before and after drug administration.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study will examine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of the investigational product AWP-09VDB-S, under FED and FASTED conditions.

The participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive the AWP-09VDB-S in either the FED or FASTED state in period 1.

After a washout period of 4-13 days of AWP-09VDB-S administration in Period 1, eligible participants will return for Period 2 and will cross over to receive the AWP-09VDB-S in the opposite state (FED or FASTED) to which they were randomised in Period 1.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety Assessments: This study assesses the safety and tolerability of AWP-09VDB-S under FED and FASTING conditions. Safety will be determined by evaluating physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and AEs. If deemed necessary, additional safety measurements will be performed at the discretion of the PI and/or Sponsor.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A follow-up safety evaluation will be performed 7(+/-2) days after each dose. This may be done at the start of Period 2 if less than 9 days has elapsed</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of AWP-09VDB-S when administered to healthy volunteers in the presence and absence of food.  Pharmacokinetic profiles: Cmax, Tmax, AUClast, AUC0-inf, Kel, t1/2 and CL/F computed from plasma zanamivir concentrations and Ae(t-t), Ae0-24, Re, Rmax, and TRmax computed from the individual urine zanamivir concentrations.
Urine PK smaples will be collected and refrigerated during the collection intervals. At the end of each interval, total urine volume will be measured, and an aliquot will be collected and stored frozen for PK analysis if deemed necessary by Ala Wai Pharma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>PK blood sample (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and12 hours after dosing).
PK urine collection (during collection interval times of 0- 4, 4- 8, 8- 12 and 12-24 hours after dosing).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Adult male and/or female healthy volunteers with a minimum age of at least 18 years and maximum age of 65 years at the time of screening.

Participants will be advised to use a condom (with the female sexual partner also to use an effective method of contraception) for 30 days following the last administration of the investigational product, and to not donate sperm during this same period of time.
6. Females of childbearing potential must either be sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to the first administration of the investigational product and remain so through 30 days following the final dosing of the investigational product, or have been using one of the following acceptable methods of birth control for the times specified:
a. Intra-uterine device (IUD) in place for at least 3 months prior to the first administration of the investigational product.
b. Double barrier method (e.g., condom and diaphragm) for at least 14 days prior to the first administration of investigational product.
c. Male partner who is surgical sterile (vasectomy) at least 6 months prior to the first administration of investigational product and is the sole sexual partner for that female participant.
d. Adequate hormonal contraception.
 
Female participants who claim to be sexually inactive, but become sexually active during the course of the study must agree to use a double barrier method (e.g., condom and diaphragm) from the time of the start of sexual activity through 30 days following the final dosing.
In addition, female participants of childbearing potential will be advised to remain sexually inactive or to keep the same birth control method for at least 30 days following the final dosing of the investigational product.
 
7. Females of non-childbearing potential have undergone one of the following sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to the first investigational product administration:
a. Sterilization (with a copy of the confirmation test) and be using a barrier method (condom or diaphragm) throughout the study;
b. bilateral tubal ligation with a barrier method (condom or diaphragm) throughout the study;

    <concealment>Following confirmation of eligibility (either Day -1 or Day 1 prior to IP administration), participants will be assigned a unique Randomisation Number, and will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio for Period 1 to either the FED or FASTED group in accordance with the randomisation schedule. Each participant will then cross over to the other group (FED or FASTED) in Period 2.   Allocation is not concealed.

After a washout period of 4-13 days of AWP-09VDB-S administration in Period 1, eligible participants will return for Period 2 and will cross over to receive the AWP-09VDB-S in the opposite state (FED or FASTED) to which they were randomised in Period 1.</concealment>
