Experimental: Cohort 1: Ewing's Sarcoma Primary Cohort - Participants 2 years of age and older with recurrent or refractory sarcoma receive R1507 as 9 mg/kg via IV infusion once weekly until disease progression, intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, prolonged (2-week) time off treatment, withdrawal, loss to follow-up, investigator decision, or death. Cohort 1 includes individuals with Ewing's sarcoma who have relapsed within 24 weeks after diagnosis and have received two or more prior chemotherapy regimens.

Experimental: Cohort 2: Ewing's Sarcoma Secondary Cohort - Participants 2 years of age and older with recurrent or refractory sarcoma receive R1507 as 9 mg/kg via IV infusion once weekly until disease progression, intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, prolonged (2-week) time off treatment, withdrawal, loss to follow-up, investigator decision, or death.

Cohort 7b includes individuals with desmoplastic small round cell tumors.

Experimental: Cohort 7c: Extraskeletal Myxoid Chondrosarcoma - Participants 2 years of age and older with recurrent or refractory sarcoma receive R1507 as 9 mg/kg via IV infusion once weekly until disease progression, intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, prolonged (2-week) time off treatment, withdrawal, loss to follow-up, investigator decision, or death. Cohort 7c includes individuals with extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma.

Experimental: Cohort 7d: Clear Cell Sarcoma - Participants 2 years of age and older with recurrent or refractory sarcoma receive R1507 as 9 mg/kg via IV infusion once weekly until disease progression, intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, prolonged (2-week) time off treatment, withdrawal, loss to follow-up, investigator decision, or death. Cohort 7d includes individuals with clear cell sarcoma.

Experimental: Cohort 7e: Myxoid Liposarcoma - Participants 2 years of age and older with recurrent or refractory sarcoma receive R1507 as 9 mg/kg via IV infusion once weekly until disease progression, intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, prolonged (2-week) time off treatment, withdrawal, loss to follow-up, investigator decision, or death. Cohort 7e includes individuals with myxoid liposarcoma.

Experimental: Cohort 8: Diagnosis Not Specified - Participants 2 years of age and older with recurrent or refractory sarcoma receive R1507 as 9 mg/kg via IV infusion once weekly until disease progression, intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, prolonged (2-week) time off treatment, withdrawal, loss to follow-up, investigator decision, or death. Cohort 8 includes individuals with subtypes of sarcoma not specified in the protocol.


Treatment: drugs: RG1507
Participants will receive R1507 IV infusion as 9 mg/kg once weekly or 27 mg/kg every 3 weeks, depending upon the cohort in which the participants are enrolled.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of R1507 in participants with recurrent or
      refractory sarcoma. Eight cohorts of sarcoma participants will be studied in parallel. Cohort
      1: Ewing's sarcoma primary cohort defined as participants who have relapsed less than or
      equal to (&lt;=) 24 months from diagnosis, received at least two prior chemotherapy programs and
      are unresectable. Cohort 2: Ewing's sarcoma non-primary (secondary) cohort defined as
      participants who have relapsed greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 24 months from diagnosis or have
      only received one prior chemotherapy program. Cohort 3: Expanded Ewing's sarcoma defined as
      participants with recurrent or relapse regardless of prior number of salvage regimens and
      regardless of time of relapse. Cohort 4: participants with osteosarcoma. Cohort 5:
      Participants with synovial sarcoma. Cohort 6: Participants with rhabdomyosarcoma Cohort 7:
      Participants with alveolar soft part sarcoma (7a), desmoplastic small round cell tumors (7b),
      extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (7c), clear cell sarcoma (7d), myxoid liposarcoma (7e).
      Cohort 8: Participants with unspecified sarcoma diagnosis. Participants in the expanded
      Ewing's sarcoma Cohort 3 will receive 27 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) every 3 weeks
      intravenously (IV). All other participants will receive R1507 9 mg/kg IV weekly. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable adverse
      events, withdrawal or death.</summary>
