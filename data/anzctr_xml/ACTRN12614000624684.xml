  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete, in random order, three intervention periods and one control period. Each period will be separated by six days and will be conducted on two consecutive days; 7.5 hours from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm on the first day, and 6 hours from 7:30 am to 1:30 pm on the second day.
The three interventions periods are as follows:
1. Physical activity: participants will walk on the treadmill at 60 % of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) for 30 min at the end of day one of the trial, at all other times they will be seated
2. Regular Activity Breaks: participants will walk on the treadmill at the same speed and incline as the physical activity intervention, for 2 min every 30 min throughout both day one and day two the trial
3. Regular activity breaks and physical activity: participants will walk on the treadmill for 2 min every 30 min throughout day one and two.  In addition they will also complete 30 min of continuous walking at the end of day one.  All walking on the treadmill will be at the same speed and incline as the physical activity intervention
The control period is:
Prolonged Sitting: participants will remain seated for the duration

On day one of each trial participants will be fed standardised meals at 15 and 205 min, and be provided with a standardised meal to consume at home during the evening between day one and two.  On day two of each trial participants will be fed a standardised test meal providing 0.7 g fat per kg body mass at 0 min.  At 305 min participants will be provided a buffet lunch.
</interventions>
    <comparator>No Physical Activity.  The Prolonged sitting intervention is the control condition. Participants will remain seated for the duration of the trial.  Feeding will occur as in the other three trials.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will initially attend a screening visit at which blood pressure and fasting lipid and glucose concentrations will be measured. If blood pressure, glucose and lipids are within the acceptable range participants will complete an aerobic capacity test (VO2max). Participants will then complete the four trial conditions in a predetermined randomized order. The randomization code will be sealed in opaque envelopes. An envelope will be opened prior to each participant's first session, and the code contained within will dictate the order the interventions will be completed by that participant</concealment>
    <sequence>STATA software will be used to generate the randomization sequence for the order the interventions will be performed for each participant.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sedentary behavior is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Observational studies indicate that regularly interrupting sedentary behavior with short bouts of physical activity lowers this risk.  The results of two acute intervention trials provided strong experimental evidence that breaking prolonged sitting with regular short bouts of physical activity positively effected postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations.    However, the effect of interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of physical activity on postprandial lipid concentrations is still not fully understood.  To address this we will conduct a well-designed experimental trial to examine the potential cardio-metabolic benefits of regularly breaking prolonged sitting with short bouts of physical activity.  This study will ensure that future physical activity guidelines and public health policies around limiting periods of prolonged sitting are based on sound, experimental evidence.</summary>
