  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised controlled trial will compare the traditional very low calorie diet (VLCD) (Optifast) with a new formulation (Formulite). This aims to assess compliance and GI symptoms prior to bariatric surgery. 

The usual regime for VLCD (e.g. Optifast, Formulite or other) prior to bariatric surgery involves:
- 3 meal complete replacement with 3 satchets of VLCD (mixed with water to form a milkshake)
- plain steamed green or leafy vegetables (as much or as little)
- black coffee or tea if desired (as much or as little)
- Water as desired
- No other foods or drinks
For this study, patients will follow this usual regime for the Formulite arm and Optifast arm. 

Energy per 55g serve = 858kj

The VLCD regime is used for 2 weeks prior to surgery. The main purpose of the regime is to reduce liver size, aiding in the ease and feasibility of the operation which requires access to the upper stomach. This can be obscured if the liver is large, as is the case in obesity. 

Adherence to the regime will be monitored by packets of VLCD remaining, as well as urinary ketones measured weekly during the trial. 
</interventions>

    <concealment>Meal replacements will be provided by the manufacturer (Formulite (trademark)) and Optifast (trademark) will be purchased.  Both will be repackaged in identical plain packs.  Sufficient product for two weeks will be provided to each patient at the initial visit.  Patients will commence the meal replacement programme 2 weeks prior to the date of their scheduled surgery.  
The random assignment of eligible patients will be computer generated by the Monash University School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine  (SPHPM) data centre which employs this type of system for all major trials. A telephone based system will be established which will allow a check of patent eligibility and randomisation only proceed if the patient meets the criteria. Randomisation will be clustered to ensure even distribution. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All data from the study will be managed by the data-centre within CORE. Outcomes will be analysed by an independent biostatistician from the Monash University SPHPM according to intention-to-treat principles. For the primary endpoint, a 95% CI for the difference in proportions between groups will be inspected and equivalence will be declared if the ends of the CI both fall within the equivalence margin (-5%, +5%). If necessary, a secondary set of analyses will be performed to adjust for baseline characteristics that are found to be imbalanced between groups where imbalance is pre-specified as a 0.25 standard deviation difference in means (quantitative measures) or an odds ratio of 1.5 (binary measures). Multivariate analysis will be performed using multiple logistic regression for binomial outcomes adjusting for baseline imbalances and potential covariates. Data analysis will be completed by an independent statistician who will be blinded to the allocation of groups. We will analyze by Intent to Treat, Last Observation Carried Forwards (ITT LOCF), Observed case and by Completer analysis, to give estimates of the effect size based on each of these scenarios.

SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION
Compliance with current VLCD is 86% at two weeks. 80% of patients who failed to comply stated this was due to taste and GI side effects. We therefore anticipate that Formulite will ameliorate these issues and there will be 90+/-10% compliance with Formulite. Assuming an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8, 30 patients will be required for each arm of the study. Based on our previous experience we would anticipate a 20% drop out rate, we will aim to recruit 76 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is one of the most prevalent and challenging diseases affecting our community. According to the latest census figures, 63.4% of Australians aged 18 years and over were overweight or obese, namely, 35.0% overweight and 28.3% obese.  Along with the increase in our community BMI has been a burgeoning of obesity related diseases including type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, hypertension, liver disease, depression and infertility.  Weight loss leads to a significant improvement in these conditions.  

Currently the only durably effective treatment for the most severe grades of obesity is bariatric surgery.  Conservative programs are effective in the short-term, however, only 3% of successful weight losers are able to maintain a meaningful weight loss beyond 2 years.  

Pre-operative weight loss with a short term very low calorie diet (VLCD) has been shown to improve surgical access by reducing liver volume  as well as the metabolic status of the patient, reducing the number of postoperative complications.  For this reason, most clinicians request their patients to undertake a preoperative weight loss programme for a minimum of two weeks.  

Whilst clinicians perceive a benefit for preoperative weight loss, patients often struggle to comply.  One reason for this is the difficulty complying with the currently available VLCD.  Most are based on liquid formulations and patients struggle with the taste and texture of the product.  Patients regularly report bloating, abdominal discomfort and constipation. In addition, the nutritional construct is often based around a large amount of sugar, and lacks high quality protein and fibre. 

Formulite (Trademark) is a new VLCD that the manufacturers claim retains the benefit of traditional VLCD, inducing Ketosis thereby avoiding hunger, whist reducing the unwanted GI side effects by combining high quality proteins with soluble fibre, less sugar and probiotics.  These changes are supposed to improve patient compliance. 

We wish to confirm potential benefits of Formulite in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.  We hypothesised that patient satisfaction would be higher and therefore compliance with the preoperative weight loss programme would be improved when compared with traditional VLCD.

HYPOTHESIS: Compliance with Formulite is better than traditional VLCD prior to bariatric surgery in obese adults. 

AIMS:
- To measure patient compliance with Formulite compared to traditional VLCD
- To determine if there are improved gastrointestinal symptoms with Formulite compared to traditional VLCD
- To assess patient satisfaction with Formulite compared to traditional VLCD
- TO measure peri-operative liver volume and weight loss following 2 weeks of Formulite when compared to traditional VLCD</summary>
