  <interventions>
    <interventions>A survey will be provided to cancer patients to evaluate how socioeconomic factors impact quality of life and experiences of care among cancer patients. Two surveys will be conducted; one at recruitment and one 4 weeks later. A sub-group of at least 15 participants identified as experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage will also complete a telephone interview lasting approximately 15 minutes at 8 weeks post recruitment.  </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of socioeconomic disadvantage on the needs and experiences of care of cancer patients. Australians experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage have poorer cancer-related outcomes than their counterparts. To ensure cancer care is equitable it is imperative that steps are taken to reduce disparities in care related to socioeconomic status. However, in order to achieve this aim and to make improvements where they are most needed, we must first understand where the greatest disparities in cancer care exist. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 or over, have been diagnosed with any form of cancer, are attending the clinic for an outpatient medical or radiation oncology appointment at any of the recruitment hospitals and have attended the clinic on at least one previous occasion in the last 6 months. Study details All participants recruited to this study will be asked to complete a survey while waiting for their outpatient appointment. A follow-up survey will be mailed to participants 4 weeks post-recruitment. Surveys will contain questions relating to patients' experiences with cancer care, quality of life, socio-demographics, disease and treatment related characteristics will also be included. A sub-sample of at least 15 participants whose survey responses indicate they are experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage, will also be contacted by the research team 8 weeks post-recruitment to participate in a telephone interview. This study will help to identify the gaps in care for cancer patients experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage, which may assist in informing the Cancer Institute NSW as to which specific areas should be targeted to improve care for this vulnerable population.</summary>
