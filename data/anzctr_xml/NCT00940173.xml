             metabolic control without experiencing multiple episodes of severe hypoglycaemia,
             often with unawareness; or

          -  with degrees of hypoglycaemia, who cannot be adequately managed with intensive insulin
             therapy alone despite intensive diabetes management delivered by a qualified diabetes
             team for at least six months prior to enrolment

          -  Patients should have an HbA1C =7% and =10% calculated as the average of the last four
             consecutive HbA1C readings during the 8-week baseline run-in period. The difference
