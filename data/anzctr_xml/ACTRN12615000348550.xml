  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention aims is to identify the most accurate, acceptable, scalable and user-friendly respiratory rate (RR) timers and pulse oximeters (POx) for the detection of pneumonia symptoms by CHWs and FLHFWs in four low-income countries - Cambodia in Southeast Asia and Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The accuracy of each device in the hands of CHWs and FLHFWs will be evaluated against three reference standards: medical expert counting (to be referred to as expert counter), a sample of videos of the CHW using the new devices which will be reviewed by a panel of experts and thirdly, an automated monitoring device (Masimos Radical-7 device) to obtain RR and oxygen saturation (%SpO2), respectively.  A total of up to six new devices will be tested in this way on a sample of up to 300 children in each of the four countries.

To explore the acceptability and usability of the RR  counting devices and pulse oximeter devices as perceived by parents, community and FLHFWs in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia a selection of up to two RR timing/classification devices and one POx device based on minimal clinical performance standards and pile sorting with CHWs and FLHFWs. This will include an evaluation of user perceptions of the devices in routine practice. Conduct qualitative interviews with CHWs and caregivers of children under five on their perceptions and opinions regarding the device(s) used and perform intermittent quality assurance to establish whether healthcare providers use of the selected device remains in accordance with the training and is not changing over time. 

The nine devices being tested in the study can be grouped into broad device categories as follows:

1.	Respiratory Rate Counters - 4 devices

a)	Non-automated devices include tools that support the manual counting of chest movements, by indicating when to start and stop counting and in this study the UNICEF ARI timer and counting beads are the two devices being tested.
b)	Automated devices support an assisted count, by automating or negating the need for manual counting of each chest movement.  Mobile software applications in the category of assisted count work when CHWs tap the screen or press buttons for each chest movement.	Mobile phone applications being tested in this study include a simple feature phone app called the respirometer and a SMART phone app called rrate.


2.	Pulse Oximeters - 5 devices

a)	Handheld Pulse Oximeters tend to be more expensive than Fingertip Pulse Oximeters and are designed for professional rather than for home use. Many of them are suitable for adults, children and young infants, since oxygen is measured using a finger external sensor that can be purchased separately for paediatric and neonatal use. As with fingertip Pulse Oximeters, handheld oximeters show values of SpO2 and pulse rate in different colours on the display, but, in general, they would need additional training of CHWs because they are more complex to operate.	In this study two devices will be tested - Lifebox and UTECH.

b)	Mobile phone applications	In order to measure oxygen saturation in blood through a mobile phone application it is necessary, in addition to a smartphone or iPhone, to also have an external finger sensor. Most of these applications can be downloaded for free; however the price of the phone and the sensor has to be also included when thinking on this approach. Oxygen values of the patient are shown on the display of the phone.  In this study one device will be tested - Masimo iSPO2 android pulse oximeter.

c)	Fingertip Pulse Oximeters are the most affordable option for measuring oxygen saturation (SpO2) in blood, and almost all of them show values of pulse rate in addition to the SpO2. A selection of fingertip pulse oximeters suitable to be use with children and showing display values in blue and black was conducted. A limitation found within this category is that some of the fingertip pulse oximeters designed for paediatric use have a limited age range of 2 to 13 years old or 15 kg weight and they are therefore not suitable for use with neonates.  In this study two devices will be tested - Contec and Devon.

Pairs of devices will be tested and therefore each pair of devices will be tested over a two week period in each country to achieve the required sample size.

    <comparator>For respiratory rate the compararator will be a medical professional or expert counter simultaneously counting the respiratory rate of the patient while the community health worker or first level health facility worker is using the new device to measure the respiratory rate.   This comparator will be the main measure but will be supported by along with a sample of video recordings being recorded and subsequently observed by expert respiratory rate counters.  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations are based on precision of the estimated difference between device and expert respiratory count assuming normal distribution (Bland and Altman 2012). A standard deviation of Sd=7 for the difference was obtained in a previous study (Noordam, Barbera Lainez et al. 2014), data not shown. Requiring a maximal total length of the 95% confidence interval of 4 units, the minimal sample size will be 47 per strata for independent observations. 

The total sample size in all countries will add up to 2*3*47=282 when stratifying into age groups 0 to 60 days / between 2 and 59 months, and a pairwise division of 7 devices into 3 groups. The sample size is then increased by 50% to n=423 (rounded off to 430) to accommodate potential clustering on CHW level.  This would mean a total sample size across all four countries of 1720.

A normal distribution of the mean of the differences could be assumed based on the relatively large sample size (central limit theorem) but differences will be logged if motivated. The selected precision is in the same range as the WHO accepted maximal absolute breathing rate deviance (Malaria Consortium 2014). The sampling design requires each child to be measured by at least two devices (assessed by the CHW/FLHFW) and the expert. Clustering of data on child level is not accounted for in the sample size calculations due to the limited cluster size of 2 observations. Clustering on CHW level might exist. In all countries 20 CHWs and 5 FLHFWs will participate for each set of devices.

In all countries a cluster size averaging (n=2*3*47) + (50%n) = 423 ~ 430/100 =  4.30.. This will require a CHW/FLHFW to observe 4 to 5 children, which is a total of 8 to 10 observations respectively.

The total sample size is increased by 50% to accommodate for clustering in the calculations (mixed model). Clustering will be assessed after data collection, and if no obvious clustering the differences will be assumed to be independent.
As the study is cross sectional, each assessment of the devices tests will be performed at a single time-point per subject.

Regression analysis will be done on continuous (RR rate and SpO2) and dichotomous (fast/normal RR and hypoxemia/no hypoxemia) data to control for confounders like user and patient characteristics, and implementation setting.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project, aims to evaluate the use of various respiratory rate timing and classification devices, as well as pulse oximetry devices among CHWs and FLHFWs with different levels of training in Cambodia, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda. 
Malaria Consortium has selected these four countries due to the high proportion of under-five deaths cause by pneumonia in each of these. In addition, Ministries of Health in all four are implementing programmes where pneumonia is diagnosed and treated at community level; although their CHW programmes differ substantially across key areas such as length of training, CHW literacy level and devices used to count respiratory rates. 
The project will systematically review the landscape for existing tools and devices which are appropriate for low-resource settings; identify the most promising and appropriate devices for field testing; establish their accuracy in supporting the diagnosis of pneumonia symptoms or measuring oxygen levels in the blood when used by community health workers and first level health facility workers and finally, explore their acceptability and usability as perceived by community health workers, first level health facility workers and caregivers.
