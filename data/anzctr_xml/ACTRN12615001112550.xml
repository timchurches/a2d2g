  <interventions>
    <interventions>Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is applied to the wound bed every week during the 24 week intervention period. During each application wound will be cleaned with soapy chlorhexidine and normal saline. PRP is then instilled onto the wound bed using PRGF technique (Registered Trademark) making sure that entire wound bed area is covered. Wound is then covered with Mepitel (Registered Trademark) contact layers followed by new gauze dressing and a single layer of pressure bandage. 72 hours (3 days) and 5 days after each PRP instillation, standard care is administered. Ulcer care and administration of PRP are performed by the principal investigator, a specialist nurse under the supervision of medical specialist in surgery
</interventions>
    <comparator>Make standard care each 48 hours: previous cleaning and debridement with saline, covered with saline impregnated gauze and cover with secondary of gauzes and one layer compressive bandage, during 24 weeks. Measure weekly ulcer area and calculate the reduction rate of ulcer at the beginning and after 24 weeks. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% Reduction in ulcer surface area.
Calculated the difference in percentage of the initial surface to the end surface.To calculate the surface of the ulcer of the ellipse formula was used.
A = length x width x 0.675</outcome>
      <timepoint> 24 weeks after randomization</timepoint>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary effects after application of platelet-rich plasma.
The side effects are rated local infection and irritative dermatitis. Are valued according to visual inspection of the principal investigator once a week according observation of the following signs: increased exudate, increasing pain, itching, erythema periulcer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every week for 24 weeks</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>For the comparative study between variables the following tests were applied:

Study of the associations between continue quantitative variables:

Normality was studied in the distribution of the sample by testing Kolmorov Smirnov normality and Shapiro Wilk and display data not normally distributed were analyzed using non-parametric U-test of Mann-Whitney.


Studyof correlation between variables:

To analyze the correlation between the evolution of healing and ulcer-related variables the Pearson correlation coefficient was determined by taking meaningful relationships as those having a lower significance of 0.01.
For calculating the sample size is decided to fix the error a 5%, it was decided to assume a beta error of 20%, therefore the study power is 80% (1 - beta).
The sample size is 47 cases obtained in each group.</statisticalmethods>
