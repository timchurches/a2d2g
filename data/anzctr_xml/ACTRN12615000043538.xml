  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who have undergone extensor tendon repair in zone V and/or VI will be randomised post-operatively into either a group who receive the usual rehabilitation protocol of controlled active motion, or an experimental group who will be treated using a relative motion extension splinting protocol- this uses an alternative splint and exercise programme.

The splint in the intervention group includes only the MCP joints rather than the MCPs, wrist and forearm, and positions the injured MCP joint (s) in 15-20 degrees relative extension to the other digits.
In the first 4 weeks no specific exercises are provided, the patient is advised to move the hand and use it for light activities in the splint. From 4 weeks the patient will be provided with customised exercises to reduce a lag if one exists, such as active MCP extension and place and hold in extension, and tendon gliding exercises if there is a limitation in flexion. These are usually around 10 repetitions 5 times per day but will be adapted to the patient. From 8 weeks passive flexion stretches 5 times per day may be included if necessary to regain flexion. Patients will also be advised on the use of heat and massage at home
The hand therapist (OT or physio) will teach the exercises and advise the patient on the use of the hand at home; they may use modalities such as heat and massage in therapy sessions.
Consultation will be one-on-one sessions. Usually the first session will be for 1 hour and subsequent sessions 30 minutes each, 1 -2 times per week for the first 4-6 weeks and then once every 1-2 weeks after this until approximately 8 -10 weeks post-operatively. Frequency and duration of sessions will be customised to the individual patients needs and are not dictated by the study protocol.
Adherence to splinting will be assessed by the therapist treating the participant and a splinting questionnaire will be completed at the 4 week mark.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is the group who will receive the controlled active motion protocol that is the usual post-operative rehabilitation regime at this unit.  
This splint includes the forearm, wrist and all digits and only allows motion at the IP joints
In weeks 1-4 patients are advised on active flexion/ extension of IP joints within the confines of the splint, and place and hold of MCP into extension; in weeks 4-6, tendon gliding exercises and wrist extension/ flexion are commenced. If there is a limitation in flexion then at 8 weeks passive flexion of the digits will be introduced. Usual exercise frequency is 5 times per day, 10 repetitions, but this will be adapted to suit the individual. Patients will also be advised on the use of heat and massage at home

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by hand physiotherapists while they are in Middlemore Hospital, where they will undergo surgery. Those identified that meet the inclusion criteria will be provided with the participant information sheet whilst they are in hospital. The physiotherapists will ensure that these potential participants have their first outpatient hand therapy appointment booked at the hand therapy department of Manukau SuperClinic (MSC), the outpatient clinic of CMDHB, within the first week after surgery. At this appointment participants will be consented by the treating therapist and randomised by selecting a sealed envelope containing  a slip of paper indicating Group A (extensor CAM protocol) or Group B (RMES protocol). 
Participants will be referred to their community hand therapist for follow-up therapy. Training in the research protocol will be provided to all therapists who will treat the participants. Participants will be requested to attend assessment appointments at 4 and 8 weeks post-op at the hand therapy department of MSC. Each session will take approximately 60 minutes and where possible these appointments will be co-ordinated with the participantsâ€™ surgical review which also takes place at MSC. Funding will be sought to reimburse participants for fuel costs. 
Due to the nature of the study it will not be possible to blind the patients to group allocation as the splints for the two protocols are very different in appearance. It will also not be possible to fully blind the assessor as the Sollerman hand function assessment will be performed with the splint in situ at 4 weeks in order to assess how well the participant can use their hand with the splint on. In order to provide partial blinding, an assistant will carry out randomisation of the participants and recording of group allocation and this will not be revealed to the primary investigator. At the 4 and 8 week assessment sessions, the same assistant will carry out the Sollerman hand function assessment in a closed room without the primary investigator. Once the Sollerman hand function assessment is completed the participant will remove the splint and conceal it from view. The primary investigator will then enter and assess the remaining outcomes. Group allocation will only be revealed to the primary investigator once all data for all participants have been collected. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Half of the sealed envelopes will contain a slip of paper indicating group A and the other half will indicate Group B. This is a type of block randomisation as there will be equal numbers of each group. Participants will choose a sealed envelope without knowing which slip of paper it contains.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Calculation of sample size was undertaken with the assistance of a CMDHB biostatistician, Irene Zeng. No previous data have been published using the Sollerman hand function assessment as the primary outcome for patients with zone V/VI extensor tendon repairs. A recent study used the Sollerman hand function assessment to evaluate patients recovering from a distal radius fracture (Porter, 2013). This provided an estimation of data variability in a patient population who had sustained a traumatic injury to an upper limb, albeit an alternative diagnosis. Data from this study were used to calculate a coefficient of variation. In addition, preliminary testing of the Sollerman was carried out with a group of healthy volunteers from the CMDHB hand therapy department wearing the splints from the two protocols to determine a likely difference in scores between groups. Using the coefficient of variation derived from the distal radius study (13.3%), and the difference in mean scores calculated from the healthy volunteers (10 points), a proposed sample size was derived.  With equivalent group sizes, 90% statistical power, 5% type I error and a derived standard deviation of 8.5 and 7.2 respectively for the RMES and extensor CAM groups, it is estimated that each group requires 13 participants. Expected drop-out rate is 30% (Hall et al., 2010) which indicates that 40 patients are required for the total sample. Over the year from June 2012 May 2013 just over 50 patients who would have met the inclusion criteria were operated on in CMDHB, this is therefore considered an achievable sample size for the study duration.Analysis of the differences in the objective and subjective measures of hand function, number of days to return to work in any capacity, grip strength, range of motion, satisfaction and adherence between control and intervention groups at 4 and at 8 weeks will be carried out by means of a [generalised] mixed linear model [depending on the distribution of the data]. Intervening variables such as gender and ethnicity will be controlled for separately and jointly where appropriate. The frequency distribution of complications in both groups will be compared by a Chi-square test of independence or Fisher exact test depending on the type of data and sample size. Correlations between the objective and subjective measures of hand function and range of motion scores will be investigated using a Pearson correlation coefficient or a Spearmans rank order correlation, depending on the data, and a Bland-Altman plot will be constructed to assess agreement between the measures. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients who have undergone surgical repair of lacerated extensor tendons on the dorsum of the hand at Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) are rehabilitated with an early mobilisation protocol known as extensor CAM (Controlled Active Motion). 
An audit of CMDHB patients showed similar joint range of motion outcomes to those reported by other centres using comparable protocols following extensor tendon repair. However, reports from centres where an alternative early mobilisation protocol, Relative Motion Extension Splinting (RMES), has been used show patients returning to work earlier. These reports (Hirth et al., 2011; Howell, Merritt, &amp; Robinson, 2005) suggest that patients rehabilitated with the RMES protocol have an earlier ability to use their hand functionally. To date there are no reports of prospective trials comparing the RMES to other early mobilisation protocols. 
This study will prospectively compare outcomes of patients managed with an extensor CAM protocol to those managed with an RMES protocol; with the hypothesis that those in the RMES group will demonstrate an earlier return to hand function.
