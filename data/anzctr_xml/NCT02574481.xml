             clinically interferes with the current study endpoints (Note: studies requiring
             extended follow-up for products that were investigational, but have become
             commercially available since then are not considered investigational studies).

         16. Septicemia at the time of randomization/enrollment.

         17. Presence of other hemodynamically significant outflow lesions in the target limb
