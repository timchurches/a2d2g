  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise Group trained classes with static and dynamic balance exercises. Balance disks and tables, foams and balls were used for the exercises. The program was composed by exercises that trained postural control during bipodal and unipodal stance, altering surfaces and visual information, avoid obstacles and ankle and hip strategy. Exercises were performed in groups with a physiotherapist, 1 hour twice a week for 12 week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group trained classes with stretching and active range of motion exercises for upper limbs. Subjects performed active exercises like shoulder flexion, abduction and rotation (without resistance), scapular adduction (with theraband) and elbow flexion and extension (without resistance). Subjects also underwent stretching of cervical and lumbar muscles (seating position). Exercises were performed in groups with a physiotherapist, 1 hour once a week for 12 week.</comparator>
