  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will have received 24-72 hours of intravenous site specific antibiotics,  followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin-clavunate acid, prescribed by site hospitals. Participants will then receive active or placebo treatment for an additional 8 days as below.

Active arm: 8 days of oral amoxcillin-clavulanate 400/57 duo formulation (70-90mg/kg/day, twice daily dosing; max 980mg per day)

Placebo arm: 8 days of oral placebo (equivalent volume as the active arm)

Treatment dose (range) is determined by local site hospital treatment protocols. Parents will keep a medication diary and/or receive phone calls to monitor adherence to intervention medication. Where possible, we will also collect empty medication bottles at the 4 week clinical review.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group receives placebo for the duration on the intervention period (8 days) whilst the active group continues on amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for the intervention period. Both medications for the study are in suspension form and the placebo has been specifically commercially manufactured which has the same taste, appearance and smell.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion with clinical cure (i.e. complete resolution of respiratory symptoms and signs). Children will have a standardised respiratory clinical assessment, completed by either a member of the study team (doctor, research nurse), or community health centre staff member (if required)  </outcome>
      <timepoint>We aim to review these children at week 4, however many children will reside in geographically isolated locations, thus a range of 4-6 weeks is a reasonable time frame to capture clinically important outcomes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion without chronic respiratory symptoms and signs or bronchiectasis. We will capture any further chronic respiratory symptoms and signs or bronchiectasis though the childs medical records (community or hospital).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>We aim to review these children at 24 months, however many children will reside in geographically isolated locations, thus a range of 23-25 months  is a reasonable timeframe to capture clinically important outcomes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to next respiratory-related hospitalisation assessed by chart rviews

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data will be captured through chart reviews of childrens medical records (e.g. hospital and/or community health record) and/or information from parents in next 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rashes) </outcome>
      <timepoint>We will monitor adverse effects while children are actively taking medication. Parents will keep a diary of adverse events. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nasopharyngeal respiratory bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance will be assessed using nasal swabs.

This is a composite secondary outcome and can not be separated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Nasopharyngeal respiratory bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance will be assessed using our research laboratorys previously published methods at baseline (admission to hospital), week 4 (range 4-6 weeks) and 12 months (range 12-14 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whole gene expression and target genes.

This is a composite outcome, thus needs to remain as is. We will perform whole genome gene expression micro-arrays and quantify selected gene targets as determined from the experimental group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (hospital admission) and 4-6 weeks (where possible). A blood sample will be taken at baseline and again at week 4-6. At each of these time points, whole gene expression and target genes will be assessed.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>An intention to treat approach will be used.

Primary aim: The main effects of the interventions will be determined by comparing the primary outcomes: (a) proportion with clinical cure (complete resolution of respiratory symptoms and signs) at 4-weeks; and (b) proportion without any chronic respiratory symptoms/signs or bronchiectasis at 24 months. We will use odds and incident ratios with logistic regression and negative binomial regression models respectively as well as linear regression for determining absolute differences between proportions (with 95%CI), as done previously. A Kaplan-Meier curve will be constructed for each group for time to next respiratory-related hospitalisation, and proportions will be compared using time-to-event regression models (as above).

Secondary aims: Logistic regression will examine the effects of treatment duration upon respiratory bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance, with models adjusted for potentially confounding demographic, social and clinical variables as appropriate, as done previously. CXR abnormality and gene expression data will be compared between children with and without chronic respiratory symptoms/bronchiectasis. 

We calculated the required sample size based on primary outcome-ii (proportion without bronchiectasis). We assume the percentage without chronic respiratory morbidity (at 24 months) in the short antibiotic group is 65.9% (based on our previous Central Australian pneumonia study where 34.1% had persistent respiratory morbidity at 12 months). To find a 50% reduction in bronchiectasis, the percentage without bronchiectasis in the long antibiotic group will be 82.9%. For 89% power and alpha=0.05, we require outcome data from 131 patients in each treatment group. Adding 20% (drop-out), we will enrol 157 children in each group. Based on primary outcome-i (proportion with clinical cure at 4 weeks), 131 per arm provides &gt;99% power (a=5%, 2-sided), assuming cure rate with short AB=73%; long=94.9%. These values are based on our pilot data from the placebo arm of our bronchiolitis azithromycin randomised controlled trial in Northern Territory Indigenous children (60% had short-term (&lt;5 days) non-macrolide antibiotics) and at 4 weeks 27% had persistent cough (i.e. 73% cure). The 95% cure rate was based on an Israeli randomised controlled trial (5 vs 10-days ABs). We estimate 314 (our total n) will be randomised from ~628 children at the point of hospitalisation based on current pilot study eligibility and enrolment. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Indigenous Australian children have the worlds highest published rates of hospitalised pneumonia and chronic lung disease including bronchiectasis (BE). Children from developing countries are also at a similar risk. Yet, optimal treatment of pneumonia and how to prevent its long-term effects remain unclear. Trials have focused upon short-term (1-2 wk) outcomes and reduced antibiotic (AB) courses in children with non-severe (viral) pneumonia. However, in high-risk populations from Australia and Malaysia, a longer course of ABs may enhance bacteria clearance and thus reduce the risk of chronic lung disease after severe bacterial pneumonia in young children whose lungs are still developing.

Our international multicentre, double-blind RCT is designed to answer our primary question: Does a longer course of ABs (13-14 days) compared to a short course (5-6 days) improve short and long-term outcomes of young children hospitalised with chest xray-proven pneumonia? We will randomise 314 children (aged 3 months to 5 yrs) from 4 sites. Children will be seen at clinically important time points (4 wk, 12 and 24 months) and blood, nasopharyngeal swabs and chest x-rays collected, based on pilot data.

Data from this first such study worldwide will substantially advance child pneumonia treatment with implications for future lung health, especially in high-risk Indigenous children. Results would lead to changes in national and international guidelines.

As a longer AB treatment for all children may increase AB resistance and lead to over-treatment in some, we will address these 2 issues by monitoring for AB resistance and embark on a discovery program to identify biomarkers that predict poor long-term respiratory health outcomes. Availability of novel biomarkers from host gene expression will help clinicians decide which children are at high risk, and therefore in need of more intensive follow up, and may enable targeting of longer AB treatment to those at highest risk of BE.
