  <interventions>
    <interventions>No intervention. Measurements and text interpretation information performed as part of a standard echo examination are collected from a backup copy of the echo database at each lab. The duration of the observation is from the first echo ever entered into the clinical database at the lab until the last echo entered when the backup database was taken. This time interval varies among each laboratory in Australia, and is dependent on when digital echocardiography was installed in the laboratory, and may be as long as 10 years. Since NEDA is a real world database, there is no intervention and no change to practice with NEDA.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence of pulmonary hypertension, defined by elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) &gt;40mmHg measured by echocardiography, in a diverse Australian population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The true prevalence in our echo cohort will be the proportion of patients with pulmonary hypertension in NEDA. The minimum indicative prevalence of pulmonary hypertension will be measured by the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in our cohort of echocardiography patients projected against the Australian population. The time period for the observation will be those having echocardiography within the last 2 years and still alive at the time of the data analysis.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prognosis of Pulmonary Hypertension as defined by Pulmonary Arterial Systolic Pressure (PASP) &gt;= 40mmHg measured using echocardiography from within the NEDA cohort, matched against mortality, provided data linkage with the National Deaths Index.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time period for the observation will be those having echocardiography within the last 2 years and still alive at the time of the data analysis.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The association between pulmonary artery systolic pressure and echo variables: left ventricular ejection fraction, mitral inflow E wave velocity, myocardial relaxation septal E velocity, E:E ratio, left atrial volume, right ventricular TAPSE, right ventricular basal and mid diameters, right ventricular Tei index, Noninvasive PVR estimation (Schiller equation), and right atrial volume.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Each echo variable will be analysed against pulmonary artery systolic pressure using standard statistical analysis tools. The time period for the observation will be all echocardiograms in the NEDA database.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of additional echo parameters associated with markers of pulmonary hypertension disease severity and predictors of death. This is an exploratory analysis designed to identify those additional markers not identified as standard markers, and those not included in Secondary Outcome 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time period for the observation will be all echocardiograms in the NEDA database.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of reference ranges for  echocardiographic variables. Reference intervals refer to  the normal ranges normally found in healthy individuals. Since NEDA is a "big data" database, it is well suited to analysis of subgroups such as those without any demonstrable disease. Each individual measurement (up to 150 individual variables) will be subjected to this analysis. Only variables in which valid conclusions can be drawn based on the number of available measurements will be reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time period for the observation will be all echocardiograms in the NEDA database.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The planned sample size of 900,000 is based on 150 Australian
laboratories reporting an average of 3000 studies per year, with at least
one year of retrospective data available. This sample size will provide
good precision to estimate the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension, and the associated abnormalities of echocardiographic variables. Based on our previous data of an estimated median survival of 4.3+/-0.1 years for patients with all-cause pulmonary hypertension, a sample size of 779 PHT patients would be required to identify a characteristic associated with a 10% increase in risk, with power 80%, alpha level 0.05.
Since NEDA will have a vastly greater sample size than the necessary sample size for risk prediction described above, NEDA will be well powered to address the primary and secondary outcomes.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Contemporary Australian data suggest that pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is more common than previously reported and confers a poor prognosis, however this single-centre data needs confirmation in a large population study from many locations and diverse backgrounds. Identification of underlying cause and prognosis of PHT non-invasively using simple markers would have a major impact on the diagnosis and management of patients with PHT.

PHT is often identified during echocardiography, performed for investigation of breathlessness. PHT is not a diagnosis in itself, but has a number of underlying causes that require additional investigation to delineate. Such causes include left heart diseases, various chronic respiratory illnesses, and chronic thromboembolic and pulmonary vascular diseases.

Over 900,000 echocardiograms (echos) are performed in Australia each year, but to date there has been no systematic method for capturing data from these echos. The newly developed National Echo Database Australia (NEDA) is designed to obtain measurement and report data, but no images, from digital echo laboratory across Australia and transfer them to a secure database, matched against national mortality data. The NEDA database will be the largest echo database in the world.  

Identification of the population of patients with PHT is of great importance, both to target those who may benefit from disease-specific therapy, and to better understand all forms of PHT in Australia and New Zealand. Abnormalities identifiable using echocardiography may be very useful prognostic indicators, and may help separate various causes for PHT. This information could be used to both identify patients who may respond to treatment, and to identify them earlier, with the goal of decreasing both morbidity and mortality for this common condition.</summary>
