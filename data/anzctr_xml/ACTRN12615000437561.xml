  <interventions>
    <interventions>The physical activity practices to be implemented in schools are derived from the Supporting Childrens Outcomes using Rewards, Exercise and Skills (SCORES) program. These practices will allow us to evaluate the health service program. Practices include: a) Teacher professional development to deliver quality physical education lessons; b) Development of a school physical activity policy; c) Provision of recess and lunch physical activity sessions; d) Incentives to engage students in physical activity; and e) Parental engagement via newsletters. To facilitate the implementation of these practices, the following strategies will be used:- 
1) Executive support: The school principal will be encouraged to demonstrate and communicate support for the SCORES program by: electing a school champion (teacher from the intervention school) to lead the intervention; speaking to teachers about the intervention at staff meetings; supporting teachers to participate in professional development training; and developing a school physical activity policy which outlines the teaching of fundamental movement skills, guidelines for recess and lunch-time physical activity sessions, and methods to engage parents such as providing newsletters.
2) Staff training: All teachers will be invited to attend an onsite, 90 minute professional development workshop facilitated by a qualified Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) teacher. The workshop will aim to build skills in delivering quality physical education lessons, including the teaching of Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS) and adherence to Supportive, Active, Autonomous, Fair and Enjoyable (SAAFE) teaching principles.  
3) Tools and resources: Resources provided to teachers at the professional development workshop will include: the SCORES Activity Handbook; the SAAFE lesson plan template; the SAAFE checklist for self-assessment; SAAFE posters; a sample of a PDHPE scope and sequence; and a list of minimum equipment for lessons. Resources provided to school champions will include: a checklist of weekly tasks and reminders; idea sheets for recess and lunch-time activity sessions; and SCORES program newsletters for distribution to parents.
4) Academic detailing: A follow-up visit to the school by a support officer will take place one-month after the teachers professional development training. The support officer will conduct peer-teaching to assist teachers to use the SAAFE principles when planning their physical activity lessons and problem-solve any barriers to implementing the schools physical activity policy. 
5) Ongoing support: Short, 5 minute duration video clips demonstrating the SAAFE teaching principles will be emailed every 2 weeks to schools throughout the 2nd term of the intervention. Principals will be encouraged to show these videos at staff meetings. Support officers will conduct 1 observation of physical activity lessons in the 2nd term of the intervention and provide feedback to teachers using the SAAFE checklist. School champions will be sent fortnightly emails containing tips for how to continue to implement the SCORES program within the school.
6) Recognition and incentives: School champions will receive a SCORES program polo shirt as soon as all meetings, training sessions, and observation sessions have been scheduled. Teachers who attend the professional development workshop will receive whistles, lanyards, stickers and merit certificates, which can be presented to students who take part in recess and lunch-time activities. Schools will receive equipment packs once all of the SAAFE videos have been viewed at staff meetings.
7) Performance monitoring and feedback: Two reports regarding the schools progress towards implementing the SCORES program will be provided to the principal and school champion (one report per term). The first report will be sent one week following peer-teaching, and the second report will be sent one week after the physical education lesson observations.
The overall duration is 9 months (3 school terms)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of interest is the level of students moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).  Total minutes of MVPA will be measured objectively using an accelerometer, worn by randomly selected Grade 3 to Grade 6 students from 10 intervention and 10 control schools, for 7 consecutive days. It is expected there will be an 11 minute difference between the mean MVPA of intervention group students and control group students. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome of interest is the implementation of SAAFE principles during the teaching of physical education (PE) classes. Adherence to SAAFE principles will be objectively measured using the SAAFE checklist. A support officer will observe up to four physical education lessons per school, randomly selected across Grade 3 to Grade 6. It is expected that there will be a 10% difference (8 point difference on the SAAFE checklist) between the proportion of teachers that conduct PE lessons according to SAAFE principles at intervention schools, compared to control schools. </outcome>

Trial outcomes will be assessed for 10 intervention and 10 control schools by post-intervention comparison of between group differences. Trial outcomes include: 1) differences in the mean minutes of MVPA between  intervention group students and control group students; and 2) differences in the mean SAAFE checklist score between teachers in the intervention group and teachers in the control group. If 4 lessons (4 teachers) are observed per school, this will result in data from 40 experimental teachers and 40 control teachers, which will allow detection of a true difference in the mean score between both groups of 15% with a power of 0.8 and a Type 1 error probability of 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many Australian children are insufficiently active to obtain the health benefits known to be associated with physical activity. The school setting provides opportunities for children to develop the skills needed to participate in physical activity. Reviews of school-based physical activity interventions have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions are effective at increasing students Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) levels and Fundamental Movement Skill (FMS) proficiency. Despite this, few trials have been conducted with the aim of implementing effective school-based physical activity programs at the population level. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of an intervention to facilitate the implementation of a school-based physical activity program with proven efficacy  the SCORES program. The study will randomise 64 primary schools across the Hunter New England region to either a 6-month intervention group or a no intervention comparison group. The existing SCORES program will be modified slightly to enable the implementation of the intervention at a population level. The SCORES program includes the following strategies: a) Teacher professional development to deliver quality physical education lessons; b) Development of a school physical activity policy; c) Provision of recess and lunch physical activity sessions; d) Incentives to engage students in physical activity; and e) Parental engagement via newsletters. To facilitate the implementation of the SCORES program, multiple evidence-based strategies will be used including: 1) Executive support; 2) Staff training; 3) Tools and resources; 4) Academic detailing; 5) Ongoing support; 6) Recognition and incentives; and 7) Performance monitoring and feedback. The effectiveness of the intervention will be determined by collecting post-intervention data at 6 months. It is expected there will be: 1) an 11 minute difference between the mean MVPA of intervention group students and control group students, measured via accelerometers; and 2) a 10% difference in the proportion of school teachers that conduct PE lessons in an engaging, motivating and physically active way, measured via observation using the SAAFE checklist. Process and acceptability data regarding the implementation of the SCORES program will also be collected via an online, self-report survey of teachers. </summary>
