    <interventions>The primary objective of the program is to reach priority populations who are testing infrequently for HIV via both postal(1) and community(2) based dried blood spot testing. 

(1) Priority populations to be targeted via postal tests are men that have sex with men (MSM), people born in Africa or Asia and people who's sexual partners live in Africa or Asia. Information about the trial is undergoing translations into Arabic, French, Indonesian, Khmer, Portuguese, Chinese, Spanish, Thai and Vietnamese.

(2) Population to be targeted in community based settings are needle and syringe exchanges, gays saunas and sex on premises venues, rural and remote aboriginal communities. The kits distributed in these settings by trained peer educators.
 
The sample is collected via a sterile lancet finger prick with blood collected on a Whatman protein saver 903 card and then returned by post. Please see sample collection instructions attached for how the self sampling will occur,

Samples will returned by post and tested at the NSW state reference laboratory for HIV (St. Vincent's Darlinghurst). The NSW state reference laboratory for HIV will assess the performance of the DBS HIV test using (3rd generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of HIV-1/2 antibodies), and  the validation of 4th generation EIA (HIV-1/2 Ab/Ag) in comparison to 3rd generation EIA

Results will be delivered via SMS or email as indicated during data collection at enrollment,  The statewide service NSW Sexual Health Infolink will provide clinical governance for result delivery.

Any samples where HIV is detected will be asked to call NSW Sexual Health Infolink for their results, support and linkage to medical care.

 The key study outcomes and their definitions are listed below to be assessed by the study group which involves clinicians, researches from the University of NSW and community based groups such as ACON, The NSW Users and AIDS Association (NUAA),  The Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO) and Pozhet

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size will focus on the primary objective of the program of reaching high-risk populations who are testing infrequently. Based on behavioural surveys, we assume that 19% of gay men had their last HIV test more than 2 years ago or never, and among CALD populations 40% had never tested. Therefore to determine if the DBS program is able to reach a 5% or greater proportion of infrequent testers than behavioural surveys, then at least 400 MSM and at least 460 heterosexuals from CALD populations is required. 
The sample size related to the laboratory evaluation of 3rd generation DBS compared to 4th generation was also calculated. To provide sensitivity and specificity estimates with confidence intervals of +/-10%, at least 60 positive and negative samples are required. Based on the 860 samples expected in the DBS pilot program we expect a HIV positivity of 1% (9 positive tests, 851 negative, of which 1-2 may be acute infections). Therefore to meet the required sample size of 60 acute infections and 60 established infections, most samples will be sourced from other blood samples tested at the laboratory for other purposes.
In terms of statistical analysis, descriptive analyses (counts and proportions) will be conducted and relevant outcomes stratified by demographic group, risk behaviour and distribution pathway. Chi-squared tests will be used to assess if there are statistical differences in these outcomes according to these stratifications. 
Standard deviations will be calculated for means, and interquartile ranges for medians. Also t-test and Ranksum tests will be used to see differences in means and medians across different participant groups.
Sensitivity and specificity will be calculated using standard methods with 95% confidence intervals presented using binomial approximation tests.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most options for HIV testing currently involve people attending clinics or community testing sites. The purpose of the Dried Blood Spot (DBS) HIV testing pilot is to increase access to testing by providing people with ways to collect their own blood samples in the comfort of their own home. It offers significant advantages to conventional blood testing such as providing added convenience, privacy and confidentiality.

This study also aims to assess whether DBS is an effective and manageable option for increasing access to HIV testing among priority populations in NSW. It will also assess who is likely to use the program as well as ascertaining participants perspectives on the testing process.
