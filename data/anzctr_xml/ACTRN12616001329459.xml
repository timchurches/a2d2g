  <interventions>
    <interventions>The physical exercise intervention will involve a 3-month, group-based, supervised exercise program delivered in community fitness centres/gyms in Victoria. Prior to commencing the program, each participant will receive a consultation with an exercise physiologists  (EP) in order to individualise the exercise prescription to their specific needs according to their prostate cancer and general health history, physical abilities and personal preferences. A combination of aerobic (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) and resistance (i.e. lifting weights) exercise will be undertaken 3 times per week. Specifically, the aerobic exercise component will include 20 to 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity cardiovascular exercise (~60-85% of estimated maximum heart rate) using a variety of modes such as walking or jogging on a treadmill, cycling or rowing on a stationary ergometer. Participants will be encouraged to undertake additional home-based aerobic exercise with the goal of achieving a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise each week. The resistance exercise component will involve 6-8 exercises that target the major upper and lower body muscle groups. Intensity will be manipulated from 6-12 repetition maximum (RM; i.e. the maximal weight that can be lifted 6 to 12 times which is equivalent to ~60-85% of 1RM) using 1-4 sets per exercise. Exercise prescription will be progressive and modified according to individual response. Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be supervised by an experienced EP. Compliance and attendance (including the reason for any missed sessions) will be tracked throughout the program by the EP. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will maintain usual care for a 3-month period. This will be followed by a 3-month follow-up period in which no formal intervention will be provided to either group. The control group will then be offered participation in the supervised exercise program at the completion of this follow-up period. Usual care involves standard medical care. Thus patients may be referred to a mental health care service (helpline, support group, psychologist/psychiatrist, medication).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to explore the efficacy of a targeted exercise intervention as a mental health care service for prostate cancer patients. In particular the aim is to a)examine whether a tailored exercise intervention can help manage psychological distress in men with prostate cancer and b) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the program to promote mental health in men with prostate cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join if you are a male aged 18 years and over and experiencing psychological distress after a prostate cancer diagnosis. Trial details: Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into two groups. Participants in one group (i.e. Exercise intervention group) will attend a 3 month physical exercise intervention program that involves resistance (i.e. lifting weights) and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) undertaken 3 times per week at various community based fitness centres/gyms throughout Melbourne . Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be conducted in small groups under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist. Participants in the second group (i.e. Usual care) will maintain usual care for 6 months and will then be offered the exercise intervention. All participants will be required to complete a number of questionnaires at baseline, 3 months and 6 months, in order to assess mental health and quality of life. They will also undergo fitness tests and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans to evaluate changes in physical fitness levels and body composition.</summary>
