  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - ferrous sulphate
Treatment: drugs - Ferinject

Active Comparator: Ferric carboxymaltose - Subjects with bw =66 kg will receive an infusion of 1,000 mg iron as FCM and after 1 week a further 500 mg iron as FCM, depending on Hb at screening.
subjects with bw &lt;66 kg, 2-3 infusions of 500 mg iron as FCM will be administered within 2 weeks from baseline, depending on Hb at screening

Active Comparator: Oral Iron - Oral Iron oral iron preparation will be provided at 200 mg iron per day in a convenient dosage schedule.


Treatment: drugs: ferrous sulphate
200 mg iron per day in a convenient dosage schedule.

Treatment: drugs: Ferinject
1000-1500mg diluted only in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride, The maximum single dose of FCM that can be administered by intravenous infusion is 20 mL (1,000 mg iron) but should not exceed 15 mg of iron per kg of body weight. This means that for subjects with a bw below 66 kg a maximal dose of 500 mg iron per infusion is allowed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to look at how well Ferric Carboxymaltose, an intravenous iron
      therapy (iron that is infused directly into your body through a vein), compares with ferrous
      sulphate capsules taken by mouth in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia during
      pregnancy.</summary>
