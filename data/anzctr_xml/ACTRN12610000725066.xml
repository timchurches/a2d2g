  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) an immediate treatment group, or 2) a delayed treatment group, also known as a waitlist control group (beginning treatment approximately 10 weeks after the immediate treatment group begins). Treatment entails weekly 2 hour support groups over 8 weeks that are facilitated by a psychologist. The groups will provide a forum where spouses can share relevant information and personal experiences relating to their shared circumstance of having a spouse/partner living in an aged care facility, and will cover topics and provide education around issues relevant to the caregiving experience, such as coping and communication strategies. Study questionnaires will be completed by all participants at two time points approximately 9 weeks apart. For the immediate treatment group, these time points will occur pre- and post-treatment. For the waitlist control group, both time points will occur before treatment.</interventions>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Staff at each aged care facility provide explanatory statements and consent forms to eligible spouses. Interested spouses post signed consent forms to the project coordinator, who then contacts spouses by phone to confirm eligibility and schedule initial interviews. Once all interviews are conducted at a facility, the facility is then allocated to immediate start or delayed treatment based on the contents of a folded piece of paper drawn out of an opaque container.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation to groups is determined using clustered randomisation i.e. participants are allocated to groups based on the aged care facility at which their spouse/partner resides. Each facility is assigned as either an immediate start facility or a waitlist facility based on simple randomisation. Specifically, a folded piece of paper labelled as either ‘treatment’ or ‘waitlist’ is drawn out of an opaque container by a staff member not directly involved in the project.</sequence>

    <summary>This project aims to chart the wellbeing of spouses/partners of Victorian aged care residents and secondly, to investigate the effectiveness of a support and discussion group in fostering the wellbeing of spouses/partners of aged care residents. The primary measures of wellbeing are depression, anxiety and burden. It is expected that spouses/partners in either immediate or delayed treatment groups will report similar benefit following intervention.</summary>
