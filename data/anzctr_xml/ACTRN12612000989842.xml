  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ATL1103 is being developed as a potential treatment for acromegaly, a disease of excessive growth hormone and insulin-like growth hormone (IGF-I) action. Twenty four acromegaly patients will receive 200mg ATL1103 three times in week one and then either once or twice a week for a further 12 weeks.  All treatments will be administered by subcutaneous injection.

The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the two dosing regimens of 1103, and to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of ATL1103. The effect of ATL1103 on serum IGF-I levels and on other pharmacodynamic markers will also be measured.</summary>
