  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is the first human treatment with PRX-102, an enzyme being developed as a long-term
      enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (alpha
      galactosidase deficiency). The safety, tolerability, and exploratory efficacy will be
      evaluated in this study of increasing doses. Patients will be treated with infusions every
      two weeks for 12 weeks (7 infusions).</summary>
