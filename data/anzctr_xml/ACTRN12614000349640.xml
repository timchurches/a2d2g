  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will have a standard dose of Gylceryl Trinitrate (standard dose = 1.5cm strip of the product where the active ingredient = 0.2% glyceryl trinitrate) applied to the perianal region immediately prior to haemorrhoid banding.</interventions>
    <comparator>placebo
The placebo is made of all the ingredients within the treatment ointment apart from glyceryl trinitrate. Specifically ethanol which is used to dissolve the active ingredient in the treatment ointment will remain in the placebo.</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain scores:

This will be assessed in the post operative period by the anaesthetic nurses who will assess VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) at 10mins, 30mins and 60mins post operatively as per standard anaesthetic protocol post operatively.

In addition patients will fill a questionnaire before leaving following their procedure where they are asked to rate "anal pain" out of 10 and "general pain" out of 10 (where 1 is labelled as virtually no pain and 10 is labelled as "worst pain possible".) 

Patients will hand in the questionnaires prior to leaving.</outcome>
      <timepoint>in the perioperative period (within 1 hr post haemorrhoid banding)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perioperative analgesic requirement
The anaesthetic charts will be reviewed. The type of medication and the total dosing will be recorded for 
1) pre-medication, 
2) during procedure medication 
3) post procedure medication (within the 60mins post operative period)</outcome>
      <timepoint>in the perioperative period (within 1hr post haemorrhoid banding)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complications of intervention
The most common side effect of the intervention is listed as headache and hence patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire where they are asked to circle yes or no to having a headache in the post operative period. </outcome>
      <timepoint>within 60mins of procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Colonoscopy findings will be determined
Following the procedure the Surgeon will fill out a form detailing relevant findings in the colonoscope; Specifically they will fill out a form asking

List the pertinent colonoscopy findings (there will be blank box where the surgeon lists the findings)

List the haemorrhoid findings: (grade:, number:, treatment given:)

Other deal: (if haemorrhoid banding not completed, why not?. Were there any complications?)</outcome>
      <timepoint>this represents the operative findings and the surgeon will complete this immediately following the procedure</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The surgeon will discuss the trial with all patients being booked for elective colonoscopy + haemorrhoid banding. If patient agrees to trial, after consenting the patient, the patient will be booked for theatre. At operation, before banding, the surgeon will apply a standard topical dose of ointment from a blinded tube/bottle. This tube/bottle will be in a numbered container. This will contain either active ingredient of placebo. The only identifiable factor on the tube will be a serial number. The serial number will be listed in a book (off site) which lists if the serial number equates to a tube containing active ingredient of placebo.

Containers will be numbered
Central randomisation will be completed using a computer
An offsite member of the team will hold the allocation schedule</concealment>
    <sequence>A random number generator will generate the serial numbers. The tubes are only identifiable by a serial number. The tubes are identical in appearance and contain either placebo or active ingredient. To select the tube, the scrub nurse will select a tube at random from all the tubes (kept within a box). The serial number of the tube will be written down by the surgeon onto a case file for that patient. </sequence>
