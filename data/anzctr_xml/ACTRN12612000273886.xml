    <interventions>Aerosolized Amikacin and Fosfomycin delivered via the PARI Investigational eFlow Nebulizer System.

Amikacin/Fosfomycin (50mg/ml amikacin and 20mg/ml fosfomycin) will be supplied as a solution.
Single dose escalating study with 3 doses adminitered over 3 days every 24hrs. Administration will take approx 15-30mins.
Patients will sequentially fill 4 cohorts. Cohort 1 (no=3) will recive 2ml, 4ml and 6ml doses on days 1 2 and 3 respectively
Cohort 2 (no =3) will recive 4ml, 6ml and 8ml doses on days 1 2 and 3 respectively
Cohort 3 (no =3) will recive 6ml, 8ml and 10ml doses on days 1 2 and 3 respectively
Cohort 4 (no=6) will recive 8ml, 10ml and 12ml doses on days 1 2 and 3 respectively.





The eflow nebulizer system is based on eFlow technolgy. The eFlow is a single patient multiuse nebulizer that uses a vibrating perforated membrane to generate the aerosol. It will be positioned in the inspiratory tubing approx 15 cm from the Y-piece (between the Puritan Bennett 840 ventiator and the patient). Once in place the nebulizer will remain in line until all study drug doses have been delivered.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Placebo is 0.9% saline. On day 3 only, each patient will recieve a volume matched dose of placebo in addition to the investigation drug delivered via the Pari eFlow nebulizer ie all patients will recieve investigational drug on days 1 and 2 at the required dosage but on day 3 patients will receive investigation drug and placebo (2hrs apart). The day 3 dose of the investigation drug will be the same volume amount as for the intervention group on day 3 but will be given 2hrs apart</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ventilator Associated Tracheobronchitis (VAT) and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) are common complications of mechanical ventilation, that may result in prolonging ICU stays and can also be fatal for critically ill patients.  The standard treatment is currently intravenous antibiotics. The emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria and Gram negative pathogens makes this approach increasingly less effective. In order to improve treatment options, aerosol antibiotics have been investigated. They generally result in a higher sputum concentration compared to intravenous delivery, with reduced systemic exposure. Studies of aerosolized antibiotics to treat or to prevent VAP indicate benefits such as lower rates of VAP at the end of treatment, reduced usage of systemic antibiotics, and earlier weaning of patients from the ventilator, leading to shorter stays in the ICU.  Since VAP may be caused by Gram negative and/or positive bacteria, an adequate antibiotic regimen needs to cover both, and also have coverage for MRSA. This study therefore plan to investigate the combination of amikacin and fosfomycin.</summary>
