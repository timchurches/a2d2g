  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: The purpose of current study was to compare the effect of Probiotic cheese with Probiotic yoghurt consumption on lipid profile during a 7 wk period. 
Design: It was a triple blinded parallel randomized controlled trial in Tehran, Iran. 180 volunteers aging 18  65 will participate. Participants will be randomly assigned into three 60-person balanced groups and consume 30 g Probiotic cheese containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 and Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 daily (intervention 1), 100 g of Probiotic yoghurt (intervention 2) and none of the above (control group). Fasting blood samples and anthropometric measurements will be collected in the beginning and after the consumption period at the Pathobiology Laboratory Center and SRBIAU Nutrition clinic, respectively.</summary>
