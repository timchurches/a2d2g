    <concealment>Potential participants will be provided with the information and consent form. All procedures, treatments and assessments will be explained thoroughly by a researcher involved in the trial. Potential participants will be given opportunity to ask questions and decide if and when they wish to participate in the trial. Allocation to the treatment will be performed by computer generated random allocation with concealment. Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was “off-site” or at central administration site.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to strengthen the muscles that people with a spinal cord injury uses to breathe. The training would involve taking deep breaths in and out through a small handheld device to exercise the muscles used to breathe. The training will be in addition to the usual care received by each person. The training will be carried out by an experienced and qualified person for 15 minutes, twice a day, five times a week for a duration of 6 weeks. It is hypothesized that this training will strengthen the muscles used to breathe resulting is fewer lung complications while in hospital and at home. Outcomes will be reassessed after one year.</summary>
