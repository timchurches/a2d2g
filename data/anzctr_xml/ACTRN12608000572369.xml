  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will explore the use of health professional facilitated sessions aiming to challenge perceived barriers to participating in physical activity amongst Macedonian and Polish older people (55+) in the Western Metropolitan Region (WMR) of Melbourne.  The study has the following aims:
·	to determine whether a health professional facilitated education intervention increases physical activity and fitness amongst the target population;
·	to determine whether a health professional facilitated education intervention assists the target population to progress in their readiness to undertake physical activity; and 

The primary study hypothesis for the project is:
·	that a health professional facilitated education session program targeting identified barriers to physical activity for two CALD groups (Polish and Macedonian) will result in improved readiness to undertake physical activity and improved participation in physical activity.</summary>
