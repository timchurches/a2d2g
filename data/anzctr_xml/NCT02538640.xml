  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a laboratory-based research study conducted in two parts. Open cross-over design. 2
      test sessions per subject included in the study. It aims at determining the postprandial
      blood glucose and insulin responses to the ingestion of cereal product differing by their SDS
      content and GI in 20 healthy non-smoking voluntary subjects, aged from 18 to 45 years.</summary>
