  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death in Australia. The
      most common cause of OHCA is a heart attack. The current treatment of OHCA is resuscitation
      by ambulance paramedics involving CPR, electrical shocks to the heart, and injections of
      adrenaline. In more than 50% of cases, paramedics are unable to start the heart and the
      patient is declared dead at the scene. Patients with OHCA who do not respond to paramedic
      resuscitation are not routinely transported to hospital because it is hazardous for
      paramedics to undertake rapid transport whilst administering chest compressions and there is
      currently no additional therapy available at the hospital that would assist in starting the
      heart.

      However, a number of recent developments suggest that there may be a new approach to the
      resuscitation of this group of patients who would otherwise die.

      Firstly, Ambulance Victoria have recently introduced portable battery powered machines that
      allow chest compressions to be safely and effectively delivered during emergency ambulance
      transport.

      Second, The Alfred ICU will shortly be implementing a new protocol whereby the patient in
      cardiac arrest can immediately be placed on a heart-lung machine. This is known as
      extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

      Third, the brain can now be much better protected against damage due to lack of blood flow
      using therapeutic hypothermia which is the controlled lowering of body temperature from 37°C
      to 33°C. Clinical trials have demonstrated that this significantly decreases brain damage
      after OHCA.

      Finally, The Alfred Cardiology service has an emergency service for reopening the blocked
      artery of the heart in patients who present with a sudden blockage of the heart arteries.
      This is currently not used in patients without a heart beat because of the technical
      difficulty of undertaking this procedure with chest compressions being undertaken.

      This study proposes for the first time to implement all the above interventions when patients
      have failed standard resuscitation after OHCA. When standard resuscitation has proved futile,
      the patient will be transported to The Alfred with the mechanical chest compression device,
      cooled to 33°C, placed on ECMO, and then transported to the interventional cardiac catheter
      laboratory. The patient will then receive therapeutic hypothermia for 24 hours. Subsequent
      management will follow the standard treatment guidelines of The Alfred Intensive Care Unit.</summary>
