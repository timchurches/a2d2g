  <interventions>
    <interventions>Faecal transplantation. Pre screened donor faeces will be administered to the right side of the colon via colonoscopy once followed by 2 enemas of donor faeces in the following week. The colonoscopy will usually take between 15 to 30 minutes and the enema less than 5 minutes. 
Colonoscopy requires drinking bowel preparation the afternoon prior to the procedure to remove faeces from the colon. The colonoscope is a long tube with a camera on the end, that is inserted into the colon, usually under sedation. The faecal transplant is delivered down the colonoscope and into the bowel. This part of the procedure takes less than 1 minute. The enema is delivered by placing a short introducer into the rectum and  delivering 150mls of fluid. This does not require bowel preparation or an anaesthetic.</interventions>
    <comparator>The contol group will receive the standard of care for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. They will also recieve their own faeces via colonoscopy and 2 subsequent enemas as a placebo control. 

Each subject potentially suitable for the study, will be asked to donate a stool sample of their own. A small portion of the stool will undergo faecal associated microbiota analysis. The remainder will be mixed with 10% sterile pharmaceutical grade glycerol, divided into 30g units and placed into frozen storage.  This stool will then be used to transplant those subjects  randomized to receive placebo with their own stool. In this way the FT will remain blinded to both the subject and colonoscopist

Standard of care for ulcerative colitis

The management of ulcerative colitis involves both maintenance medication and medication used to control flares of the disease. The goal of maintenance therapy in UC is to maintain steroid-free remission, clinically and endoscopically. This requires regular clinical assessment including history, physical examination and at times colonoscopic examination. Other tools of assessment include blood (e.g. CRP, WCC) and stool (calprotectin) testing for inflammatory markers and imaging including MRI, CT or ultrasound. 

The choice of maintenance treatment in UC is determined by disease extent, disease course (frequency of flares), failure of previous maintenance treatment, severity of the most recent flare, treatment used for inducing remission during the most recent flare, safety of maintenance treatment, and cancer prevention. The mainstay of maintenance medication are the 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds (5-ASA) such as mesalazine or sulphasalazine. These compounds are commonly taken orally in formulations that predominantly deliver the active 5-ASA component to the colon. Alternatively, or in addition, mesalazine preparations can be delivered topically via enema or suppository if the disease only involves the left side of the colon (although it is only PBS funded for topical therapy during a flare and not for maintenance of remission  even though it also works in this setting). The majority of patients can be managed with maintenance 5-ASA compounds most of the time. For patients who have repeated flares of disease on 5-ASA maintenance therapy (1 or more flares in a year needing steroids), thiopurine medication such as Azathioprine or 6-mercapropurine should be used. These medications induce systemic immunosuppression, reduce the incidence and severity of flares of colitis but also slightly increase the risk of some infections and malignancy. Anti-TNF agents such as infliximab or adalimumab have been shown to have benefit in maintaining remission in UC (and are licensed for this indication by the TGA), however these agents are very expensive and not funded by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in Australia and so, are not readily available. The anti TNF agents also give an increased risk of infection, particularly latent TB reactivation. 

Mild flares of ulcerative colitis can be managed with higher doses of oral 5-ASA compounds or the addition of topical 5-ASAs given via enema or suppository. More severe flares are usually managed with a course of systemic corticosteroid. These can be given intravenously in acute, severe disease or orally in less severe flares. The steroids should then be tapered over time and discontinued. There is no indication for long term steroid use in ulcerative colitis and prolonged steroid use is associated with a number of complications including infection, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, poor wound healing, thinning skin, mood changes and insomnia. Severe flares of ulcerative colitis not responsive to steroids may respond to rescue therapy with the addition of either cyclosporin or anti-TNF therapy. 

Patients in whom colonic inflammation cannot be controlled adequately frequently undergo total colectomy. This may be done electively (for refractory disease) or emergently in acute fulminant colitis. Colectomy entails surgical risk that is higher in the emergent setting; this risk includes infection, wound breakdown and a mortality rate. Colectomy is considered curative for ulcerative colitis especially if they have an ileostomy stoma created, however, it frequently also leads to complications both short- and long-term.  In addition, in patients in whom a ileal-anal pouch is fashioned up to 50% of patients will subsequently develop pouchitis at 4 years post surgery.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test faecal transplant as a potential new therapy for active ulcerative colitis. Patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted diversity of bacteria in the bowel and faecal transplant aims to replenish the diversiy of the bowel bacteria. Faecal transplant involves the delivery of stool from a faecal donor into the bowel of a patient with the aim of improving symptoms and reducing mucosal inflammation. </summary>
