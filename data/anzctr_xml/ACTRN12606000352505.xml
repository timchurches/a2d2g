  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study tests whether d-cycloserine improves the effectiveness of exposure therapy for decreasing social anxiety symptoms. We predict that individuals from the community diagnosed with social phobia who receive four exposure therapy sessions in comdination with D-Cycloserine will experience a greater reduction in social anxiety symptoms than individuals who receive placebo in combination with four exposure therapy sessions. Participants receive five weekly group therapy sessions. the first session is educational and the next four consist of public speaking exposure therapy. One month post intervention participants are assessed for social anxiety symptoms as well as other general health indicators. All subjects, therapists, assessors and data entry research staff are blind to condition.</summary>
