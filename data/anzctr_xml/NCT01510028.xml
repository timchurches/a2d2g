    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion

        For Cohorts 1-4:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy by both:

               -  Arylsulfatase A (ASA) deficiency by assay in leukocytes AND

               -  Elevated sulfatide in urine

          2. Appearance of the first symptoms of disease at or before 30 months of age.

             For Cohorts 1-3 only:

          3. Ambulatory at the time of screening. The minimum level of function required to meet
             this criterion is defined as the ability to walk forward 10 steps with one hand held.

          4. The patient is less than 12 years of age at the time of screening.

             For Cohort 4 only:

             3.1 Minimum motor function requirements:

               1. A total GMFM-88 (percent) score =40 at the screening examination and a total
                  GMFM-88 (percent) score =35 at the baseline examination, AND

               2. GMFM-88 Dimension E: Walking, Running &amp; Jumping, item 68 ("walk forward 10 steps
                  with one hand held") score of at least 1 "initiates" at the screening and
                  baseline examinations (if applicable).

             4.1 The patient is less than 8 years of age at the time of screening.

             For Cohorts 1-4:

          5. Neurological signs of MLD must be present at the screening examination.

          6. The patient and his/her parent/representative(s) must have the ability to comply with
             the clinical protocol.

          7. Patient's parent(s) or legally authorized representative(s) must provide written
             informed consent prior to performing any study-related activities. Study-related
             activities are any procedures that would not have been performed during normal
             management of the patient.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients will be excluded from the study if there is evidence or history of any of the
        following criteria at screening:

        For Cohorts 1-4:

          1. History of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

          2. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to anesthesia or is thought to
             be at an unacceptably high risk for anesthesia due to airway compromise or other
             conditions.

          3. Any other medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude participation in the trial.

          4. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study that involves the use of any
             investigational product (drug or device) other than HGT-1110 or the IDDD used in this
             study within 30 days prior to study enrollment or at any time during the study.

          5. The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          6. The patient has a condition that is contraindicated as described in the SOPH-A-PORT

        Mini S IDDD Instructions for Use (IFU), including:

          1. The patient has had, or may have, an allergic reaction to the materials of
             construction of the SOPH-A-PORT Mini S device.

          2. The patient's body size is too small to support the size of the SOPH-A-PORT Mini S
             Access Port, as judged by the Investigator.

          3. The patient has a known or suspected local or general infection.

          4. The patient is at risk of abnormal bleeding due to a medical condition or therapy.

          5. The patient has one or more spinal abnormalities that could complicate safe
             implantation or fixation.

          6. The patient has a functioning CSF shunt device.

          7. The patient has shown an intolerance to an implanted device.</exclusivecriteria>
