    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - FOLFIRI
Treatment: drugs - E7820

Active Comparator: 1 - Experimental Irinotecan plus E7820

Active Comparator: 2 - FOLFIRI alone


Treatment: drugs: FOLFIRI
Comparator dose and mode of administration The FOLFIRI regimen consists of irinotecan at 180 mg/m2 (IV infusion) on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle, leucovorin at 200 mg/m2 (400 mg/m2 if using d,l-racemic mixture of leucovorin) by IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle, and 5-FU at 400 mg/m2 as an IV bolus injection followed by a total of 2400 mg/m2 by continuous IV infusion over 46 hours over Days 1 and 2 via an ambulatory programmable pump (the use of an ambulatory pump is optional).

Treatment: drugs: E7820
Test product: dose and mode of administration:
E7820 is administered orally in tablet form once daily, every day of each 14-day treatment cycle. For the Phase Ib portion, the doses will be 40 mg/day, 70 mg/day, and 100 mg/day, and for the Pase II portion, the dose will be the MTD in combination with Irinotecan, as determined during the Phase ib portion of the study.
The irinotecan regimen consists of an irinotecan dose of 180 mg/m2 by IV infusion once every 2 weeks (Day 1 of each 14-day cycle).
