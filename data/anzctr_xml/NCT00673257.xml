Experimental: Pharmacokinetics of Daunorubicin chemotherapy patients - Patients receiving a chemotherapy regimen including daunorubicin hydrochloride administered as an infusion of any duration &lt; 24 hours on a 1 or a 2 day schedule. Pre-study evaluations no greater than 14 days prior to daunomycin administration. If patients have had significant intercurrent illness or treatment that might affect organ function, laboratory work should be performed at an appropriately closer interval to daunomycin administration. A complete history and physical examination including height, weight and body surface area. Patients should be weighed with only light clothing; shoes must be removed before weight is measured. Patients height should be measured using a stadiometer after removing shoes. Laboratory evaluation: a) CBC with differential and platelet count. b) ALT, AST, bilirubin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, GGT.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Population Estimates for Daunorubicinol Clearance - Pharmacokinetic parameters of Daunorubicin hydrochloride will be analyzed, samples were drawn according to the following schedule: prior to the drug infusion, at the midpoint of the infusion if infusion is = 30 min in duration, end of infusion and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 (when feasible) hours after the end of the infusion. Samples will also be collected at 24, 48, and 72 (when feasible) hours after the end of the infusion. The concentration time data will be analyzed by model dependent and model-independent means. Pharmacokinetic data will be analyzed using ADAPT II software (Biomedical Simulations Resource, University of Southern California). Mean Daunorubicin hydrochloride Clearance will be assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>prior to drug infusion, midpoint, and end of infusion. Also 0.5,1,1.5,2,3,4,6,8 and 12 hours after end of infusion.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Population Estimates for Daunorubicinol Volume of Distribution - Pharmacokinetic parameters of Daunorubicin hydrochloride will be analyzed, samples were drawn according to the following schedule: prior to the drug infusion, at the midpoint of the infusion if infusion is = 30 min in duration, end of infusion and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 (when feasible) hours after the end of the infusion. Samples will also be collected at 24, 48, and 72 (when feasible) hours after the end of the infusion. The concentration time data will be analyzed by model dependent and model-independent means.

      <outcome>Relationship Between Pharmacokinetics, Renal and Hepatic Function, and Complete Blood Count - Multivariate analysis of the data will also be performed. Assess the significance of the relationship between the following characteristics: BMI, BSA, ALT, bilirubin, age, gender, and ethnicity, and daunomycin PK parameters.</outcome>

    <summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood from patients with cancer to study in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about how patients respond to treatment with certain
      chemotherapy drugs.
