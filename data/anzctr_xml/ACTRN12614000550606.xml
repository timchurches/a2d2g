    <interventions>The Australian GRACE Risk Intervention Study is assessing risk stratification in acute coronary syndrome patients using the Grace Risk Score and treatment recommendation tool (GRS) versus standard patient care.
The Grace Risk tool includes calculation of ischaemic and bleeding risk scores, a nomogram to assess patient risk / benefit, a treatment recommendation plan (based on guideline recommended investigations and therapies) and documentation of physician intended therapies. Based on the risk scores, patients are categorized into low, intermediate or high risk of ACS and bleeding and physicians are directed to recommended investigations and treatments according to the level of risk. This paper based tool is completed and placed into the patient's medical records early in the patient assessment process. It is then reviewed by the treating physician to acknowledge that the recommendations have been considered.
Following a 3 month implementation period where hospital staff are trained on use of the tool, patients will commence entry into the study. Post implementation, sites will be followed up to confirm continued use of the tool. A clinical champion will be identified at each site to assist in implementation of the tool. A copy of the completed patient GRS will be submitted to the coordinating group.
Each site will enrol 80 patients (approximately 10 patients per month). The duration of the intervention period will therefore be 12-18 months according to patient recruitment.
This study will also employ a Data Safety Monitoring Committee to evaluate blinded study endpoints in each of the 2 groups.</interventions>

Data is extracted from the medical records and entered into an electronic Case Report Form. 
The primary (hospital performance measure) endpoint will be the composite endpoint of adherence to performance measures (receipt of angiography; receipt of 4/5 recommended therapies and referral to cardiac rehabilitation) by the time of discharge among those patients discharged alive.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the incremental net clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of risk stratification using the GRACE Risk tool and treatment recommendation plan on care within the routine clinical environment.
Data is extracted from the medical records and entered into an electronic Case Report Form. 
Cost effectiveness will be measured by data linkage to the Medicare Benefits Scheme and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Quality of Life (EQ5D) as completed by the patient.

    <exclusivecriteria>Hospitals with an existing implemented risk stratification support system for the management of ACS patients will be excluded.

Patients presenting to hospital with an ACS accompanied with, or precipitated by significant co-morbidity e.g. motor vehicle accident, trauma, severe gastrointestinal bleeding, peri-operative or peri-procedural MI will be excluded and patients already hospitalised for any reason when the ACS develops are
not eligible for enrolment in the registry.

    <statisticalmethods>In the existing CONCORDANCE data set 6561 are confirmed ACS patients.  Of these confirmed ACS patients 2326 (35.5%)  are classified as high-risk patients (GRS greater than 118). 
Each of the three indices of guideline adherence is given a score of one, i.e. inpatient angiography=1, discharge on optimal medical therapy=1, and rehabilitation referral=1. Thus a patient meeting all three indices of guideline adherence would have a total score of 3.   
A sample size of 12 sites per group with 28 high risk patients per site achieves an 80% power to detect a difference in the total score of 0.5 between the group means when the standard deviation is 0.92 and the intra-cluster correlation is 0.176 using a Two-sided T-test with a significance level of 0.05.  

Therefore, this study will enroll 28 high-risk patients per site or 336 patients per arm. However, it will be important to recruit all patients presenting with an ACS diagnosis regardless of risk as their management will also likely be influenced by the intervention and the benefits of some recommendations (like angiography) are not as well established in this group.  Thus the  samples size will be 947 patients per arm or 1894 in total. Outcomes in this whole cohort will be assessed as a secondary endpoint.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Australian Grace Risk Intervention Study (AGRIS) aims to
enhance evidence based decision making and outcome delivery of Australian Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patient care. Hospitals will be randomised to either implementation of  objective risk stratification using the validated GRACE Risk score based decision support tool or to standard care.

It is envisaged that the GRACE Risk tool together with recommendations for evidenced based care will improve the use of evidence based investigations and therapies and therefore enhance secondary prevention in hospital.
