  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of whether less intensive therapy will maintain DFS &gt;= 95% for LR patients randomized to 1 of 2 low-intensity regimens - The 5-year DFS for these patients will be estimated on the 2 low intensity regimens. Interim analysis based on the estimated hazard rate will also be conducted, for each of the 2 low intensity regimens to protect against lower DFS for the LR patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from end of Induction to first event (relapse, second malignancy, remission death) or date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of whether the 5-year DFS in AR patients is adversely affected by the reduced pulses in maintenance - If it is found that there is a decrease in DFS due to the reduced pulses, comparison of outcomes between the two MTX regimens will be restricted to the every 4 week pulses arms. A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to test for quantitative interaction in this 2x2 factorial design.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 4 weeks versus every 8 weeks from the start of reduced pulse maintenance, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>DFS for B-LLy patients - EFS rate will be estimated for this group of patients. The 95% confidence interval will be computed for the same. Biology data captured for these patients will be summarized.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from end of Induction to first event (relapse, second malignancy, remission death) or date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>DFS for Down syndrome patients - The 5-year DFS for these patients will be estimated on modified therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from end of Induction to first event (relapse, second malignancy, remission death) or date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in DFS from 93% to 96% in AR patients based on the methotrexate randomization - All power calculations are based on the assumption of proportional hazards, and using the log rank test (alpha = 5%) with 5 planned analyses of the data for interim monitoring purposes (MTX question for AR patients). The study will also be monitored for futility.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from randomization at the end of interim maintenance II to first event (relapse, second malignancy, remission death) or date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Burden of therapy in AR patients overall at different time points during and at the end of therapy - Assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL), the Child Vulnerability Scale, and by the Behavior Assessment Scales of Children-Second Edition, Parent Rating Scale (BASC-2 PRS). Standardized scores for the sub-scales of the PedsQL 4.0 will be calculated using age and gender specific normative data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 30 months after beginning of maintenance (off-therapy time point for boys)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Burden of therapy in AR patients randomized to every 4-week vs every 12-week pulses during maintenance therapy - Assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Instrument scores, the Child Vulnerability Scale, and emotional symptoms (measured by the BASC-2 PRS), adjusting for age, gender, and family income. Comparison of differences in means (of the continuous measures) between the 2 randomization groups with 2-sample t-tests will be done. If the continuous data are not normally distributed, a non-parametric statistical measure will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 30 months after beginning of Maintenance (off-therapy time point for boys)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  B-ALL patients must be enrolled on AALL08B1 prior to treatment and enrollment on
             AALL0932

               -  Note: B-LLy patients are not eligible for AALL08B1, and can enroll directly onto
                  AALL0932

          -  B-ALL patients must have an initial white blood cell count &lt; 50,000/uL

          -  Patients must have newly diagnosed National Cancer Institute (NCI) Standard Risk B-ALL
             or B-LLy Murphy stages I or II; patients with Down syndrome are also eligible

               -  Note: for B-LLy patients with tissue available for flow cytometry, the criterion
                  for diagnosis should be analogous to B-ALL; for tissue processed by other means
                  (i.e. paraffin blocks), the methodology and criteria for immunophenotypic
                  analysis to establish the diagnosis of B-LLy defined by the submitting
                  institution will be accepted

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent

          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute

    <exclusivecriteria>-  With the exception of steroid pretreatment (defined below) or the administration of
             intrathecal cytarabine, patients must not have received any prior cytotoxic
             chemotherapy for either the current diagnosis of B-ALL or B-LLy or for any cancer
             diagnosed prior to initiation of protocol therapy on AALL0932

                  intrathecal chemotherapy, except for steroid pretreatment); B-LLy patients with
                  CNS3 disease are not eligible for this protocol or the COG HR ALL protocol; it is
                  recommended that intrathecal cytarabine be administered at the time of the

                  bone marrow or venous line placement to avoid a second lumbar puncture; this is
                  allowed prior to registration; systemic chemotherapy must begin within 72 hours

                  pregnancy test result has been obtained

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This partially randomized phase III trial studies different combinations of risk-adapted
      chemotherapy regimens and their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating
      younger patients with newly diagnosed standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia or B-lineage
      lymphoblastic lymphoma that is found only in the tissue or organ where it began (localized).
      Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy), giving the drugs in different doses,
      and giving the drugs in different combinations may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
