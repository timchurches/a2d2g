  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention is a 15 minute exercise task using rubber therabands, administered in small groups with instruction from an exercise scientist. Participants will exercise for 30 seconds followed by 30 seconds rest, rotating between 3 techniques (bicep curls, lateral raises and chest press), and completing 5 x30 seconds of each exercise by the end of the task. Shortly after the completion of the exercise task the vaccine will be administered. The exercise task will be completed before each of the 3 doses of vaccine (baseline, 2 months and 6 months)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events reported (by diary): Pain and tenderness at the site of the injection (the Toxicity grading scale for vaccines -  Mild: mild discomfort to touch, Moderate: Discomfort with movement, Severe: Significant discomfort at rest) redness and swelling (measured in mm).

On each evening for 7 days after vaccination, children will be asked to rate how painful /tender their arm is where they received the vaccination at rest and during movement. Parents will be asked to measure and record any swelling and/or redness with an evaluation card provided. In addition, parents will be asked to record any use of medication, fever, drowsiness, malaise or anorexia in the child.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Eligible children are aged 11-13 years, in year 7, have not previously received the HPV vaccine, and have no contraindications to vaccination against HPV. They must provide a signed parental consent form to both participate in the year 7 HPV school vaccination program and to participate in this study. Only participants fluent in English will be considered for participation.  This is to ensure that there is good communication between investigators and participants, which will increase patient compliance and the correct completion of exercise task.</inclusivecriteria>

Children with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder will also be excluded because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Any condition that prevents vigorous exercise.</exclusivecriteria>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Pilot data from our previous studies shows that incidence of adverse event reports was lower in exercise groups than controls. In studies using the influenza (N=60) and Hepatitis B (N=78) vaccines, exercise groups reported adverse events significantly less often (15% and 24% respectively) than control groups (45% and 53% respectively). Both these vaccines show far lower rates of adverse events than the HPV vaccine; however, in order to maximize our ability to detect significant differences, we conducted Power calculations predicting a modest 25% difference between groups. Power calculations indicate that expecting a reduction of rate of adverse event reporting of 25% (e.g. 80% in control group and 55% in exercise group), a sample size of 62 per group is necessary. Given that a drop-out rate of &gt;10% from dose 1 to dose 3 is expected, we will recruit N=150 children with N=75 per group. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>HPV is a sexually-transmitted infection that can lead to several cancers. HPV vaccination is an important way to protect against these cancers, so its important that vaccination rates are high and teenage girls and boys complete all 3 doses of vaccines. Exercising at the time of getting the vaccine might be a way to stop some of the side effects children often experience, like pain and redness, and improve the experience of vaccination, helping improve vaccination rates. In this study we will test if a 15 minute exercise task changes the number of adverse event reports, we hypothesise that an exercise task will reduce the number of children who suffer an adverse event like pain and redness at the injection site.</summary>
