  <interventions>
    <interventions>The VicRide program involves planned on-road urban and rural rides and discussions with other newly licensed riders and the coach before and after the on-road rides. The whole session is delivered over 4 hours. The program requires five preparation exercises as well by the participant riders within 2 weeks before the ride session day so that they can effectively contribute to the discussions on the day of the ride session and to facilitate their engagement in the learning on the day. They are also required to learn the hand signals that will be used by the Coaches during rides on the session day. All the preparation should take about an hour to complete. The participants are given the Handbook at least 2 weeks before the riding session to ensure that they are prepared and sufficiently experienced to participate in all the activities in the ride session. The preparation exercises are designed for the participants to think about their own experiences in relation to motorcyclist-specific hazards, a close call, and their early rides, and their motivations for and styles of riding. They all relate to the key topics covered in the discussions on the session day. The coach facilitates discussions between on-road rides to cover four key topics: hazard perception and responding; roadcraft; inexperience and risk exposure; risk taking and motivations for riding. The program is delivered in groups of 2 or 3 riders with a qualified coach experienced as a rider and riding instructor. The coaches have also been trained specifically in this program with a particular focus on coaching strategies.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects are recruited using two methods. 1.Subjects are recruited via information provided to them by licensing authorities and consent online at a study website; or 2. after receiving a mailed letter (as per previous group) alerting them about the study (and allowing them to opt out), those eligible are phoned by research staff and invited to participate. After screening, and consent, all participants complete a baseline interview administered by a trained telephone interviewer using a CATI system. After the interview, participants are allocated to intervention group using an automatic simple randomisation system built into the CATI software. The interviewers and interviewees are blinded to the group assignment until the end of the baseline interview when the randomisation process occurs. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was via a simple automatic process in-built into CATI software. No stratification or blocking used. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>1.	All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. They will however exclude patients who withhold or withdraw consent to the use of their data.
2.	All tests are two-sided and the nominal level of alpha will be 5%.
3.	P-value will not be adjusted for multiplicity
4.	All statistical analyses will be unadjusted except where indicated.
5.	No sub-group analysis will be implemented
6.	Multiple imputation method will be used to impute missing secondary outcomes of self-reported crashes and self-reported near crashes if more than 10% of missing is observed in each of the two outcomes.  However, when data are missing because the riders withdrawn from the study before the completion of interviews 2 or 3 then no imputation will be performed. 
7.	Data screening will be conducted to determine outlier and missing data treatment on case by case basis for all variables.
8.	The number of observations used in the analysis will be reported.

Sample size calculations assumed a composite crash outcome (at least one police-recorded crash or self-reported crash) of 22% after 12 months, based on previous studies reporting crash rates in novice motorcyclists or drivers. Assuming a 15% drop-out rate, 2400 riders were required for statistical power of 88% (a=0.05) to detect an absolute reduction in crash outcome of 5.5% (a relative reduction of 25%).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project involves the evaluation via a randomised control trial (RCT) of an on-road Assisted Ride Program for Victoria based on best practice rider training and education for newly licensed motorcycle riders. Qualified and experienced motorcycle rider training instructors will provide coaching and feedback to newly licensed rider participants on their riding skills and behaviours over the course of a 4 hour supervised on-road ride.  The anticipated benefits of the project are safer on-road riding by participants, and reduced engagement in risk taking behaviours and crash involvement.  If the program produces road safety benefits for participants, then it may be introduced on a state-wide basis to reduce road trauma among this vulnerable group of road users.</summary>
