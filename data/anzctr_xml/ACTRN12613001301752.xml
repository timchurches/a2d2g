  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart Failure (HF) is a debilitating and chronic disease that is associated with a high rate of comorbid mental illness. Depression is associated with increased risk of mortality and cardiac events. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is recommended as a preferred treatment in HF and cardiovascular disease (CVD) management. However determining the effect of CBT in CVD and HF patients is implicated by a history of limited randomised controlled trials, confounded sampling issues and reduced functioning ability. Furthermore, research in the field of anxiety management in cardiac patients is lacking although emerging research indicates that clinical anxiety is as prevalent as depression. This study seeks to investigate the therapeutic impact of a CBT intervention targeted to both depression and anxiety on HF outpatients in managed care. The treatment model mood management has been trialled and evaluated to be efficacious in depressed and anxious nonmedical clients. Participants (n=5) will be offered the program as a treatment option from a HF nurse and self refer to the study. It is hypothesised that participants will display improved scores on measures of depression and anxiety. Results will help inform current and future research on effective therapeutic treatment of CBT group therapy and the utility for depressed and anxious HF outpatients. </summary>
