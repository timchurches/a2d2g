    <interventions>MT10109: Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A.
Subjects will be administered a single equivalent dose of MT10109 by intramuscular injection to the EDB muscle of either the left or right foot, the comparator will be administered to the other foot.  Four cohorts of eligible subjects will be studied; Group A (2.5 U dose), Group B (5 U dose), Group C (10 U dose), and Group D (20 U dose).

The foot in which the drug is to be administered (i.e. left or right) will be assigned in a randomized manner.

Subjects will be followed up for 90 days post injection.</interventions>

    <concealment>Each subject will receive a singe injection of MT10109 injected into the Extensor Digitorum Brevis (EDB) muscle of one foot and a single injection of Botox injected into the EDB muscle of the other foot. An unblinded pharmacist will prepare the injections, according to a randomisation schedule, and all other study staff and subjects will be blinded as to which treatment in administered to which foot.

The pharmacist who prepares the injections will allocate to either the right or left foot based on a randomisation schedule</concealment>
