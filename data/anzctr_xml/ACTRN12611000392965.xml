  <interventions>
    <interventions>The multimodal supportive care intervention will include self-management and tele-based group peer support. Self-management resources will be in both print and web-based form. A study website will be provided for participants to access program materials and other resources, and to interact in group discussions and forums. The intervention also includes group peer support calls for participants, co-facilitated by a specialist prostate cancer nurse counsellor and trained peer support volunteers. The groups will have up to 8 members, and will run for six months with monthly teleconferenced meetings. Participants who are randomised to the intervention condition will be mailed the patient materials and allocated to a peer support group immediately after randomisation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care will consist of the man's standard medical management and a package containing information on coping with diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, managing side-effects, nutrition, and an exercise booklet and DVD. Participants who are randomised to the Usual Care condition will receive the package of materials immediately after randomisation.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients will be identified through the Queensland Cancer Registry (QCR), a population-based register of cancer diagnoses in Queensland, as being recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. The diagnosing clinician listed on the pathology record is contacted for permission to contact their patient about the study. The doctor will be sent a letter from the QCR about the study, along with an information sheet and consent form. If the doctor consents to the patient being contacted, the QCR sends a consent package (including a letter to the patient signed by the doctor, information sheet and consent form) seeking consent to participate in the study. The consent form includes consent for the release of contact details from the QCR to the research team. If the patient consents to participate by returning the completed consent form, QCR will provide the patient's details to the research team. Research staff will contact the patient to determine eligibility and complete baseline assessment. For eligible participants, randomisation will occur at the completion of all baseline data collection. Allocation concealment will occur, with randomisation being undertaken by computer at the central administration site.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluates an innovative supportive care intervention to improve the well-being of men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Who is it for?
This study is for men who have recently been diagnosed with localised prostate cancer in Queensland.

Trial details
In this study participants are randomly (by chance) divided into two groups. One group will receive usual care, i.e. currently available resource and support materials. The other group will receive the Living with Prostate Cancer supportive care intervention. This includes the provision of self-management resources in both print and web-based form, as well as access to a study website where participants can interact in group discussions and forums. The intervention also includes group peer support phone calls for participants led by trained peer support volunteers and a specialist prostate cancer nurse counsellor. The duration of this intervention is 6 months.

Participants will complete questionnaires at 3, 6 and 12 months after enrolling in the study to evaluate their psychological well-being and quality of life.</summary>
