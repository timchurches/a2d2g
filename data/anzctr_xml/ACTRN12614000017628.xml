  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: Land-based exercise training. 
Participants will attend a centre-based program 3 times weekly for 1hour. Supervised land-based walking will be undertaken in surrounding parkland or on treadmills in a laboratory or gymnasium. Initial exercise intensity will be set individually according to results of a preliminary exercise test (i.e. 55-65%VO2peak) and regular measures of intensity (heart rate (HR) using a HR monitor and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE, Borg Scale) will be collected and recorded during each session to ensure compliance. Exercise intensity will be progressed throughout the 6-month program.

Group 2: Water-based exercise training. 
Participants will attend a centre-based program 3 times weekly for 1hour per visit, and will participate in a water-walking program undertaken in a shallow heated 30x25m pool. The intensity of each session (55-65%VO2peak) will be matched to that undertaken by Group 1 using comparative oxygen uptake assessment as well as HR monitoring. The exercise-training program will be similarly progressed over the 6-month period.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 3: Educational Seminar Group This group will be asked to continue with their usual physical activities for the 6-month duration of the trial. During this time they will receive a centre-based education program (4 sessions of 1 hour conducted every 6 weeks) providing information including healthy lifestyles in older age, to minimize any Hawthorne effect. The education program will be delivered by study investigators and trained research assistants. </comparator>

    <sequence>Stratified block randomisation will be used to minimise the effects of gender so that the resulting sample will have very close to a 1:1 ratio of men and women. Other known risk factors such as age will be controlled in the analysis. The block randomisation will be done using a database based on the ‘ralloc’ package within strata. The randomisation will use three randomised block sizes and simple randomisation within blocks to ensure a ratio of study : control participants close to unity within strata and overall.  The randomisation will use a 2x3 design so there are six strata (from one stratification variable and three blocks). The order of the block size will be randomised.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size
No published study has investigated the impact of exercise training on cerebrovascular function, our primary outcome measure. However, based on our previous published work, and recent feasibility (pilot) work from our laboratory which demonstrated that CBF is increased in older individuals (n=9, age 65-78 years) by 10% following 12 weeks of training. A sample size of 35 will provide 80% power, assuming a two-tailed alpha of 0.05. We will recruit 45 subjects to each group to allow for a withdrawal rate of around 10-15% which we have found in our experience of centre-based interventions to be sufficient. 
Data analysis
The normality of data will be assessed graphically by using histograms and box plots. Continuous variables with normal distribution will be described using means and standard deviations; median and inter-quartile range will be used for those without a normal distribution. Categorical variables will be described using frequency tables.
Outcome measures will be primarily assessed with an intention-to-treat analysis at the end of the intervention with secondary analysis for the 12- month time point. This effect will be tested as the interaction between the allocation group (land-based walking; water-based walking and control) and time, on the primary and secondary outcomes. We will apply multilevel regression models (mixed models) given the repeated measures design. The baseline value of each outcome will be included in the model as a covariate. Alpha will be set at 0.05 and all statistical tests reported will be two-tailed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>AIM:
The aim of this randomised controlled study is to investigate the impact, in older adults, of a novel aquatic exercise intervention which optimises the haemodynamic stimulus responsible for improvement in brain blood flow and function.

HYPOTHESES:
1. A land-based walking program will improve brain blood flow and function in elderly subjects (&gt;50yrs), relative to a matched but non-trained control group.
2. Water-based walking, involving elevated responses to the circulation when training in water will improve brain blood flow and function to a greater degree than land-walking.
3. Improvement in brain blood flow measures will be significantly related to changes in cognition, memory and clinical measures.

RESEARCH DESIGN:
The study is a randomised, single-blind controlled trial.

METHODS:
One hundred fifty healthy, insufficiently active individuals, aged 50 years and older, with subjective memory complaints will be recruited from the community. Participants will be randomised to either a land-based, water-based or non-exercise training group. The exercise groups will attend centre-based exercise sessions 3 times a week for 6 months. The control group will maintain their usual lifestyle and attend 4, one hour centre-based healthy ageing education sessions over the 6 months.
Primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. In addition the primary outcomes brain blood flow and peripheral vascular function will be assessed at week 12 during the 6-month exercise training period.
