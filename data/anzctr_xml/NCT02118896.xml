Experimental: 1: FK506E (MR4) - Single open arm of FK506E (MR4). Since this was an extension study for many studies, generally the dose given at enrollment was to be continued. The investigator was permitted to adjust the subject's dose and modify the MR4 dose regimen as deemed necessary to minimize Adverse Events (AEs) and maintain effective immunosuppression. MR4 capsules were taken orally, once daily in the morning. MR4 capsules were to be swallowed with fluid (preferably water) on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before or 2 to 3 hours after a meal. MR4 was supplied as 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 5 mg capsules in amber glass bottles or in blister packs.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant Survival - Participant survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method procedures at 66 months (phase 2) and 24 months (phase III). The two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the estimated rates of patients alive at end of study (EOS) was calculated using Greenwood's formula. Start, event and censor times for the Kaplan-Meier analyses of participant survival were (Event time: day of death, Censor Time: day of last follow-up (for participants prematurely withdrawn from the study), and day of last visit (for participants completing the study) .</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 5.5 years (66 months (phase II) and 24 months (phase III)).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Graft Survival - Graft survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier Method procedures at 66 months (phase II) and 30 months (phase III). The two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the estimated rates of patients free from graft loss at EOS was calculated using Greenwood's formula. Graft loss was defined as re-transplantation or death. For kidney transplantation graft loss was also defined as nephrectomy or return to long-term dialysis. The date of graft loss is the earliest date of either of these events. Start, event and censor times for the Kaplan-Meier analyses of graft survival were (Event time: day of death, Censor Time: day of last follow-up (for participants prematurely withdrawn from the study), and day of last visit (for participants completing the study) .</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 5.5 years ((66 months (phase II) and 30 months (phase III)).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biopsy-confirmed Acute Rejection (BCAR) Episodes - FAS population. Evaluation of biopsy specimens performed by local histopathologist following "Histological Grading of Biopsies for Rejection" using grading relevant to type of organ allograft. Spontaneously resolving AR defined as episode not treated with new/increased corticosteroid medication, antibodies/any other medication and resolved irrespective of any MR4/MMF/azathioprine dose changes; corticosteroid sensitive AR was an episode which was treated with new/increased corticosteroid medication only and resolved, irrespective of any MR4, MMF or azathioprine dose changes; corticosteroid resistant AR was an episode which did not resolve following treatment with corticosteroids, if it was not treated with corticosteroids first but only with antibodies, it was included in this category; corticosteroid resistant AR episodes were further classified into episodes which resolved with further treatment and those which did not respond to further treatment/were ongoing at EOS/withdrawal.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First BCAR Episode - The time to first acute rejection episode was defined as the number of days from day 1 (defined as the day of study enrollment) to the first clinical, laboratory or histological signs that were considered to be related to the first acute rejection episode.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 1344 days (3.75 years).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events - An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An AE was, therefore, any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use the study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. Causally-related is defined as a highly probably, probably, possible, not assessable or missing relationship as assessed by the investigator. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Resulted in death, was life threatening: did not refer to event which hypothetically might have caused death if more severe); resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect; required inpatient hospitalization/led to prolongation of hospitalization (treatment/observation/examination caused by AE was considered serious); other medically important events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From first dose to duration of participation in the study (up to 6 years and 28 days after EOS).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
