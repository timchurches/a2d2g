  <interventions>
    <interventions>To determine the trimester-specific reference intervals for HbA1c, fructosamine and fasting glucose in non-diabetic pregnant women, serum samples will be collected once per trimester. 
In order to minimize inconvenience to subjects, serum sample collection in first trimester will be done at the time of first trimester Down screening. Serum sample collection in second trimester will be done at the time of oral glucose tolerance test. Serum sample collection in third trimester will be done at 34  37 weeks gestation during antenatal visit, together with serum sample collection for other purpose if possible.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>For estimation a reference range, 200 samples are required(1). For the analysis of prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus using IADPSG criteria, it is expected the prevalence will be about 33% (2). Assuming a confidence interval of 95% and precision of +/- 5%, the sample size required is 339 subjects (3). To account for possible default and missing data, sample size of 400 subjects is chosen.

Independent paired t-test and chi-squares will be used to analyze the parametric and non-parametric data respectively. Non-parametric method will be used to determine the reference intervals, which does not assume a Gaussian type distribution. The lower and upper reference limits were estimated at the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles respectively. SPSS version 17.0 will be used for statistical analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome is related to glycaemic control, which can be monitored by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). HbA1c can identify the average blood glucose concentration over the previous months prior to the measurement. The correlation between HbA1c levels and clinical outcomes depends on appropriately-defined reference intervals, which have not been defined in Hong Kong pregnant women. Fructosamine can also be useful in monitoring the effectiveness of therapy in diabetes, in a manner analogous to the HbA1c. It reflects the glycaemic control over the past 2  3 weeks. Therefore it can determine the effectiveness of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treatment earlier compare with HbA1c, which may improve pregnancy outcome in patients with GDM. However, there is only limited experience in use of fructosamine in patients with GDM.

Therefore, there is a need to establish trimester-specific reference intervals of HbA1c, fructosamine and fasting blood glucose in non-diabetic pregnant women in the local population, which may be useful in guiding treatment for GDM and diabetes mellitus in pregnancy.</summary>
