  <interventions>
    <interventions>Emotional disclosure writing
Participants who complete the intervention will be asked on 3 consecutive days. On each day they will write for 20 minutes about a traumatic or upsetting experience in their life. They will be instructed to delve (dig deep) into their deepest emotions and thoughts. This will be administered online. Participants will be sent a secure link each day to compete in their own time. The task will not be supervised. The writing will be stored on the researchers computer under the participants ID code and will only be shared with the study supervisors. Participants will receive a 4mm punch biopsy wound either 14 days after the first writing session or will start the task the day after the 4mm punch biopsy (in order to see whether the timing of the intervention matters). The biopsy will be performed by a registered dermatologist at the clinical research center in campus. To perform the biopsy, the skin on the upper arm will be marked and cleaned, then anaesthetised. A punch biopsy will be performed and the skin samples will be stored and transported to the lab for analysis.</interventions>
    <comparator>Time management writing
Participants who complete the intervention will be asked on 3 consecutive days. On each day they will write for 20 minutes about how they spend their time. They will be instructed to be as objective and descriptive as possible (i.e. just the facts, no emotions, no opinions, no feelings). They will be asked to concentrate on the specific details of their activities, even when referring to everyday tasks. On the first day they will write about the past 7 days, on the second day they will write about the past 24 hours and the third day they will write about their plans for the next 7 days.  Participants will be sent a secure link each day to compete in their own time. The task will not be supervised. The writing will be stored on the researchers computer under the participants ID code and will only be shared with the study supervisors. Participants will receive a 4mm punch biopsy wound either 14 days after the first writing session or will start the task the day after the 4mm punch biopsy (in order to see whether the timing of the intervention matters). The biopsy will be performed by a registered dermatologist at the clinical research center in campus. To perform the biopsy, the skin on the upper arm will be marked and cleaned, then anaesthetised. A punch biopsy will be performed and the skin samples will be stored and transported to the lab for analysis.</comparator>

      <outcome>Speed of healing of a 4mm biopsy wound as indicated by photographs and immunological and histological analyses. The 1st biopsy will be embedded in paraffin and immunohistology will be performed to identify CD1a, HLA-DR, CD-68.
The 2nd biopsy will be 5mm and will be taken 14 days after the initial biopsy at the same site. This biopsy will be split into two  half with be snap frozen and half will be embedded in paraffin. 
The snap frozen will be analyzed for 
1.	Cytokines  IL1, IL6, TNFalpha 
2.	Collagen  type I/III collagens, glycosaminoglycans and collagen crosslinking, PICP (collagen synthesis), MMP9 (inflammation) MMP2 (collagen remodelling)
The section embedded in paraffin will be analyzed for immunohistology (CD1a to identify Langarhan cells; HLA-DR for immune cell activation; CD-68 to identify macrophages)

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the University of Auckland through an advertisement flyer promoted through social media, the University of Auckland’s junk email address book, in public areas at the university’s campuses, from emails sent by course coordinators to the university’s students, and student notice boards throughout the Auckland University campus’.
Interested participants will be screened for eligibility using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Upon verbally consenting the researcher will look at a randomized list created through random.org to allocate the participant to one of four groups. The researcher would ask a colleague to put the participants code on a sealed envelope and the group allocation inside. When the researcher contacts them and determines they are eligible she will open the envelope to reveal the group.
Participants will then be sent a link to go online and complete consent and a baseline questionnaire. Depending on whether they receive the intervention before or after the initial biopsy they will also be given the control or intervention instructions for the writing task.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomized list will be generated used the website random.org. This will allocate participants to one of four conditions: emotional writing before initial biopsy, control writing before initial biopsy, emotional writing after initial biopsy or control writing after initial biopsy</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research has found that stress has a negative impact on wound healing (Ebrecht et al., 2004; Marucha, Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Favagehi, 1998). A meta-analysis of research conducted by Walburn and colleagues (2009) found that stress impacted the healing both acute and chronic wounds as well as experimentally inflicted wounds, such as punch biopsy and tape stripping. The research cites a high effect size (r=0.42) and emphasises that a focus should now shift to determining why stress detrimentally effects healing. Research is now looking at stress reduction interventions to help promote faster healing. At present only a few studies have measured the relationship between stress reduction techniques and wound healing (Broadbent et al. 2012; Emery, Hextall, Kirtley, Taylor, Dyson &amp; Weinman, 2005). If such interventions can be proven to have a positive effect there are very important implications for clinical and surgical populations.
Emotional writing is one intervention that researchers are currently trialling to investigate the stress-reducing effects on wound healing. The intervention involves participants writing about a traumatic or upsetting event over three consecutive days for 20 minutes per session. The intervention is not only easy to administer but also very cost effective. Emotional writing has been found to have a number of positive effects on mood and well-being for different populations. For example, Smyth (1998) conducted a review of 13 studies reporting benefits in physical health, psychological well-being, physiological functioning, and general functioning. Furthermore, emotional disclosure has been linked to decreased pain, better mood and shorter hospital stays in surgical patients (Francis &amp; Pennebaker, 1992; Greenberg &amp; Stone, 1992). The benefits of emotional writing are not fully understood but it is thought that writing about traumatic events or upsetting emotions can help process the event or issue, which can decrease the stress and prevent rumination (Pennebaker, 1997).
Two studies to date have found that emotional writing has an impact on wound healing. Weinman, Ebrecht, Scott, Walburn and Dyson (2008) conducted a randomised control trial with young men who received punch biopsy wounds. They found that those who completed emotional writing healed significantly faster than the control group. More recently Koschwanez et al., (2013) found a similar effect with older adults. Those assigned to write expressively, rather than about daily life events, had a greater proportion of fully healed wounds at day 11 after receiving a standardized biopsy.
Despite the amount of research that has been done looking at the effects of emotional disclosure there is still more research to be conducted to ensure that the intervention has the best effect. In the two studies previously discussed (Koschwanez et al., 2013; Weinman et al., 2008), the intervention was administered prior to wounding. The research aims to understand if the timing can play a role in improving wound healing. Timing may be a very important factor in understanding exactly how the emotional disclosure intervention works and may be particularly relevant for injured populations, for whom which this intervention may be particularly helpful and may be more practical to administer after the injury or post-surgery.
