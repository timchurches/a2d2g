    <concealment>Healthy participants (n=12) will be drawn from in the Primary MK002 (n=100), who are not involved in the intervention of the primary study.  
These participants will be offered involvement in the sub-study. 

MCI participants will be recruited through the process of screening within our primary study. Those assessed as MCI would not be eligible for the primary study, so can be offered the sub study. Other MCI participants will be contacted from our research database). 

Allocation will be done by contacting via computer/phone an "off site" administrator, within another state, at a central research  office. </concealment>
    <sequence>A remote site, computer generated randomisation process will be used to allocate intervention or non-intervention to those recruited in the study, within each MCI and HC groups. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>In the current study, the main outcome variable used to assess differences between the two open label intervention groups and two non-intervention groups are epigenetic changes in inflammatory gene expression, as measured within the blood. 

Using the G*Power software (version 3.1.5) for Power analysis (1 - Beta) indicated a sample size N equals 12 per group is required to detect any significant differences between groups at greater than/ equal to 80% power and alpha equal to 0.05. The analysis may include 4 covariates (age, gender, APOE e4 allele status, education) and a commonly used F test (e.g. ANCOVA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the effect of curcumin taken orally, within a broader study investigating curcumin in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Participants will be allocated to either, no treatment or curcumin, for a period of 3-6 months. At the beginning and conclusion of the study, they will be required to undertake a brief cognitive assessment, answer lifestyle questions and donate blood. A once only mouth swab will also be taken. 
The intention of the study is to measure the influence of curcumin on the expression of inflammatory genetic markers, to examine if it is useful in reducing inflammation, by measuring associated proteins in the blood. 
The influence of curcumin on existing lifestyle patterns including sleep, activity levels and nutrition will also be examined through questionnaires at the end of the study.
