  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) What is being observed?
Australian podiatrists perspectives on complementary and alternative medicine therapies in podiatry.

b) Why is it being observed?
To date only one study so far has explored a similar theme. More research is warranted in this area.

c) How will it be observed?
Participating Australian podiatrists will be interviewed once via either a face-to-face interview, telephone interview or Skype (online) interview

d) What is involved in the interview?
Looks to explore 3 key themes through a mix of open ended questions that will vary based on the participants responses.
1.What are the perspectives of podiatrists on the utilization of Complimentary and Alternative Medicine and its effectiveness?
2.Which specific Complimentary and Alternative Medicine therapies should be classified as Complimentary and Alternative Medicine in podiatry and why?
3.Is there a need to integrate Complimentary and Alternative Medicine into the podiatric medicine education system? 

e) What are the duration(s) of the interview(s) being performed?
Interview times will range from 20-30 minutes.

f) If multiple interviews are conducted, what is the frequency of the interviews?
Each participant will be interviewed once only due to time constraints.

g) What is the total duration of this observational study?
We have given ourselves roughly 3 months to carry out the interview process and data collection.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Explore perceptions of Australian podiatrists on complementary and alternative medicine relating to clinical and personal experiences.

There will be extensive analysis of the responses given during the participant interviews which will consist of but not limited to; grouping common themes,listing of words associated with the topic, gauging the participants positive/negative attitude towards the subject, assessment of participant tone and body language, detailing positive/negative experiences with personal and clinical use etc.

To ensure all themes are covered we will use guiding questions to ensure each participant is interviewed uniformly but without leading to a robotic interview style and allowing for ease of conversation. This will hopefully lead to lengthier and more detailed responses and create a conducive interview environment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 3 months following data collection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the need for integration of education on complementary and alternative medicine in future Podiatric degrees.

This theme will be explored in each interview to assess their personal opinions on whether complementary and alternative medicine has a place in the curriculum of podiatry degrees and whether this will make for better practitioners.</outcome>
