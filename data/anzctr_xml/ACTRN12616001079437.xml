    <interventions>Motivational Interviewing + Oncology Rehabilitation Program
The motivational interviewing group will receive weekly half hour telephone calls for 7 weeks in addition to their rehabilitation program. These calls will be aimed at promoting physical activity using a motivational interviewing style whereby the therapist guides the patient to come up with their own reasons for changing physical activity behaviour. Telephone calls will be individually tailored to each patient. The motivational interviewing will be conducted by a physiotherapist who has completed a 2 day group workshop in motivational interviewing run by a psychologist. They also will receive a minimum of 6, 1 hour individual coaching sessions by a motivational interviewing specialist. The proficiency of the physiotherapist in delivering motivational interviewing will be assessed on two occasions based on a role play by an independent assessor using the validated Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Scale version 4.1: once prior to the commencement of the intervention and once during the mid-point of the intervention. Adherence to telephone calls will be monitored through call log records of duration and topics covered by the therapist within each session.
All participants will receive 1 hour of exercise and 1 hour of education as
part of their usual rehabilitation program which will run twice weekly for 7 weeks. They will also receive a home exercise program and diary as per the control group.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group will receive 1 hour of exercise and 1 hour of education as part of a standard oncology rehabilitation program which will run twice weekly for 7 weeks. They will also receive a personalised written or video home exercise program and diary. 
The rehabilitation program will be completed in a group format with exercise individually tailored to each patient. Exercise will consist of aerobic, resistance balance and flexibility training and progressed according to an established protocol. 
The education program will follow the exercise sessions and will run for 1 hour each session. The group education sessions will provide information about topics related to coping with a cancer diagnosis and management of cancer as a chronic disease. 
The rehabilitation program will be run by a oncology trained nurse, physiotherapist and allied health assistant. A social worker, occupational therapist and dietician will also provide relevant education sessions.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) will be used to determine the effect of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes of amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity (minutes), sedentary time (minutes), step count, levels of inflammation, fatigue, mood, quality of life, self-efficacy, strength, and walking capacity. Group means between groups at Week 8 will be compared using baseline scores as covariates. All available data will be analysed as per group allocation in accordance with the intention to treat principle.
To compare the amount of people meeting recommended physical activity guidelines (150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity achieved with and without bouts), numbers and percentages of participants meeting guidelines will be recorded at baseline and week 8 and odds ratios will be calculated through logistic regression. Any differences at baseline will be adjusted through logistic regression using baseline proportions and group allocation as independent variables.  
A minimum sample size of 38 has been calculated to be sufficient for power of  0.80 and two-tailed alpha level of 0.05 to detect a large standardised mean difference of 0.97 based on the assumption that moderate to vigorous physical activity levels of patients enrolled for oncology rehabilitation in the intervention group would increase from 12.2 minutes per day to 21 minutes per day (150 minutes per week) in order to achieve physical activity guidelines. To account for 20% attrition, 46 participants will be recruited.
Qualitative analysis will also be completed to explore differences between the motivational interviewing and standard rehabilitation groups to gain a deeper understanding about patient perspectives about their experience with the Oncology Rehabilitation Program. Participants for the qualitative phase of the study will be recruited through purposive sampling, and invited to complete a 20 to 30 minute interview at the completion of the rehabilitation program. Approximately 20 participants (10 per group) will be selected or until data saturation, that is a sufficient number of participants have been interviewed with no new themes occurring.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether motivational interviewing, when added to a standard cancer rehabilitation program, improves physical activity levels and other health and well-being related outcomes.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enrol in this trial if you are aged 18 or over, have been diagnosed with any cancer for which you are currently undergoing treatment or have completed adjuvant therapy in the last 12 months, and have been referred for rehabilitation at Eastern Health.

Study details
All participants will receive the standard oncology rehabilitation program, which lasts 7 weeks and involves weekly group exercise and education sessions as well as a home exercise program and exercise diary. Participants will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive this rehabilitation program alone, or to receive motivational interviewing from a physiotherapist via telephone in addition to the rehabilitation program. Participants allocated to this motivational interviewing group will receive 7 weekly telephone calls from a physiotherapist, of approximately 30 minutes in duration, to encourage participants to complete more physical activity.

Participants will be asked to wear an activity tracking device and complete a number of questionnaires and physical function tests at the end of the 7 weeks, and some participants will also complete interviews with researchers to provide feedback on the program.

It is hoped that this trial will provide evidence about the use of motivational interviewing during an oncology rehabilitation program to inform therapists and managers whether this is an effective intervention to facilitate positive physical activity behaviour. </summary>
