          7. Positive pregnancy test at Screening or Baseline.

          8. History of any medically significant condition considered by the Investigator to
             adversely affect participation in the trial.

             Screening to Baseline.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety of weekly injections of Nexvax2
      given for three weeks to patients with coeliac disease who have been on a gluten-free diet.

      The second purpose of this study is to compare the immune response over the three week study
      period in coeliac disease patients given Nexvax2 compared to those given saline.</summary>
