  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A total of 400 participants will be recruited from 20 retirement villages (intervention group villages n=10: control group villages n=10). Participants will be required to be aged 60 to 75 years; insufficiently active (not achieving the recommended level of 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week); on no special diet; not involved in another special physical activity program, and able to participate in a low-stress physical activity program with minimal risk to overall health and wellbeing. Couples may enter the control or intervention group together but cannot be allocated to separate groups (risk of contamination).The program is for the age group 60-75 y. The prevalence of underweight (&lt;18.5 BMI) is low in this age group. However, at risk participants identified will be referred to their GP for follow- up and excluded from the study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>A Physical Activity Readiness (PAR_Q)questionnaire and a medical clearance form will be completed on enrollment. This will allow for those deemed high risk to be eliminated from the study.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants in the 20 retirement villages will be sent a postcard explaining the intervention project, their rights and confidentiality details. They will be asked to sign and return the postcard if they are willing to participate in the research. This procedure has been used by the Investigators to enhance recruitment in previous projects with this age group. There will be a staggered entry into the intervention of 50 participants per week over a 3-month timeframe. The intervention group (n=200) will receive the intervention program. Requests to complete the self-administered questionnaire at baseline and 6-months  will be the only contact the control group will receive from project staff. Incentives will be provided to all participants as used in such previous research.The method of allocation concealment will be done by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical activity levels of Australias ageing population are declining, while their rates of overweight and obesity are increasing. Physical activity and a healthy diet are recognised as important in maintaining a healthy weight and preventing chronic disease. The retirement village provides a unique setting to access and engage with this older target group, to test the effectiveness of strategies to increase levels of physical activity, improve nutrition and maintain a healthy weight. 
      This large scale RCT will evaluate a physical activity, nutrition and healthy weight management intervention for adults aged 60-75 years residing in retirement villages that will ultimately reduce chronic disease (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers).
       By the end of the intervention we anticipate that there will be a significant improvement in physical activity (time/intensity) and dietary behaviours (10% reduction in dietary fat; 10%fibre intake; 10% increase in fruit/vegetables consumption), and body composition of the intervention group participants, compared to the control group participants.</summary>
