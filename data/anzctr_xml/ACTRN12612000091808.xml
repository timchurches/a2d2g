  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group A: Best practice therapy.
Best practise therapy provided by an occupational or physical therapist including evidence-based protocols for casting, electrical stimulation, task-specific movement training and home practise. 14 sessions (1 hour per session) of best practice therapy is provided over 8 weeks (2 weeks of casting (1 session per week), followed by  2 weeks of 3 x weekly therapy, then 2 weeks of 2x weekly therapy, and finishing with 2 weeks of 1 x weekly therapy).

Group B: Best practise therapy plus botulinum toxin injections. 
A single dose of Botulinum toxin- A will be injected at baseline only and follow the 2009 British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine national guidelines (Spasticity in adults: management using botulinum toxin). 
Botox (Registered Trademark) botulinum toxin type A toxin is used in this trial. 
Botulinum toxin-A is injected intramuscularly into specifically selected muscles, determined by the treating rehabilitation physician. Larger superficial muscles may be identified with knowledge of surface anatomy; smaller muscles may require use of nerve stimulation or EMG to ensure correct placement of the injection,
Dose will be individually determined based on the participant's identified needs and clinical goals. A maximum dose of 360U Botox (Registered Trademark) will be provided in a single adult injection session.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation Concealment
A set of random numbers will be used to create an allocation sequence which will be contained in individual opaque envelopes for use by the chief investigator. As a person is recruited, the next envelope in the sequence is opened and the participant assigned to the stated group.
Implementation
All randomisation, sequence generation, and preparation of group allocation materials will be performed by a third party who has no direct contact with the clinical aspects of the trial. Telephone allocation will be administered by a research assistant; and this will occur after completion of all baseline outcome assessments.
Blinding Arrangements
Due to the overt nature of the interventions, participants (and their carers) and the injecting physician will not be blinded to group assignment.  Assessors of outcomes will be blinded to group assignment, as will treating therapists who are providing the intensive therapy program.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be block randomised into three groups (1:1:1) using a computer generated set of random numbers with groups equal at one timepoint (unknown) prior to end of treatment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will evaluate a client-centred motor-training intervention to improve functional outcome after botulinum toxin injection (BoNT-A) for people with a neurological injury (stroke or brain injury). Spasticity is common following stroke and those with greater spasticity typically experience less recovery. Current treatment for spasticity is to provide BoNT-A, an antispasticity drug. Some evidence exists to support the use of BoNT-A, but all studies recommend that BoNT-A be provided in conjunction with physical therapy. However, little direct evidence exists for optimum type, dosage and timing of therapy. Participants will be recruited on a consecutive admission basis from hospital outpatient spasticity clinic and receive an 8-week intervention which will include intensive one-on-one physiotherapy, behavioural strategies to increase patient motivation, and a task-specific home exercise program. A distinguishing feature of the program is that it is tailored to the specific needs of each participant, patients are extended to receive intensive physiotherapy practice, and the content is driven by the Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management (National Stroke Foundation, 2010). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 months following the conclusion of intervention and will include assessment of functional movement, quality of life, and cost.</summary>
