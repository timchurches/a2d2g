  <interventions>
    <interventions>Combination of alfenatnil and propofol in different dose combinations given to patients and studied in cross-over design to determine influence on ECT duartion and quality. 

Most patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have six treatments on alternate days during a course. Every patient recruited into the study will have four treatments during the study period. Each of these patients will receive four treatments as part of a ECT course on alternate days. All patients will receive either drug A, B, C or D for induction on a particular day. 

Group A 30 patients will receive intravenous (iv) propofol (PPF) 0.5 mg/kg along with iv alfentanil 10 mcg/kg 

Group B 30 patients will receive iv PPF 0.75 mg/kg along with iv alfentanil 10 mcg/kg 

Group C 30 patients will receive iv PPF 1.0 mg/kg 

Group D 30 patients will receive iv Thiopentone 3.0 mg/kg

Wash-out period for these treatments would be approximately 48 hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a project being jointly conducted by departments of Anesthesia and Psychiatry at Ballarat Health Services.  

Anaesthetic agents such as hypnotics tend to increase the seizure threshold in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Consequently, higher current strength may be required to induce seizure activity. 

This study aims to reduce the dose of such anaesthetic agents. However, this does not imply that patients will be awake or partially awake at the time of ECT. Agents that do not increase seizure threshold such as opioids would be used in combination with hypnotics. In fact, a monitor to record depth of anaesthesia, will be employed during this study to ensure patients are asleep before ECT is administered.

This study will be approved by Ballarat Health Services  and St John of God Human Research and Ethics Committee.

The main aim of the study is to determine optimal dose of anesthetic agents used with or without opioid to induce good quality seizure.</summary>
