  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Foot orthoses are a modality of treatment frequently used mainly to relieve the pain caused by plantar fasciitis. This randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness of prefabricated and customized foot orthoses made in ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), a cheap raw material not commonly cited in previous trials.
Methods: A double-blinded, randomized trial was conducted from May 2004 to July 2005. Each participant was reviewed at four and eight weeks after the initial appointment. One hundred and forty-two patients were randomly allocated to receive a prefabricated or a customized foot orthosis, both made in EVA. The primary and secondary outcomes were pain, both measured by a visual analog scale and the previous was measured by the pain sub-scale of the Foot Function Index (FFI-pain) and later by palpation in the medial calcaneal tuberosity.</summary>
