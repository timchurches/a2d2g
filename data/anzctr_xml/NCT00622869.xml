    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus (reduced tacrolimus)
Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus (tacrolimus elimination)
Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus (tacrolimus control)
Treatment: drugs - Everolimus (reduced tacrolimus)
Treatment: drugs - Everolimus (tacrolimus elimination)
Treatment: drugs - Corticosteroids

Experimental: Everolimus + reduced tacrolimus - Low dose tacrolimus (tacrolimus reduced) + everolimus + corticosteroids.

Experimental: Tacrolimus elimination - Low-dose tacrolimus (until Month 4, then tacrolimus eliminated) + everolimus + corticosteroids.

Active Comparator: Tacrolimus control - Control dose tacrolimus + corticosteroids.


Treatment: drugs: Tacrolimus (reduced tacrolimus)
After everolimus whole blood trough levels were confirmed to be in the target range of 3-8 ng/mL, tacrolimus tapering began, achieving a target tacrolimus whole blood trough level of 3-5 ng/mL by 3 weeks after randomization, a level which was maintained for the duration of the study.

Treatment: drugs: Tacrolimus (tacrolimus elimination)
After everolimus whole blood trough levels were confirmed to be in the target range of 3-8 ng/mL, tacrolimus tapering began, achieving a target tacrolimus whole blood trough level of 3-5 ng/mL by 3 weeks after randomization. Tacrolimus elimination was started beginning at Month 4. Tacrolimus was tapered after everolimus whole blood trough levels were within the target range of 6-10 ng/mL. Tacrolimus was completely eliminated by the end of Month 4.

Treatment: drugs: Tacrolimus (tacrolimus control)
Tacrolimus trough levels were targeted to be maintained at 8-12 ng/mL until Month 4. At Month 4, tacrolimus whole blood trough levels were decreased to a target trough level of 6-10 ng/mL for the remainder of the study.

Treatment: drugs: Everolimus (reduced tacrolimus)
Everolimus was started within 24 hours of randomization at a dose of 1.0 mg twice a day (bid, 2 mg daily dose). The dose was adjusted to maintain everolimus trough blood levels between 3-8 ng/mL for the duration of the study.

Treatment: drugs: Everolimus (tacrolimus elimination)
Everolimus was started within 24 hours of randomization at a dose of 1.0 mg twice a day (bid, 2 mg daily dose). The dose was adjusted to maintain everolimus trough blood levels between 3-8 ng/mL until Month 4; beginning with Month 4, the dose was adjusted to maintain everolimus trough blood levels between 6-10 ng/mL.

Treatment: drugs: Corticosteroids
For patients in all groups, corticosteroids were initiated at or prior to the time of transplantation according to local practice. Corticosteroids could be used for the duration of the study but could not be eliminated before Month 6.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence Rate of Composite Efficacy Failure From Randomization to Month 12 - Composite efficacy failure was defined as treated biopsy proven acute rejection (tBPAR), graft loss, or death. A BPAR was defined as an acute rejection confirmed by biopsy with a Rejection Activity Index (RAI) score = 3. tBPAR was defined as a BPAR which was treated with anti-rejection therapy. The RAI is used to score liver biopsies with acute rejection and is composed of 3 categories (portal inflammation, bile duct inflammation damage, venous endothelial inflammation) each scored on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) by a trained pathologist. The total RAI score = the sum of the scores of the 3 categories and ranges from 0 to 9, with a higher score indicating greater rejection. The graft was presumed to be lost on the day the patient was newly listed for a liver graft, they received a graft re-transplant, or they died.
The incidence rates of composite efficacy failure were estimated with a Kaplan-Meier product-limit formula.</outcome>

      <outcome>Incidence Rate of Composite Efficacy Failure From Randomization to Month 24 - Composite efficacy failure was defined as treated biopsy proven acute rejection (tBPAR), graft loss, or death.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence Rate of Treated Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (tBPAR) at Months 12 and 24 - tBPAR was defined as an acute rejection confirmed by biopsy with a Rejection Activity Index (RAI) score = 3, which was treated with anti-rejection therapy. Liver biopsies were collected for all cases of suspected acute rejection preferably within 24 hours, at the latest within 48 hours, whenever clinically possible. The RAI is used to score liver biopsies with acute rejection and is composed of 3 categories (portal inflammation, bile duct inflammation damage, venous endothelial inflammation) each scored on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) by a trained pathologist. The total RAI score = the sum of the scores of the 3 categories and ranges from 0 to 9, with a higher score indicating greater rejection. The graft was presumed to be lost on the day the patient was newly listed for a liver graft, they received a graft re-transplant, or they died.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Renal Function From Randomization to Months 12 and 24 - Change in renal function was assessed by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the abbreviated (4 variables) Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-4) formula which was developed by the MDRD Study Group and has been validated in patients with chronic kidney disease. The MDRD-4 formula used for the eGFR calculation is: eGFR (mL/min/1.73m^2) = 186.3*(C^-1.154)*(A^-0.203)*G*R, where C is the serum concentration of creatinine (mg/dL), A is age (years), G=0.742 when gender is female, otherwise G=1, R=1.21 when race is black, otherwise R=1.
The changes in renal function were analyzed via analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, pre-transplant hepatitis C virus status and randomization eGFR as covariates. Based on these ANCOVA analyses, the least-squares mean and standard errors of change were reported.</outcome>
