    <comparator>All participants in the control arm will receive a 12-week supply of  varenicline tablet. The recommended dosing schedule includes:
1 to 3 days  One 0.5 mg tablet/day

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cytisine in comparison with varenicline. A total of 1266 smokers will be recruited from state Quitline services. Participants will have an equal chance of being randomly allocated to either the intervention or control arm (1:1 ratio).

Participants in the intervention arm will receive a 25-day supply of cytisine capsules (1.5 mg cytisine). Participants in the varenicline arm will receive a 12-week supply of varenicline tablet (0.5 mg/1.0 mg varenicline). All participants will also receive standard Quitline behavioural support. 

All participants will be followed-up for six months and the follow-up interviews will be held at one, three and six months after the quit date. The main outcome measures are abstinence from smoking at one, three and six months follow-ups.</summary>
