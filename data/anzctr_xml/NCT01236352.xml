    <summary>The purpose of this first in human study is to determine if BMS-911543 is safe and tolerable
      in subjects with symptomatic intermediate-1, intermediate-2 or high risk myelofibrosis to
      permit clinical testing at the Maximum Tolerated Dose or at a Clinically Active Dose, and to
      determine if BMS-911543 will demonstrate efficacy in symptomatic myelofibrosis.</summary>
