    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This was a double blind randomized trial. Patients enrolled from a hospital clinic in Auckland, NZ following completion of written consent. Prior to randomization to treatment, patients completed a 4 week single-blind run-in period of 2 placebo capsules twice daily, for which = 90% compliance was required for progression into the trial. Patients meeting inclusion criteria then randomized to receive trientine or identical placebo capsules. Treatment
assignment was performed centrally using variable block sizes to ensure
balance throughout trial recruitment and numbered drug packs were
prepared and dispensed sequentially to randomized patients</concealment>
    <sequence>Random order of subject enrollment into treatment groups without stratification was performed by permuted block randomisation to ensure balance throughout enrollment, using a computer software programme contained with SAS v8.01 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was designed to assess the effects of the drug triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride on cardiac dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and demonstrable cardiac dysfunction. Previous treatment of diabetic rats has shown significant improvement in structure and function of the heart, including alleviation of heart failure through significant cardiac regeneration, and clinical studies have shown that TETA.2HCl may work through chelation and excretion of copper (Cu) in urine. This study was designed to measure indices of cardiac structure over a 12 month intervention period and hypothesized that markers of diastolic dysfunction in T2DM would be improved on treatment versus placebo.</summary>
