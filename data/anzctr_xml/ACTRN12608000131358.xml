    <interventions>Phase One: cross-sectional comparison between females with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)

Phase Two: the effects of a single 45 minute exercise session (aerobic or power exercises) on plasma uncarboxylated osteocalcin (unc-OC), adionectine (AN) and c-peptide. Blood samples will be taken before exercise, immediately after and at 0.5, 1, 2, 24 and 48 hours post exercise. 

Phase Three: Participants will be randomised to six months of either power training or aerobic training (each session will be 60 minutes, 3 sessions per week) and 12 months of follow-up</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin (unc-OC) will be 
analysed based on a sandwich type electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) utilizing anti-OCG3 mouse monoclonal antibody labelled with Ruthenium (Ru) which luminates with electric stimuli. Magnetic beads bound to anti GluOC 4-5 mouse monoclonal antibody is used as a solid phase. After binding the unc-OC in the sample with the GluOC4-5 bound beads and Ru labelled OCG3, an electric impulse is applied via an electrode. The level of luminescence for the Ru complexes bound to solid phase antibody reflects the amount of unc-OC in the sample. The concentration of the unc-OC in the sample is measured by comparing the sample's luminescence to that of a calibrated solution of known unc-OC standards</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria for the non-diabetic group. Fasting blood glucose &lt;5.6 mmol/L, or individuals who are unable to exercise. In addition, participants who are already involved in regular vigorous physical training in the preceding 6 months.

Exclusion criteria individuals with T2DM. Individuals with unstable T2DM, individuals on sulfonylureas or insulin therapy and individuals who have participated in regular vigorous resistance training in the preceding 6 months will be excluded from the study. Also, patients unable to exercise will be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Females will be divided into two groups (a) non-diabetic, and (b) diabetic. The non-diabetic group will be matched to the T2DM group for age and menopausal status.
Each group (i.e. T2DM and non-diabetics) will then be randomly allocated (sealed opaque envelops) into power or aerobic training groups (i.e. T2DM power and T2DM aerobic and non-diabetic power and non-diabetic aerobic). Randomization will be stratified according to pre/post menopause to ensure a similar number of pre menopause and post menopause females in each subgroup.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method of randomisation for this study is Stratified allocation. The randomisation is according to menopausal state. There will be two different sets of sealed envelopes for those with T2DM and those without T2DM.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine the links between bone structure and metabolism, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and exercise. First, we aim to test the hypothesis that bone is implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM through mechanisms involving osteocalcin (OC) in its uncarboxylated (unc-OC) form. Second, we aim to examine the acute and chronic effects of a novel form of exercise training for people with T2DM, power training, and compare it to aerobic training on osteocalcin-mediated effects on glucose metabolism in females with and without T2DM. 

Hypotheses

Phase One:  Bone structural abnormalities are present in patients with T2DM, compared to non-diabetic individuals matched for aged, body mass index (BMI), although bone mineral density (BMD) is high. 

Phase 2: Acute effects of exercise: In both non-diabetic females and those with T2DM, power exercise will result in greater increases in unc-OC and high molecular weight (HMW)-adiponectin (AN) levels, compared to the acute effects of aerobic exercise.

Phase 3 Chronic effects of exercise: In both non-diabetic females and those with T2DM, power training will result in greater improvements in bone structural strength and a shift of bone remodelling balance towards greater formation than for aerobic exercise training.</summary>
