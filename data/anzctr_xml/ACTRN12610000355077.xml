  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Small amounts of sweet tasting sugar water reduces pain in babies during painful blood tests and injections. We do not know if sugar also reduces pain in toddlers and young children. This project will help to determine if small amounts of sugar water reduce pain in toddlers during their immunisations and venepuncture and if sucking on a lollypop helps to reduce pain in pre-school children between 3 and 5 years of age during their injections for immunisation. The immunisation part of this study will be done in the Royal Childrens Hospital Immunisation Centre where mothers and fathers bring their children in to have their scheduled childhood immunisations done. The part of the study examining sucrose efficacy in hospitalized toddlers during venepuncture will be conducted in Canada, at CHEO in a surgical ward.</summary>
