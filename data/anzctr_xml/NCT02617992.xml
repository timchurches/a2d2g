    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Histological characteristics of post-EMR scar biopsies</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Scar size - Scar size (maximum dimension)</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence of post EMR scar with clip artifact - Presence of post EMR scar with clip artifact, recognized as one or more nodule within the scar with a normal pit pattern</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of sites of recurrence - Number of sites of recurrence (unifocal, 2 sites, 3 or more sites)</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Location of recurrence - Location of recurrence (edge of the scar, within the scar or both)</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Morphology of recurrence - Morphology of recurrence (flat or elevated)</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kudo pit pattern assessment - Kudo pit pattern and whether the pit pattern of recurrence is only seen with NBI</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>NICE classification - As recurrence is diminutive the NICE classification is also applied and so the NBI appearance of recurrence (darker or lighter than the scar) is noted.</outcome>
