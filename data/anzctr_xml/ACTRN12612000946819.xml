  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventions being used include the Ropinirole transdermal patch - 8 cm2 transdermal patch, containing 3.84 mg of ropinirole and targeted to deliver 2 mg with each daily application and Requip[Registered Trademark] XL[Trademark] (ropinirole extended release tablets, 2 mg) - 2mg oral tablet.

The study will be conducted in 24 healthy volunteers divided into 2 treatment groups that will be run in parallel (at the same time).

Group 1:  will receive a single ropinirole transdermal patch application and a single Requip[Registered Trademark] XL[Trademark]  tablet (or vice-versa) separated by a 3-day washout period 

Group 2: will receive 5 consecutive daily ropinirole transdermal patches and 5 consecutive daily Requip[Registered Trademark] XL[Trademark] tablets (or vice-versa) separated by a 3-day washout period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of ropinirole following single and repeat (5) administrations of the Ropinirole Transdermal Patch compared with single and repeat doses of oral Requip XL extended release tablets.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Group 1: PK sampling will start on each treatment day (ie, Days 1 and 5) according to the following schedule: predose, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 36, and 48 h after dosing (with the transdermal patch or the oral tablet).

Group 2: Based on randomization, the PK sampling schedule is as follows:
Ropinirole Transdermal Patch:
Day 1 or 9:  predose, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 h after application of the first patch
Days 2-4 or Days 10-12:  predose, and 3, 6, and 9 h after application 
Day 5 or 13:  predose, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 36, and 48 h after application of the last (5th) patch
Requip XL tablet:
Days 1-4 or Days 9-12:  predose
Day 5 or 13:  predose, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 36, and 48 h after dosing</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess safety and tolerability of the Ropinirole Transdermal Patch including assessment of skin irritation using a modified Draize scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Skin irritation will be assessed at 1 and 24 h after removal of each patch.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess adhesion of the Ropinirole Transdermal Patch using observations that will be quantified using the scoring system described in the Protocol (Patch Adhesion Scale).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patch adhesion will be assessed at 6, 12, and 18 h after application and immediately prior to removal of each patch.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to compare the concentration of Ropinirole in the blood after application of the patch to the concentration of Ropinirole in the blood after taking the tablet formulation.

The study will also look at how safe the Ropinirole patch is, as well as how well subjects tolerate the dose delivered transdermally (study drug is absorbed through the skin).</summary>
