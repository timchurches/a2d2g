      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Viral Load at Week 24 and Week 48 by Overall Susceptibility Score (OSS) at Screening - Association between baseline resistance and virological response was assessed as change in viral load by OSS at screening. OSS categorized as 0, 1, 2, &gt;3 (maximum value of 6) and calculated as the sum of the net assessment of in-vitro phenotypic and genotypic susceptibility using a binary scoring system (0= resistant, 1= sensitive or susceptible) for each antiretroviral agent in OBT. Higher scores indicate greater susceptibility. Baseline value is the average of the values from screening, randomization and immediately pre-dose.</outcome>

    <summary>Maraviroc (UK-427,857), a selective and reversible CCR5 coreceptor antagonist, has been shown
      to be active in vitro against a wide range of clinical isolates (including those resistant to
      existing classes). In HIV-1 infected patients, maraviroc (UK-427,857) given as monotherapy
      for 10 days reduced HIV-1 viral load by up to 1.6 log, consistent with currently available
      agents. Safety and toleration have been studied in over 400 subjects for up to 28 days at 300
      mg twice daily. No significant effects were seen on the QTc interval. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the antiretroviral activity of maraviroc (UK-427,857) in HIV infected,
      treatment experienced patients who are failing their current antiretroviral regimen and
      infected with R5-tropic virus exclusively. This study will involve more than 100 centers in
      Europe and Australia to achieve a total randomized subject population of 500 subjects.
      Patients will be randomly (2:2:1) assigned to one of three groups: Optimized Background
      Therapy [OBT (3-6 drugs based on treatment history and resistance testing)] + maraviroc
      (UK-427,857) 150 mg taken once daily, OBT + maraviroc (UK-427,857) 150 mg taken twice daily,
      or OBT alone. The study will enroll over approximately a 9 month period with 48 weeks of
      treatment. This may be extended for an additional year depending on the results at 48 weeks.
      Physical examinations will be performed at study entry, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40
      and 48. Blood samples will also be taken at study entry, weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32,
      40 and 48. Additionally, blood samples will be drawn twice, at least 30 minutes apart, at
      weeks 2 and 24 for maraviroc (UK-427,857) pharmacokinetic analysis. As part of this clinical
      study a blood sample will also be taken for non-anonymized pharmacogenetic analysis. Patients
      will undergo a 12-lead electrocardiogram at study entry, weeks 24 and 48.</summary>
