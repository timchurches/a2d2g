  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will involve patients in the Emergency Department who already have an IVL insitu secured by a standard dressing and are admitted and awaiting a bed on the wards within the hospital. 
The research team will identify and consent these patients if they are otherwise eligible and fit the inclusion criteria.
If a patient is randomised to receive skin glue then their original dressing will be removed, glue applied to the IVL and allowed to dry (mater of minutes) before a new standard dressing is applied back over the top of the IVL. The skin glue applied is single use therefore one per patient used once only. 
If they are randomised to the control group then they will simply have their current standard dressing removed and replaced with another standard dressing. 
The research team will look at failure (IPOD) of the first IVL inserted in the patient by following the patient up either within the hospital or by telephoning them 48hrs after application of the dressing they have been randomised too. 
Those patients randomised to the intervention group will receive skin glue plus standard dressing to secure the IVL.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To reduce the failure rate of IVLs inserted in patients by reducing the combined poor outcomes of Infection, Phlebitis, Occlusion and Dislodgement (IPOD). 
Failure rate of the study IVL is defined by one or more of IPOD occuring.
-Infection is defined by cellulitis at the IVL insertion site. 
-Phlebitis is defined by two or more of these symptoms; pain, redness, swelling or a palpable venous cord. 
-Occlusion is defined by when 5ml of 0.9% saline can not be easily 'flushed' through or when the IVL has been removed due to clinical staff stating the IVL 'was not working'. 
-Dislodgement is defined by either evidence of subcutaneous extravasation or IVL no longer present at the insertion site.
Failure of the first IVL inserted in the patient as a result of IPOD will be assessed and decided upon by the researcher who is also a health clinician. The researcher will look for and/or ask about IPOD associated clinical signs and symptoms when they follow the patient up at 48hrs either in person on the wards or by telephone.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients enrolled in the trial will be followed up once only. This will be at 48hrs after they have had their IVL dressing changed for the purposes of being part of the trial.
They will be followed up by the researchers either in person on the wards within the hospital or by telephone. This is regardless of whether they have been randomised to have skin glue plus standard dressing or standard dressing only.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-Informed written consent by patient or legal decision maker
-Presence of either a pre-hospital (Queensland Ambulance Service) inserted upper limb IVL or clinical indication for an Emergency Department inserted upper limb IVL.
-Decision by Emergency Department staff that patient is to be admitted to hospital therefore IVL expected to be in place greater than 24 hours.
-Patient aged 18years or over.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>If the patient is considered to be or have any of the following then they will be excluded from the study. 
-Is less than 18 years of age.
-History of allergy or irritation to either standard IVL. insertion materials or skin glue.
-IVL inserted through non-intact (eg area of abrasion or blistering) or diaphoretic skin (too sweaty to enable dressing adhesion).
-Pre-existing upper limb phlebitis, infection, venous thrombosis.
-Agitated patients wo are likely to pull IVL out.</exclusivecriteria>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>-Those patients who have an IVL and who are to be admitted to hospital and are waiting to be transferred from the Emergency Department to the ward will be identified.
-From this group only those that match the inclusion criteria for selection and do not match the exclusion criteria for selection will be approached by the research team.
-These patients will be given an explanation of the study first before voluntary written consent is obtained. 
-Patients who provide consent will be randomised to either the use of skin glue plus a standard dressing or standard dressing only.
-The researcher who determines if a patient is eligible for inclusion in the study is unaware when the patient is consented whether or not they will receive skin glue plus a standard dressing to secure their IVL or just a standard dressing to secure their IVL. The patient will be randomised using an approved randomisation app on the research iPAD. 
-Patients current dressing will be removed and replaced depending on the group the patient is randomised too.
-Patients details will then be entered electronically onto a data sheet application available on the iPad.
-The patient will then be followed up in person on the wards within the hospital or by phone within 48hrs of the dressing change.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomisation application will be available to use on the research iPad allowing for computerised sequence generation.</sequence>

    <summary>The study involves the addition of skin glue to the insertion site of a routinely inserted peripheral intravenous line (IVL) which is expected to reduce the IVL failure rate, by reducing the combined poor outcomes of Infection, Phlebitis, Occlusion and/or Dislodgement, in those patients that are admitted to hospital.</summary>
