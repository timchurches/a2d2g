  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study designed to identify a dose of NIM811 that has a good safety profile, is well
      tolerated when co-administered with SOC, and provides a clinically meaningful effect in viral
      load reduction compared to SOC alone. This information will be used to support doses selected
      for future studies.</summary>
