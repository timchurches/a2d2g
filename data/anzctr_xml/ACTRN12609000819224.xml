If selected to recieve treatment via videoconference participants will be given 12 weeks of structured cognitive behavioural therapy. Each session will be conducted weekly for one hour at a time most convient to both the therapist and participant. There will be a total of 13 sessions. Participants will be measured on several symptom measure before treatment, at the end of treatment and then 6-weeks after treatment has ended.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the efficacy of cognitive behavioural psychotherapy via videoconference. 

Structured Interview For the DSM-IV- will be used for assessmetn and diagnosis. 
Primary Measures:
Depression Anxiety Stress scale (DASS)
Quality Of Life &amp; Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES)
This will assessed by using a 2x3 (VC-F2F x pre-post-follow up) Analysis of Covariance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>November 2009- January 2011

All participants will be treated within this period. When their assessment/diagnosis occurs depend on when they are referred to the Curtin Psychology Clinic. The questionnaires used on the day of the first assessment will constitute the pre-treatment measure.  Treatment will be conducted for a maximum of 12 weeks. Measures administered at the start of treatment will also be provided at the end of treatment (post-treatment data). Then 6-weeks after treatment has ended the same questionnaires will be given to participants, which will constitute the follow-up data.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To analyze the clinical significance and reliable change of pre-post-follow up participant scores. 

In addition to the primary measure, participants will be given an additional symptom specific measure that is more relevant to their primary diagnosis. For example-
Depression-Beck depression inventory
Social phobia- brief fear of negative evaluation
Panic disorder- anxiety sensitivity index
Post traumatic stress disorder- Impact of events scale
Obsessive compulsive disorder- Obsessive compulsive inventory 
Generalized anxiety disorder- penn state worry questionnaire 
For other non specificed depression/anxiety disorders the depression and anxiety stress scale (DASS) will suffice. 
These measures will be used to calculate the clinical significance and reliable change.</outcome>
      <timepoint>November 2009- January 2011

All participants will be treated within this period. When their assessment/diagnosis occurs depend on when they are referred to the Curtin Psychology Clinic. The specific symptom measure will be administered before their first treatment session and will constitute the pre-treatment measure.  Treatment will be conducted for a maximum of 12 weeks. Measure administered at the start of treatment will also be provided at the end of treatment (post-treatment data). Then 6-weeks after treatment has ended the same questionnaire will be given to participants, which will constitute the follow-up data.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After being referred to the Curtin Adult Psychology Clinic, the first one or two sessions will be to determine a diagnosis. These sessions will be done by a therapist in person. Then, participants will be randomly selected to receive treatment either in-person or via videoconference. Therapy done in-person will not be different from standard practice. If selected to receive treatment via videoconference participants will not be in the same room as their therapist. When participants arrive at the clinic they will be guided into a private room. In this room participants will be able to hear and see their therapist via a computer. Participants will not need to know how to use the computer. All participants will be asked to complete several brief questionnaires. These questionnaires will be given to participants when treatment begins and 12-weeks later, when treatment ends. Finally, these questionnaires will be sent to you by post (with a payed return envelope) 6-weeks after treatment has ended. The method of allocation consealment involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was at the central administration site</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomized list of 0's and 1's, whereby 0= the inperson condition and 1= the videoconference condition, was generated for 200 potential participants using a random generator from the site http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Traditionally, therapists treat clients in the same room. However, many people do not have direct access to such services. Recent advances in computer technology have made it possible to see and hear someone who is not in the same room. This form of contact is called videoconferencing. Hence, the purpose of this research is to study how successful treatment is via this medium.</summary>
