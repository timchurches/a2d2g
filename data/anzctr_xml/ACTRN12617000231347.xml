  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a 'slow tempo' chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to take part in this trial if you have newly diagnosed AML and are aged 65 or over, or are unable to undergo standard care chemotherapy; if you have untreated secondary AML or transformed AML and are aged 18yrs or over; or if you have relapsed or refractory AML are you are aged 18 or over.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will undergo the slow tempo chemotherapy treatment regimen, which will involve 35-day cycles of induction chemotherapy until remission is achieved, followed by three 35-day cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, lastly followed by 42-day chemotherapy cycles for two years. Participants will be assessed for disease progression and for treatment side effects throughout the treatment.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether slow tempo chemotherapy with low dose cytarabine and thioguanine is safe, tolerable and effective in the treatment of newly diagnosed and refractory/relapsed AML.
