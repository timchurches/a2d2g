  <interventions>
    <interventions>Work-circuit group based Physiotherapy for a mixed group of Orthopaedic patients. 
-Exercises included balance, mobility, strengthening and range of movement exercises in a group setting. In standing, sitting and lying.
-Exercises were completed at a moderate intensity
-Frequency: Participants completed an individual circuit for 30minutes one-on-one with a Physiotherapist in the morning and a group work-circuit for 30 minutes in the afternoon. Thus 2x30min circuit exercises per day.
-Administered by a Physiotherapist and Physiotherapist Aid
-Monitor of adherence completed via medical records and an exercise sheet.
-Duration of the intervention was 12 weeks.

-Assessed via outcome measures of balance and mobility.
-Outcome measures used were the BERG balance scale, the Modified Elderly Mobility Scale (MEMS), the timed-up-and-go test and the 10 metre walk test.</outcome>

      <outcome>Improved function
-Impairments assessed with the following outcome measures: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR) for quadriceps strength and function.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost effective rehabilitation
a) Assessed by the amount of staff needed to administer the interventions. Eg. group work circuit intervention allows one Physiotherapist and one Physiotherapist Aid (x2 staff) for 6-8 patients. Whereas one-on-one Physiotherapy intervention utilises one Physiotherapist per one patient.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>To maintain confidentiality, all data collected was de-identified and a coded system based on group allocation was used. The beds (and thus participants) had been randomised A and B; the data was recorded A1, B1, A2, B2 etc. This maintained confidentiality and proved effective for data entry in preparation for data analyses. The statistical software used for the analysis was SPSS version 17. Descriptive statistics included: age, gender, condition, the randomised treatment option and the length of stay in rehabilitation. 

Independent samples t-test was used to test the difference between the two intervention groups.  Paired t-tests were used to demonstrate within group change from the individual or group work-circuit interventions for all balance and mobility data (MEMS, BERG Test, TUG Test, 10MWT and VAS). For those variables using an ordinal scale (Mobility Aid used for the 10MWT and the TUG Test), a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used while the Sing test was used to investigate the SLR test (able/unable to SLR). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Question: Is group work-circuit physiotherapy an effective model for orthopaedic rehabilitation or is individual therapy more beneficial? Design: Randomised control trial, single-blinded. Participants:  Twenty-one in-patients with an orthopaedic problem participated in rehabilitation at John Flynn Private Hospital, Tugun, Queensland. Intervention:  All participants received physiotherapy twice daily, six days a week for a variable period (one to three weeks) depending on length of stay (LOS). Each participant had an individualised physiotherapy session in the morning for 30 minutes and then were randomly allocated a further 30 minutes of individualised treatment (Group A) or participated in a group work-circuit physiotherapy program (Group B) in the afternoon. Outcome measures:  Measures were undertaken at admission/discharge for all patients admitted to the study. Demographics (age, gender, condition, LOS), pain level (Visual Analogue Scale) and the ability to straight leg raise (able/unable) were recorded. Balance and mobility measures included: the Berg Balance Scale, the Modified Elderly Mobility Scale, the 10 metre walk test and the Timed Up and Go test. Results: This pilot study demonstrated that both the individual and group work-circuit interventions are effective treatment options for a mixed group of orthopaedic patients. Participants in individual and group work-circuit interventions improved in all balance and mobility outcome measures (p&lt;0.05), but only the work-circuit group reported less pain (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion:  These preliminary results show that both intervention and models are effective for the rehabilitation of people with orthopaedic problems. These results indicated that group work-circuit therapy is a cost-effective model for orthopaedic rehabilitation.</summary>
