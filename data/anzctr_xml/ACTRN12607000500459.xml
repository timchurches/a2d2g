  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is increasing evidence to suggest that the routine use of high flow oxygen in the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction (heart attack) may be harmful.  It seems likely that administration of oxygen at a level titrated (adjusted) to meet the oxygen needs of an individual patient may result in fewer adverse effects and improved patient outcomes than treatment with the standard high flow approach.  This trial will randomly allocate patients presenting at the coronary care unit with a type of heart attack called a STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction) to either high flow or titrated oxygen therapy.  The oxygen will be administered for 6 hours.  The effects of the different treatments will be determined by taking blood tests whilst the patient is in-hospital to look at levels of proteins called Troponin T and BNP.  The levels of these proteins act as indicators of the extent of damage that has happened in the heart.  The study will also look at patients survival rates and their overall cardiovascular well-being in hospital and for 30-days after their myocardial infarction and at approximately 4-6 weeks after discharge from hospital patients will have an MRI scan which can be used to determine the extent of damage to the heart.</summary>
