    <interventions>The objective of this cross-sectional observational study is to examine the correlation between total Vitamin D levels in blood serum, follicular fluid and semen with various parameters of male and female fertility including oocytes generated, and rates of fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and miscarriage. In addition, in vitro/ex vivo investigations will be performed to determine the relationship between Vitamin D status, and the bioenergetic profile of sperm and granulosa cells. 
For females, blood samples are routinely collected before and during IVF cycles to monitor estrogen and progesterone levels as per standard fertility assessment and treatment. An aliquot of these samples from consenting patients will be used to determine Vitamin D status (25 hydroxy vitamin D).
Follicular fluid and the granulosa cells within it will be collected from consenting patients as they undergo oocyte collection using transvaginal oocyte aspriation at the clinic.
For consenting males, an aliquot of semen will be collected for vitamin D testing and sperm testing following assessment of diagnostic semen parameters and/or insemination of all oocytes retrieved, Therefore the sample that is tested for Vitamin D and sperm function as part of this study is not required for further patient tests or use.

To assess the lengthiest outcome, live birth rate, patient data will be observed up to 12 months (1 year), so that live birth outcomes can be recorded. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pregnancy Rates (detection intrauterine gestational sac with foetal heart
beat at 7 weeks gestation)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Detection of intrauterine gestational sac with foetal heart using ultrasound is conducted at 7-8 weeks gestation or 7-8 post embryo transfer. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Live Birth Rates (delivery of a live infant showing any sign of life, for instance heartbeat and voluntary movement)</outcome>
      <timepoint>To determine whether or not a live birth has occurred, primary outcome [2] will be followed up from 9 months to 1 year after embryo transfer. This is due to the fact that after detection of a pregnancy, female patients come under the care of their selected obstetrician and selected maternity hospital. The timepoint described above allows  adequate time for the return of clinical information about the live birth outcomes from the maternity hospital to the IVF clinic.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oocytes Retrieved (defined as the number of all oocytes retrieved following ovum pick up [OPU])
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The number of oocytes retrieved will be assessed up to 3 months post oocyte collection/OPU.
Normally this information is captured in our database within 2-3 days of transvaginal oocyte aspiration/OPU, but this extended time frame allows adequate time for data entry by embryological staff depending on workload. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oocyte Maturity (defined as the number of all oocytes retrieved demonstrating one polar body)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The number of oocytes mature retrieved will be assessed up to 3 months post oocyte collection/OPU.
Normally this information is captured in our database within 2-3 days of transvaginal oocyte aspiration/OPU, but this extended time frame allows adequate time for data entry by embryological staff depending on workload. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fertilisation Rates (defined as the number of zygotes with 2 pronuclei after fertilisation as a proportion of all oocytes retrieved following OPU).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The fertilsation rate will be assessed up to 3 months post oocyte collection/OPU.
Normally this information is captured in our database within 2-3 days of transvaginal oocyte aspiration/OPU, but this extended time frame allows adequate time for data entry by embryological staff depending on workload. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fertilisation Rates (defined as the number of zygotes with 2 pronuclei after fertilisation as a proportion of all mature oocytes (M2) retrieved following OPU).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The fertilsation rate will be assessed up to 3 months post oocyte collection/OPU.
Normally this information is captured in our database within 2-3 days of transvaginal oocyte aspiration/OPU, but this extended time frame allows adequate time for data entry by embryological staff depending on workload. </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Utilisation Rates (defined as the total number of embryos cryopreserved or transferred back to the patient as a proportion of all oocytes retrieved or as a proportion of all mature oocytes (M2) retrieved following OPU).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Utilisation rates will be assessed up to 3 months post oocyte collection/OPU.
Normally this information is captured in our database within 2-3 days of transvaginal oocyte aspiration/OPU, but this extended time frame allows adequate time for data entry by embryological staff depending on workload. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Variability in oocyte quality is a major contributor to pregnancy rates during IVF . We wish to measure the concentration of various steroid and hormones including vitamin D in the follicle fluid and serum of IVF pateints during oocyte recovery and relate this to patient factors, stimulation and ovulation protocols to provide a better indication of their impact on oocyte and embryo quality and on pregnancy and implantation and live birth delivery rates.</summary>
