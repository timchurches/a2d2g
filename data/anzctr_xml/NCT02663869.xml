  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinical hypotheses:

      The increasing number of people aging with HIV is a matter of fact. Differences in prevalence
      of comorbidities between the general population and HIV-positive patients are mainly driven
      by duration of HIV infection rather than chronological age of HIV+ patients.

      People aging with HIV display heterogeneous health conditions. Host factors and duration of
      HIV infection are associated with increased risk of MM, independently from chronological age
      and these factors are responsible of the prevalence difference of comorbidities and MM in
      comparison to the general population.

      Objectives:

      The study objective is to assess the prevalence of, and risk factors for, individual
      co-morbidities and multi morbidity (MM) between HIV-positive patients with similar duration
      of HIV infection, but 30 years difference. We compared estimates across both groups to a
      matched community-based cohort sampled from the general population.</summary>
