  <interventions>
    <interventions>A simple open trial will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Benzodiazepine eHealth program (BDZ eHealth) that provides psycho-education and gradual reduction information. BDZ eHealth is designed to provide people with information and strategies to address their benzodiazepine use via five core modules, plus an Introduction module. 

The BDZ eHealth has five core modules are:

1. Benzodiazepines and Dependence: This module provides psycho-education around what BDZs are, dependency on BDZ, BDZ effectiveness and appropriate and inappropriate uses of BDZ.
2. The Pathway to Reduction: This module provides psycho-education on BDZ reduction and withdrawal processes, involving the 3 main steps in the BDZ reduction process
3. A Gradual Reduction Program (Case Illustration). This third module provides an illustrative case example of Peter outlining his gradual benzodiazepine reduction program over time.
4. Withdrawal Symptoms. This module provides information around what BDZ related withdrawal symptoms are, common and uncommon withdrawal symptoms, and the issues with going cold turkey.
5. Managing Withdrawal Symptoms: This module contains information and helpful strategies to help manage the reduction/withdrawal symptoms (e.g., controlled breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness meditation, problem solving, goal setting, increasing physical exercise, nutrition, sleep hygiene).


All modules are open from the first log in and each module will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Participants are encouraged to first read the Introduction module and then work through the other program modules at their own pace, over the 5 weeks. Given the open access nature of the program modules, participants are free to choose whether they work through the modules sequentially or not. Participants will receive automated emails (e.g., to log on, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions at the beginning of each week, to monitor their progress and activities. Modules make use of text, graphics, audio, video, editable forms and downloads. Modules can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. We also encourage participants to make use of the Reconnexion benzodiazepine telephone support service while undertaking the BDZ eHealth program, as well as work in conjunction with their doctor should they wish to commence benzodiazepine reduction. 


Participants will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 1 - 5) assessments, a post-intervention assessment (Week 6) and a 1 and 3 month follow-up assessment (Week 10 &amp; Week 18 respectively). Participants will continue to have access to the program for the entire duration of the trial. Participants will also be asked to complete a short online questionnaire to determine the reasons for their engagement/disengagement with the program.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Pre-, post- and follow-up variables will be subjected to within group repeated measures ANOVA and MANOVA to determine significant changes over time.
2. Correlational and multiple regression analyses will be used to determine any potential predictors and discriminators of attrition and adherence.
3. Open ended data obtained from intervention satisfaction may be analysed using protocols of content analysis to identify common themes.

We have conservatively applied a small-medium effect size. Therefore, assuming a small-medium effect (i.e. GPower f test = 0.25), significance set at 5% (p = .05) and power at 80%, a total sample size of 63 (this figure also accounts for an expected attrition rate of 30%) will be required to demonstrate statistical significance on the primary outcome measure. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A simple open trial will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Benzodiazepine eHealth program (BDZ eHealth) that provides psycho-education and gradual reduction information. BDZ eHealth can be accessed on multiple devices (desk top, tablet and mobile). People, who visit the website, either directly or through seeing the study advertised, will be invited to take part in the BDZ eHealth evaluation study.

BDZ eHealth is designed to provide people with information and strategies to address their benzodiazepine use via five core modules, plus an Introduction module. Each module will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Participants will receive automated emails (e.g., on completion of a module, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions at the beginning of each week, to monitor their progress and activities. During the course of the study we strongly encourage participants to work with their doctor should they decide to reduce their benzodiazepine dosage as well as seek specialist benzodiazepine telephone support from Reconnexion. 


Participants will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 1 - 5) assessments, a post-intervention assessment (Week 6) and a 1 and 3 month follow-up assessment (Week 10 &amp; Week 18 respectively). Participants will continue to have access to the program for the duration of the trial. Participants will be asked questions to ascertain reasons for engagement or lack of engagement with the program.

It is expected that people who undertake BDZ eHealth will show reductions in their benzodiazepine dependency, anxiety and / or depressive symptoms at post and follow-up time points</summary>
