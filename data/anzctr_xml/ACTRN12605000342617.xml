    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Drugs were available in sealed brown paper bags (with patient's number, name and weight written on it), which were opened immediately prior to operation on the first side.  Each bag contained 2 bottles labelled with the name of patient, weight of the patients and operation sequence (first operation side or second operation side).  Each bottle contained same number of indistinguishable capsules. Randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were done by the pharmacy which made up the sealed brown paper bags with name of patient written on its outside, to be collected by one of the researchers the day before the trial on a patient.  Investigators and patients were blinded to the treatment allocation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paracetamol is commonly used to reduce pain after operations.  Recently anaesthetists have been using bigger doses of paracetamol because it has been suggested that bigger doses will work better.  However these bigger doses have never been assessed scientifically in adult patients to see if they work better, and it has not been determined at which dose the maximum effect in reducing pain occurs.  We will investigate whether a 90 mg per kg body weight dose works better than a 60 mg per kilogram dose, in reducing pain after wisdom tooth extraction.  We will also examine the pharmacokinetics (the way the body removes the drug) of paracetamol, and whether paracetamol changes the way blood clots at these doses.  We will also examine whether these doses are safe, by monitoring liver enzymes, and making sure the blood level of paracetamol is not greater than that previously recognised to cause liver disease.  The patients will be healthy volunteers scheduled to have wisdom tooth extraction.  They will have blood taken at intervals for four hours after having the paracetamol.  They will fill in pain scores at the same times they have blood taken.</summary>
