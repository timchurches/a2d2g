  <interventions>
    <interventions>in a seated position subjects were asked to actively reach the end-range of shoulder axial rotation, on dominant shoulders, they performed three repetitions ovr a period of about 15 minutes. Humeral and scapular 3D positions were recorded by means of an electromagnetic tracking device. each subject was supervised by a physiotherapist. The task had an overall duration of 1 week, 1 hour each day.</interventions>
    <comparator>control group was constituted by 13 subjects and other 13 were handball players, both were subjected to the same kind of electromagnetic evaluation. control group was formed by normal healthy volunteers.</comparator>
