  <interventions>
    <interventions>The mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group intervention will include tele-based group cognitive therapy and home practice. The group therapy sessions will be conducted weekly over 8 weeks and will each be between one and one and a half hours in length. Each group will contain seven men, and be facilitated by health professionals with experience in oncology, professional training in MBCT and training in the telephone delivery of interventions. Participants in the intervention will also be provided with a workbook summarising each weekly session and including interactive worksheets to keep group discussions on task; self-help materials; and a meditation CD. Participants who are randomised to the intervention condition will be mailed the intervention materials and allocated to a therapy group immediately after randomisation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patient education will consist of the mans standard medical management and a package containing existing patient education materials. These will include the consumer version of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Advanced Prostate Cancer, patient booklets on coping with cancer and tip sheets, and a CD on stress management and relaxation. These materials will be used at the participant's discretion. Participants who are randomised to the Patient Education condition will receive the package of materials immediately after randomisation.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible participants will be ascertained directly through clinicians in the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group and in major treatment centres in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. These clinicians will give eligible patients a brochure about the study and a form on which the patient can consent to being contacted by the research team. 

Research staff will then contact the patient to give them additional information about the study, send a consent package (including an information sheet and consent form), seek informed consent, confirm eligibility and complete the baseline assessment. For eligible participants, randomisation will occur at the completion of all baseline data collection and the receipt of a signed consent form. Allocation concealment will occur, with randomisation being undertaken by computer at the central administration site.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluates an innovative therapeutic intervention to reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life for men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer.

Who is it for?
This study is for men who have been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia.

Trial details
In this study participants are randomly (by chance) divided into two groups. One group will receive patient education, i.e. currently available resource and support materials. The other group will receive a telephone delivered mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group intervention. This intervention includes group therapy phone calls for participants led by trained health professionals and daily meditation practice. The duration of this intervention is 8 weeks.

Participants will complete questionnaires at 3, 6 and 9 months after enrolling in the study to evaluate their psychological well-being and quality of life.</summary>
