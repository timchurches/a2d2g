    <interventions>Retroflexion of the colonoscope in the right colon which is standard practice for many endoscopists despite the paucity of data anaecdotally is thought to improve the detection of polyps behind folds that may not been seen on standard forward view withdrawal. The procedure duration for colonoscopy is approximately 20 minutes with retroflexion only adding an extra 1-2mins to the total procedure time and is standard practice for the endoscopists involved. 
The process is undertaken in each patient once.</interventions>
    <comparator>The endoscopist will document any polyps seen on standard forward view assessment of the right colon.
The approximate duration of the procedure is 20 minutes and is undertaken in each patient once. 
The patients all undergo the same maneuver within the same session and the practice of retroflexion is standard practice for all endoscopists involved. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome is to assess whether retroflexion in the right colon improves the detection of adenomas in comparison to standard forward viewing and a previous study2 found that 33% of patients had polyps detected on forward view. We hypothesize that the detection rate can be improved by at least 5%.
One group only is required as the technique will be identical for all subjects. With a one sided analysis, a significance level of 0.05, and a power of 0.8 the sample size will be 1172 subjects. Allowing for a 10% retroflexion failure rate2, the number of subjects recruited will be 1290.
The primary analysis will be that of comparing proportions. Confidence intervals will be calculated, and Chi square or Fishers exact tests, as appropriate, used to compare other categorical data using statistical software (Stataversion 10). A p-value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess whether the use of a 'retroflexion' technique improves adenoma (tumour) detection in the right colon. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and are scheduled to undergo a complete colonoscopy. 
Trial details All participants in this trial will undergo a single colonoscopy which includes a technique known as 'retroflexion' in the right colon. This is standard practice for many endoscopists. The procedure duration is approximately 20 minutes with retroflexion only adding an extra 1-2mins to the total procedure time. Adenoma detection rate from the standard forward view assessment will be compared to that from retroflexion. It is thought that retroflexion may improve the detection of polyps behind folds that may not be seen on standard forward view. </summary>
