  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pinitol has been shown to demonstrate insulin signalling and the stimulation of glucose transport in humans. Research shows that carob is very high in pinitol in comparison to other legume products. Therefore, carob is a much viable source. 
Three test foods will be consumed by 20 (15 people minimum) participants in a double-blind crossover design containing a control and two test meals. The control biscuit will contain moderate fibre within a commercial cereal-based biscuit (control), test meal one will contain high pinitol carob fibre (HPCF) and test meal two will contain a low pinitol carob fibre (LPCF). 

CONTROL 
Energy: 915 KJ
Carob ingredient: 0 g
Pinitol: 0 mg
Carbohydrate: 33.1 g
Dietary fibre: 3.8 g

TEST MEAL 1 (HPCF)
Energy: Approx. 900 KJ
Carob ingredient: 6 g
Pinitol: 600 mg
Carbohydrate: 33 g
Dietary fibre: 6 g

TEST MEAL 2 (LPCF)
Energy: Approx. 900 KJ
Carob ingredient: 6 g
Pinitol: &lt;100 mg
Carbohydrate: 33 g
Dietary fibre: 6 g

Two nutrition and dietetics honours students will be deliver the intervention, while the blood samples will be taken by trained nurse staff. The supervisors of this intervention are both trained as dieticians. 
Values will be determined after testing final product. 
Participants are required to have fasted overnight (12-hours). 

All three test foods will be consumed on separate occasions, with at least a 72 hour washout period. Blood samples taken to measure the effects of a high pinitol carob fibre (HPCF) cereal-based biscuit on glycaemic and insulin responses on appetite within humans.  

Adherence will be measured by using a 24-hour recall to monitor dietary intake the day before testing was maintained. As there is 3 separate, acute, testing days, subjects will only be required to maintain habitual dietary patterns.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The control test food will contain a moderate fibre test food within a commercial cereal-based biscuit containing no carob or pinitol product. 

CONTROL 
Energy: 915 KJ
Carob ingredient: 0 g
Pinitol: 0 mg
Carbohydrate: 33.1 g
Dietary fibre: 3.8 g

The control will contain insoluble fibre in the form of wholegrain cereal (wheat products). Carob is also high in insoluble fibre, therefore allowing a comparison. </comparator>

      <outcome>Meal intake data at subsequent meal/s. Sandwiches will be provided to the subjects all containing a similar nutritional profile. Subjects are encouraged to eat as much as they desire, food will be weighed before and after to estimate dietary intake to compare with VAS scores. Intake will be analysed through Foodworks software (Xyris P/L Brisbane, Australia).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Previous studies identified that to detect biochemical differences,as few as seven subjects of each sex may be sufficient, while 18 subjects should identify statistically significant changes using a paired design and a study power of 0.8 if VAS ratings vary by at least 5 mm [FLINT, 2000]. Using a repeated
measures design would decrease this number possibly, however, a target of 20 subjects was set for recruitment based on these studies to ensure at least 18 subjects complete the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to substantiate the effects of acute ingestion of high pinitol carob fibre on glycaemic control and subjective satiety and appetite responses. A secondary aim is to distinguish any additional clinically relevent effects of the pinitol compared to the fibre alone. We hypothesise that high pinitol carob fibre within a cereal-based test food will lower glycaemic and insulinaemic responses and increase satiety resulting in lower dietary intake.</summary>
