  <interventions>
    <interventions>Physiotherapist devised physical rehabilitation programs conducted by the family member(s), 3 x 30 minute sessions per week for 4 weeks. Family members will undertake two training sessions with the Physiotherapist initially and then the Physiotherapists will review weekly (ie 5 times in total).</interventions>
    <comparator>standard care. Usual rehabilitation programs will take place; this includes individual physiotherapy sessions with the frequency ranging between 1 - 5 times per week according to individual needs. Normally, clients may also undertake extra exercise sessions with rehabilitation assistants or independently if able and if suitable they can attend fitness and sports groups up to twice a week. The rehabilitation units goal is that every client attends at least one physical activity session each weekday. Individuals will continue to receive speech therapy, occupational therapy and psychotherapy as required.</comparator>

 *Sharing in decisions regarding my family member's care on a regular basis.
 *Ability to share in the care of my family member.
 *Support and encouragement given during my family member's stay in the rehabilitation unit.
 * Physiotherapists availability to speak with me.
 * Preparation for my family member's discharge from the rehabilitation unit.</outcome>
