  <interventions>
    <interventions>4 sessions of telephone counselling based on motivational interviewing techniques, cognitive behavioural therapy, models of behaviour change, and relapse prevention theory. Each session goes for approximately one hour and are delivered once a week. In addition participants will be mailed a self-help booklet that supplements the intervention.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims To evaluate the efficacy of a telephone-based intervention consisting of four-sessions of motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) designed to assist individuals to reduce their cannabis use and related problems. Design Random allocation to intervention or delayed treatment control with four- and 12-week follow-up assessments. Setting Counsellors from the Cannabis Information and Helpline (CIH), an Australian reactive telephone service, delivered the intervention to callers seeking treatment. Participants A total of 160 participants were recruited by the CIH, with 110 participants completing the final follow-up assessment (69% retention). Measurements Cannabis use, dependence and related problems, and other substance use, were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Findings Intervention participants reported greater reductions in dependence symptoms (p&lt;0.001), and related problems (p&lt;0.001) compared to control participants at both follow-up assessments. Compared to control, intervention participants reported greater confidence to reduce cannabis use (p=0.002), and in turn reported a greater percentage of abstinent days at twelve weeks (p=0.019). Conclusions The remote delivery of brief MI+CBT cannabis use interventions continues to show promise in assisting a wider audience of treatment seekers while achieving comparable treatment outcomes to those of face-to-face interventions in the short term.</summary>
