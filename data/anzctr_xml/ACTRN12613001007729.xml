  <interventions>
    <interventions>We used surgical mask (3M [TM] Standard Tie-On Surgical Mask, Cat No: 1816) manufactured by 3M company, USA.

Masks provided to intervention group supervised mask use to use it during the Hajj week (4-10 November, 2011). Each participant provided with 5 masks per day and a brochure with instructions about mask wearing and usage. The medical researchers followed them each day to reminding participant about recording their mask usage in health diary.

      <outcome>Primary outcome: any pilgrim develop subjective fever and one symptom of influenza-like illness

During the Hajj week, everyday Muslim doctors supported by trained research nursing and public health staff visited participants in their tents to examine them and reported any symptom of of influenza-like illness. </outcome>

Participants reported their uptake by filling an anonymous self-reported questionnaire.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Number of contacts will vary depending on the location of the pilgrims in a tent. For most pilgrims in tents there will be at least 8 persons lying close to them, but the ones living in the far corners of the tent will have only 3 contacts around them, while the ones lying close to the wall of the tent (but not in the extreme corner) will have 5 people around them. Therefore on average every 100 index cases will have 684 contacts ([4×3+32×5+64×8]=684).
Each large tent can accommodate around 100 pilgrimsbut the numbers can vary depending on the size and location of the tent, and the policy of the tour group. However, it is reasonable to estimate that there will be about 90 occupants per tents. Every year 4000-5000 Australian pilgrims travel to Hajj, so there will be about 50 tents in the Australian camp. The recruitment phase will gradually escalate since more people will become symptomatic as days pass day.

Considering the masks to be 50% effective and the secondary attack rate of influenza to be 20%, and assuming 5 index cases of ILI to be present in day 0 in each tent, 23.8% (P1) cases will be expected in intervention group and 33.6% (P2) in control group on day 4, thus 334 pilgrims should be recruited in each arm to archive 80% (B at 0.2) power of the study with a at 0.05 according to the following formula, where Z stands for Z statistics for power:
[z1-a/2-)}+z1-Bv{P1(1-P1)+P2(1-P2)}]2÷{(P1-P2)2}.

Considering an intra-cluster co-efficient (IIC) of &lt;0.02 we have increased the sample by a factor of 1.2 i.e, 20%. So, about 401 pilgrims need to be recruited in each arm from 10 tents making a total of 802 subjects from 20 tents: half of these should preferably be females to avoid gender bias.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot trial to assess the effectiveness of face masks in the prevention of transmission of influenza-like illness (ILI), defined as subjective fever and at least one respiratory symptom, eg cough, among Australian Hajj pilgrims during the Hajj 2011. Also, we want to estimate influenza vaccine coverage rate among Australian pilgrims at the Hajj 2011 and to explore reasons for not receiving the influenza vaccine. </summary>
