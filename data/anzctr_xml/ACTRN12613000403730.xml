    <interventions>Mitii: Move it to improve it is an internet- based multimodal therapy which combines upper limb (UL) training within the context of meaningful physical activity that can be accessed in children's homes. Inherent in this approach is the ability to scaffold visual perception skills and cognitive challenge, both important aspects of activity engagement in a virtual training environment.
The program is potentially cost effective as only 3 center based therapists (occupational therapist, physiotherapist, neuropsychologist) are required to provide initial assessment, goal setting and training for families and participating children. Each therapist is then able to remotely moditfy the individualised program each week. The current application proposes to test the efficacy of Mitii in a waitlist randomised controlled trial.
We propose to provide Mitii at an intensity of 30 minutes per day for 6 days per week over 20 weeks (total dose 60 hours). All children will therefore receive the therapy within 12 months of being randomised either to commence Mitii immediately or after 5 months, with retention of effects tested at 40 weeks.
As current therapy programs are resource intensive and time consuming it its important to determine if gains from Mitii are sustained as this could offer a cost effective model of care, particularly for rural, remote and isolated children with acquired brain injuries.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children will be matched in pairs according to age (18 month age bands), and intellectual functioning (&gt;80 or &lt;80. Where available, an IQ assessment which has been completed &gt;12 months post injury can be used, otherwise an IQ assessment will be completed prior to matching.). A matched pairs design is the design of choice as it minimises the likelihood of group differences at baseline that has often been present in rehabilitation studies. Once matching has been achieved, children will be randomised within pairs (one member of each pair to randomly allocated to each group) from concealed envelopes opened by non-study personnel. Treatment allocation will be recorded on a piece of folded paper inside each envelope in random order (either 1:Waitlist 2:Immediate; or 1:Immediate 2:Waitlist, with the sequence being computer generated).  The randomisation process will involve allocating a number “1” or “2’ to each member of the pair. As each pair is entered, they will be allocated the next consecutive envelope, which will be opened by the non-study personnel who will read and record the treatment allocation from the paper inside the envelope. Study personnel will be informed of group allocation.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>For sample size determination if we are planning a study with 30 experimental subjects and 30 control subjects.  In a previous study the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 0.39.  If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 0.35, we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) .790.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Analysis will follow standard principles for RCTs, using two-group comparisons on all participants on an intention-to-treat basis. External and internal validity of results will be checked using baseline and general descriptive information available for all eligible families; comparing the characteristics of families who completed the study with those who enrolled in the study but did not complete, and those who did not enrol. The primary comparison immediately post intervention (20 weeks) will be the AMPS and AHA scores. Outcomes between treatment groups will be compared at follow-up using generalised estimating equations (GEEs), with time (0, 20, 40 weeks) and study group (Mitii, usual care), as well as a time by group interaction as covariables. We will use the Gaussian family, identity link, and an exchangeable correlation structure. Secondary analyses will compare the outcomes between groups for participation (domains of LIFE-H) and QOL (domains of Kidscreen52). For dichotomous outcomes we will compare outcomes between-group outcomes using GEEs with the logistic family and logit link. For continuous variables we shall compare using the Gaussian family and identity link (possibly after transformation, depending on the distribution). Statistical significance will be at p&lt;0.05 with adjustment for multiple comparisons, and all analyses will be intention to treat. Sensitivity analyses using imputation techniques will investigate whether the effect estimates are biased as a consequence of non-ignorable missing data.</statisticalmethods>
