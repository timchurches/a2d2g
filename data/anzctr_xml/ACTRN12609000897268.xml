  <interventions>
    <interventions>An ordered study design comparing the effects of a standard bland meal and a standard meal with 30g of chilli paste. The standard meal wil consist of a bread roll, beef or soy patty (according to the subject's preference) and glucose drink (approximately 100g of Glucaid, which contains 75g of glucose per 300ml).
Participants are required to consume both of the meals, starting with the standard bland meal and then the chilli paste containing meal, with a one week period between the visits.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In type-2 diabetes, tissues become insulin resistant and blood glucose and insulin levels rise. The incidence of type-2 diabetes is increasing in Australia, and Tasmania has a particularly high prevalence. Control of plasma glucose and insulin levels are important in the prevention and management of type-2 diabetes. This is also important to reduce the subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

 

We have previously shown that chilli, a commonly used spice helps in improving blood glucose as well as insulin levels in generally healthy humans. These results were more pronounced in overweight and obese individuals  i.e. those individuals who have a known predisposition to type-2 diabetes and CVD.

 

We aim to extend this work in type-2 diabetics to assess if the beneficial effects of chilli are also presented or perhaps enhanced, in type-2 diabetics. We will assess post-meal (up to two hours) effects of a bland (spice free) and a chilli-containing meal on plasma glucose and insulin concentration and blood vessel function, in a group of type-2 diabetics.  If the anticipated results i.e. improvements in glucose and insulin profile and possibly in blood vessel function, are observed in the proposed investigation, this cheap, readily available and commonly used spice may be used to help control diabetes and prevent the onset of CVD.</summary>
