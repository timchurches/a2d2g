  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - S-warfarin
Treatment: drugs - Midazolam
Treatment: drugs - Pexidartinib

Active Comparator: Part 1 - Reference treatment - On Day 1 all participants will receive a single oral dose of midazolam (2 mg) and S-warfarin (10 mg with vitamin K [5 mg]), followed by blood draws for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.

Experimental: Part 1 - Test Treatment 1 - On Day 5 all participants will receive a single oral dose of midazolam (2 mg) and S-warfarin (10 mg with vitamin K [5 mg]), followed by blood draws for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. All participants will receive the 600 mg pm dose of pexidartinib on Day 5 and continue BID dosing of pexidartinib (400 mg for the am dose, and 600 mg for the pm dose) until Day 15.

Experimental: Part 1 - Test Treatment 2 - On Day 15, all participants will receive a single oral dose of midazolam (2 mg) and S-warfarin (10 mg with vitamin K [5 mg]) with the morning dose of pexidartinib followed by blood draws for PK analysis.

Experimental: Part 2 - Pexidartinib only - On Day 15, all participants will receive a pm dose of pexidartinib as recommended for their tumor type (400 mg for non-malignant tumors and 600 mg for malignant tumors). All participants will continue to receive pexidartinib BID dosing in 28-day cycles at the 800 mg or 1000 mg dose until the end of the trial. The dose of pexidartinib may be further modified depending upon tolerance as defined in the protocol.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has two parts.

      Part 1 will test how pexidartinib affects the way the body processes midazolam and S-warfarin

      Part 2 will test the efficacy and safety of pexidartinib treatment in various tumor types.

      In Part 2, the same participants will continue to receive pexidartinib twice daily, at a dose
      specific to their tumor type.

      Participants will be allowed to continue using pexidartinib as long as the participant
      derives benefit.</summary>
