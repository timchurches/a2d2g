             adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer; in situ carcinoma of the
             cervix, treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence for at least 3 years
             prior to study entry; or other solid tumor treated curatively, and without evidence of

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CLGX818X2101 is a first-time in-human, phase I study to establish the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of daily administered LGX818 (daily, twice daily
      and/or every-other-day), a RAF kinase inhibitor. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      melanoma harboring the BRAF V600 mutation (during dose escalation phase and expansion phase)
      and patients with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring the BRAF V600 mutation (during the
      expansion phase) will be enrolled. The study consists of a dose escalation part were cohorts
      of patients will receive escalating oral doses of LGX818, followed by a safety dose expansion
      part were patients will be treated with oral dose of LGX818 given at the MTD or RP2D.</summary>
