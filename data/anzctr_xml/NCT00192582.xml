  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Participants will be recruited by Aboriginal Mental Health Workers  or nominated by
             mental health staff or the General Practitioner. The treating doctors or local mental
             health team will be notified of the nomination in each case and, if they have no
             concerns, the Aboriginal Mental Health Worker will arrange the information and consent
             session with the research team. The participants will be clients who have a primary
             chronic mental illness, are aged over 18 years, are able to give informed consent, and
             are current clients. The diagnoses for inclusion are Schizophrenia, Delusional
             disorder, Schizoaffective disorder, Drug-induced psychosis, Non-specific psychoses,
             and Affective disorders. The criteria for chronicity for the purposes of the project
             are defined by two or more episodes of illness severe enough to require medical
             intervention and treatment. The carer will be identified by discussion between the
             client and the Aboriginal Mental Health Worker or Health Worker.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A new treatment for indigenous people with mental illness in remote communities has been
      developed. The study hypothesis is that this new treatment will result in better outcomes for
      clients and carers than the outcomes of clients and carers who do not receive the treatment.
      The treatment is a combination of a talking treatment and sharing of stories about mental
      health. The treatment will be delivered to the client with their chosen carer and with the
      local Aboriginal Mental Health Worker or Health Worker. The treatment will be given by the
      research team - a psychiatrist and an indigenous research officer. The trial will compare two
      groups of clients - a control group which is receiving 'treatment as usual', and the group
      which receives the new treatment. Measures of social functioning and symptoms of mental
      illness will be administered at base line and every six months for two years.</summary>
