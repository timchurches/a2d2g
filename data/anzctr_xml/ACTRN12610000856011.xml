    <interventions>single arm phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy with intravenous docetaxel (Taxotere), cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) [TPF regimen; T: Taxotere, P: Cisplatin F: 5-FU] and concurrent chemoradiation with weekly intravenous cisplatin in patients with locally advanced laryngeal carcinoma
Fifty eligible patients with pathologically proven laryngeal  carcinoma are enrolled.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients initially receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m2) on day 1 and intravenous 5-FU (750 mg/m2) continuously on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete or partial response after 3 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy proceed to chemoradiotherapy. Patients with less than a partial response after course 3 proceed to surgery, including total laryngectomy.
Chemoradiotherapy: 3 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo 7 weeks concurrent chemoradiation with weekly intravenous ciplatin (30 mg/m2).</interventions>

      <outcome>Acute treatment-related toxicities will be measured by clinician assessment and graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer(RTOG/EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Acute treatment-related toxicites [such as hematologic (leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal (diarrhea, vomiting), neurological (neuropathy, pain, hand foot syndrome) toxicities] will be assessed at baseline, at the end of every sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycle and weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgery followed by irradiation is considered to be the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced laryngeal carcinoma; however, Larynx preservation remains an interesting point of view for these patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation is an alternative choice for preserving the patients voice. The current clinical trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy by TPF regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiation with weeky cisplatin in this regard.</summary>
