  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) single ultrasound guided injection of autologous platelet rich plasma (2ml) into the site of maximal abnormality in the elbow.

To obtain the autologous platelet rich plasma, 5 ml of venesected blood will be centrifuged for 7 minutes at 1500 revs/sec and then the buffy coating and 2ml of the supernatant will be aspirated using a 22 gauge needle into a 3ml syringe. This 2ml will then be injected into the elbow.

2) single ultrasound guided injection of glucocorticoid (Celestone Chronodose 1ml + 1 ml normal saline) into the site of maximal abnormality in the elbow

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited via online and printed advertisements and from medical practitioners. Respondents will undergo an initial screening to ensure inclusion. Those who are eligible at this point will be given the participant information and consent form and will be invited to participate provided ultrasound criteria are met. Following written consent and diagnostic ultrasonography, participants will be randomly assigned in random permuted blocks of differing sizes to receive one of the three treatment regimens, stratified by radiologist and size of the tear (&lt; or &gt; or = 6mm). The randomisation sequence will be created using a computer-generated table of random numbers. To conceal randomisation, stratified allocations will be sealed in consecutively numbered opaque envelopes and kept in a locked location accessible only by an independent administrator. This administrator (not involved in the trial in any other capacity except for opening randomisation envelopes and preparing syringes with treatments) will open the next envelope in sequence at each site and prepare syringes accordingly.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lateral epicondylitis (LE) or tennis elbow is a debilitating musculoskeletal condition that can result in significant disability, health care utilisation, lost productivity and costs. Glucocorticoid injection is of proven short-term benefit, but beyond 8 weeks its benefits have not been established and some studies have even suggested a rebound worsening of symptoms. Autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) appears to be a promising new treatment for LE however strong evidence for its efficacy from high quality randomised placebo-controlled trials is currently lacking. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided injection with either autologous platelet rich plasma or glucocorticoid using a three-arm randomised placebo-controlled trial design.</summary>
