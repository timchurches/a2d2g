    <summary>- Aim

      The AVOID (Air Verses Oxygen In myocardial infarction) trial is designed to determine if the
      withholding of routine oxygen therapy in patients with acute heart attack leads to reduced
      heart damage compared to the current practice of routine inhaled oxygen for all patients.

      - Background

      There is evidence supporting and refuting the current practice of providing oxygen to all
      patients with acute heart attack. A recent summary of clinical trials suggested that oxygen
      may increase the degree of heart damage during heart attack. It also highlighted that the few
      trials into oxygen therapy were performed before the use of modern medications and procedures
      to treat heart attack and that further studies were urgently needed, using contemporary
      practices.

      - Design

      A total of 334 patients will participate in this randomized controlled trial. Patients in
      this study will receive the best current management and care for their condition. Patients
      will be randomized to routine pre-hospital care with oxygen therapy vs pre-hospital care
      without oxygen therapy. Patients will then receive standard hospital care, aside from
      allocated oxygen or no oxygen therapy. The primary outcome measure of heart damage will be
      investigated using routine blood tests. With additional information gathered from other
      aspects of routine heart care including coronary angiogram, electrocardiograms and
      complications of hospital stay. Patients will be followed up at 6 months to determine any
      longer term effects of treatment.</summary>
