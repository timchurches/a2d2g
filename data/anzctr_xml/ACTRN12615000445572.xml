  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Dystocia line partogram is a visual tool that uses a graduated (stepped) line to indicate whether cervical dilatation, determined by vaginal assessment at regular intervals, is slower than a mean of 0.5cm per hour. The tool is administered by a midwife and the results of vaginal assessments are recorded on the partograph every four hours or as clinically indicated.</interventions>
    <comparator>The standard Action line partogram is a visual tool that uses a sloping line to indicate whether cervical dilatation, determined by vaginal assessment at regular intervals, is slower than a mean of 1cm per hour.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Nulliparous women in spontaneous labour who are:
* At term (between 37 and 41 weeks plus 6 days gestation) with a singleton pregnancy, a cephalic (head down) presentation and cervical
dilatation of 4cm or greater
* Equal to or greater than 18 years of age and able to provide informed
consent
* Defined as low risk i.e. no history of: stillbirth or neonatal death, three or more consecutive miscarriages, previous fetal death in utero, previous
preterm birth (less than 32 weeks), previous mid-trimester loss/cervical incompetence/cone biopsy/known uterine anomaly, previous early onset of pre-eclampsia (less than 32 weeks gestation), or rhesus isoimmunisation;
no complications during the current pregnancy (such as
multiple pregnancy or fetal abnormality); and no precluding medical conditions (such as cardiac disease, essential hypertension, renal disease,
pre-existing diabetes, previous gestational diabetes, epilepsy, severe asthma, substance use, significant psychiatric disorders, age greater than
40 years, body mass indexless than 17 or greater than 35).</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Participants will be consented to the trial when attending for assessment of early labour. Upon assessment of active labour (cervical dilatation of 4 cms or more) the attending midwife will obtain an opaque study envelope containing either an experimental Dystocia line partogram  labelled with a unique study code or a form stating to use a standard partogram and record the study code.</concealment>
    <sequence>Opaque envelopes containing either a pre printed Dystocia line partograms  a form of similar weight, stating to use a standard partogram, will be prepared by the Mater Research Institute using block randomisation</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for this trial is based upon determining an accurate estimate of the compliance with the correct commencement and use of the relevant partograph in both the action line and dystocia line groups. With a sample size of 196 participants per group, the compliance proportion in each group can be reported along with a confidence level of 95% and a confidence interval width of 0.10, assuming a proportion of 85% (a proportion less than 85% will be deemed to be not high enough to continue with a full RCT without further amendments to the protocol). With the addition of 10% for attrition the overall sample size would be 218 per group (436 participants overall).
Simple descriptive stats will describe the primary outcomes of the pilot study. All women randomised will be analysed in their allocated treatment groups (ie. Intention to treat) by a researcher blinded to treatment allocation. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcomes will be calculated. Secondary outcome measures of categorical data will be analysed with chi-squared tests and continuous data will be analysed with t-tests for normally distributed data and MannWhitney U test for parametric data. Linear regression (continuous outcomes) or logistic regression (binary outcomes) analysis will be undertaken if necessary to adjust for imbalances in potentially confounding variables (univariable then multivariable models). All study outcomes will be analysed using a two sided P value of &lt; 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. The study is only powered for the primary outcomes and for secondary outcomes confidence intervals (CI) will be presented to estimate possible effect sizes. All withdrawals, losses to follow-up, and deaths will be reported. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study is to test the procedures for a larger trial that will compare two different tools (partographs) for measuring progress in labour. In particular we aim to achieve a compliance rate of 85% with both the intervention and control arms of the trial. The outcomes will inform any necessary changes to the main study protocol. If no substantial changes are required the data from this pilot study will be incorporated into the results of the main study</summary>
