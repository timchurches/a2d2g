  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants were randomly assigned to a 6-week physiotherapy or placebo treatment group, which commenced 3-5 days after hydrodilatation.  All hydrodilatations were performed according a standardized protocol.  Depomedrol (40 mg, 1 ml) and normal saline were injected to a total volume of up to 90ml or until filling of the subscapular bursa, capsular rupture or participant requests termination of the procedure. 
Project physiotherapists were trained in the standardised protocol for both the physiotherapy and the placebo treatments.  Both treatments were performed twice per week for the first two weeks and then once per week for the remaining four weeks (8 visits, 30 minutes each).  The placebo treatment consisted of inoperable ultrasound and light application of an inert gel. The physiotherapy treatment was standardised and progressed according to specific criteria. Specific interventions included muscle stretching techniques both passive and self executed to stretch muscles passing over the glenohumeral joint, cervical and thoracic spine mobilisation, glenohumeral joint passive accessory glides, glenohumeral joint passive physiological mobilisation, strength and co-ordination exercises for rotator cuff and scapular stabilisers, and proprioceptive challenge.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered shoulder-specific disability index consisting of 13 items divided into pain and disability subscales.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured as baseline, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months. The primary endpoint was at 3 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Participant's overall assessment of pain was measured with a 10-cm Likert scale comprising a vertical line labeled "no pain" at the bottom (0) and "maximal imaginable pain" at the top.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Range of active shoulder movement was measured according to a standardised protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. The Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) instrument measures health-related quality of life and can be converted into an utility index using utility weights derived from an Australian population sample.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. Perceived recovery was measured on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from much worse to completely recovered to estimate the percentage of patients with a successful outcome, defined as much improved or completely recovered.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5. Adverse effects elicited by the use of open-ended questions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>6. Costs including direct health care and non-health care costs and indirect costs were elicited by self completed questionnaire/diary completed weekly for the entire 6-month follow-up period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
