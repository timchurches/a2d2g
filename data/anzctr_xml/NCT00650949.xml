    <summary>This study seeks to (i) determine the safe dose of CYT997 when given in combination with
      carboplatin in patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (glioma) and (ii) to determine
      whether the combination of CYT997 with carboplatin is a useful treatment for glioma.</summary>
