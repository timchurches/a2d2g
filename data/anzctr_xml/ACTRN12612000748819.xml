    <summary>The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is high in fruit, vegetables and dairy and lower in fats, signficantly reduced blood pressure in people without diabetes. At present their has been no investigation of the effect of the DASH diet in people with diabetes. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of a DASH like diet in people with diabetes</summary>
