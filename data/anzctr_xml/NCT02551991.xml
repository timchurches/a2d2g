  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open-label, phase 2 comparative study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of nal-IRI in combination with other anticancer therapies, compared to
      nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine, in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have
      not received prior chemotherapy. This study will assess the following regimens:

        -  nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin

        -  nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV

        -  nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine

      The study will be conducted in two parts:

        1. a safety run-in of the nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin regimen, and

        2. a randomized, efficacy study of nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin, and nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV,
           versus nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine.</summary>
