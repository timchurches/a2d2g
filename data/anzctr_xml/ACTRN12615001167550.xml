  <interventions>
    <interventions>Before and after study. All patients will be assessed at baseline, week 2 and week 4 on no HCV treatment. They will then receive 12 weeks of active treatment with the Abbvie 3D regimen which is as follows: paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir (150/100/25 mg once daily by mouth), dasabuvir (250 mg twice daily by mouth) and weight-based RBV dosed twice daily by mouth(1000 mg daily if body weight &lt; 75 kg, 1200 mg daily if body weight &gt;= 75 kg). Ribavirin will be given to GT1a patients but not to GT1b patients</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) leads to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma in 20-40% of those infected after 30 years. It is unclear whether the remaining 60-80% of those with HCV derive an objective physical health benefit from the treatment and cure of HCV infection. HCV infection appears to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk, however this is controversial, and it is unclear whether the mechanism is through HCV-induced metabolic syndrome and diabetes, or through chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study if to determine feasibility of using RH-PAT to measure change in endothelial function over time during HCV treatment, to refine assumptions and to seek a signal of effect. These data will then be used to determine if a larger multicentre trial is justifiable and to inform its design. </summary>
