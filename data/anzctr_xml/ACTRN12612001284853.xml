  <interventions>
    <interventions>General Practitioners (GPs) will be instructed about current best practice for acute Low Back Pain (LBP) using a novel approach. The approach aims to assist GPs to identify and address attitudes and beliefs which may be barriers to recovery from acute LBP, explain back pain to their patients, and to provide patients with a framework which enables them to resume normal employment and activities of daily living. 

GPs will be instructed about the approach during a 4 hour interactive workshop. The workshop will be supported by a booklet, a website, and a module within their electronic patient management system. The workshop will be delivered at baseline. Subsequently, GPs will receive ongoing support to use the approach via the booklet, the website. A member of the research team will visit the practices monthly during the three month duration of the trial. GPs will also be able to contact the research team as required via email and telephone.

GPs will also be provided with a novel information booklet to provide to their patients. This booklet outlines current best practice for acute LBP, supports recommendations from the GP booklet, and addresses commonly held beliefs. It encourages an active approach to managing LBP. The booklet will also be supported by a website.

GPs will try to use the intervention with patients experiencing acute low back pain for the three month duration of the trial.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>HC-PAIRS: the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the total score will be calculated pre- and post-intervention. The change score along with its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated, and a paired t-test will be used to identify any statistically significant change, with alpha set at 0.05.

BACK-PAQ: the mean and SD of the total score will be calculated pre- and post-intervention. The change score along with its 95% CI will be calculated, and a paired t-test will be used to identify any statistically significant change, with alpha set at 0.05. The mean and SD of each of the 6 factors will also be scored pre- and post-intervention. The change scores along with their CI will be calculated, and a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test will be used to identify any statistically significant change. To correct for multiple testing in these six domains, alpha will be set at 0.01 to reduce the risk of a Type 1 error, and corresponding confidence intervals will be calculated at 99% CI. The convergent validity of the BACK-PAQ will be assessed by examining Pearson correlation coefficients of factor and total scores on the BACK-PAQ with scores on the HC-PAIRS.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with LBP are often anxious, catastrophise about the consequences of LBP, and are fearful of movement and re-injury. Increased fear is associated with more time off work, and the progression of an acute episode of LBP to chronic disability. Health Care Practitioner (HCP) attitudes and beliefs are associated with the attitudes and beliefs of their patients.

Numerous guidelines have been developed to try and improve the management of LBP and prevent progression to disability. When these guidelines are followed patients have better outcomes at lower cost. However, the development and implementation of these guidelines has not decreased the financial and social burden of LBP. Although this may be due to a number of factors, the attitudes and beliefs of both HCPs and their patients, and the interaction between these two groups, are important contributors.

The Fear Reduction Exercised Early (FREE) approach will communicate current best practice to GPs and their patients by using a novel information package. This aims to influence the attitudes and beliefs of both GPs and their patients, providing them with a consistent framework upon which to achieve optimal management of LBP. 

This trial will test the acceptability and utility of the FREE approach amongst a cohort of General Practitioners.
