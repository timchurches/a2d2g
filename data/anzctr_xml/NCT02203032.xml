  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Visits at Which Participants Achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Response of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1) and at Least a 2 Grade Improvement (From Week 16) From Week 28 Through Week 40 - The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling. The participants' psoriasis was assessed as cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 28 through Week 40</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Visits at Which Participants Achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response From Week 28 Through Week 40 - The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</outcome>
