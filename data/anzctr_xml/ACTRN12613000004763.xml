  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intradermal capsaicin (100 micrograms) will be administered intradermally into the dominant forearm once on both study day 1 and study day 2. Intradermal capsaicin is not being used as an intervention (e.g. treatment), but instead as a method to produce neuropathic like pain symptoms in healthy pain-free volunteers. Sensitivity to two different types of thermal test will be performed in the presence of intradermal capsaicin. One thermal test involves placing a small match boxed sized thermode on participants dominant forearm for 30 seconds. Once the thermode is removed from participants dominant forearm, participants will then be asked to rate how painful the thermode was, an area of flare will be measured and participants sensitivity to von Frey hairs and a foam paintbrush will be measured. The other thermal test involves participants placing their dominant forearm onto specialised temperature bars for 30 seconds. Once participants are asked to remove their dominant forearm from the specialised temperature bars, participants will then be asked to rate how painful the speciliased temperature bars were, an area of flare will be measured and participants sensitivity to von Frey hairs and a foam paintbrush will be measured. Both thermal tests are performed at non-harmful temperatures. As the study is being conducted as a 2-way cross over design, participants will randomly be assigned to either the thermode test or the specialised temperature bars test for study visit 1 or study visit 2. Therefore, if a participant is assigned to the thermode test for study visit 1, they will be assigned to the speciliased temperature bars test for study visit 2. Thermal tests will be performed prior to intradermal capsaicin and at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes post intradermal capsaicin. Each study day will be approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes long.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the effect of the specialised temperature bars with standard warmth/heat on spontaneous pain, flare, allodynia and hyperalgesia responses induced by intradermal capsaicin.

Spontaneous pain will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Flare will be assessed by tracing the area of visible flare onto clear acetate. The area around the injection where participants skin has become sensitive to light stroking (allodynia) will be assessed with a foam paintbrush.  The area of skin around the injection that has become painful to probing which was not painful before (hyperalgesia) will be assessed using speciliased plastic rods (von Frey hairs) which bend at a known pressure. Participants will also be asked to rate any pain experienced during the foam paintbrush (allodynia) and von Frey (hyperalgesia) test. </outcome>
