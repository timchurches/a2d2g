  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will attempt to determine what causes distress in lung cancer and mesothelioma patients and whether having access to an interdisciplinary team reduces this distress. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are 18 years or over with lung cancer or mesothelioma, and currently under the care of any/all medical oncologist, respiratory physician, radiation therapist, palliative care specialist at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.

Trial details:
Participants in this trial will receive access to allied health staff (including Social worker, Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist, Dietitian and Clinical Nurse) who can assist them with strategies for reducing or managing their concerns. The overall duration of this study will be 6 months in which we will aim to assess all patients with a new diagnosis of lung cancer or mesothelioma and existing patients as required. 

Study aims:
To compare distress in lung cancer and mesothelioma patients before and after having access to a team of allied health staff to address their concerns.
