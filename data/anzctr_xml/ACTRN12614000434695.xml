  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a randomised, double-bind cross-over treatment in 20 healthy male participants and will involve the delivery of commonly consumed dietary bitter compounds (oral capsules) or placebo control, to assess its effects on appetite and energy intake. Capsules will be given to the participants at the time of the treatment to ensure they are taken. 

The study will be of 3 days duration, during which time 3 treatment arms each of 1 day duration will be completed in randomized order with at least a 7-day washout between treatments. The 3 treatment arms consist of 2 bitter phytochemical treatments and 1 placebo control.

All treatments comprise of 2 capsules, one acid stable one taken 60 minutes before the lunch and one non-acid stable one taken 30 minutes before the lunch. For the 3 arms participants will receive either:
1. 2 placebo capsules (Placebo) at 30 and 60 minutes prior (acid stable capsule) to lunch.
2. A placebo at 60 minutes prior to lunch in the acid stable capsule and a 500mg plant extract  (See non-public information for extract details) in a normal cellulose capsule at 30min prior to lunch (Stomach targeted) 
3. A 500mg plant extract (See non-public information for extract details) in an acid stable capsule 60 minutes before lunch and a placebo in a normal cellulose capsule 30 minutes before lunch. 

The reason for the 2 different treatment locations is because animal studies have shown that the effect gastric exposure may differ from that of duodenal exposure.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Food Intake

The ad libitum lunch and snack meals will be served within individual meal booths, and meals will consist of a pasta and sauce meal (lunch) or sandwiches (snack), where each item is served in excess. Participants will be advised that they can eat as much or as little as they choose and to eat until they are comfortably full. They will be required to remain within the booth for a period of 30 minutes. When they have finished eating they will raised an I am full sign.

Lunch and snack items will be weighed on 2 occasions both before and after each of the ad libitum meals. Energy (kJ), fat, CHO and protein intake will be calculated using the dietary software program Foodworks.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 mins and 1h post intervention for the lunch. Then 2:30 and 3h post intervention for the snack.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual analouge scales (VAS) for appetite related measures

VAS  Hunger, Fullness, Satisfaction, Thoughts of Food, Nausea

VAS will be used following the methodology of Flint et al (Flint, Raben et al. 2000). 
The following questions will be used: How hungry do you feel? / How full do you feel? / How satisfied do you feel? / How much do you think you can eat now / How nauseas do you feel? 

They will be achored on the left with the following statements:
 I am not hungry at all / I am not full at all/ I am completely empty / nothing at all / not nauseas at all 

And on the right withI am as hungry as I have ever been / I am totally full / I cannot eat another bite / a large amount /very nauseas 

Subjects will mark their responses by placing a vertical line across the 100-mm scale according to their subjective feelings.

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis was performed to provide estimates of variance components using data from a previous test meal experiment performed at the UoA Human Nutrition Unit which also investigated the effect of a test breakfast on satiety in a group of men. Calculations were done on both the primary end point of Ad libitum energy intake at the outcome lunch meal, as well as the secondary endpoint of Hunger &amp; Fulllness VAS scores  In the current studies it is anticipated that 20 participants will be required to complete the 3 treatment days, based on the assumptions shown below:

Ad libitum energy intake at the outcome lunch meal:
Energy intake at the ad lib lunch meal is the primary outcome. The power calculations have used the assumptions of outcome differences of 500kJ, equivalent to a change of 5 percent in an individual consuming a typical daily intake of 10MJ/day (=10,000kJ/day). In order to inform as to the within-person standard deviation, numbers corresponding to the smallest (686kJ) and largest (990kJ) standard deviation from the previous trial were used. 
Paired data (cross-over)  continuous outcome (EI)
Anticipated standardised effect, Delta = [anticipated difference in outcome500kJ]/[sd of difference of outcome variable measured on two occasions estimated from previous studies]
In order to detect an outcome difference of 5% (500kJ) as significant at P&lt;0.05 
(i)	Delta = 500/686 = 0.73    80%=17 subjects; 90%=22 subjects
(ii) Delta = 500/990 = 0.51    80%=33 subjects; 90%=42 subjects
Machin, D. et al.  Sample Size Tables for Clinical Studies, 3rd Edition, 2008.

The model based upon an estimated error variance taken from the previous study could be larger (or smaller) than previously observed &amp; hence the actual probability of detecting the effect is uncertain. Using the 80% confidence interval (worst case scenario) the number of subjects required is estimated to fall between 17-33 subjects. Based on these calculations, 20 participants will be recruited. Given the potential for participants to withdraw from the study, recruiting 20 people will allow for 80% power even after 3 withdrawals. 






Hunger &amp; Fullness assessed by Visual Analogue Score (VAS):
 The modelling showed that for a sample size of 20 subjects completing a 3 treatment cross-over design, the power to detect an effect size of 10mm difference from baseline (10%, based on 100mm VAS) in VAS ratings was 0.732. The same repeat measures design was found to have a 
power of 0.875 to detect an effect of 12.5mm (12.5%), and 0.951 to detect a larger 15mm (15%) change from baseline as significant. The model, based upon an estimated error variance taken from the previous satiety experiment, cannot allow for the fact that the error in the proposed study could be larger (or smaller) than previously observed and hence the actual probability of detecting the effect is uncertain. Using the upper 90% confidence interval (worst case scenario) the power to detect a 12.5% effect and 15% effect, respectively, fell to 0.83 and 0.88 which may still be considered acceptable. A similar, although not identical, study design was also assessed by Flint et al.  (Flint, Raben et al. 2000)  who concluded that 20 subjects would be sufficient to detect a difference of 10mm on fasting and 5mm on postprandial ratings, at power 0.8. Our data provide a simlar estimate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The number of individuals who are overweight or obese is increasing dramatically both globally and within New Zealand. One of the major causes of weight gain is poor appetite control, where individuals overeat (eat more than is required to maintain their current weight) either because they do not generate physiological signals of fullness and stop eating, or because the pleasure associated with eating overrides these signals. 
We believe that delivering bitter plant compounds to the gut may regulate appetite and potentially be a possible way to suppress appetite and help people lose weight. This study will give a non-toxic bitter plant extract to people then measure if it affects how much food they eat and how full they feel
