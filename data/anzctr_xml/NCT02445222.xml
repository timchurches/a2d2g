  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Per Health Authorities guidelines for gene therapy medicinal products that utilize
      integrating vectors (e.g. lentiviral vectors), long term safety and efficacy follow up of
      treated patients is required. The purpose of this study is to monitor all patients exposed to
      CD19 directed CAR T-cells (CD19 CART) for 15 years following last CD19 CART (e.g. CTL019)
      infusion to assess the risk of delayed adverse events (AEs), monitor for replication
      competent lentivirus (RCL) and assess long-term efficacy, including vector persistence.</summary>
