  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention will be 6 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) sessions administered by psychology interns
Usual care compromised of medical treatment and pulmonary rehabilitation
6 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) sessions will be divided into:
2 face-to-face individual sessions of 1 hour each, within the first 4 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation
4 phone sessions of 60 minutes each will be undertaken for counseling, each session will be fortnightly within the first 2 months after the face-to-face sessions.
CBT intervention will be standardised following a manual written by the TPCH psychology department. </interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care compromised of medical treatment and pulmonary rehabilitation.
Participants in the Control group will not receive face to face intervention. After rehabilitation participants will receive fortnightly telephone contacts of 5-10 minutes at same periods as the intervention group. Telephone contact will entail assessment of symptoms. </comparator>

    <concealment>All patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation will be assessed for symptoms of anxiety and depression
After consent given patients will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to intervention (CBT) or control. Allocation concealment will be done by central randomisation by computer.
Patients will be stratified at randomisation for lung condition and severity. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be by intention to treat. Descriptive statistics will be used for exploratory analysis. t-tests and Chi-squared tests will be used to test for differences between continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively, between the intervention and control groups.  A p value (two-tailed) &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. 
A sample size of 50 intervention and 50 control participants has 80% power at alpha (significance) level 0.05 to detect a 3-fold increase in significant improvement of anxiety or depression scores, based on the assumption of improvement 10% of the control group and 33% of the intervention group.

    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess the impact and viability of CBT as a treatment for patients with chronic lung disease undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation. We expect that CBT and rehabilitation will have a synergic effect, enhancing rehabilitation benefits and improving patients quality of life through improved patients coping skills and psychological and physical well being</summary>
