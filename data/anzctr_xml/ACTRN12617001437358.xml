  <interventions>
    <interventions>Approximately 36 participants with atopic dermatitis will be enrolled and will receive BTX 1204 4% Solution or Vehicle Solution applied topically on their target lesion twice daily for 28 days. The Vehicle Solution will be identical to the BTX 1204 4% Solution, but without the active ingredient.
At the Day 1 Visit, participants will receive their first study drug application at the clinical site during the morning visit. Participants will be trained in the correct application of the study drug and provided an ample supply of study drug to complete twice daily dosing through Day 7. The first application of study drug will occur in the morning and the second application approximately 12 hours later. A diary will be maintained documenting compliance with the self-administered application. 
At the Day 8 Visit, the participant will be provided an ample supply of study drug to complete dosing through Day 14. At the Day 15 Visit, the participant will be provided an ample supply of study drug to complete dosing through Day 28. The final application of study drug will be applied by the participant on the evening prior to the Day 29 Visit.</interventions>
    <comparator>Approximately 36 participants will be randomised 2:1 to receive either active BTX 1204 4% Solution or Vehicle Solution. The Vehicle Solution will be identical to the BTX 1204 4% Solution, but without the active ingredient.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome for the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of BTX 1204 4% Solution with 28 days of twice daily application in participants with mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis. 

The primary outcome is assessed by: Adverse events, concomitant medications, laboratory findings (complete blood count, chemistry and urinalysis). Urine drug tests will be conducted for the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol. Signs of Atopic Dermatitis, cutaneous tolerability, patient reports of burning/stinging and pruritus will be recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: 
Adverse events and concomitant medications monitored from time of consent through the Day 29 visit.
Complete blood count, chemistry, and urinalysis conducted at Baseline and at Day 29.
Urine drug tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels conducted at the Baseline (Day 1), Day 8, Day 15, and Day 29 Visits.
Signs of atopic dermatis on the target lesion (erythema, exudation, excoriation, induration/papulation, and lichenification) will be obtained at the Baseline (Day 1), Day 8, Day 15, and Day 29 Visits.
Cutaneous tolerability (erythema, scaling, dryness, burning/stinging, and irritant/allergic contact dermatitis) will be obtained at the Baseline (Day 1), Day 8, Day 15, and Day 29 and graded using the following scale: 0, None; 1, Slight; 2, Moderate; 3, Severe.
Participant reports of burning/stinging and pruritus obtained daily on a Patient Diary.
Blood levels of study drug will be measured pre-dose on Day 1 (Baseline) and on Day 29.  
Pregnancy testing will be conducted for women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) at the Screening Visit, the Day 1 visit (if &gt; 7 days from the Screening Visit), and at the Day 29 Visit.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Allocation is concealed and central randomisation will occur. A randomisation code will be prepared by an unblinded statistician. This statistician will be the only person aware of the randomisation code. Randomisation will be 2:1 (24 active:12 vehicle) and done by site. Once a participant is deemed eligible to enroll, randomisation will occur. The site will contact the Interactive Web-based Response System to receive the kit number to be used for that participant throughout the study.
Sealed, unblinding envelopes will be maintained at the investigatorsâ site only for circumstances where the clinical research organisation or sponsor cannot be contacted and the participant is in imminent danger without knowledge of their treatment.

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The selected sample size is based on having appropriate sensitivity to observe a safety signal. Thirty-six (36) participants, 24 receiving active BTX 1204 4% (w/w) Solution and 12 receiving Vehicle Solution, will be adequate to detect if there are any systemic safety or tolerability concerns.
All statistical processing will be performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SASÂ®) unless otherwise stated.
Safety Analyses: All participants who receive at least one confirmed dose of study drug, and have at least one post-Baseline assessment will be included in the safety analyses.
All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring during the study will be recorded and classified based on MedDRA terminology. Treatment-emergent adverse events are those AEs with an onset on or after the first application of study medication. All reported TEAEs will be summarised by treatment group, the number of participants reporting events, system organ class, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarised by cohort, system organ class, preferred term, severity, outcome and relationship to study drug; and all SAEs will be listed by participant. In addition, a list of participants who discontinue from the study for any reason and the reason for discontinuation will be provided. The mean, standard deviation, median and range will be calculated for the change from Baseline in each Sign of AD (erythema, exudation, excoriation, induration/papulation, and lichenification) at each timepoint (Day 8, Day 15, and Day 29). In addition, a total score will be calculated based on the sum of each of the Signs of AD times the score (0, 1, 2, or 3; max score of 15) and the change from Baseline will be summarised for each timepoint.
Cutaneous tolerability scores for each parameter (erythema, scaling, dryness, burning/stinging, and irritant/allergic contact dermatitis) will be summarised for each visit. In addition, the change from Baseline in the mean scores will be summarised for each visit.
Summaries of the amount of burning/stinging and pruritus reported by the participants in the daily Patient Diary will be summarised using daily means by treatment. Graphic presentations will be prepared to display the changes in burning/stinging and pruritus over time.
Changes in laboratory parameters from Baseline to Day 29 will be summarised using shift tables to evaluate for trends. Abnormal laboratory findings will be summarised and listed by participant. Concomitant medications will be mapped to ATC Level 2 using the WHODrug dictionary. The number and percentage of participants reporting each medication will be summarised. Medications taken by each participant will be listed.
Drug Levels: Blood levels of study drug will be summarised for Baseline and Day 29. The mean, standard deviation (SD), median and range will be presented.
Demographics: Demographics/Baseline characteristics will be summarised by age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, target lesion size, and BSA of AD.
ISGA: The change from Baseline for ISGA on the target lesion will be assessed on Day 29. The mean, SD, median, and range will be presented. The proportion of participants with an ISGA target lesion score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and a decrease of 2-grades or more will be presented.
Target Lesion Size: The change from Baseline in the size of the target lesion will be determined.</statisticalmethods>
