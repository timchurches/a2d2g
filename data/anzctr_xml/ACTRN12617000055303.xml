    <interventions>Sleep HAPi is an individualised education package of information and strategies for healthy sleep during pregnancy, tailored for each participant in each trimester. Sleep HAPi is an intervention specifically designed for this study and will be used in each of the three intervention weeks; one intervention per trimester (this corresponds to time points 2, 3 and 4  see Study Process document attached to this ANZCTR registration form).   

The package comprises of:
+ A booklet providing evidence based material on:
      * The basic physiology of sleep;
      * The benefits of healthy sleep and consequences of poor sleep;
      * The fundamental principles of achieving healthy sleep;
      * Trimester specific sleep changes and expectations;
      * Trimester specific sleep suggestions.
+ A summary of the actigraphy data from the measurement week prior.

The package is designed to be expanded on over the three intervention weeks, with the majority of information provided and discussed in the first intervention week, with additional trimester specific information and actigraphy data added as the study, and pregnancy, progress.

The study will utilise both subjective and objective measures of sleep.  The subjective measures will be obtained from six questionnaires at all six time points (see Study Process attached).  The first questionnaire at T1 (study commencement) is expected to take 10 minutes, the questionnaire at T2 (11-14 weeks gestation) approximately 30-40 minutes, the questionnaires at T3 (21-24 weeks gestation), T4 (32-35 weeks gestation), T5 (6 weeks postnatal) and T6 (12 weeks postnatal) approximately 20-30 minutes each.  The first questionnaire will be completed at the initial meeting with the participant, while the remainder will be posted to the participant for completion in their own time within a specified date range.

The objective measures will be obtained from a total of six weeks of actigraphy and sleep diaries at T2, T3 and T4 - two separate weeks at each time point, one before the intervention and one after.   The participant will wear an actiwatch and fill out a sleep diary for a seven day period.  It is expected that filling out the sleep diaries will take no more than 10 minutes per day.

Analysis of the objective and subjective measures will elucidate the participants sleep behaviours and patterns, which will then be discussed with the participant during the intervention.  Relevant suggestions from the Sleep HAPi booklet will then be explored in an attempt to improve sleep.  The actigraphy week immediately following each intervention will indicate adherence and whether the sleep suggestions are improving the participants sleep.

The interventions are a one-on-one, face-to-face meeting scheduled at T2, T3 and T4.  These meetings, delivered by a Sleep Scientist, will take place at either the participants home, or at the Sleep/Wake Research Centres meeting rooms.  The first intervention at T2 is expected to be 60-90 minutes in length, with subsequent interventions at T3 and T4 expected to be 45-60 minutes in length.

Intervention fidelity is addressed by having a single researcher delivering the education package.  Intervention adherence will be assessed using an action and reflection plan.  At each intervention time point, the researcher and participant will discuss and develop a sleep action plan.  Actigraphy in the week following the intervention will be assessed to determine adherence to the action plan, and the subsequent intervention will be used to reflect on the effectiveness of the plan.

    <comparator>From October 2009 to October 2012, the Sleep/Wake Research Centre at Massey University (Wellington, New Zealand) conducted a large Health Research Council (HRC) funded project entitled 'E Moe Mama: Maternal Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand', with a cohort comprising of 1144 women: 407 Maori and 737 non-Maori women.  It was a questionnaire-based project designed to investigate relationships between sleep changes across the perinatal period and maternal health, wellbeing and mood. Comprehensive questionnaires were administered at 35-37 weeks gestation and 12 weeks postpartum, and a phone interview completed at 4-6 weeks postpartum. 

The second phase of the study, entitled 'Moe Kura', began after additional funding from Massey University was granted in late 2012.  Moe Kura investigated the sleep and wellbeing of the same woman and child, with each pair followed up with an additional questionnaire when the child was 3 years of age.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pregnancy brings enormous change to a womans life. Hormonal, physiological, and emotional changes alter many systems in the body, making it difficult for pregnant women to get enough quality sleep. In fact, by the third trimester 97% of women will experience sleep disruption of some kind. Evidence from other populations show that having poor quality sleep can trigger depression. Furthermore sleep and depression share a bidirectional relationship  poor sleep increases the risk of depression and depression contributes to poor sleep, causing a self-sustaining negative state. To add a further layer, two primary risk factors for depression in pregnancy are: 1) a prior history of depression; and 2) poor sleep quality. Pregnant women with a prior history of depression are thus highly vulnerable. 

The effects of poor sleep and depression can be severely and directly detrimental to health. It can also have tragic implications on relationships and ones ability to enjoy life. Healthy mothers, raising healthy children are fundamental to growing strong communities. At such a crucial time in life, the health, relationships and enjoyment of women and their families are of paramount importance. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the sleep quality of women throughout pregnancy (through both objective and subjective measures), establish an individualised sleep health program to facilitate good sleep patterns and habits and evaluate if better sleep health can avert depressive symptoms and the self-sustaining nature of poor sleep quality and depression. Investigating the efficacy of an intervention such as this, has been recently suggested in current literature, and is the next important step in preventing both antenatal and postnatal depression.</summary>
