  <interventions>
    <interventions>Investigational product will be administered via intravenous infusion for 30 minutes.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapies may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy other than APG-1252. Supportive care measures including those directed at controlling symptoms resulting from the patients malignancy are allowed.   Patients will be treated in 28-day cycles. Treatment will begin in the first cycle at 10 mg of APG-1252 administered via intravenous infusion for 30 minutes, twice weekly (on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 and 22 of each cycle), then will be one week off treatment before commencing the next treatment cycle. Doses can be modified depending on toxicity and PK results based on discussions with the Investigators and Sponsor. If no DLTs or less than two drug related Grade 2 toxicities are observed by the end of Cycle 1, the dose of APG-1252 will be increased in subsequent cohorts, to 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 240 mg, 320 mg and 400 mg accordingly. If a DLT or two drug related Grade 2 toxicities occur in Cycle 1 at any dose level escalation will convert to the standard 3+3 design and will occur at increments of 1.4 x the preceding dose. If greater than or equal to 2/6 patients develop DLT at any dose level dose escalation will cease and the dose level immediately below will be expanded to 6 patients. If less than or equal to 1/6 patients develop a DLT at the highest dose reached this will be declared the MTD.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the safety of APG-1252, when intravenously administered to patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or other solid tumors. All the patients will be monitored by performing and assessing the vital signs, ECG, serum chemistry, full blood examination, coagulation and urinalysis at screening, day1, day2, day 8, day 15 and day 22 of cycle 1, and day 1, day 22 for the subsequent cycles, end of study, and 30 days after last dose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline screening, cycle 1:  day1, day2, day 8, day 15 and day 22; subsequent cycle(s): day 1 and day 22, end of the study, and 30 days after the last dose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), when intravenously administered to patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or other solid tutors. DLTs are assessed and determined as per NCI CTCAE v4.0.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of each treatment cycle.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (AUC, Cmax) of APG-1252 and its metabolite APG-1252M1. Plasma and urine PK data will be analyzed using compartmental or non-compartmental methods, as appropriate, with appropriate standard non-linear analytic software. Dose proportionality will be explored by regression model for log transformed area under the curve (AUC) and maximum APG-1252 and APG-1252 M1 concentration (Cmax) data if data warranted. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be taken at Day 1, Day 2, Day 22 and Day 23. Urine samples will be collected at Day 1 and Day 22.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of APG-1252 in study participants, Blood samples for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be obtained in Cycle 1 from all patients for the analysis of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition and activation of apoptosis.  Serum will also be sampled for the detection of cytokeratin 18 (CK18) using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Tumor tissue biopsies and surrogate tissue biopsies, if easily accessible and the patient is agreeable, will be obtained in Cycle 1 for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of target-related proteins.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples (10 mL per time point) for pharmacodynamic analysis will be collected in Cycle 1 on Day 1, pre-dose (within 1 hour prior to the APG-1252 administration), 6 and 24 hours post APG-1252 administration; and on Day 22 at 6 and 24 hours post APG-1252 administration. Patients who volunteer to have paired tumor biopsies will have tumor tissue samples collected via a fresh punch or core biopsy (approximately &gt; 3 mm) at Baseline and post-treatment (at any time post dose on Day 8 until post dose on Day 22 of treatment).  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy in patients with SCLC and other solid tumors Patients with solid tumors will be evaluated for response every 2 cycles (i.e.., 8 weeks), according to the new response evaluation criteria in solid tumors: revised RECIST Guideline, Version 1.1 . The lesions will be assessed by CT, MRI, Chest X-ray, Ultrasound, Endoscopy, Laparoscopy, Tumor Markers, Cytology and Histology and etc. depending on tumour types.

    <designfeatures>This is a multi-center, single-agent, open-label, Phase I dose escalation study of APG-1252. Initially, single patient cohorts will be evaluated and doses of APG-1252 will increase to next dose level untilone DLT or two Grade 2 drug related toxicities are observed, at which point dose escalation and cohort rules will follow a standard 3+3 escalation design. Allowances for intra-patient dose escalations are provided.</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be summarized and tabulated using the latest available version of SAS analytic software. Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, range, etc.) will be derived where appropriate. Safety and tumor response data will be compared over time to assess change from baseline during treatment and follow-up. Dose level differences will be assessed using appropriate parametric or nonparametric significance tests, as applicable. Pharmacokinetic data will be analyzed with appropriate, standard non-linear analytic software. If data warrant, the relationship between PK and pharmacodynamic parameters will be explored. Exploratory data analysis may be conducted to investigate the relationship between biomarkers, for example Bcl-2 in PBMCs, and APG-1252 PK parameters. Data analysis may include fitting standard pharmacodynamic model relationships to the biomarker data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a new cancer drug, APG-1252 which has not yet been tested in humans. The study will also look at the amount of drug in the blood to evaluate the way the body processes the drug and the way the drug acts on the growth of tumours in cancer patients. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 or over, and have been diagnosed with Small cell lung cancer or other solid tumor types with no standard treatment options. Before the study starts, they are asked to sign a consent form. Each participant then goes through a series of tests to see whether the study is suitable for them. These tests include reviewing the participants medical and medication history, a physical examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG), CT and bone scans (to locate and measure tumours), taking urine and blood samples for testing and asking about how able they are to do their usual daily activities. If a participant's test results are satisfactory, they are enrolled into the study. 

Study details:  All participants in this study will receive a specified dose of APG-1252 in 28-day cycles, which is administered intravenously (i.e. directly into the vein), at a starting dose of 10mg. The first set of participants will start on the lowest dose level, with the next highest dose only commencing in the next set of participants once the safety of the first dose has been confirmed. Researchers will take a number of blood samples on days 1, 3, 8, 15, 22 of dosing in each participant to examine the rate that the body processes the drug. Further blood samples, as well as CT, MRI scans other medical imaging/assessments will be taken before treatment and at the end of treatment to look for changes in tumour growth. Participants will also be assessed for side effects throughout the study period. 

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will show whether APG-1252 can be safely given to cancer patients, and provide information on the rate of processing of the drug in the body. 
Using this information, researchers hope to find the best dose to use for further testing of APG-1252 in cancer patients.
