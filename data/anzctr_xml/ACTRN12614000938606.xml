  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Interested participants will visit www.ontrack.org.au and register online. Participants then complete the online alcohol program at their own pace. 

Participants will be asked to log into OnTrack at least once a week for three months. OnTrack provides the core alcohol program, focusing on practical skills, such as mindfulness and goal-setting. OnTrack uses elements of motivational interviewing where participants are encouraged to think about the reasons for changing their drinking behaviour. There is no focus on nutrition or physical activity.

2. The "OnTrack to Cutting Down and Feeling Good" pdf newsletters are emailed to participants once a week for 6 weeks and contain advice and ideas designed to help participants become healthier. The focus of the intervention is on addressing diet and healthy living by asking participants to increase their physical activity (specifically walking behaviour) and to increase their intake of fruit and vegetables and healthy meals.

After three months participants will be interviewed over the phone regarding their experience of using the On Track alcohol program and the Nutrition Support intervention. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored through these phone interviews.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants must report a weekly alcohol consumption over the previous month of &gt;14 standard drinks/week for both men and women.

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants must not have not used injected drugs in the previous month or report daily use of an illicit substance. They can not have a self-reported history of a psychosis lasting &gt; 2 days or a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder.  They must not be acutely suicidal.

People under the age of 18 have been excluded from this research as child and adolescent treatment requires different clinical considerations and approaches than adult. 



People in existing dependent or unequal relationships with any member of the research team will not be recruited into the study to avoid any potential coercion or breaches of confidentiality. Any people in such relationships who express interest in the research will be referred to other appropriate sources for treatment. 

As is the case for adolescents, it is recommended by the NHMRC that pregnant women abstain from alcohol use for the duration of their pregnancy. As this project does not specifically promote or require abstinence as a treatment goal, this treatment could directly conflict with this advice. Additionally, the risks involved in treatment failure are too high to be acceptable. Any pregnant women referred to the project will be referred for appropriate face-to-face treatment that can provide the high level of monitoring and support that is required by this group. People who are highly dependent on medical care may have conditions that are exacerbated by alcohol use and therefore require an abstinence goal. As for adolescents and pregnant women, these people will be referred to other appropriate treatment.

    <concealment>Interested participants will visit www.ontrack.org.au and register online. They will receive a screening telephone call where they are provided information about the research. If eligible they will be sent a link to an online survey which includes participant consent section. 

Baseline data will be obtained from participants through telephone interview online questions regarding drinking behaviour, physical activity, and diet. 

Participants then complete the online alcohol program at their own pace. These Pilot Study participants will also receive emailed Healthy Living intervention information in the form of “OnTrack to Cutting Down and Feeling Good” emailed newsletters. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>To investigate the effects of the conditions on alcohol consumption across two time points (i.e., baseline, 3 months post-baseline), SPSS Mixed Models will be utilised.  Mixed models ANOVAs allow analyses to address missing data without making data substitutions. Data on screening, refusals and dropout to be coded and reported, and the key analyses use intention-to-treat. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current project aims to conduct a Pilot Study, to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of a combined treatment, comprising an existing online alcohol support program  OnTrack (www.ontrack.org.au), together with emails and newsletters focusing on nutrition and healthy lifestyle "OnTrack to Cutting Down and Feeling Good" emailed newsletters.

Approximately fifteen male and female participants, aged over 18 years and drinking more than 14 standard drinks per week will be recruited in to the OnTrack online alcohol program. They will be assessed on their drinking behaviour, physical activity, and diet at the start of the Pilot Study and then again after participating in OnTrack Alcohol and receiving the emailed "OnTrack to Cutting Down and Feeling Good" newsletters. The participants will also be questioned by phone interview about their experiences using OnTrack Alcohol and the "OnTrack to Cutting Down and Feeling Good" emailed newsletters.
