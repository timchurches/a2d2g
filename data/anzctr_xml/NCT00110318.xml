  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Elbow pain for at least 6 weeks and satisfy the widely accepted diagnostic criteria of
             lateral epicondylalgia

          -  Diagnostic criteria are pain over the lateral humeral epicondyle that is provoked by
             gripping activities

          -  Reduced grip strength and increased sensitivity to manual palpation over the lateral
             epicondyle

          -  Reproduction of pain with stretching of the forearm extensor muscles or with specific
             resisted static contraction of extensor carpi radialis brevis is also usually present.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion Criteria.

          -  In the preceding 6 months, had consulted a health care practitioner for neck or arm
             pain or injury, other than lateral epicondylalgia, which has prevented participation
             in usual work or recreational activities

          -  Had treatment with physiotherapy or corticosteroid injections for lateral
             epicondylalgia in the preceding 6 months

          -  Upper limb fractures

          -  Diseases of the bone, muscle and nervous systems that preclude treatment by any of the
             treatments being evaluated in the project.</exclusivecriteria>
