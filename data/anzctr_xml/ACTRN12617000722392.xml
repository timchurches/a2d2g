  <interventions>
    <interventions>The BCD study uses a discrete choice experiment approach to explore the effect of changing beverage prices and exposure to educational messaging on participants' selection of sugary and non-sugary beverages.

It does not use a traditional allocation of treatment and control groups but rather the experiment allows subsequent modelling of predicted effect at a population level of changes in beverage prices and volumes. 

Study participants will complete an online experiment in which they will be given a series of 20 hypothetical non-alcoholic beverage purchasing tasks in a convenience store setting. In each task, participants will choose between seven sugary and non-sugary beverage alternatives (energy drink, plain low-fat milk, flavoured milk, bottled water, regular soft drink, diet soft drink, fruit juice, no beverage) and a no beverage alternative that will be described by attributes of those alternatives (price and volume). Prices and volumes which varied between scenarios with four generic volume levels (200mL, 330mL, 460mL, 600mL) and four alternative-specific price levels as follows:

Energy drink: $2.00, $3.30, $4.60, $5.90
Plain low-fat milk: $1.00, $2.30, $3.70, $5.00
Flavoured milk: $2.00, $3.50, $5.00, $6.50
Bottled water: $1.00, $2.30, $3.70, $5.00
Regular soft drink: $2.00, $3.50, $5.00, $6.50
Diet soft drink: $2.00, $3.50, $5.00, $6.50
Fruit juice: $2.00, $3.30, $4.60, $5.90

As this is not a traditional trial, a total of 160 choice scenarios were generated using NGene software to minimize the correlation between displayed prices and volumes (in order to isolate the effect of changing each). Each participant was randomly allocated to complete one of eight blocks of 20 choice scenarios. 

The responses from participants will be incorporated into a discrete choice model, which will then allow generation of the predicted impact of hypothetical beverage price changes on population purchases of  sugary and non-sugary beverages. 

Approximately half of participants will also be shown an educational message discouraging sugary drink consumption, prior to completing the choice scenarios, from the rethinksugary drink campaign (Copyright held by Cancer Council Victoria). The graphic message describes the sugar content of a selection of common SSBs accompanied by the message "you wouldn't eat 16 teaspoons of sugar". The message will be displayed on the screen within the online experiment for 5 seconds. </interventions>
    <comparator>This is not a traditional RCT. Therefore while no individual participant can be said to be a 'control', many participants will complete choice scenarios with prices and volumes that approximate usual prices and volumes in real-world convenience stores.  

Approximately half of participant will not be exposed to an educational message.

In the modelling of predicted population purchases of beverage under differing pricing scenarios, the 'baseline' scenario will be the mean price and volume of beverages reported to be most recently purchased in convenience stores by participants, without exposure to an educational message. </comparator>

    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software.
The sequence generation for the combination of prices and volumes per block was developed using NGene experimental design software [version 1.1.2, Choice Metrics, Australia]. An orthogonal simultaneous design was developed which minimises the correlation between the coefficients of different alternative (price and volume) levels. Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software was used to determine the order in which participants within each block saw the difference choice scenarios (each participant saw the scenarios in a unique order). </sequence>

    <designfeatures>As described above, no individual participant can be said to be allocated to an intervention or control group. Across the 20 choice sets that each participant completes, they will see a range of prices and volumes of beverages, some of which will be higher and some lower than baseline or 'real-world' prices and volumes. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Discrete choice models will be estimated using random utility theory.  Observed heterogeneity and scale will be explored via the inclusion of respondent characteristics with unobserved preference and scale heterogeneity (SE) explored using mixed logit, logit-het, latent class analysis and/or GMNL models.  Tradeoffs respondents are prepared to make across attributes will be investigated via the calculation of the marginal rates of substitution.  Predicted probability analysis will be undertaken to explore predicted beverage purchases.  This will be used to explore a number of policy relevant scenarios including testing various tax rates (e.g. 10%, 20%, 30% SSB price increase and 10%, 20%, 30% non-SSB price decrease, combined SSB price increases and non-SSB price decreases, and the effect of educational messages and their impact on predicted purchases of SSBs and non-SSBs. Predicted purchase results will be used to calculate own and cross price elasticities. Heterogeneity in such results will be explored over key characteristics of consumers such as income, gender, age and baseline SSB consumption.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) such as softdrinks, cordials, flavoured milks and sports drinks is linked to increased risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing Type 2 Diabetes and dental decay.  Increasing sugar sweetened beverage prices by taxing them and discouraging people from buying them using educational messages have both been proposed as strategies to discourage consumption. This study aims to explore the characteristics of beverages that people consider when deciding which beverage to buy. It will also examine preferences for different educational messages and pricing changes designed to reduce purchasing of sugar sweetened beverages. In this Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) participants will be asked to choose between different beverage options with variable prices, volumes and under different conditions including after seeing an educational message. We hypothesise that increasing the price of sugary drinks and showing participants an educational poster about the negative health effects of sugary drinks will both decrease the likelihood participants will select a sugary drink. The results will be relevant to government and policy makers, by helping them to understand which types and size of pricing strategies are useful in reducing sugar sweetened beverage consumption in different groups of consumers, for example those with low and high incomes. </summary>
