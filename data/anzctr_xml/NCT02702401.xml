  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with previously systemically
      treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      The primary objectives of this study are to determine 1) Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and
      2) Overall Survival (OS) of pembrolizumab plus best supportive care (BSC) compared with
      placebo plus BSC. The primary hypotheses of this study are: 1) pembrolizumab plus BSC
      prolongs PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, assessed by a
      blinded central imaging vendor compared to placebo plus BSC, and 2) pembrolizumab plus BSC
      improves OS compared with placebo plus BSC.</summary>
