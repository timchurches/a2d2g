      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) Related to Type 1 or 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions and Injection Site Reactions - Type 1 hypersensitivity or allergic reactions were possible in response to any injected protein and included shortness of breath, urticaria, anaphylaxis and angioedema. Type 3 hypersensitivity reactions were similar to Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions but were likely to be delayed from the time of injection and included symptoms such as rash, urticaria, polyarthritis, myalgia's, polysynovitis, fever and if severe then included glomerulonephritis as well. Injection site reactions included injection site bruising, discolouration, erythema, haematoma, haemorrhage, nodule, induration, pain, pruritus and rash. Participants with type 1 or type 3 hypersensitivity reactions and participants with injection site reactions were reported in this outcome measure.</outcome>
