  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are three participant groups. 
i)	Participants on methadone
ii)	Participants on buprenorphine (or buprenorphine+naloxone) 
iii)	A healthy control group.
The procedures for the first two participant groups (those on methadone and those on a buprenorphine product) will attend four sessions each, in random order, with five days washout between each session. Each session is approximately three hours long.  The cold pressor test is administered two hours after baseline.
The four sessions (which are in random order) are:
(1) 	STANDARD OPIOID MAINTENANCE MEDICATION DOSE ONLY
Standard methadone oral liquid (the participants own regular dose) OR  buprenorphine (+/- naloxone) (the participants own regular dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablet or buprenorphine plus naloxone (4:1 ratio) depending on what the participants usual OST medication is. NB naloxone is only given as part of the Suboxone combination product if that is the participants usual opioid medication, naloxone is not absorbed by the sublingual route. Naloxone is not given to other participants unless it is a part of their routine opioid agonist maintenance medication.
(2) 	THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE OF STANDARD OPIOD MAINTENANCE DOSE
In this session a 30% increase in the participants own standard methadone liquid dose or buprenorphine (+/- naloxone) sublingual tablet or film dose is given. The actual dose will depend on participants base dose.
(3)  	OXYCODONE DOSE
In this session the participants standard methadone oral liquid dose or buprenorphine (+/- naloxone) sublingual dose plus oral immediate release oxycodone tablets, dose to be equivalent to 30% of usual maintenance methadone / buprenorphine (+/- naloxone) (Note - the actual dose will depend on the participants regular dose of methadone or buprenorphine which will be used to calculate the oxycodone dose).
(4) 	GABAPENTIN DOSE
the participants standard methadone oral liquid dose / or buprenorphine (+/- naloxone) sublingual dose plus 600mg gabapentin oral tablet.

The healthy control (non-methadone, non-buprenorphine) subjects will attend the study laboratory for three 3-hour study sessions, each separated by at least 5 days. At each session, the cold pressor test will be conducted 2 hours after baseline. In random order each participant will receive

(1) 	placebo (either matched placebo for gabapentin or matched placebo for oxycodone or both, depending on active condition)

(2)	immediate release oxycodone 5mg oral tablet

(3) 	600mg gabapentin oral tablet



Cold Pressor Procedures:
 Acute pain response will be measured the two hour time point using a standardized cold pressor trial.  With this widely used experimental pain induction method, a body limb (typically the arm) is immersed cold water, reliably producing an aching pain of clinical quality and intensity. 

Cold Pressor testing approach: 

The participants will be seated in a comfortable chair, and asked to roll up their sleeve and remove watches or jewelry from their non-dominant arm and hand.  Participants will then place their forearm (to above the elbow) into the cold water bath with fingers wide apart.  No contact will be made with the side or bottom of the container.  As soon as the limb is fully immersed, timing will begin.  A water pump is placed in the cold-water container to prevent laminar warming around the immersed limb.  Participants will not be spoken to during the cold-water immersion in order to minimize any distraction or cues for time that could adversely influence pain detection and tolerance levels.

Participants will be told to inform the research staff when (a) pain is initially detected (threshold). Then they will be asked to keep the immersed limb in the container until pain can no longer be tolerated and then remove their arm (b) the time when they remove their arm from the bath is recorded by the research staff (tolerance).</interventions>
    <comparator>An increase in the participants usual methadone or buprenorphine (+/- naloxone) dose (30%) is compared with the equivalent dose of oxycodone, and also comapred with placebo. Placebos are available for oxycodone, gabapentin, methadone and buprenorphine (+/- naloxone) are identical on appearance to the active medications being used.</comparator>

Adverse events may be detected by routine monitoring of physiological measures.

Eligible participants will be deemed healthy by the study physician. Participants with a current pain condition will be excluded from the study as concurrent pain conditions may confound the results from the cold pressor test, which is being used as a model for acure pain. One arm of the study involves healthy volunteers, and the other two arms of the study are a group pf patients on methadone and a group of patients on buprenorphine.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The study is a randomised, controlled, double-blinded, double-dummy, within-subject crossover study.

As the study uses a within-subject crossover design all participants will recieve all conditions for that group. The group is determined by the participants opioid medication (one of three groups, methadone, buprenorphine or healthy control. Healthy controls are recieiving neither methadone not buprenorphine).</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple computer generated randomization to determine the order of the conditions is conducted by the PI who has no other role in data collection so the remaining study staff can remain blinded to the study condition). The randomisation is communiacted to the off site clinical trials pharmacist who makes up the medications (active and placebo) for each session, so the blind can be maintained by the study staff.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the current pilot study is to identify the efficacy of different pharmacological approaches for the management of experimentally induced nocioceptive pain in patients currently receiving opioid substitution treatment in the form of methadone or buprenorphine (+/- naltrexone) maintenance treatment (sublingual film or tablet). The pharmacological interventions to be assessed are (a) increasing maintenance opioid  dose by 30%, (b) adding opioid agonist (oxycodone equivalent to 30% of the daily opioid maintenance dose, and (c) adding gabapentin to the usual maintenance dose. The primary outcome measure is change in pain response using a cold pressor model for acute pain. Measures of safety, including physiological and cognitive measures, will also be examined.</summary>
