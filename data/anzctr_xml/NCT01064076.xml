Experimental: S-ICD System - This is a single arm study


Treatment: devices: S-ICD System
The S-ICD System is an implantable technology that uses a subcutaneous pulse generator and subcutaneous electrode system to treat ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The S-ICD System consists of the SQ-RX pulse generator (Model 1010), the Q-TRAK subcutaneous electrode (Model 3010), the Q-TECH programmer (Model 2020), and Q-GUIDE electrode insertion tools (Models 4010 and 4020).

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Free of Type I Complications at 180 Days. - Percentage of Participants Free of Type I Complications at 180 days compared to the performance goal of 79%. Type I complications are those caused by the S-ICD System.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Pass Induced VF Conversion Test - Percentage of participants who pass induced VF conversion test was compared to a performance goal of 88%. Definition of a success was two consecutive successful 65 joule shocks out of four attempts in the same polarity.</outcome>
