  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo 4 separate intramuscular injections of 5% hypertonic saline solution into their upper limbs (no therapeutic benefit) over 2 sessions.  
There will be 2 injections per session, and the sessions will seperated by at least 1 week.  The first injection in a session will be followed by the second injection by approximately 35 minutes (this time frame includes a laterality task during pain, a washout period of 10 mins, a post-pain laterality task, and a pre-pain laterality task).

Injection sites are bilateral thenar eminences and bilateral common extensor origin (CEO) on the lateral upper forearm area.  Each site will be injected once.  The same bilateral locations will be injection during 1 session - eg R and L thenar eminences or R and L CEO.

Participants complete a laterality recognition task before, during and after the painful stimulus.  The laterality task is a computer based time response measurement programme which displays pictures of hands, feet and cars of different laterality (handedness) which have been rotated around different axes.  Participants judge the laterality of each picture and input their response using the arrow keys on a keyboard.  The task takes 7.5 minutes to complete when all pictures are displayed twice.  The programme is also designed to ask participants to rate their pain levels (VAS) at 20 second intervals.  This is also inputted using the arrow keys.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants are healthy and receive the same intervention (no therapeutic benefit).  Participants used as own controls - pre, during, post painful stimulus.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the effects of experimentally induced hand and elbow pain on the mental rotation of body parts and non-body objects in healthy participants, and assess the reliability of these response patterns.

The tool used to measure this outcome is the laterality task which is a response time measurement programme.  The response times during the different pain states (pre, during, post) will be analysed to assess how the average response times change.
The pain ratings are measured using a Visual Analogue Scale measurement, and the pain perceptual characteristics are measured using the McGill pain questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There are 4 types of data to be collected: demographic data will be collected at least 1 week prior to the first injection.  The pain rating and perceptual characteristics and laterality data is collected at the time of injections (detailed below):

- immediately before the injection - the pre-pain laterality and pain rating data is collected.
- immediately after the needle is withdrawn - the during-pain laterality and pain rating data is collected.
- the perceptual characteristics data is collected when the experimentally induced pain has reached 0 (approx. 6-7 mins post needle withdrawl).
- the post-pain and pain rating data is collected following a washout period of 10 mins after the during-pain data collection has finished (at least 17.5mins after the needle has been withdrawn)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare laterality data between exposures (changes in injections sites and sides), and differences in handedness, gender, ethnicity, age (demographic data) and perceptual characteristics of pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There are 4 types of data to be collected: demographic data will be collected at least 1 week prior to the first injection.  The pain rating and perceptual characteristics and laterality data is collected at the time of injections (detailed below):

- the post-pain and pain rating data is collected following a washout period of 10 mins after the during-pain data collection has finished (at least 17.5mins after the needle has been withdrawn)</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited via notices and volunteers will be initially emailed an information sheet about the experimental pain and the study, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  If they are still interested they will be be emailed a link to complete the pain conditions questionnaires (exclusion criteria).  If suitable and willing, they will meet with NP to discuss the study, ask questions and enroll.  From there a time will be arranged to receive the intervention (all participants receive the same intervention). </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is intended to investigate how experimentally induced pain in the hand and elbow causes changes in the way people recognise pictures of hands/feet/cars as left or right handed.  If these findings are shown to be reliable, we propose that measuring the way people recognise left and right could be used to determine what sort of pain they are feeling at that time.</summary>
