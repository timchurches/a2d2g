  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ropivacaine Transversus Abdominis Plane infusion at a rate of 0.1ml/kg/hr bilaterally up to a maximum of 7ml/hr bilaterally via transversus abdominis plane catheter for 48 hours. The infusion rate will be rounded down to the nearest integer (e.g. a 68 kg patient will receive an infusion rate of 6 ml/hr bilaterally).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint of the trial will be the ratio of total morphine administration between 24-48 hours postoperatively and 0-24 hours post-operatively.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 hrs post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A sedation score greater greater than 2.
Sedation scores will be noted, with gradings as follows:
0 = alert.
1 = mild: Sometimes drowsy, easy to rouse and can stay awake once woken.
2 = moderate: Constantly drowsy, still easy to rouse, unable to stay awake once woken.
3 = severe: Constantly drowsy (somnolent), difficult to rouse, severe respiratory depression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or absence of nausea and/or vomiting in the interval prior to assessment will be noted.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or absence of pruritis (itch). A yes/no question answered by the patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain Visual Analogue Score.
Patient pain will be assessed using a visual analogue score (VAS), where patients rate their pain on a 100 mm horizontal line, with one end of the line representing no pain and the other end representing severe pain. 
Patients will be asked to note their VAS at rest and on movement or coughing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The patient's Functional Activity Score will be noted. This is a self-assessed score with gradings as follows: 
0 = no limitation - activity is unrestricted by pain. 
1 = mild limitation - activity is mild to moderately restricted by pain.
2 = severe limitation - the ability to perform the activity is severely limited by pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total morphine use 0-48 hours post-operatively.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 hours post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients to be indentified prior to surgery using surgical lists. They will be approached by research personel to explain trial and obtain consent. Patients will be randomised at the end of surgery to receiving either local anaesthetic or saline infusion. Randomization will be concealed from the investigators and patients as the randomization sequence will be held by the Pharmacy Department. When a patient is recruited, Pharmacy will be contacted and directed to make up the study solution as per the randomization schedule. The log of the bag numbers and the bag contents will be kept by Pharmacy and be available to the Principal Investigator in case of requirement for unblinding. Additionally, a sealed envelope labeled with the patient number will be attached to the infusion bags. This envelope will contain the details of the bags' contents. The envelope will be removed when the study drug comes to theatre, and kept in a locked filing cabinet in the Department of Anaesthesia of the Hospital. This will provide the means for unblinding if Pharmacy is unavailable, for example after hours.</concealment>
    <sequence>When a patient is recruited, they will be assigned a unique 5 digit study code. The first digit codes for the hospital; the next three digits represent the patient number for that hospital; and the final digit will be a check digit, being the sum of the previous four digits. 

Patients will be randomized from a pre-determined computer-generated list (random number generator with numbers 0-0.499 coding for placebo and 0.5-1.0 coding for treatment). The program will be cycled until equal numbers in each group are obtained. The column of numbers generated will be placed next to the second column of numbers listing the eighty study codes. Randomization will be stratified by centre. Randomization will be concealed from the investigators and patients as the randomization sequence will be held by the Pharmacy Department. 
When a patient is recruited, Pharmacy will be contacted and directed to make up the study solution as per the randomization schedule.
