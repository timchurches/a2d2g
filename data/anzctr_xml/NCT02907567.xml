    <inclusivecriteria>1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any
             study-related procedures. For subjects unable to provide written consent, consent will

             acceptable method of contraception.

          3. Previous decline in cognition for more than six months.

          4. Neuroimaging (MRI) obtained within the previous 6 months or during screening,
             consistent with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

          5. MMSE 18-26 inclusive.

          6. No active depression and a Geriatric Depression Score (GDS) of &lt; 6.

          9. Living at home or in a community setting (assisted living) without continuous nursing
             care. Each subject must have a reliable caregiver who sees them at least 3 times
             weekly, can oversee the administration of study drug, and is willing and able to
             participate in all clinic visits and some study procedures. Responsible caregiver must
             provide written informed consent to participate.

         10. Concurrent use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine must be stable for 90
             days prior to screening and not expected to change.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. History of or screening brain MRI scan indicative of significant abnormality,
             including, but not limited to, prior hemorrhage or infarct &gt; 1 cm3, &gt;3 lacunar
             infarcts, cerebral contusion, encephalomalacia, aneurysm, vascular malformation,
             subdural hematoma, hydrocephalus, space-occupying lesion (e.g. abscess or brain tumor
             such as meningioma).

          2. Clinical or laboratory findings consistent with:

               1. Other primary degenerative dementia,

               2. Other neurodegenerative condition

               3. Seizure disorder

               4. Other infectious, metabolic or systemic diseases affecting the central nervous
                  system

          3. A current DSM-V diagnosis of active major depression, schizophrenia or bipolar
             disorder.

          4. Clinically significant, advanced or unstable disease that may interfere with outcome
             measures, and which may bias the assessment of the clinical or mental status of the
             patient or put the patient at special risk</exclusivecriteria>
