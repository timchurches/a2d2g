    <interventions>Describe the  weight loss programs:
Both weight loss programs were used by the Dr. Rashidlamir and colleagues in their study in 2009. The study is published in the World Journal of Sport Sciences. In the present study, we used the weight loss program by doctor Amir and colleagues in 2009.(Amir Rashid lamir, Mahmood Goudarzi, Ali asghar ravasi: effect of gradual and acute weight loss on strength and endurance of well trained wrestlers. Word journal of sport sciences, 2009, 2 (4).)

Describe the twelve-day weight loss protocol (proposed weight loss):
Weight loss program was proposed, including three continuous stages, each stage was the fourth day:
In three days early from the first stage, We reduced the amount of 10 percent of lunch and dinner daily amount of the subjects., then on the fourth day of the first stage subjects lunch and dinner ate completely (similar to prior programs), second stage program, three days early in the second stage, We reduced the amount of 20 percent of lunch and dinner daily amount of the subjects, then on the fourth day of the second phase reduction in the amount of lunch and dinner was converted to 10 percent. In the third stage of the program, three days early in the third stage, We reduced the amount of 10 percent of lunch and dinner daily amount of the subjects, then on the fourth day of the third stage reduction in the amount of lunch and dinner was converted to 20 percent. There was no limitation on drinking water and no decrease in breakfast, but the subjects avoided fat in all meals. The program was implemented in the entire twelve days. These three steps were performed continuously in 12 days by the subjects.

Traditional weight loss protocol:

Traditional weight loss protocol was includes severe restrictions of food and sauna. Subjects performed the traditional weight loss protocols for 48 hours (severe food,  and fluid limitation and sauna).Severe food restriction was two days, including a Severe food restriction in the amount of breakfast and lunch and dinner (48 hours). furthermore, They used the sauna at the end of the second day(2 haurs).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>traditional weight loss protocol group:
the main result:
agrp in all subjects was significantly increased at 12 hours after the end of the weight loss program
We've collected blood samples from subjects in two stages. It had two stages for 12 hours before and 12 hours after the execution of programs. Then blood samples by the methods for analysis and was made into a case of figures and data. Then, using the software spss (using one-way Analysis of variance) the increase was found.</outcome>
      <timepoint>traditional weight loss protocol group:
glycogen depletion (for all subject, the end of the weight loss program)
Previous studies have proven that one of the main reasons for increased plasma agrp by severe food restriction is glycogen depletion. According to previous studies (about agrp), we have commented (Timepoint 1).</timepoint>

      <outcome>traditional weight loss protocol:
Increased appetite (for all subject, the end of the weight loss program)

rapid increase in weight again of wrestlers (for all subject, the end of the weight loss program)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recommended weight loss:
Stability in appetite (for all subject, the end of the weight loss program).

    <concealment>Our letter to the ethics committee as an office mail (Official) We deliver to the wrestling officials. However, this letter was not sealed. In addition, to ensure coaches and wrestlers, we have a copy of this letter and it was shown them. The reason for this was that: the subjects being studied to ensure the ethical. They understood the study methods and styles. First, letter of the University Committee for ethical approval was being studied, then this letter was given to the Board of Directors wrestling. After agreement of the Board of Directors for do procedures, we described how our study for coaches and wrestlers. The wrestlers who had qualified as volunteers participated in this study.</concealment>
    <sequence>We used the simple random sampling. Thus, the characteristics of the participants selected were identical with their society  (wrestling) (adults and overweight). Data analyzed by the One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for difference of between groups followed by Tukey post-hoc test was used to compare both groups with control group before and after the 12-day intervention. Data are presented as a means+/- standard deviation (DS). All calculations were made on SPSS/PC version 16.0.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: AGRP  is secreted from central part of the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus and candidate gene for human fatness, an appetite stimulator peptide and an acute motivator for appetite. It has an effective role on reception and selecting food, weight control and energy homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of two weight loss protocol on the plasma AGRP in well trained wrestlers.
Methods: Thirty trained wrestlers (The mean age of subjects: 24.33+/- 3.33, The mean Body mass index of subjects: 24.90+/-2.38, The mean body fat percentage of subjects:12.92+/-3.01) divided into the two experimental groups and one control group. Experimental group I: Used a 12-day weight loss program with three sessions per week practicing wrestling. Experimental groupII: Used the traditional two-day weight loss program and Sauna (DS) and Control group was without diet. Blood samples (10 cc from-brachial vein) were collected before and twelve hours after doing protocol. Furthermore, subjects percent of body fat was measured with three point method. The levels of plasma AGRP was measured with special kit using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for data processing and analysis by spss-16.
Results: Both experimental groups have a significant reduction on body weight (p&lt;0.001). D group has a significant reduction on percent of body fat (p&lt;0.05). the  plasma levels AGRP in the DS group has significantly increased (p&lt;0.001).
Conclusions: However, in aspect of descriptive consequence that traditional method (sauna, restriction food) couldnt be a suitable method for weight loss. Furthermore, it may have harmful effects on wrestlers performance, and also increasing of AGRP can be a sign of reduction of muscle glycogen stores. As well, the DS Group of wrestlers was a loss their weight in Non-academic method. This method has a negative effect on their performance. D Group showed a significant decrease in weight but there wasnt significant increase in plasma AGRP levels. Furthermore, because of no significant change in percent of body fat, the weight loss in traditional method may be due to body dehydration and restriction food intake.</summary>
