  <interventions>
    <interventions>The posture analysis of subjects with and without temporomandibular disorder was carried out by photogrammetry (SAPo v 0.68). Also, the distribution of plantar pressures was evaluated by baropodometry (software Footwork), both at rest and maximum intercuspal jaw position. The approximate duration of the assessments was two hours and the overall study was six months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the body posture and the distribution of plantar pressure at the mandibular rest and during maximal intercuspal jaw position in individuals with and without temporomandibular disorders. With the results of the study it will be possible to know the relationship between the masticatory and postural systems and this can contribute for a better diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.</summary>
