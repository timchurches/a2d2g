Active Comparator: Treatment Arm A (VMP Alone) - Participants will receive velcade (bortezomib) 1.3 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) as subcutaneous injection, twice weekly at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 in Cycle 1 followed by once weekly at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 in Cycles 2 to 9, melphalan 9 mg/m^2 , orally, once daily (on Days 1-4) and prednisone 60 mg/m^2, orally, once daily, on Days 1 to 4 of each cycle up to Cycle 9.

Experimental: Treatment Arm B (D-VMP) - Participants will receive velcade 1.3 mg/m^2 as SC injection, twice weekly at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 in Cycle 1 followed by once weekly at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 in Cycles 2 to 9, melphalan 9 mg/m^2, orally, once daily (on Days 1-4) and prednisone 60 mg/m^2, orally, once daily, on Days 1 to 4 of each cycle up to Cycle 9. In addition participants will also receive daratumumab 16 mg/kg as IV infusion, once weekly, for 6 weeks in Cycle 1 and then every 3 weeks, in Cycle 2 to 9 and thereafter, once every 4 weeks until documented progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. On days when daratumumab is given, dexamethasone 20 mg IV or PO is given 1 hour or less prior to daratumumab infusion as pre medication and prednisone substitute, and prednisone 60 mg/m2 once daily will be given on Days 2-4.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of daratumumab to velcade
      (bortezomib) melphalan-prednisone (VMP) will prolong progression-free survival (PFS) compared
      with VMP alone in participants with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are ineligible
      for high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).</summary>
