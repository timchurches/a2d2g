  <interventions>
    <interventions>There is no trial intervention. This is an observational study of men's engagement in the antenatal, birth and early postnatal period. Men will complete three questionnaires. One will be completed in the third trimester (between 30 and 40 weeks of their partner's pregnancy). A second after birth (between day 0 to 5 after the birth), and a third at six weeks postnatal (between weeks five and seven postnatal).  </interventions>
    <comparator>There is no intervention. This is an observational study. Within the study will be comparisons between men by
a) Employment (Hours worked per week and FIFO status versus not)
b) Race (ATSI verus not)
c) Age (teenage versus older)
d) Migrant status (born Australia versus not)
The primary outcome will be engagement measured using a set of five choices and validated internally (with correlation statistics) with a Likert scale score.</comparator>

Descriptive statistics
Compare continuous variables Student t test/Mann Whitney U test
Compare discrete variables Chi Square/Fisher Exact test
Multivariate analysis of variables significantly associated with engagement on univariate analysis including all variables significant at p&lt;0.1 in model
Sample size was determined to provide power &gt;80% and alpha error &lt;0.05 to assess differences in engagement of 15% between men in categories under comparison (e.g. FIFO, teenage, migrant, ATSI) from the background rate in the wider cohort assumed to be 50%. The study population was selected to ensure adequate numbers of subpopulations as well as a large comparison group. This generated a sample size of 1000.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prospective study of 1000 men who are the acknowledged father of an unborn baby. Men will be recruited via their partner. Following informed consent, men are followed across the antenatal period, birth and their involvement in the study concludes six weeks postpartum.
Men complete an antenatal, birth and postnatal questionnaires that addresses demographic, engagement, anxiety and depression, quality of life questionnaires and in addition questionnaires specific to each stage (antenatal focuses on pregnancy issues, birth on birth issues and postnatal on issues anticipated to arise in the first six weeks postpartum).</summary>
