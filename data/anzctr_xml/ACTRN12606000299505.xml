    <interventions>A prospective randomised controlled trial of the costs and benefits of the Chronic Disease Community Program compared to usual care, in patients with COPD. 

Study Intervention
The Chronic Disease Community Program (CDCP) is a health systems intervention. CDCP aims to:
1. Improve information flow between hospitals, GPs and community-based health providers
2. Facilitate case conferences and care planning where appropriate
3. Increase access to Chronic Disease Self Management (CDSM) Programs and telephone coaching, home medicines review, allied health assessments and interventions and oral health care. 
4. Plan and coordinate services to meet individual patient needs
Individual programs are usually completed within 6 months, depending on access and scheduling of program components.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control intervention
The control group will receive usual care from their general practitioner and other community health providers for 6 months following discharge from hospital. After 6 months, these participants can elect to participate in the CDCP.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is often associated with high health care costs and a reduced quality of life for sufferers. Many different approaches have been used to assist patients to manage their condition at home and to improve communication between hospitals and GPs. Some approaches have been very successful, others less so. Some programs are expensive and some patients derive greater benefit than others.

This study examines the costs and benefits of a program run by the Southern Adelaide Health Service (SAHS) for people with chronic lung disease, diabetes and heart failure. The study examines what impact the program is having on the rate of readmission to hospital, GP visits and other health costs, including use of medicines, for people with COPD. We will compare the Southern Adelaide program with usual care when a patient has had a recent hospital admission.
Measuring lung function when a person with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is well, provides a good indication of disease progression. There may be other simpler indicators however, that help predict when, and how often, a person with chronic lung disease is likely to need hospital care. This is the second question that the study has been designed to answer.</summary>
