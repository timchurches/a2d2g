  <interventions>
    <interventions>The initial visit will involve randomisation to receive either an active intervention or sham. The active intervention is a single high-velocity low-amplitude lumbar manipulation targeting the L5-S1 facet joint on the participant's most symptomatic side. The participant will be in the side-lying position, with the upper leg bent and lower leg straight. The clinician will contact the target joint with their hand, and stabilise the participant at the shoulder and knee. The clinician will then deliver a rapid and short thrust into the joint into the joint. A cracking or popping noise may be heard during the SMT. This will take approximately 1 minute to complete, and will be delivered in a private research room, on a chiropractic examination table, by a chiropractor with a minimum of 3 years clinical experience. Several chiropractors will deliver these interventions, and will receive training to standardise techniques and participant interaction, in the form of a single 30-60 minute small group workshop run by a researcher who is also a chiropractor.
At each of 3 follow-up visits, the intervention is a pragmatic chiropractic treatment (not randomised) involving a combination of mid and lower back spinal manipulation, spinal mobilisation, soft tissue therapy, education, and advice as appropriate for the individual participant. The specific treatment approach will be determined based on the participant's history and physical examination. The follow-up treatments are expected to take 10-15 minutes, and are intended to replicate an evidence-based private practice chiropractic treatment. These will be delivered by a researcher who is a chiropractor with &gt;3 years clinical experience, and each of the 3 follow-up visits will occur within 4-10 days of the previous visit. Treatment notes will be kept at each follow-up visit, recording symptomatic change, physical examination findings, specific treatments delivered, and advice provided.</interventions>
    <comparator>At the initial visit, lumbar manipulation will be compared against a sham manipulation which involves similar positioning but without a thrust to the spine. This will be delivered by trained chiropractors with &gt;3 years' clinical experience. No sham interventions will be delivered at the follow-up visits.
20 healthy volunteers (without a history lower back pain) will not receive an intervention, undergoing baseline measures only.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The clinician providing the intervention at the initial visit will randomise the participant to one of two groups with the use of sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes containing randomised 1s or 2s. Group one will receive a lumbar manipulation and group two will receive a sham lumbar manipulation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The ones and twos will be generated and placed into the sequential envelopes using an online random number generator with 1:1 allocation, by a researcher not involved in data collection (http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/).</sequence>

    <designfeatures>After the initial visit, the study becomes observational only, with active interventions provided to all participants. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on a study by Waller et al. 2015, to see a 15% change (effect size 0.64) in pressure pain threshold at the lumbar spine, based on 80% power and with alpha at 5%, a sample size of 40 per intervention group (80 total) will be required. An additional 20 healthy volunteers (no lower back pain) will be required at baseline.
This also satisfies sample size calculations for the other primary outcome measure, and for the observational studies also planned using the data from this trial.
Data analysis is planned as a repeated measures ANOVAs with factors of time and group. The data will also be analysed based on subjective lower back pain features and psychosocial questionnaires. Pearson's correlation and multiple regression are planned for observational data. A biostatistician will assist in choosing and running appropriate analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a randomised trial looking at how pressure pain threshold and temporal sensory summation change following lumbar spinal manipulative therapy, by comparing this to a sham treatment. It also aims to look at how pain sensitivity differs between people with and without lower back pain, depending on the severity of lower back pain, and based on how they respond to treatment. We will recruit 80 participants with lower back pain, who will randomly receive either a lumbar or sham manipulation. Pain sensitivity will then be measured at various areas of the body for 30 minutes. Participants will then return for 3 additional visits, where pain sensitivity will be measured again before receiving a real treatment, involve manipulation, mobilisation, and soft tissue therapy as deemed appropriate for that participant. 20 healthy volunteers without lower back pain will also have their pain sensitivity measured, but will not receive treatment.</summary>
