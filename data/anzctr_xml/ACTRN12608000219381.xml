    <interventions>Cystoscopy (+/- bladder biopsy) and questionaires to diagnose Interstitial Cystitis. Questionaires include details on demographics, pelvic pain symptoms with visual analogue scales to rate severity, urinary symptoms with Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency (PUF) and O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index and Problem Index questionaires. These questionaires are given to participant at recruitment preoperatively. The duration of observation is from recruitment to the completion of the operation with or without biopsy results. There are no follow up questionaires planned at this stage.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prospective Observational study looking at the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis in women with chronic pelvic pain. Women who are booked for a laparoscopy as part of their investigation for chronic pelvic pain are recruited. Questionaires on demographics, pelvic pain symptoms and urinary symptoms are given and cystoscopy added to the procedure if not already planned for. Findings at cystoscopy such as glomerulation and Huner's ulcer, and at laparoscopy such as endometriosis and its stage, are recorded. Outcomes of proportion of these women with interstitial cystitis will be looked at. Comparison will also be made of the presenting symptoms between the groups of women who have interstitial cystitis alone; endometriosis alone,;both and neither conditions.</summary>
