19.  Medical requirement for intravenous immunoglobulin or blood transfusions.
20.  Participation in any investigational product study within the 8 weeks preceding the study.
21.  Participation in any research study involving significant blood sampling, or blood donation to Red Cross (or other) blood bank during the 8 weeks preceding the reference drug dose in the study.
22.  Have ever received a blood transfusion.
23.  Positive test for HIV, Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus I  &amp; II (HTLVI &amp; HTLVII), and syphilis.
24.  Any clinically significant biochemical or haematologic abnormality (Hb must begreater than or equal to 13.5g/dL).
25.  Ingestion of any poppy seeds within the 48 hours prior to the screening blood test 
(volunteers will be advised by phone not to consume any poppy seed in this time period).
26.  Detection of any drug listed Appendix 3 "Laboratory Values" in the urine drug screen unless there is an explanation acceptable to the medical investigator (e.g. the subject has stated in advance that they consumed a prescription or OTC product which contained the detected drug) and/or the subject has a negative urine drug screen on retest by the pathology laboratory. These drugs include: Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, Barbituates, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Methadone, Opiates, Phencyclidine, Tetrahydrocannabinols and Tricyclic anti-depressants.  
27.  Evidence of any condition that, in the opinion of the clinical investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives or pose excessive risks to participants.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is examining the infectivity of a Plasmodium falciparum NF54 malaria cell bank in humans.  Participants will receive a single inoculum of the malaria cell bank, which consists of human red blood cells containing P. falciparum NF54 malaria parasites.  Following administration of the inoculum, we will measure the growth of the malaria parasites in the blood-stream and then administer anti-malarial treatment (Riamet) according to specific criteria (based on the number of parasites in the blood as well as clinical signs/symptoms of malaria).  We will also be assessing the safety of the inoculum and also the way the immune system responds to it.  Determining the infectivity and safety of the malaria cell bank is important as it will form a critical part of future clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of a new malaria vaccine that is currently being developed.</summary>
