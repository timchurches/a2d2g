  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study consists of 2 parts:
Part 1:  open label single ascending dose study
Part 2:  randomized cross-over study comparing the Dexmedetomidine Transdermal System (DMTS) to an IV dose of dexmedetomidine

Dexmedetomidine Transdermal System (DMTS) is a 3 cm squared patch.  Each 3 cm squared patch contains 0.73 mg of dexmedetomidine and formulated to deliver an average rate of 2 mcg/h over 3 days.  Each patch will be worn for 3 consecutive days without any patch changes.  The patch will be applied to a non-hairy portion of the subject's upper arm.    

Patch adhesion will be assessed visually by the study staff at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after application and immediately prior to removal.    

Part 1 is a single ascending dose study to determine a maximum tolerable dose (MTD) .  The study will increase dose by 3 cm squared patch.  The starting dose is 6 cm squared, followed by 9 cm squared, 12 cm squared, 15 cm squared, 18 cm squared, 21 cm squared, and 24 cm squared.  Dose escalation decision will be made by a separate safety monitoring committee.  The committee will review safety data from the previous dose group and decided whether a dose escalation is permitted.  

Part 2 consists of 3 days of DMTS treatment followed by 3 days of washout, and IV dexmedetomidine followed by 3 days of washout.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group only relates to the bioavailability (Part 2) portion of this study.

The control treatment is a 10-minute IV infusion of dexmedetomodine hydrochloride at a dose of 1mcg/kg.  
</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A primary outcome of this study is the assessment of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DMTS following a single 3-day application.    

The MTD will be determined by testing increasing doses on different cohorts of subjects until the highest dose with acceptable side effects is found. 

At the end of each cohort, a safety monitoring committee will review the following data:  skin irritation, clinical lab results (haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, adverse events, cardiac telemetry, sedation scores and concomitant medications.  


</outcome>
      <timepoint>Maximum tolerated dose will be assessed on Day 1 (dosing)- Day 7.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A primary outcome of this study is the bioavailability of dexmedetomidine from the DMTS at the maximum tolerated dose against Precedex IV infusion.  This outcome is determined by assessing the blood level of dexmedetomidine and calculating the dexmedetomidine clearance for the Precedex treatment.  .    </outcome>
      <timepoint>While on patch, blood levels will be evaluated at:  pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after application; before patch removal, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 32, and 40 hours after patch removal.  

While on IV Precedex treatment, blood levels will be evaluated at pre-dose, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 hours after the start of infusion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of DMTS following a single 3-day application of the DMTS compared with a 10-minute Precedex IV infusion.   The pharmacokinetic profile is assessed by determining pharmacokinetic parameters (Tmax, Cmax, AUC, and half-life) via blood samples.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>While on patch, blood levels will be evaluated at:  pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after application; before patch removal, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 32, and 40 hours after patch removal.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the sedation effect of dexmedetomidine as per the original Wilson sedation scale.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>While on patch, sedation will be assessed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 36, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, and 60 hours after patch application; before patch removal, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 hours after patch removal.

While on IV treatment, sedation will be assessed just before the end of the infusion, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after infusion start.   </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the adhesion of the DMTS by assessing the percentage of area the patch adheres to.  This will be visually inspected by the study staff.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Patch adhesion will be assessed at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after application and immediately prior to removal.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the systemic safety and tolerability of the DMTS as determined by vital signs, physical exams, clinical laboratory tests, ECG findings, cardiac telemetry events, concomitant medications and adverse events.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments will occur:
Vital Signs:  daily
Physical exams:  predose and end of study
Clinical laboratory tests:  predose, Day 4 or Day 7, end of study
ECG:  predose, end of study
Cardiac telemetry:  Continuous reading starting from 12 hours before study drug administration to 12 hours after completion.  
Concomitant medications:  daily
Adverse events:  daily
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The dermal tolerability of the DMTS through assessment of skin irritation.  </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is an open-label study whereby the study staff (including the study doctor), pharmacist, study monitor, and subject will be aware of the assigned treatment.  The randomisation list for the bioavailability portion of the study will be maintained and used by the study staff for treatment allocation.  Treatment allocation is not concealed.

If the subject is deemed eligible for the MTD portion of the study, the subject will be allocated the next dose.  A subject will be considered eligible to participate in this study if all inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria are met.  

The study inclusion and exclusion criteria are the same for Part 1 and Part 2 of the study.  Only 1 part of the study is offered at any given time.  For example, a subject will only be enrolled into Part 2 when Part 1 is complete.  

If the subject is deemed eligible for the bioavailability portion of the study, the subject will be randomized to one of the two treatment sequences.  Each eligible subject in the bioavailability portion of the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, as per the randomisation list, to one of two treatment sequences:

Sequence A:  Precedex IV infusion first then DMTS treatment
Sequence B:  DMTS treatment first then Precedex treatment
</concealment>
    <sequence>In the MTD portion of the study, single ascending doses will be evaluated sequentially and subject will be assigned to the dose cohort being evaluated at the time of their enrolment.

In the bioavailability portion of the study, a simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by the computer  software will be used.  Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio.  No stratification factors in this randomisation.  </sequence>

    <summary>This is a second in human study for DMTS.

This open-label study consists of 2 parts:
Part 1 is a single ascending dose study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of DMTS.
Part 2 is bioavailability study 

The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of the DMTS following a single 3 -day application (Part 1)  and how much dexmedetomdine from the DMTS at the MTD is available in the body after a 3-day treatment (Part 2).</summary>
