  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness in the Study Eye - Central retinal thickness is assessed in the study eye by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system that provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina from which retinal thickness can be measured. A negative change from baseline in retinal thickness indicates an improvement and a positive change from baseline indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 26</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured in the study eye using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase from baseline in the number of letters read correctly indicates improvement and a decrease from baseline in the number of letters read correctly indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 26</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With at Least 10 Letters of Improvement in BCVA From Baseline in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured in the study eye using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly indicates improvement and a decrease in the number of letters read correctly indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 26</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With Fluorescein Leakage as Measured by Fluorescein Angiography (FA) in the Study Eye - Fluorescein leakage is measured in the study eye by FA. FA is a technique for examining the circulation of the retina (and detecting any leakage) using a dye-tracing method. The assessment of fluorescein leakage compared to baseline is categorized as Improved (leakage area decreased = 10%), Unchanged (leakage area changed &lt; 10%), and Worsened (leakage area increased = 10%).</outcome>
