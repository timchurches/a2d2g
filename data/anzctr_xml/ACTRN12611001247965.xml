  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Cardiva VASCADE VCS consists of a sterile disposable catheter containing a deployable extravascular collagen patch and a clip.  The VASCADE VCS is intended to seal a femoral arterial access site at the end of any procedure that uses a 5 French introducer sheath to access the femoral artery.  This is a one time use device.  The procedure of deploying the collagen patch takes less than 3-5 minutes.</interventions>

    <summary>The Cardiva VASCADE VCS consists of a sterile disposable catheter containing a deployable extravascular collagen path and a clip.  The VASCADE VCS is intended to seal or close the femoral arterial access site while reducing time to hemostasis (stop the bleeding process), time to ambulation (when a person can walk), and time to hospital discharge in subjects who have undergone diagnostic or interventional endovascular procedures.</summary>
