  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a clinical study aiming at establishing immunological assays for the
      qualitative and quantitative evaluation of WT-1, Survivin and HPV16 E7-specific immune
      responses in cancer patients. Such a study will allow the development of suitable
      immunological tools to be used in assessing response in a subsequent phase I study aiming at
      evaluating therapeutic vaccine candidates targeting WT-1, Survivin and/or HPV16 E7-expressing
      tumors. In addition, this study will help defining the baseline cancer-associated immune
      responses in the selected patient population.

      Cervical and ovarian cancer patients, as well as leukemia patients, will be included in this
      study.

      WT-1, Survivin and HPV-specific immune responses will be monitored in these patients by ex
      vivo and cultured IFNg ELISpot as well as tetramer staining.</summary>
