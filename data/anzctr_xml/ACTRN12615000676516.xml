  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be a case-control study of 3000 patients admitted to hospital with first time acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 3000 age, gender and ethnicity-matched controls with no known coronary disease.

The protocol consists of a baseline visit either during admission for cases or at an outpatient clinic for controls where clinical and dietary information will be collected along with a blood sample for genomic and biomarker analysis. Subsequent hospital admissions and mortality will be followed for up to 5 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary composite endpoint of death, recurrent ACS, revascularisation, and readmission for a cardiac cause.

This is assessed via linkage of data with the All NZ Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement (ANZACS-QI) database (which will include outcomes) via encrypted patient national health identifier number.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1, 3, and 5 years after baseline assessment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whole genome sequencing will be performed on the DNA samples of participants to search for genetic variants affecting the risk of acute coronary syndromes.

With whole genome data available, we can undertake hypothesis free unbiased discovery studies and investigate biological networks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be a large scale, multicentre
longitudinal casecontrol study with a long term follow up through the All NZ Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality
Improvement (ANZACSQI) database. The aim is to determine how the genomic and envinronmental risk profiles differ according to ethnicity, age and gender. 

Patients with first time Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) will be eligible. A control population will be enrolled through collaboration with primary health care organisations. This will identify an age, gender and ethnicity matched population with no history of coronary disease or surgery. 
We hypothesise that:
a) Genomic profiles of patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes will differ depending on ethnicity and age of onset of disease
b) Different risk alleles will be identified in different ethnic groups and in younger individuals that will yield insights into underlying pathophysiology, and phenotypic differences in disease expression and progression
c) Prognostic variables will be identified from genomic and biomarker analysis that will be able to be incorporated into risk prediction models for outcome
