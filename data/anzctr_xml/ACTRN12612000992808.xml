  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acupuncture: 
Study Duration: the whole study will take 15 weeks starting from the screening, and including the baseline and end measurement sessions as well as twelve  acupuncture treatment sessions.
Intervention: each acupuncture treatment session will be one hour in duration with a total of 12 treatment sessions (2 x bi-weekly treatments for two weeks, 1 x weekly treatments for the next 6 weeks and finally 2 x fortnightly treatments for the next four weeks). 
Mode of administration: The acupuncture treatment involves single-use disposable acupuncture needles that vary between 13-40mm in length and 0.18-0.25mm in diameter. The points of application will vary depending on the stage of treatment but will be points that regulate activity of the respiratory tract, and tonify the Spleen, Kidneys and Lungs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham Acupuncture: 
Study Duration: the whole study will take 15 weeks starting from the screening, and including the baseline and end measurement sessions as well as twelve  acupuncture treatment sessions.
Sham Intervention: each session will be one hour long in duration with a total of 12 sham treatment sessions (2 x bi-weekly treatments for two weeks, 1 x weekly treatment for the next 6 weeks and finally 2 x fortnightly treatments for the next four weeks).
Mode of administration: The sham acupuncture will be sham laser acupuncture treatment in which the diode has been removed from the laser to ensure that the treatment is biologically inactive. The points used in treatment will be identical to the points used in the needle acupuncture treatments. Patients will be told that they are receiving laser acupuncture. Participants will be aware before consenting that some participants will receive a placebo treatment.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>at screening and at 13 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Activity of the genioglossus muscle both during wakefulness and during sleep in response to airway occlusions as measured via intramuscular electrode wires inserted into the genioglossus muscle</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and at 13 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean arousal threshold defined as the maximal respiratory effort required to arouse from sleep in order to re-open the airway thereby terminating an occlusion. This is taken as the average pressure in the throat just prior to termination of respiratory events. A pressure tipped catheter will be advanced through the nasal cavity to the back of the throat to take this measure.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Upper Airway Resistance during wakefulness. Resistance is measured as a function of nasal to epiglottic pressure as measured by an epiglottic pressure catheter and a pressure catheter at the back of the nasal chonae.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a disorder characterised by repetitive obstruction of the throat during sleep. People who suffer from OSA have increased risk of heart disease and are often very tired during the daytime. Currently, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most common treatment for OSA because it treats the disorder in almost all patients. Many patients, however, do not like using CPAP for several reasons (for example it is bulky, or is uncomfortable), and therefore choose not to use it. For this reason, we wish to find an alternative treatment that is effective and well tolerated by patients.
A recent research paper has suggested that acupuncture can lower the severity of OSA. However, the authors did not investigate how acupuncture caused the change in OSA severity. Our study aims to 1) see whether acupuncture treats OSA, and 2) try and work out how acupuncture is improving the severity of OSA. It is hypothesized that patients will experience fewer respiratory events and experience less daytime sleepiness after twelve treatments of acupuncture, but that placebo acupuncture will have no effect on the severity of OSA or sleepiness. It is also hypothesized that for those patients who experience reductions in the severity of their OSA symptoms will show changes in the activity of the airway muscles, changes in the resistance to airflow in their throat and changes in the amount of effort required to wake them from sleep while they are having a respiratory event.</summary>
