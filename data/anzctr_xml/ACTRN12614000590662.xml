  <interventions>
    <interventions>Advanced Care Planning (ACP) plus Symptom Management and Support (SMS) is a two-pronged intervention.  The ACP prong of the intervention is a series of nurse-lead discussions which explore and identify values and concerns relating to the participants health care and management of care at end of life.  The discussions will include the patient and the patient's carer if available and willing to participate in the discussion.  It is anticipated that the discussions will take place over the course of up to four visit about 1 - 1.5 hours in length.  The sessions will be scheduled at the participant's convenience, but likely not more than once per week.  The ACP process will involve identification of an appropriate substitute decision maker and may involve the writing of an informal advance care plan to guide others in making substitute decisions and/or the writing of a formal Advance Care Directive.  The ACP prong will also include documentation of the ACP or ACD in the participants medical record and appropriate communication of ACP/ACD documents to relevant health care providers including General Practitioners (GPs), Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) staff, specialists, NSW Ambulance, ED staff and community health nurses.  

The SMS prong of the intervention is an education component provided to the participants GPs and other health care providers.  The education component includes: in-service style training by a member of the research team conducted at baseline and repeated at 6 months; individualised education regarding palliative care; provision of a symptom management resource list; letter to GP with information about Plan Early and ACP, written information about referral to specialist palliative care, and 6 weekly follow-up telephone calls to GP and family; and education and training of RACF staff and General Practitioners in the SELHD Terminal Care Plan.

In addition, the research nurse will schedule home visits with the participant and carer to administer questionnaires
at 9 week intervals for six months or until death, whichever is sooner.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment.  Standard treatment will be usual care, which is standard evidence-based care provided at the discretion of the patients GP and other health care providers.  As health conditions will vary among participants in the control group, usual care is also expected to vary.

In addition, the research assistant will send questionnaires to the participant and their carer at 9 week intervals for six months or until death, whichever is sooner.  Questionnaires which are not returned are followed up by telephone from the research assistant.</comparator>

    <concealment>Eligible patients are identified by clinical staff in the Prince of Wales Hospital Emergency Department using the iPAL-EM guide.  The project nurse or ED staff member then introduces the trial, provides basic written information about the trial and requests permission to follow-up at a later date.  The project nurse contacts the patient within one week’s time to further explain the study and schedule a home visit including the patient’s carer if the patient wishes.  During the home visit, the project nurse explains the trial again and obtains the patient’s informed consent.  After consenting the patient, the project nurse opens a numbered, sealed envelope containing the treatment allocation.  The research assistant completed the randomisation and concealment before any home visits were scheduled.  The research assistant has no contact with the eligible patients prior to randomisation and will not reveal the randomisation procedure or assignments to the project nurse.</concealment>
    <sequence>Blocked randomisation with varying block sizes was selected in order to ensure an equal number of participants are randomised to each treatment group.  A random number generator available online was used to conduct the randomisation.</sequence>

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 500 has been chosen to allow detection of a change in survival of 12% or greater.  Power is therefore also sufficient to demonstrate equivalence with regard to survival.  Survival, however, is not our primary outcome measure, which is the POS (patient), a quality of life measure which requires a smaller sample size.  We expect just over half to survive (pControl=0.52) to 4months. A positive change greater than or equal to 12% (corresponding to pIntervention&gt;=0.64) would be detected as statistically significant (with alpha=0.05, beta=0.2). Effect sizes below this number would not be detected with a sample size of 500.

We will use intention to treat (ITT) analysis which includes all randomised patients in the groups, regardless of adherence to treatment received and death.

Baseline Analyses:  Baseline measurements across groups will be compared to validate randomisation.  Comparison of the main outcome between the control and the intervention group will be performed using the Mann-Whitney U test (for discrete categorical variables). A random intercepts model for either ordinal or multinomial logistic regression will be used to account for correlation between repeated measurements for the same person.

Secondary Analyses:  Comparisons of mortality (or other binary variables) will be performed using the Pearson Chi-square test while analysis of continuous secondary variables will use t-test calculations. If needed (in the presence of not normally distributed outcomes or small frequency numbers), non-parametric methods will be used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Plan EARLY is a randomised trial to assess the impact of Advance Care Planning (ACP) intervention on documentation of ACP, symptom management, healthcare utilisation and concordance with participant wishes in adults with an advanced, progressive life-threatening illness who present to the Emergency Department and who do not require referral for specialist palliative care.  The trial will also seek to recruit the participants carers if available.  Failure to recruit the carer will not result in the patients exclusion from the trial.  Participants are randomised to one of two treatment groups: advance care planning (ACP) for patients plus Symptom Management and Support (SMS) for their healthcare providers, or Usual Care.  

The ACP plus SMS intervention involves: up to 4 face to face visits with a project nurse at the participants place of residence to discuss and complete ACP; completion of questionnaires at 9 weekly intervals; in-service style education to ED staff, RACF staff and GPs; individualised education to GPs regarding symptom management; written information regarding ACP, Plan EARLY and referral to specialist palliative care; and follow-up telephone calls to GP and family members at 6 week intervals.  

Usual care is the standard clinical care provided by the patients regular treating team.  As health conditions are expected to vary among participants in the control group, the usual care may differ between participants.  Participants randomised to the control group will complete questionnaires regarding their care and symptoms at 9 week intervals over a 6 month period.  Furthermore, the SMS education component will be offered to healthcare providers of patients randomised to the intervention group only.  However, it is expected that there may be some contamination of the control group with regard to SMS education as inevitably some healthcare providers will care for patients in opposite treatment groups.  Participants in the SMS education component will not be asked to withhold the skills they may have acquired from patients randomised to the control group.

Project staff will collect health care utilisation data from hospital records for participants in both the intervention and control groups.

During the course of the study referral to specialist palliative care will be offered if care needs, such as symptom burden greater than 3/10 on SAS or distress requiring multidisciplinary specialist care, are identified.  

Finally, health care providers who participate in the SMS education component will be asked to complete an evaluation of the training received.
