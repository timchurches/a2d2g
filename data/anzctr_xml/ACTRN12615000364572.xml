  <interventions>
    <interventions>Six sessions of 45 mins of Bowen therapy over 6 weeks. Bowen therapy will be administered by a qualified Bowen therapist and involves a series of precise, gentle and painless pressure moves, called Bowen Moves, that are applied with the thumbs and fingers onto specific points of muscles, tendons and ligaments.</interventions>
    <comparator>1) Six sessions of 45 mins of sham Bowen therapy over 6 weeks
2) Usual care for 6 weeks

Sham therapy will involve "pseudo-Bowen" moves that will involve skin touch but will not include pressure.
Usual care will require participants to continue with their normal therapy (if any) over the 6-week period.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bowen therapy is a manual therapy type of complementary medicine developed in the mid-1980s. It involves precise, gentle and painless pressure moves, called Bowen Moves, applied with the thumbs and fingers onto specific points of muscles, tendons and ligaments. Preliminary evidence has indicated that it can reduce pain in some chronic pain conditions; however, the evidence to date has been provided from uncontrolled pilot studies. The goal of the current study is to determine the effects of Bowen Therapy on pain and function in people with chronic widespread pain. A randomised controlled trial will be undertaken with three groups. One group will receive real Bowen therapy, one group will receive sham Bowen therapy, and the third group will receive ongoing care. Outcome measures assessing pain function will be obtained prior to the intervention, one week after the 6-week intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. The study will identify any specific effects that Bowen therapy has on the function of the pain system and how this influences function.</summary>
