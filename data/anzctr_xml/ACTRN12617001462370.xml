  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the study were cardiac and vascular surgical patients admitted in the elective or acute setting at a tertiary public hospital (Waikato Hospital, New Zealand) between December 2008 and February 2009. Prior to surgery included participants completed two questionnaires: the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) questionnaire and the Identity Consequences Fatigue Score (ICFS) questionnaire. The duration of observation was from surgical admission until 6 months post operatively.

The MNA questionnaire was used to screen for preoperative nutritional status and consisted of two sections: screening and assessment. Using a scoring system, the screening section assessed loss of appetite, weight loss, mobility, psychological stress, acute disease, neuropsychological problems and BMI. Patients were then allocated into normal and possible malnutrition subgroups. If classified as possible malnutrition, then the patient would complete a more detailed assessment section evaluating their dietary history, and psychosocial and health status, including both mid- arm and calf circumferences.

The ICFS measured self-reports of patient fatigue and, following preoperative completion,  was then posted to participants for self-completion at 2 and 6 months postoperatively. Patients were contacted by phone to ensure receipt of questionnaires and a reminder phone call was conducted if a completed questionnaire was not received within a week, through a pre-paid envelope provided. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relationship between pre-operative nutritional status and post-operative fatigue assessed using pre-operative nutritional status (assessed by the MNA questionnaire) and post-operative fatigue (assessed by the ICFS questionnaire).

Bi-serial-correlation tested the relationship between nutritional status (dichotomous variable: 0-11 possible malnutrition and 11-14 normal nutrition) and fatigue, due to the non-linear intervals on the scale. Unpaired t-tests identified variables for construction of multiple regression analyses, while association between categorical variables was investigated using Pearsons chi-square statistics. Mixed ANOVA detected differences in mean measurements of fatigue between the two nutritional groups. In addition, repeated measures over the three time points and the interactional effect between time and nutritional status were analysed.</outcome>

      <outcome>Comparison of changes in the levels of post-operative fatigue for normal and possible malnutrition nutritional groups. Contrast analysis was performed to identify the significance of fatigue change between patients pre-operatively and 2 months postoperatively, as well as the change in fatigue between 2 and 6 months post-operatively. </outcome>

      <outcome>Assess the influence of nutritional and surgical variables on post-operative fatigue levels. 

Multiple regression studies were constructed to identify nutritional status variables (as per the MNA and ICFS score) and other co-morbidities (including smoking status, pre-existingÂ renal disease, major surgery and re-operation for vascular surgery) which best explained levels of fatigue. Variables were selected by first including all factors and then removing all that were not significant. Significance unless otherwise specified was defined as p&lt;0.05.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nutritional status is an important prognostic factor in surgical patients. Fatigue is common after surgery and if unmanaged may impair healing and recovery. Objectives: Examine the relationship between pre-operative nutritional status and post-operative fatigue at 2 and 6 months. Compare changes in the levels of post-operative fatigue for different nutritional groups over 6 months. Assess the influence of nutritional and surgical variables on post-operative fatigue levels at 2 and 6 months. Design: Using the Mini Nutritional Assessment questionnaire, preoperative nutritional status was screened and patients categorised to normal nutrition or possible malnutrition.  Self-reports of patient fatigue were measured preoperatively, and 2 and 6 months postoperatively with the Identity Consequences Fatigue Score (ICFS) questionnaire.</summary>
