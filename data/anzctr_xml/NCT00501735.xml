  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm trial that will be conducted at up
      to 50 sites in North America, Europe and Australia. This study is designed to assess
      objective response (OR) [complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)] in subjects with
      cutaneous manifestations of CTCL with a requirement for maintenance of such objective
      response for at least 28 days in subjects with stage IIB, III, and IVA CTCL. Additionally,
      this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of CTCL subjects Stages IB, IIA, IIB,
      III, or IVA treated with oral forodesine.</summary>
