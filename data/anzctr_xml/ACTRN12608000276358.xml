    <interventions>Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) is a relatively new stress-reduction technique whose aim is to remove neurological abnormalities which have a specified physiopathological pattern.  Oftentimes emotional trauma can cause a learned emotional response, a conditioned fear, and as a result, a related physiopathological pattern.  Under normal conditions, the learned response becomes extinct, and the physiopathological pattern resolves. However, occasionally this does not happen, and both persist. This especially seems to be case in phobia. The goal of NET is to normalise these aberrant patterns through a physical correction. It involves the dynamics of memory, muscle testing, and some principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (i.e. the meridian-emotion relationship).
The experimental group received two 30-minute sessions of NET - once per week for 2 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial's aim was to test the efficacy of using Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) to reduce the severity of the symptoms of spider phobia in adults. It was hypothesised that NET would  reduce the severity of both subjective and objective symptoms of spider phobics</summary>
