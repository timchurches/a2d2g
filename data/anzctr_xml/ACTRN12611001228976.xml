  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is to process blood tests of emergency department patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria using a point of care blood analyser stationed within the emergency department. The blood tests available are haemoglobin, electrolytes, creatinine, calcium, glucose, INR, troponin, D-Dimer, beta-HCG. Patient may recieve one or more of theses tests, but only once as part of their emergency department evaluation. Patients are involved in the study only as long as it takes for their doctor to make an admission or discharge decision (typically several hours at most).
Patients will be recruited over a period of 8 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control arm will have their required blood tests processed in the usual way using the central laboratory service. This involves taking a blood sample by venepuncture or via an intravenous cannula, generating a request form, and sending both the bllod sample and paperwork to the central laboratory via a pneumatic tube delivery system.</comparator>

    <concealment>Study allocation will be recorded on a sheet of paper, each sheet sealed inside opaque sequentially numbered envelopes. These will be stored with the team co-ordinator in the ED.  When a patient meets inclusion criteria, the staff member enrolling the patient will ask the team co-ordinator for an allocation envelope. The team co-ordinator will take the next envelope in the sequence and give this to the treating doctor to open.</concealment>
    <sequence>We will use a stratified block randomisation method to ensure balanced numbers of participants in each arm of the study. There will be two strata (those patients suspected of an acute coronary syndrome, and all other patient appropriate for point of care testing). Given that this study is unblinded, random block sizes will be used to prevent the possibility of predicting the allocation sequence.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to assess the impact of an Integrated Point of Care Testing service (IPcOT) within the emergency department. Point of care testing (PoCT) involves the installation of a blood analyser within the emergency department that can process a selection of specific tests. The emergency department staff operates the machine, and a result is available in a few minutes. IPoCT involves integrating this machine with the hospital pathology service so that the results of testing performed on this machine are recorded within the SEALS database, and these results can be accessed through the patients electronic medical record. It would seem intuitive that having a IPoCT machine in the ED would have obvious benefits with rapid availability of blood tests allowing rapid decision making that would translate into shorter ED LOS. However, this does not take into account that a IPoCT machine must be operated by ED staff, rather than the lab staff, increasing the work load of ED staff and diverting them away from their usual duties. The IPoCT machine may be able to process a single sample in several minutes, however, in a busy ED where many patients require blood tests simultaneously it is likely that multiple staff will be competing to process blood samples on the one machine, leading to a back-log of tests so that turn-around times for IPoCT could be much longer than expected. The aim of this study is to determine the impact that the availability of point of care testing has on time to admission/discharge decision, and a secondary objective is to perform an economic evaluation (ie what is the cost per unit time saved in decision making time?).</summary>
