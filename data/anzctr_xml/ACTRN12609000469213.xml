  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prior to group allocation, all participants will receive 1 day of diabetes self-management education run by Diabetes Australia - Victoria.  The education will be delivered by DA-Vic Diabetes Educators to groups of approximately 30 people and each session will last for approximately 7 hours during one day.  Intervention will be peer support groups for people with type 2 diabetes, led by lay peer leaders. Groups will meet monthly over a period of 12 months, with each session running for approximately 90 minutes. The sessions will address some of the key steps involved in behaviour change and chronic disease management, including physical activity, medication adherence, nutrition, and smoking cessation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be a waitlist condition, who will receive the 1 day of diabetes self-management education and then continue with their usual care and management of diabetes.  They will commence the Peer Support program after a 12 month wait following their baseline measures.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The major goal of this research project is to implement and evaluate a structured state-of-the-art peer-led group program to improve daily management, social and emotional support, linkages to clinical care and ongoing support for people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).  It seems likely that the benefits of such programs, compared to those delivered exclusively by health professionals, results from features of the social support offered and the connections established with local community resources and other supports.

The evaluation proposal also includes a comprehensive health economic evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the program as well as its future transferability to other settings and countries in the Asia Pacific Region and Southern Africa.  The project could significantly influence the successful implementation of peer-led diabetes management programs across these countries and Australia.

The aims of the trial are:
1. To implement and evaluate the impact of the Australasian Peers for Progress-Diabetes Program (PfP-DP) on diabetes self management, social and emotional support, linkage(s) to clinical care and ongoing support.
2. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PfP-DP and its potential long-term benefits and potential transferability to other settings and countries.
3. To identify salient enablers and barriers to future system-wide uptake in Australia and potential transferability to Malaysia and other middle income countries in Asia and Southern Africa.

Hypothesis:
Compared with those in the wait-list control condition, participants in the Australasian PfP-DP will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in HbA1c at 12 months following baseline measurement, and will show improvements in diabetes self-management, social and emotional support, linkages to clinical care and ongoing support.</summary>
