  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a feasibility double-blind randomised controlled trial in 32 participants. It
      evaluates the feasibility of a full trial which will examine the efficacy of weekly
      supplementation of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) relative to placebo on the subsequent
      frequency and severity of objectively-verified symptomatic acute respiratory tract infection,
      overall and as a proportion of detected colonisations of the upper respiratory tract by 9 of
      the most common aetiologic viral pathogens.</summary>
