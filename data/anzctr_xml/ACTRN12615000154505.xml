  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pilot RCT - Thirty patients with a diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and attending a specialist rhinology clinic, will be recruited into this study.

Microbiological swabs will be taken from suitably recruited CRS patients for bacterial culture and microbacterial analysis. Nasal swabs will be performed under endoscopic guidance after application of local anaesthesia spray.

Patients will be randomised to receive either saline or xylitol nasal rinse. 

Arm1
Patients randomised to receive xylitol will be supplied with xylitol and given instructions to make a 4% solution which will be used three times daily for two weeks. 

Arm2
Patients in the saline group will be given instructions to make a physiological saline solution using sea salt, which will also be used three times daily for two weeks. At the end of that two week period, patients will return to the clinic for re-assessment where further swabs are taken. 

Monitoring of therapy will be by completion of a patient diary template.</interventions>
    <comparator>As swabs are taken before and after therapy, each patient will serve as their own control. Saline nasal rinse will be considered to be the comparator treatment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The presence of biofilms within the paranasal sinuses have been correlated to poorer clinical outcomes following treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis.  In light of the resistance of biofilm bacteria to conventional antibiotics, a number of novel approaches for treating biofilms have been proposed, including physical removal of the biofim by irrigation, interfering with chemical communication between micro-organisms or degrading the biofilm matrix with enzymes. 

The effect of Xylitol on the microbiome of CRS has not yet been evaluated. It is hypothesised that xylitol may be an effective method for reducing biofilms and improving outcomes in CRS. If Xylitol nasal irrigation can reduce the bacterial burden within CRS sinuses, this simple, safe and effective treatment would be an invaluable, non-antibiotic addition to the treatment options for CRS. </summary>
