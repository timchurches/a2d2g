  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease remain one of the leading causes of death in Australia, accounting for
      47637 (36%) of deaths in 2004.

      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a category of cardiovascular disease, characterised by
      intermittent claudication. This is defined as walking induced pain, cramping, aching,
      tiredness or heaviness in one or both legs that does not go away with continued walking and
      is relieved with rest. It is estimated that between 5-10% of individuals aged over 50 years
      suffer from claudication. The primary and most effective treatment for these patients is
      focused on improving walking ability and functional status.

      Current research has shown that approximately 30% of patients improve with exercise, while
      30% continue to deteriorate and the rest show no change. The changes produced at a
      biochemical and cellular level due to exercise are unknown. To help better understand this,
      our study will assess the entire range of proteins expressed before and after exercise in the
      skeletal muscle tissue of patients with intermittent claudication. This will help to
      identifying key proteins that have a role in improving patient symptoms and outcome.</summary>
