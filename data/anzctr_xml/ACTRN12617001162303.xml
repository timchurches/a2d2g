  <interventions>
    <interventions>Injection of Platelet Rich Plasma into knee
3 injections 1 week apart. 
	Group 1 receives 3 placebo injections (Normal Saline). 
	Group 2 receives one PRP injection followed by two placebo injections. 
	Group 3 receives 3 PRP injections. 

Irrespective of which group a patient is randomised to, they will require a blood draw of 20mL at each of the first 3 appointments to ensure patients are blinded to the treatment.  If they are to receive a PRP injection, this will be processed and injected.  If they are to receive a saline injection, the blood will be appropriately discarded.  The blood draw and preparation will be performed by a doctor who is an unblinded member of the research team.  In order to completely blind the patients to their treatment, a shield will be applied so they cannot see what product is being injected. 
The blood for PRP is drawn up in a special syringe which is then placed in a centrifuge. The platelet rich plasma component is kept and the other layers discarded. The injection into the knee occurs immediately after centrifuge process (no storage required). . </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to determine the clinical effect of intra-articular multiple PRP injections compared to single PRP injection into the symptomatic early arthritic knee. 
The objective is to determine the effectiveness of PRP injections for early knee arthritis and if multiple injections give a better clinical response at up to 12 months following treatment.
This study is designed as a double blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial with three groups. All groups receive 3 injections 1 week apart. 
	Group 1 receives 3 placebo injections (Normal Saline). 
	Group 2 receives one PRP injection followed by two placebo injections. 
Group 3 receives 3 PRP injections
