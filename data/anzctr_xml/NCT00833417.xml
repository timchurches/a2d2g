  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Vismodegib 150 mg

Experimental: Vismodegib 150 mg - Patients received vismodegib 150 mg orally once daily until disease progression; intolerable toxicity, most probably attributable to vismodegib; or withdrawal from the study.


Treatment: drugs: Vismodegib 150 mg
Vismodegib 150 mg was provided in hard gelatin capsules.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Scores - The SF-36 Health Survey (Version 2) uses patient-reported symptoms on 8 subscales to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The Physical Component Summary (PCS) score summarizes the subscales Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, and General Health. The Mental Component Summary (MCS) score summarizes the subscales Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. Each score was scaled from 0 to 100. A positive change score indicates better HRQoL.</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>-  Men and women = 18 years of age.

          -  For patients with metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC), histological confirmation of
             distant BCC metastasis (eg, lung, liver, lymph nodes, or bone), with metastatic

             considered to be inoperable.

          -  For patients with locally advanced BCC, radiotherapy must have been previously
             administered for their locally advanced BCC, unless radiotherapy is contraindicated or
             inappropriate. For patients whose locally advanced BCC has been irradiated, disease
             must have progressed after radiation.

          -  For women of childbearing potential, agreement to the use of two acceptable methods of
             contraception, including one barrier method, during the study and for 12 months after

          -  For men with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a latex
             condom, and to advise their female partner to use an additional method of
             contraception during the study and for 3 months after discontinuation of vismodegib.</inclusivecriteria>

          -  Life expectancy of &lt; 12 weeks.

          -  Patients with superficial multifocal BCC who may be considered unresectable due to
             breadth of involvement.

          -  Concurrent non-protocol-specified anti-tumor therapy (eg, chemotherapy, other targeted
             therapy, radiation therapy, or photodynamic therapy).

          -  Recent, current, or planned participation in an experimental drug study.

          -  History of other malignancies within 3 years of the first day of treatment with
             vismodegib in this study (Day 1), except for tumors with a negligible risk for
             metastasis or death, such as adequately treated squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin,
             ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Uncontrolled medical illnesses such as infection requiring treatment with intravenous
