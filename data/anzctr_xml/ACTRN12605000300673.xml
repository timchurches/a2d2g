  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cough provocation using 3 different doses of nebulized capsaicin; cough provocation using eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea.  One visit for each intervention will be required for the recruited patients.</interventions>

    <interventioncode>None</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In the first visit of the study, the history of chronic cough will be elucidated and all investigations already performed by their medical doctors will be recorded. Once all the investigations for common causes of cough were performed and a cause for chronic cough is still obscure, we will book a second visit to perform provocation with capsaicin, to evaluate the possible primary hypersensitivity of the airways.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A third visit will be booked to evaluate the response of the airways and cough to dry air by eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea. This provocation has the purpose of evaluating the association between chronic cough and dryness of the airways.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Diagnosed with chronic cough that has been present for over 8 weeks, subjects with chronic cough will fall into two categories: cause of chronic cough is well-defined ie mild asthmatics, gastro-oesophageal reflux sufferers, rhinosinusitis sufferers, etc.;  cause of chronic cough is obscure, and previous investigations have failed to identify a cause. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Upper or lower airway infection in the past four weeks;Pregnancy: female participants of child bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy, by urine pregnancy test, before the capsaicin provocation, and if found to be pregnant will be excluded from the study; Smokers;Uncontrolled major diseases, including psychiatric disorders, heart conditions, high blood pressure or others deemed of significance by the investigator;People with any reported allergic reaction to pepper or ethanol.</exclusivecriteria>
