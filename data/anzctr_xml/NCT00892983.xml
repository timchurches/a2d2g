  <interventions>
    <interventions>Behaviour - FAB
Behaviour - Sleep

No Intervention: Standard well child care - Standard Well Child Care (SWCC) - 8 Core visits at 2-4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3, 5, 8-10 and 15 months, 2 and 3 years.

Experimental: FAB (Food Activity Breast feeding support) - 8 extra parent contacts for augmented education and support around breast feeding, food and activity

Experimental: Sleep - Prevention of sleep problems in first 6 months and then active early intervention for sleep problems from 6 months to 24 months

Experimental: FAB + Sleep - combination of interventions used in arms 2 and 3


Behaviour: FAB
Standard well child care plus 8 extra parent contacts for augmented education and support around breast feeding, food and activity with 1 before birth and then at 1-2 weeks, 3-4, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 21 months post-partum.

Behaviour: Sleep
Standard well child care plus 5 extra contacts focussed on Sleep with 1 before birth (anticipatory guidance), sleep problem prevention starting at 3 weeks and then sleep problem intervention starting at 6 months or if problems emerge upto 2 years of age. Main prevention advice focussed on placing baby to sleep awake, maximising night-day differences and use of sleep place in parents bedroom for first 6 months. Intervention after 6 months uses preferentially a technique called "parental presence", and if this does not fit family a technique called "camping out" and finally, if neither of the first two fit family, controlled crying.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is one of the biggest threats to health in the 21st century. Rapid weight gain in the
      first year of life tends to lead to overweight in children, which in turn leads to overweight
      in adults. This rapid early weight gain occurs most often at weaning when eating patterns
      emerge. Infant sleep problems also appear to be associated with the risk of becoming
      overweight, and contribute to maternal post-natal depression. We propose to undertake a 4-arm
      randomised controlled trial to determine whether extra education and support for families
      around weaning and development of early food and activity habits, with or without
      intervention to improve infant sleep, will decrease the current risk patterns of rapid
      excessive early childhood weight gain in New Zealand. This would provide strong evidence for
      the value of such a strategy in the long term control of the obesity epidemic and its
      consequent complications.</summary>
