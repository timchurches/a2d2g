  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a randomised cross-over design, participants will consume a test meal containing 65mmol of sodium or a low salt control meal containing 5mmol sodium on 2 separate study days with a 7 day washout period in between treatments.

The test meal will comprise of 100ml of Reduced Salt tomato soup made up with 150mL water with 3.8g of added salt (65mmol NaCl sodium chloride). Participants are asked to consume the test meal over a 5 minute period.</interventions>
    <comparator>A control meal containing 5mmol sodium. This will comprise 100mL of Reduced Salt tomato soup made up with 150mL water with no added salt. Participants are asked to consume the test meal over a 5 minute period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A high salt diet can damage the blood vessels so that they are less responsive and expand less to the need for greater blood flow. This may cause the accumulation of fat in the artery and lead to heart disease and strokes. There is research to suggest salt can decrease blood vessel function. We are testing whether a salty meal has any short-term effects on blood vessel function in healthy people. We are doing this because we previously showed a higher than recommended salt intake made blood vessel less responsive after 2 weeks.</summary>
