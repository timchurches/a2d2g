  <interventions>
    <interventions>The wahakura is a 36x72cm flax bassinet, with no handles, and a 20mm thick foam sponge mattress covered in a cotton pillowcase.  They are woven by local weavers, and supplied to the mother during the pregnancy, with some standard instructions.  They are to be used for babies sleep, wherever and whenever they sleep, be it floor, mattress, bassinet, cot, or bed.  When used in the bed situation, the wahakura should be used on top of the blankets.  They should not be used in the car (car seat recommended), nor should babies be carried in them.  They should be passed on to all carers (babysitter, grandparents, and extended whanau).  Babies should sleep on their back, with no pillows, face always clear of blankets, no toys or loose objects in the wahakura.  It is being tested because there is no evidence in the literature of infant behaviour while using a wahakura, particularly in the bed-sharing situation. Duration of use is six months</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All infants who register antenatally with the two midwifery practices will be invited to participate.  Mothers agreeing to participate will be randomised to one of the two groups. Allocation will be concealed and performed following application of inclusion/exclusion criteria by opening a sealed envelope opened in numbered sequence.  As parity and SES may significantly affect the primary outcomes, stratified block allocation will be used (deprivation quintile derived from home address &lt;3 vs = 3, parity 1 vs &gt;1) with a block size of 3 used within each strata combination.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computerised random-number generator (provided by either SAS 9.1 or Stata 10) will be used to assign blocks of participants to the two arms.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Unsafe sleeping environments lead to 40-60 unexpected infant deaths annually in NZ, disproportionately affecting Maori babies.  Bed-sharing with baby when the mother smoked in pregnancy is unsafe, but Maori, like other indigenous peoples, have some affinity to bed-sharing, seeing it as promoting breastfeeding and whanau-infant attachment. Also, smoking rates are high amongst pregnant Maori women.

We will evaluate a safe sleeping device originating in the Maori community; a woven flax basket called the wahakura, and compare it to a standard bassinet on a number of levels.  We will recruit 240 mainly Maori and low socio-economic mothers and their babies from two participating Hawkes Bay midwifery services. Recruitment during pregnancy will be followed by randomisation to one of the sleeping environments. The study will require a face to face interview in pregnancy; over-night home recording of the infants sleep at 1 month old using infra-red video equipment, skin temperature and Haemoglobin oxygen saturation levels; a next morning interview; and follow up interviews at 3 months (face to face) and 6 months (by phone).  Key outcome measures will be time head-covered over-night, thermal environment, hypoxic events and amount of breast feeding.
The results will support evidence-based recommendations for safe sleeping of infants</summary>
