      <outcome>User Acceptance of the New MiniMed 640G Insulin Pump and Guardian Link Transmitter - Descriptive summary will be used to characterize the results of the study questionnaires. The questionnaire will use a Likert scale (rating of 1 to 7) to assess subject acceptance of the MiniMed 640G, Guardian Link Transmitter, and the training materials. A response of 4 or greater will be considered positive on a Likert scale for training materials and product acceptance.</outcome>

             he/she has received treatment from an investigational study drug or investigational
             study device in the last 2 weeks (CEP267 User Evaluation is not included in this

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This four center international study will include two United Kingdom National Health Service
      centers, and two centers in Melbourne, Australia. The objective of the study is to evaluate
      subject acceptance of a new insulin pump and transmitter together with the accompanying
      training materials. Descriptive data from participant questionnaires and device uploads will
      be evaluated.

      Pediatric subjects between the ages of 7 - 18 years and adults from the age of 19 years of
      age upwards, who currently use an insulin pump in the management of their type 1 or type 2
      diabetes, will be invited to participate. Each subject will be trained on the study device
      and then use it for approximately four weeks. During this time there will be three in-clinic
      visits and four follow-up phone calls, scheduled at the subjects' convenience. At the end of
      this period, they will revert back to their original insulin pump and complete a
      questionnaire on the study pump training materials, features and usability.</summary>
