  <interventions>
    <interventions>The following interventions are implemented together for 4 months:
1. Diet - using very low energy liquid meal replacement (Optifast) in combination with low fat and low carbohydrate meals.
2. Exercise - both aerobic using exercise bikes and resistance using weights in a hospital gym, as well as at home. The hospital based sessions are for 40 minutes to 1 hour, 3 times each week for 8 weeks then once each week for 8 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Subjects with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea will be invited to participate in a supervised 4-month diet and exercise program. We will measure daytime function, quality of life and severity of sleep-disordered breathing before and after the study, and in addition will followup subjects for 12 months after they complete the active intervention protocol.</summary>
