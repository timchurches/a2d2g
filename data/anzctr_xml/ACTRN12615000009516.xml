  <interventions>
    <interventions>"ReCog" is a four-week manualised intervention based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy and cognitive rehabilitation. It comprises 4 two-hour sessions involving education, skills training and skills practice on topics such as memory and attention, and between-session homework. The intervention is delivered in weekly group sessions of 3-10 participants with 2 facilitators. Homework takes approximately 30-60 minutes per week. Treatment adherence is monitored via session attendance and homework completion</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Waitlist group. These participants are offered the intervention after all assessments are completed (4.5 months after the initial assessment). Waitlist participants are able to access standard medical and health treatments, with no specific restrictions other than not participating in the ReCog intervention until after assessments are completed. 2. Healthy volunteers with similar age and education to cancer survivors participate as a further comparison group; they participate in assessments only and do not receive any treatment or training </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study builds on and extends a previous project that tested a group intervention for cancer survivors who have experienced problems with cognitive functions such as attention and memory. The study uses a more rigorous research design (random allocation to treatment or waitlist) and also tests potential reasons that the treatment may be effective. It was hypothesised that participants in the treatment group would show bigger improvements in objective cognitive function, subjective cognitive function and other self-report measures than participants on a waitlist or healthy control participants. It was also predicted that better cognitive function would be associated with higher self-efficacy and more favourable illness perceptions</summary>
