  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>5-azacitidine, a demethylating agent, has been approved for use in USA for treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), with overall response rates of approximately 48%, a delay to progression to acute leukaemia or death and an improvement in quality of life. Thalidomide has also shown some activity as a single agent in MDS though with poor tolerance at doses above 100mg/day. Neither of these agents is currently routinely available in Australia for MDS. 
This trial aims to show the safety and tolerability of the combination of these two agents in MDS, with responses at least as good as single agent 5-azacitidine, and to investigate further the mechanisms by which these drugs work and whether we can predict which patients may be more likely to respond.</summary>
