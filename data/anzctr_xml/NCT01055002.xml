  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study of a protocol for inducing a falciparum malaria infection in healthy
      volunteers in order to test the activity of novel agents being developed as drugs for the
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria. In this pilot study, 16 healthy male volunteers will be
      administered a low level malaria infection via infected human red blood cells. After 6 days
      they will be administered one of two registered antimalarial treatments (8 volunteers for
      each treatment) in order to define the rate of clearance of the infection. This information
      will be used to design similar future studies for the initial assessment of the efficacy of
      novel antimalarial drugs in development.</summary>
