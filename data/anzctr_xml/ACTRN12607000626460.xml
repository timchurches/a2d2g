    <interventions>Eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment groups (the placebo groups will be pooled for analyses):
	Placebo: up to 48 injections using a 0.7 cm grid and 0.2 mL/injection (n=4)
	Placebo: up to 24 injections using a 1.0 cm grid and 0.2 mL/injection (n=4)
	Placebo: up to 24 injections using a 1.0 cm grid and 0.4 mL/injection (n=4)
	1.0% ATX-101: up to 48 injections using a 0.7 cm grid and 0.2 mL/injection (n=18)
	1.0% ATX-101: up to 24 injections using a 1.0 cm grid and 0.2 mL/injection (n=12)
	1.0% ATX-101: up to 24 injections using a 1.0 cm grid and 0.4 mL/injection (n=18)
Subjects who successfully complete screening and baseline evaluations will receive up to 48 injections (0.2 mL each, or a maximum volume of approximately 9.6 mL) or 24 injections (0.2 mL or 0.4 mL each, or a maximum volume of approximately 4.8 mL or 9.6 mL, respectively) per treatment, depending upon size and configuration of Submental Fat (SMF). Treatment will be given at four-week (Â± 3 days) intervals.</interventions>

6.Currently on, or considering starting, a weight reduction regimen.
7.Any medical condition (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological disease, uncontrolled hypertension, thyroid dysfunction) that would interfere with the assessment of safety or efficacy in this trial or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study procedures or to give informed consent.
8.Treatment with fish oil or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) within seven days before randomization, or any anticipated need for agents with anticoagulative effects (e.g. warfarin, heparin) during the course of the trial.  Aspirin used for prophylaxis will be allowed.
9.Treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) within 28 days before randomization.
10.Treatment with radio frequency, laser procedures, chemical peel, dermal fillers in the neck or chin area within 12 months before randomization or botulinum toxin injections within 6 months before randomization.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Deoxycholate acid, or deoxycholate, is a  naturally occuring bile acid produced by the liver as one of several end products of sterol metabolism. In the human body, deoxycholate serves to solubilise dietry fats and facilitate their absorption. 
ATX-101 (sodium deoxycholate) is being developed by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals as a promising nonsurgical treatment modality for several conditions characterized by unwanted or excessive fat deposition including, but not limited to, lipomas, lipodystrophy in patients with HIV infection, submental and buccal fat deposits, infraorbital fat pockets, and other settings in which liposuction or surgery is the current approach.  These surgeries are associated with the known risks of anaesthesia, infection, bleeding, bruising and scarring; the possibility of poor outcomes, adn the expected discomfort and 'down-time' for the patient. Given the risks, which are well-established and documented, the growing populatiry of these procedures is testament to the psychological importance of self-image and to the benefir realised by subjects who seek them. The need for an improved, legitimate and minimally invasive product for reduction of localised fat deposits is substantiated by th esignificant and growing popularity of Lipostabil@ and other unapporved extemporaneous mixtures of phosphatidylcholine/deoxycholate (PC/DC). 
The objectives of this study are to 1. to determine the safety and tolerability of ATX-101 injections at one concentration and three dosing paradigms, relative to placebo, and 2. to evaluate the potential efficacy of ATX-101, relative to placebo, in reducing SMF, and thereby achieve improvement as judged by the Investigator and participant.</summary>
