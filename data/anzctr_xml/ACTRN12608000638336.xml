  <interventions>
    <interventions>(1) Aerobic warm-up of the lower limbs.
Aerobic exercise involved 5 minutes of static jogging to an intensity where "a little breathlessness" was experienced.
(2) Static stretching of the hamstrings . 
Static  stretching involved the participant placing their leg on an elevated surface with their knee extended and their ankle plantarflexed. Participants were then instructed to lean forward from the hip, with their spine in neutral until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh. This position was held for 30 seconds, and then repeated 3 times. 

This was all done in one session on one day for half of the participants. The participants in this group then switched (crossover study) to the dynamic stretching intervention described below. The second session was completed within 3-14 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Aerobic exercise and dynamic stretching:
Aerobic exercise was completed as described above (5 minutes of static jogging to an intensity where "a little breathlessness" was experienced). 

Dynamic stretching of the hamstrings involved each participant actively swinging the leg to be stretched forward into hip flexion until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh whilst keeping their knee extended and their ankle plantarflexed. This was repeated for 30 seconds and repeated 3 times.

This was done in one session on one day for half of the participants. The participants in this group then switched (crossover study) to the static stretching intervention described above. The second session was completed within 3-14 days.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Short-term hamstring flexibility:
Hamstring flexibility was determined by passive knee extension range of motion in supine, with the hip flexed to 90 degrees. A myrin goniometer, placed on the lateral shin, was used to calculate this range of motion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate: This was the increase in hamstring flexibility observed immediately after stretching.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Medium-term hamstring flexibility:
Hamstring flexibility was determined by passive knee extension range of motion in supine, with the hip flexed to 90 degrees. A myrin goniometer, placed on the lateral shin, was used to calculate this range of motion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>15 minutes after stretching.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hamstring injury is very common. Aerobic warm-up and stretching exercises are suggested to increase hamstring flexibility and reduce the risk of hamstring injury. There is still considerable debate on what type of stretching has the greatest effect on hamstring flexibility. This study examined the short-term effects on hamstring flexibility of static stretching and dynamic stretching (both combined with aerobic warm-up) in individuals with previous hamstring injury and matched healthy controls.
Study hypothesis: Static stretching results in greater increases in hamstring flexibility than dynamic stretching.</summary>
