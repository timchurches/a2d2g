    <interventions>This is a prospective study involving the collection of blood samples for the purposes of measuring circulating DNA from patients with resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases. Two distinct cohorts of patients, those undergoing initial liver resection followed by 12 cycles of FOLFOX and those given pre and postoperative chemotherapy will be treated and followed according to standard protocols.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to measure cancer specific gene changes in the blood as a biomarker in monitoring
disease status in colorectal cancer. Biomarkers are substances that can be found in blood and/or tumour tissue
and may be used to measure the effects or progress of a disease or condition.
Genes are substances in the body which contain information about characteristics us as individuals. Previous
studies have found that the majority of colorectal cancers contain mutations in several genes (the gene is changed
or different from the common form) and that these cancerrelated
mutations can be detected in the blood.
Identifying biomarkers are important because they may be linked with disease progression, they may help to identify people who are most likely to benefit from a certain treatment such as chemotherapy, or they may be used to track the status of cancer without the need for invasive procedures, such as biopsies.</summary>
