  <interventions>
    <interventions>A total of eight swabs will be taken from each participant with chronic rhino sinusitis (CRS) at only one time point. Specifically, two swabs will be taken from each participant at each of the following locations: the vestibule, the nasopharynx, the nasal cavity and the throat. A biopsy of the middle aspect of the anterior turbinate at only one time point will also be taken from those CRS patients that are undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. and then the resultant swabs and biopsy tissue will be analysed using both microbiology and genetic techniques. </interventions>
    <comparator>Controls will be participants that have healthy sinuses and, therefore, they will be individuals who do not have chronic rhino sinusitis. Similar to cases, a total of eight swabs will be taken from each control participant at only one time point. Specifically, two swabs will be taken from each of the following locations: the vestibule, the nasopharynx, the nasal cavity and the throat. Biopsies will not be taken from control participants. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This observational study will investigate the presence or absense of different bacterial strains in the sinuses of the participants. The swabs will be assessed by laboratory techniques that identify the presence of a large variety of different bacterial strains. Using these techniques,  approximately 70-100 different bacterial strains are usually found in each swab sample.</outcome>

      <timepoint>The levels of different biomarkers that are known to be associated with inflammation (cytokine levels) will be measured in the biopsy tissue samples to determine the extent of inflammation in the sinus. The following inflammation biomarkers will be assessed: the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) interleukin-8 (IL-8), the monotone induced by interferon-gamma (MIG), interleukin-15, (IL-15), epidermal growth factor (EGF), eotaxin, interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA).</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Group 1: Controls
&gt; 18 years of age
Disease free sinuses as based on examination by an Ear Nose and Throat Doctor on the same day as the swabs are taken.

Group 2: Cases
&gt;18 years of age
The cases have had a current diagnosis of chronic rhino sinusitis by an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) Doctor. Specifically, the same day that the samples are being taken from the participant, the participant undergoes an examination by the ENT doctor. Please note that during this examination, the ENT doctor can distinguish chronic rhino sinusitis from acute rhino sinusitis. </inclusivecriteria>

Microbiology: Microbiology techniques will be used to determine the presence or absence of different bacterial species present in the swabs taken from different parts of the nose, mouth and throat in both cases and controls. The anova and proportion of all cases containing a particular bacterial strain will be compared to this same proportion in controls. Other comparisons will be made as well using the proportion of different bacterial strains in different subsets of the data such as comparing the proportion of males carrying a particular bacterial strain with females carrying that strain, comparing the bacteria found in the mouth with the nose and the throat, comparing the bacteria found in the different locations of the nose. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to determine which bacteria, fungi, and viruses normally exist in the health sinus and chronic rhinosinusitis. Persons with healthy sinuses will be invited to participate in the study (Group 1) as well as individuals with chronic rhinosinusitis  (group 2). A number of swabs will be taken from the sinuses of participants as well as a biopsy of the anterior aspect of the middle turbinate for sinus patients and analysed by laboratory techniques (microbiology and immunology).
