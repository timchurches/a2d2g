  <interventions>
    <interventions>We aim to collect health service use information together with client demographics for approx. 350 people who have been discharged from the Wellington Early Intervention in Psychosis Service between November 2006 and November 2014. EIS supports people who have had a first episode of psychosis for 2 or 3 years in the community. Clients are discharged to either primary health care or to another community mental health service. All participants will be followed up over the years since discharge. For each participant we will collect at least 2 years  worth of health service use data. The primary health care and community mental health services which we are interested in provide health care, (physical as well as mental health care) to people in the community. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Wellington Early Intervention Service Follow Up study: The years after discharge. 
The Early Intervention Service supports people in the community after a first episode of psychosis. After discharge (usually after 2 years) our clients are referred to the care of their GP or a Community Mental Health Team, depending on their needs at the time. 
We want to find out how our clients fare, what services they access and how their health needs and recovery develop in the years after discharge. In particular we are interested in a comparison between the group discharged to GP and the group discharged to a CMHT team so that we can evaluate our discharge process and criteria. 
We propose to collect the following information together with client demographics for approx. 350 people who have been discharged from the EIS between November 2006 and November 2014:
a. Age, ethnicity, gender
b. Duration of time with the Early Intervention Service
c. Date of discharge from EIS
d. Discharged to GP,  CMHT or other
e. Number and duration of hospital admissions
f. Number and duration of admissions to respite
g. Number of referrals across mental and physical health services 
h. CMHT contacts
i. Specialist visits and assessments
j. ED contacts
k. Primary health contacts
l. GP visits
m. Blood tests, number and normality 
The information is available in the CCDHBs DataMart and Compass Healths database. So no patient files or notes will have to be accessed. 
Compass Health in Wellington are interested in cooperating, and they are waiting to hear how we get on with HDEC as they do not have their own process.
