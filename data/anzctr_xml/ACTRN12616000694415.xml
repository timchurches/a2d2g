  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty at the Mater Hospital who provide consent and meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the 'feedback group' or the 'no feedback group".

Arm 1 'Feedback Group': Participants will wear the Garmin Vivofit Activity Monitor on the wrist 24 hours per day for a minimum 1 week prior to surgery and 6 weeks after surgery. Prior to surgery the participants will not be able to see their daily step count on the device, On day 1 after surgery the cover on the display of the Garmin Vivofit device will be removed and participants will be able to see the number of steps they are taking, They will be given a daily step goal based on days after surgery and average steps from previous arthroplasty subjects. They will continue to wear the device for 6 week after surgery.

Arm 2 'No Feedback Group': Participants will wear the Garmin Vivofit Activity Monitor on the wrist 24 hours per day for a minimum 1 week prior to surgery and 6 weeks after surgery. Prior to surgery, and for the first 2 weeks after sugery the participants will not be able to see their daily step count on the device, On day 14 after surgery the cover on the display of the Garmin Vivofit device will be removed and participants will be able to see the number of steps they are taking,  They will continue to wear the device for 6 week after surgery.

The 2 groups will be compared for mean step count.</interventions>
    <comparator>We will assess whether participants who wear the device and are given daily goals and feedback of daily step count in the first 2 weeks after arthroplasty surgery have higher activity levels than those who do not receive goals or feedback of daily step count in a randomised controlled trial. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study we will use these commercially available activity trackers to monitor and encourage higher activity levels in a series of participants before and TKA or THA performed at the Mater Hospital. We will assess whether participants who wear the device and are given daily goals and feedback of daily step count in the first 2 weeks after arthroplasty surgery have higher activity levels than those who do not receive goals or feedback of daily step count in a randomised controlled trial. We will also assess and whether higher activity levels impacts hospital length of stay, participant satisfaction, participant reported outcome measures, or subsequent activity level. </summary>
