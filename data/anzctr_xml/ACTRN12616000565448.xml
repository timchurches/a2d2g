  <interventions>
    <interventions>In addition to standard physiotherapy provided by physiotherapists within Transition Care, the experimental group will receive therapy from a family member, who will receive training and supervision from a research physiotherapist. Therapy will be tailored specifically to the individual, with their mobility or other goals in mind. Elements of therapy may include transfer practice, walking or simple strengthening or balance exercises considered safe for the family member to assist with.The involvement of the family member is also considered part of the intervention.
Participants (caregivers providing therapy) will receive up to four 30-60 minute face-to-face appointments with the physiotherapist to learn to provide therapy and monitor progress and any concerns the patient or caregiver may have. The family members will also receive contact via telephone or text message as required and according to patient and caregiver preference - over a period of four weeks, to provide support, monitor progress and answer any questions that may arise. Adherence to exercise will be measured using a paper exercise diary.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard physiotherapy provided by physiotherapists or allied health assistants within Transition Care, which may include mobility training, strengthening or balance programs provided individually or in groups. Transition Care funds only small amounts of physiotherapy, so patients may be seen for short times daily, every few days or weekly. Some who are likely to be discharged to residential aged care facilities may receive little intervention.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of training family to help with physiotherapy for older people. It will formalise ad hoc arrangements of involving family in physiotherapy, and identify whether this approach is safe and effective for frail older people who have been in hospital, have become weak, and need time and support to get back on their feet. We will measure improvements in physical activity levels, as well as confidence with walking, and quality of life.</summary>
