    <interventions>De novo combination therapy with allopurinol 100mg orally and gradual pre-specified dose increments of azathioprine starting at 25mg and increasing to 50mg orally daily as determined by measuring thiopurine metabolite levels at week 6 and the absence of serious side effects.

    <concealment>The initial screening visit will ensure adequate explanation of the project to potential participants with a view to obtaining informed consent. Consenting participants will then be randomized by computer randomization software into either Group A (standard azathioprine/6MP monotherapy regimen) or Group B (combined allopurinol-thiopurine co-therapy. From this week 0 visit onwards, the investigators will be blinded to each participantâ€™s grouping as all medications will be supplied in sealed, non-distinguishable dosing packs at each visit, labelled by unique code number for each participant according to grouping. These packs will be arranged and supervised by an independent study coordinator who will be able to re-identify participants via the code number log if required. Supplying all study medication will also enable accurate monitoring of adherence. Dosing adjustments where required (e.g. for leukopenia or deranged LFTs) will all be pre-specified as per protocol. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis, are immune system related conditions where an overactive immune response from the bodys white blood cells causes inflammation and damage to the intestines and in turn the typical symptoms of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Immune-modifying drugs (immunomodulators) like azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) dampen down the overactive white blood cells that are the cause of the inflammation. Over 50% of patients who attend an IBD clinic at Eastern Health are on one of these medications. 

In IBD like other immune related conditions, AZA and 6MP have been shown to both get patients well (induce remission), and keep patients well (maintain remission). Importantly, they also reduce the need for cortisone-based medicines such as prednisolone that are associated with many side effects and no long-term benefits. 

We know that AZA and 6MP to produce two chemical end-products (metabolites) that are responsible for the benefits and also side effects of these drugs. These metabolites are known as 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP). 6-TGN is the good metabolite that makes these drugs work, while 6-MMP instead can cause side-effects, especially affecting the liver. Therefore it is desirable to have high levels of 6-TGN and low levels of 6-MMP to get the best out of these drugs.

Recent research has shown that by adding another drug called allopurinol to AZA/6MP in almost all cases the 6TGN levels improve and the 6MMP levels greatly reduce. Also, we generally use a much lower dose of the AZA/6MP combined with the allopurinol and thus most patients end up getting a greater benefit but with fewer tablets, with no increase in side effects. It should be noted that the use of allopurinol in combination with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine remains experimental, and is not currently approved by the TGA.

In this study we are comparing patients who are commencing on treatment with azathioprine with those who will be started on a combination of azathioprine and allopurinol to see if this combination of drugs is more effective and quicker to work, yet similarly safe, to those taking the standard AZA alone. 

If we are able to show that the combination is better in this study, then this will have major consequences to how azathioprine is used in the treatment of IBD in the future. </summary>
