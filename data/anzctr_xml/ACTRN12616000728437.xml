    <interventions>Randomised trial comparing the effectiveness of two types of laxation regimens in their ability to achieve an empty rectum during prostate radiation therapy.
Group 1 will be prescribed 1 sachet Movicol Half (Macrogol 3350 6.563g) per day to be consumed orally in the evening. Prescription is as follows
- Use of Movicol half strength is commenced 7 days prior to attending for CT simulation. Once CT simulation is completed use of Movicol half strength is then ceased.
- Use of Movicol Half strength is recommenced 7 days prior to commencing treatment and is then consumed daily for 7 weeks until treatment is completed. 

Group 2 will be prescribed Metamucil (9 grams per day) consumed orally as 1 x 3 gram serve added to a 250ml glass of water at breakfast, lunch and dinner. The group will also be prescribed 1 x Nutralife Probiotic 50 supplement consumed orally per day. Prescription is as follows.
- Use of Metamucil is commenced 7 days prior to attending for CT simulation. Once CT simulation is completed use of Metamucil is then ceased.
- Use of Metamucil is recommenced 7 days prior to commencing treatment and is then consumed daily for 7 weeks until treatment is completed. 

Compliance will be checked by completion of medication diary for the laxatives and through packet return for the probiotic.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be prescribed 1 sachet Movicol 1/2 strength per day to be consumed orally in the evening. This is commenced 1 week prior to CT planning simulation for radiation treatment,  then ceased and recommenced 1 week prior to commencing radiation treatment. Movicol 1/2 strength is then taken daily for duration of treatment (7 weeks) and ceased at the end of treatment.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Differences in rectal volume between the two treatment arms, 
CT scans are routinely conducted during treatment with a total of 12 collected over the treatment period. Rectal volume will be measured by outlining the prostate, bladder and rectum on all CBCT scans. The rectal volume and cross sectional area will be recorded from this data</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, daily during the first week of treatment and at weekly intervals over a 7 week period while receiving radiation therapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Differences in rectal gas measurements between the two treatment arms, 
Rectal gas which will be estimated by viewing the CT scan in the mid-sagittal plane and using a semi quantitative scale of 1-5; representing (1)no gas present, (2) gas occupying 5 to less than 25%, (3) 25 t less than 50%, (4) 50 less than 75% and (5) 75 less than 100% of the rectum.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, daily during the first week of treatment and at weekly intervals over a 7 week period while receiving radiation therapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of patients with symptoms of diarrhoea during treatment requiring the cessation of laxatives. This will be assessed at weekly review appointments using the patient self-reported diary which includes the Bristol stool chart.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Patients will be analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Sample size calculation for this study is based on a conservative sample size requiring forty patients in each arm to detect a difference of 4cm3 in the average rectal standard deviation between the two study arms . This sample size calculation, based on their data gives a power of &gt;0.80 to detect a treatment difference between the two groups at the significance level of 0.05. A sample size of up to 60 patients per arm in this study design is being used to account for withdrawals from the study. The total sample size will be up to 120 patients.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine if a statistically significant difference exists in average rectal volume, across the 12 CT treatment scans, between the two treatment arms. If randomisation is incomplete and groups are unbalanced on any factors (e.g. age), and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be conducted</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Metamucil and a probiotic (good bowel bacteria) is more effective than Movicol at emptying the bowel while receiving daily radiation therapy to the prostate. 
Who is this for? You may be eligible for this study if you are aged 50 years or more and have been scheduled to undergo external bean radiotherapy (EBRT) to the intact prostate at the Central West Cancer Care Centre at the Orange Health Service. 
Study details: Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance) into one of two groups. One group will be prescribed Movicol half strength and a low gas diet (current practice at the treatment facility). The second group will be prescribed Metamucil, Nutralife Probiotic (to promote good bowel bacteria and reduce bowel gas) and a low gas diet. 
Standard EBRT treatment for prostate cancer is delivered daily (Monday- Friday) over a 7 week period. Laxatives and probiotic use will commence 1 week prior to attending for the radiation planning appointment, then ceased and recommence one week prior to commencing radiation treatment. You will be required to take the laxatives and probiotic daily during the treatment period. In taking part in this study you will also be required to complete of a food and bowel habits diary and attend weekly review appointment with the Dietitian in addition to your usual review appointments with the Doctor or Nurse.
It is hoped that results from this study will identify the most effective way to ensure an empty bowel while receiving treatment.
