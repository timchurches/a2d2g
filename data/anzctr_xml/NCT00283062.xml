  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessment - Number of Participants With Disease Progression - PFS is the interval from the date of surgery to date of progression. The date of progression was the earlier of
first PSA increase to = 0.4 ng/mL confirmed within two weeks
date of the nadir, if PSA nadir did not reach &lt; 0.4 ng/mL (for deferred arm)
first radiological/ histological evidence of tumor progression
death. Median PFS was to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. However, enrollment was not met, and meaningful conclusions for efficacy or QoL could not be drawn. Median PFS could not be estimated. Reported is the number of participants with disease progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>from the date of surgery up to 3 years after randomization of the last participant</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Median Overall Survival (OS) - Overall survival (OS) was the time interval from the date of surgery to the date of death due to any cause.
Median OS was to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier Curves. However, enrollment was not met, and meaningful conclusions for efficacy or QoL could not be drawn. Moreover, median OS could not be estimated. Reported is the number of participants who died from any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>from the date of surgery up to 3 years after randomization of the last participant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Median Cancer-specific Survival (CSS) - The CSS was the time from the date of surgery to the date of death due to prostate cancer.
Median CSS was to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. However, enrollment was not met, and meaningful conclusions for efficacy or QoL could not be drawn. Therefore, based on a protocol amendment, median CSS was not estimated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>from the date of surgery up to 3 years after randomization of the last participant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Median Metastasis-free Survival (MFS) - MFS was the interval from the date of surgery to the date of the first clinical evidence of metastasis after treatment initiation. Metastasis was evaluated by a physical exam or radiologically on bone scan or CT scan. Local (palpable) progression, documented histologically or by imaging techniques was considered evidence of progression.
Median MFS was to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. However, enrollment was not met, and meaningful conclusions for efficacy or QoL could not be drawn. Therefore, based on a protocol amendment, median MFS was not estimated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>from the date of surgery up to 3 years after randomization of the last participant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To Evaluate Quality of Life (QoL) as Measured Using a Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Questionnaire - The FACT-P is a 39-item participant questionnaire which assesses physical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), functional well-being (7 items), and additional prostate cancer specific concerns (12 items). All items are scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The total FACT-P score ranges from 0-156, with higher scores representing a better QoL with fewer symptoms. A score of 156 represents the best outcome.
Note: Enrollment was not met, and meaningful conclusions for efficacy or QoL could not be drawn due to the low sample size.</outcome>

      <outcome>Assessment of Safety and Tolerability - Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) - Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE). A TEAE was as any adverse event that occurred or worsened during the on-treatment period, which was the period from the day of first infusion of study treatment until 30 days after the last infusion of study treatment.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III study in participants at
      high risk of recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. The study will
      investigate

        -  Treatment with docetaxel (TAXOTERE®) every three weeks (q3w) plus leuprolide acetate
           (ELIGARD®) versus leuprolide acetate alone (ELIGARD®)

        -  Immediate treatment following prostatectomy versus deferred treatment at the time of
           relapse

      Using a 2x2 factorial design participants will therefore be randomized to

        -  Immediate adjuvant treatment with docetaxel plus leuprolide acetate (chemotherapy and
           hormonal therapy)

        -  Immediate adjuvant treatment with leuprolide acetate alone (hormonal therapy)

        -  Deferred treatment with docetaxel plus leuprolide acetate (chemotherapy and hormonal
           therapy)

        -  Deferred treatment with leuprolide acetate alone (hormonal therapy)

      Primary Objective:

        -  The primary objective of the study is to compare progression-free survival using a 2x2
           factorial design

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the 5-year overall, cancer-specific and metastasis-free survival after
           systemic treatment between the groups

        -  To compare the safety and tolerability between Docetaxel in combination with leuprolide
           acetate and leuprolide acetate alone.

        -  To evaluate quality of life as measured by the FACT-P questionnaire.

      Originally, 1696 participants were planned in the study (with 424 participants randomized to
      each arm). However, only a total of 211 participants completed the randomization procedure as
      of 26 September 2007. Thus, sanofi-aventis, in accordance with the Steering Committee,
      decided to stop the participant recruitment as of 26 September 2007. Participants who had
      already signed their Informed Consent (IC) before September 26, 2007 were allowed to enter
      the randomization if they met eligibility criteria. The final revised number of planned
      participants to be randomly assigned to the 4 treatment arms was 250, and 228 participants
      were actually randomized.

      The final sample size did not allow all the statistical analyses to be conducted on efficacy
      data. Therefore, the protocol was amended to reflect the change in the plans for statistical
      analysis. The study was underpowered to serve as the basis for drawing conclusions regarding
      efficacy and quality of life (QoL) endpoints.</summary>
