  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are Three different conditions in this study: two treatment and one minimal attention (control). All conditions involve web-based information/education, delivered over 8 consecutive weeks, about BD.  
(1) BEP: This is the basic online Bipolar Education Program (BEP). The BEP consists of 8 web-based modules, which participants receive one per week, covering information about diagnosis, causes, treatments, management of BD as well as testimonies from well-known people with BD.  Participants complete and submit workbook tasks related to each of the modules.
(2) BEP+ Enhanced Informed Support: This condition consists of the online BEP described above as well as receiving weekly email support from an informed support person. The Informed Supporter is someone who is successfully managing their BD and trained to provide email support to participants.  In addition the "informed supporter" will help to develop and implement a Stay-Well Plan. A Stay Well Plan consists of strategies to help people manage their BD.</interventions>
    <comparator>(3) Control: This condition is a minimal attention condition with 8 weekly emails containing attachments of information relating BD.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: to determine whether the web-based Bipolar Education Program (BEP) improves understanding and control of bipolar disorder, as well as mood, functioning and psycho-social adjustment in adults with newly diagnosed with bipolar disorder, in comparison with a minimal online education control condition.  Two versions of the bipolar education program will be evaluated:(a)on its own and (b)with email support from an informed supporter who will also provide structured assistance to implement a stay-well self-management plan.  Informed supporters are people with bipolar disorder who are effectively self-managing their condition and who will be trained to provide online support for the education program under supervision of our clinical team.  
Hypotheses: At post-intervention and follow-up (3 and 6 months post-intervention):
1.  Participants who receive the Bipolar Education Program (BEP) will have greater understanding of bipolar disorder, report greater control and self-management of their condition, and experience a better illness trajectory (fewer depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes, symptoms and impairment, fewer hospitalizations) and better psycho-social functioning than the attention control group.   
2.  Participants who receive the full BEP package (BEP + email support from an informed supporter with assistance to develop and implement a stay well plan) will have greater understanding of bipolar disorder, report greater control and self-management of their condition, and experience a better illness trajectory (fewer depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes, symptoms and impairment, fewer hospitalizations) and better psycho-social functioning than people  receiving the BEP alone or the attention control condition.  
3.  People receiving the full BEP package will report greater satisfaction with the intervention than those in the other BEP conditions and in the attention control condition. 
4.  The health service costs associated with hospitalizations and visits to health practitioners will be significantly different between the groups.</summary>
