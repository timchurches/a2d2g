  <interventions>

      <outcome>Safety assessed by monitoring and reporting any adverse events. Adverse events include any changes in the health of a participant and will be self-reported. Participants will be asked to report any adverse events at 3 months (by questionnaire designed for this purpose) and 6 months (by interview). Participants will also be able to report events between clinic visits by telephoning the coordinator. Adverse events may include, for example, a reaction at the infusion / injection site, attendance at a hospital emergency department, hospitalisation. All adverse events will be reported to the Prinicpal Investigator at each site who will determine the relationship (or otherwise) to zoledronic acid or denosumab.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether zoledronic acid or denosumab are efficacious in reducing back pain and size of Modic lesions in persons with back pain and Modic changes. Primary hypothesis is that either drug will be different to placebo for pain and size of Modic lesion at 6 months. The design is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to receive zoledronic acid or denosumab or placebo, and will be observed for 6 months.</summary>
