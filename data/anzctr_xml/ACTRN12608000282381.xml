  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to design, implement and evaluate programs that use both Internet and telephone/communications technology to automate the provision of tailored smoking cessation assistance. In particular, the research is interested in the relative effectiveness of detailed advice (as provided through a web-based expert system) as compared with the capacity of modern messaging technology (SMS) to provide a set of prompts and reminders to help smokers manage a quit attempt and prevent relapse. The project is an innovative collaboration between a team with expertise in the development of mass-deliverable smoking cessation interventions, and a team with expertise in human-computer interaction (HCI), which is concerned with optimizing use of computing and communication technology.   Using principles of HCI, smokers will be actively involved in the development of the programs through an interative process of review consisting of a series of user-based evaluations, design workshops and field trials. In this way, real-world use and acceptability of the interventions will be assessed and reviewed until we have developed the best possible prototypes. Following this process, a large-scale randomised controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each of the interventions both individually and combined, against a control condition receiving minimal cessation assistance.  It is hypothesized that all intervention programs will be more effective than minimal assistance, with the Combined program proving most effective, especially among smokers who are more addicted and/or have had no previous quit attempt lasting beyond a week.</summary>
