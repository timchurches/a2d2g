  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the relative bioavailability of tamsulosin hydrochloride in a
      fixed dose combination capsule of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.5 mg/0.2 mg)
      relative to co-administration of dutasteride 0.5 mg capsules and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2
      mg tablets or capsules. Two fixed dose combination capsules will be tested; one will contain
      tamsulosin hydrochloride pellets with a 15% enteric coating, and the other tamsulosin
      hydrochloride pellets with a 10% enteric coat. In addition, two formulations of tamsulosin
      hydrochloride will be tested in the co-administration with dutasteride 0.5 mg; a 0.2 mg oral
      disintegrating tablet and a 0.2 mg hard shell capsule. This will be an open-label,
      randomized, single dose, four-period crossover in healthy male subjects of North East Asian
      ancestry. Subjects will receive single oral doses in four treatment periods, each separated
      by a 5-10 day washout period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at
      regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure,
      heart rate and review of adverse events. The study will enrol approximately 30 healthy male
      subjects to ensure that 24 complete the study.</summary>
