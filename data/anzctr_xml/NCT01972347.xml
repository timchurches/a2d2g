  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open label, single centre, phase II study of neoadjuvant drug treatment with
      dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with resectable American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
      Stage IIIB-C BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma.

      The main aim of this study is to find out if giving of a new combined drug treatment to
      patients with melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes BEFORE they have surgery, will
      result in improved clinical and pathological response of the melanoma tissue after 12 weeks
      treatment.</summary>
