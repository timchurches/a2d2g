  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is an open label, eight arm crossover study in participants with T1DM, designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety of four doses of MSL-001 (the transbuccal human recombinant insulin intervention) compared to recombinant human insulin (Humulin). Transbuccal human recombinant insulin intervention is where the administration of the insulin intervention is by placing the film strips on the inner cheek.

It consists of 10 subject visits: the screening visit (V0), eight treatment visits (V1-V8), and a safety follow up visit (V9). Between each treatment visit there is a 7-21 day window allowed for adequate washing out.

At the screening visit (Day -28 to day -3) subjects will be informed about the study and sign the informed consent if they agree to participate. 

Participants will check in the evening prior to each treatment visit and undergo safety assessments prior to study drug treatment. 




At each treatment visit, a subject will receive a single dose of MSL-001 (the transbuccal human recombinant insulin intervention) or the comparator (subcutaneous insulin). By the end of the study, each subject will have received both formulations of MSL-001 (the transbuccal human recombinant insulin intervention) and the comparator drug. Therefore at each treatment visit, participants will receive one dose per visits of the treatments noted below.

*Comparator Arms:
Recombinant Human Insulin Subcutaneous (SC) dose 5IU 
Recombinant Human Insulin Subcutaneous (SC) dose 10IU 
Recombinant Human Insulin Subcutaneous (SC) dose 15IU 

*Film formulations A and Formulation B (the transbuccal human recombinant insulin intervention):
Formulation A: 1 x 5IU film for 5IU dose (plus 3 placebo films)
Formulation B: 1 x 5IU film for 5IU dose (plus 3 placebo films)
Formulation A or Formulation B:1 x 15IU film for 15IU dose (plus 3 placebo films)**
Formulation A or Formulation B: 4 x 5IU films for 20IU dose (no placebo films)**
Formulation A or Formulation B: 4 x 15IU films for 60IU dose (no placebos films)**

**Following dosing with the Formulation B 5IU dose, data from the the three 5IU formulations (subcutaneous 5IU, Formulation A 5IU film and Formulation B 5IU film) will be analysed to determine which film formulation will be utilised for the remainder of the study.

Both formulations contain the same active product and the same excipients and are prepared essentially using the same process. However, the ingredient list for Formulation B includes hydropropylmethylcellulose and glycerin whereas the ingredient list for Formulation A was simplified and lacks hydropropylmethylcellulose and glycerin.


**As noted above, the mode of administration of the film strips is by placing the film strips on the inner cheek.

The duration of study participation for participants completing the study is up to 112 days. The estimated duration of the total study is approximately 6 months. The end of study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last particpant.
</interventions>
    <comparator>This study compares the administration of  the comparator, Humulin R insulin administered subcutaneously with the study drug (MSL001) administered via transbuccal means (that is,the film will be placed on the inner cheek) at varied dose strengths.

At enrollment, all eligible participants will will have T1DM and will be on a standing insulin regimen that will include a combination of basal (that is, intermediate -long acting insulin) such as Lantu (Trademark) glargine, Levemir (Trademark) detemir, or NPH (Neutral Protamine Hage-dorn) and prandial insulin (that is short acting insulin) such as  Novolo (Trademark) insulin aspart, Humalog (Trademark) insulin lispro, Apidra (Trademark)insulin glulisine, Novolin R(Trademark) regular human insulin, or any other approved similar Insulin approved in Australia, unless the participant uses an insulin pump. 

All of the trial subjects using Lantu (Trademark) or Levemir(Trademark) as their basal insulin will interrupt their normal regimen at least 48 hours prior to their first dose of the IP.
Between 22 and 48 hours of receiving the IP, the only basal insulin that will be permitted is NPH. As needed, participants will receive instruction from the study Investigators regarding how to approach their insulin regimen prior to admission to the study site. All prandial insulins, including Continuous Subcuta-neous Insulin Infusion (CSII) users, will interrupt their normal insulin regimen after dinner on day -1 (relative to treatment). 

At the conclusion of the treatment visits, once all assessments have been completed and participants have been fed, they will be instructed to resume their normal insulin regimen. Additional glucose monitoring will be performed to ensure that the subject is stable prior to discharge.

Adherence to the treatment will be monitored on site when administering the film strips. A visual check of the inner cheek will be performed to ensure dissolution of the product prior to allowing any water consumption. Empty packets of each strip used will be kept at site and be reviewed as part of compliance. The subcutaneous injections are performed by study nurses and physicians.</comparator>

      <timepoint>The following will be assessed: - Vital Signs:Vital signs will include body temperature (oral), BP, respiration rate, and pulse rate. Vital signs will be measured at each study visit at check in, pre dose and prior to discharge (each study day). Blood pressure will be obtained using calibrated sphygmomanometers or automated blood pressure measurement equipment. All vitals should be performed with the subject in a semi supine position after five minutes resting. If the first reading is out of range, then two more readings are taken and the lower of the two additional readings are to be used. - 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG):A standard 12-lead ECG will be recorded after 5 minutes with the subject in a semi supine position at screening, Visit 1 (pre and post dose at Visit 1, post dose being within 15 minutes of when the euglycemic clamp is finished) and at Visit 9. The following parameters will be recorded from the subjects ECG trace: heart rate, QTcF interval, PR interval, QRS interval, and RR interval. - Standard laboratory safety parameters: Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis will be taken at all study visits. - Incidence of AEs will be reviewed at all study visits both during the assessments and in comparison since the last visits. The AE term, start and stop dates, severity, action taken with study drug, and outcome, will be documented, along with the Investigators opinion of the causal relationship between the event and the study drug. The most likely expected events are as follows. These are considered to be minor: *Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic events: Hypoglycemic events are a sudden drop in a subjects blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).Hyperglycemia is an increase in a subjects blood glucose level above 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).These events are expected to be minor. *Irritation of the buccal mucosa:Application of the adhesive strips to the buccal mucosa may cause irritation. *Allergic reaction:An allergic reaction may occur against the components of the investigational product (IP) including the material used to make the buccal strips or the adhesive. *Risks Associated with Study Procedures:Minor risks are associated with catheter insertions and frequent blood draws including hematoma, infections, vasovagal reaction, or anxiety. *Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments: Diabetic subjects are frequently on concomitant medication such as insulin and medications for complications related to their disease. However, the inert nature of glycan coated GNPs would suggest minimal or manageable interactions with concomitant medications in subjects suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. </timepoint>
