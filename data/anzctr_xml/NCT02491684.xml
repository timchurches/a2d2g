             in the GINA guidelines (ie, LABA, leukotriene receptor antagonist or sustained release
             theophylline). The medium or high dose ICS plus LABA can be any combination inhaler or
             2 separate inhalers. Patients must have taken ICS (&gt;250 µg fluticasone or the
             equivalent daily) plus second controller medication for at least 12 months prior to
             the date the informed consent is obtained, with or without another controller such as
             oral corticosteroids (OCS), theophylline, tiotropium, or leukotriene receptor
             antagonists. The maintenance treatment must have been kept at the same or at a higher
             level these last 12 months.

             al 2005) documented within 5 years prior to Visit 1, or proof of a positive response
             to a methacholine or histamine challenge (a decrease in FEV1 by 20% [PC20] at =8
             mg/mL) performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines (American Thoracic Society 2000) or
             proof of positive response to mannitol challenge (a decrease in FEV1 by 15% [PD15] at
             =635 mg) (Anderson et al 2009) documented within 5 years prior to Visit 1. If
             historical documentation is not available, reversibility or proof of a positive
             response to a methacholine, histamine or mannitol challenge must be demonstrated and
             documented at Visit 1

          5. Must answer "Yes" to the question "Does a cold or flu make your asthma worse?"

             and To have had at least one documented severe asthma exacerbation within the last 12
             months that was suspected by the patient to have been caused by a common cold or flu
