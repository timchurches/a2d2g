  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Two hundred primary hip replacements with Delta-Motion heads and cups were performed between December 2008 and December 2009 and were followed-up for a minimum of five years.

The two hundred patients have been reviewed at regular intervals, and data has been obtained from the patients pre-operatively, and post-operatively at 6 weeks, 6 months or 1 year, and at a minimum of 5 years.  

Patient outcome were assessed using The Harris Hip Score and X-rays were taken for radiographic evaluation. 

The aim of the study is to measure clinical and radiographic outcomes such as ceramic breakage and squeaking to verify the clinical effectiveness of the product that is new to the market.

The primary objective of the study is to investigate the clinical outcome of the Delta-Motion hip system and to demonstrate improved range of motion, head engagement and stability of the replaced hip.  The null hypothesis is that the large diameter ceramic on ceramic bearing will not improve patient outcomes compared with published data.

Complications will also be assessed and x-rays will be used to validate component positioning and quality of bone in-growth.

    <publicnotes>All patients in the investigators practice sign an ethics approved consent form to collect data specific to their procedure.  The patients included in this study all signed the consent form and data was collected; ethics was applied for to allow publication of the data, hence ethics for this specific review was obtained after the first patients were consented.</publicnotes>
