  <interventions>
    <interventions>Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning (RIPC) Intervention:  Three 5-min cycles of RIPC administered by a blood pressure cuff inflated to 20 mm Hg above systolic blood pressure around the non-dominant arm, with an intervening 5 min of reperfusion between each cycle, during which time the cuff is deflated.  This entire 3 x 5 min protocol is to be administered 24 hours prior to surgery, as well as after induction of anaesthesia, immediately prior to the start of the surgical procedure.  Therefore, two complete RIPC protocols (6 bouts of 5 min of ischaemia) prior to surgery will be administered.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac-related clinical adverse events including (but not limited to) myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.  Clinical adverse events will be assessed by standard clinical assessments performed by the primary clinician caring for the patient.  If an event is suspected (e.g. MI), standard clinical investigations will be ordered as per usual practice (e.g. for MI - ECG and cardiac Troponin T blood test).  All adverse events will be classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and they will be recorded by the study co-ordinator.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ischaemia-Reperfusion Injury is a specific type of tissue damage that unfortunately often occurs following major surgery, such as Vascular Surgery. A technique called Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning (RIPC) is known to provide protection to the heart and other tissues in such a setting.  This technique involves interrupting the blood supply to a limb for a brief period, and it is simply performed by intermittently inflating a blood pressure cuff around the arm.  There appear to be two phases of protection, early and late.    

The aim of this project is therefore to investigate the potential of combining these two phases of protection by administering RIPC twice pre-surgery in a vascular surgery group.  We hypothesize that this RIPC protocol will reduce the risk of cardiac and renal complications during and following surgery.</summary>
