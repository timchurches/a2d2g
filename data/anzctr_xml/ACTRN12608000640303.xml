  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery have their sleep/ wake cycles actigraphically measured, their core body temperature rhythms and salivary melatonin measured and recorded and their mood assessed. This takes place in three seperate stages, each a week long. They are monitored pre-operatively, post-operatively in hospital and post-discharge.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep/ wake cycle disruption, the extent of which is measured using actigraphy and sleep diaries.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three sets of measurements are taken - five to seven days pre-operatively, five to seven days immediately post-operatively and five to seven days immediately post-discharge. One sleep diary of one week is completed at each stage.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Circadian disruption, measured using vitalsense core body temperature monitoring equipment and salivary melatonin. Changes in melatonin levels and core body temperature show the extent, if any, of circadian disruption.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The three to four days of pre-operative core body temperature data, three to four days of post-operative data and three to four days of post-discharge data are collected. Salivary melatonin is also collected at nine half-hour intervals once at every stage. The pre-operative results are then compared to the post-operative to establish melatonin onset time and changes in core body temperature levels - these measurements are compared one week post-discharge.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mood disturbance, measured using profile of mood states questionnaires</outcome>
      <timepoint>The profile of mood states questionnaire is taken one week pre-operatively, one week post-operatively and one week post-discharge.  The results of the questionnaires are compared one week post-discharge.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep, controlled by the sleep homeostat and the circadian clock, is essential. In the hospital environment, sleep can be disrupted. This disruption may be attributable to an effect on the sleep homeostat, the circadian clock, or both. The consequences of sleep disruption due to hospitalisation, surgery and anaesthesia may include delayed post-operative recovery. Here, we measure sleep/ wake cycles, mood states and two different markers of circadian rhythms in a surgical population to determine any changes that may occur in the hospital environment.</summary>
