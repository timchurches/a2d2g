Eczema shield (Ethical Nutrients)  2 capsules per day (2x10^10 cfu/day, Lactobacillus rhamnosus) for 14 days
Travel bug (Ethical Nutrients)  2 capsules per day (1 x 10^10 cfu/day, Saccharomyces boulardii) for 14 days
Mutaflor (Natural Therapy Imports) - 2 capsules twice a day (1 x 10^10 cfu twice a day, E. coli Nissle 1917 ) for 14 days
Bifidobacteria lactis  2 capsules per day (1 x 10^10 cfu/day) for 14 days
Streptococcus thermophilus  dry powder 100 billion cfu per g (2 x 10^10 cfu per day, i.e. 200mg per day) for 14 days
Bifidobacteria breve  dry powder 100 billion cfu per g (2 x 10^10 cfu per day, i.e. 200mg per day) for 14 days

Mode of adminstration: Oral

Personalised intervention: No
Intervention adherence: Compliance will be monitored by capsule counts and by completion of a daily diary of doses taken. Diaries will be reviewed at Day 8 and Day 15 and missed doses recorded. Non-compliance will be defined as missing more than 1 dose.  The study nurse will assess compliance.</interventions>

    <sequence>This is an open label study and participants will not be randomised. Participants will be assigned to a probiotic group sequentially in the order they are consented.

    <statisticalmethods>SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION
The study sample for each probiotic tested will be n=20. This sample size is expected to provide sufficient power to detect biologically significant pre-post changes in the primary outcome (Boyle et al CEA 2008;38:1882).

No comparisons will be made between probiotic groups.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
Continuous data will be presented as arithmetic means +/- 1 SD, or medians with inter-quartile ranges. Categorical data will be analysed using Chi2 test or Fishers exact test. Data will be displayed using histograms to identify whether outcomes have a normal or non-normal distribution.

As the primary objective is to compare post-treatment immune measures with pre-treatment measures within each group of participants receiving a single probiotic species, paired statistical tests will be employed. Normally distributed outcomes will be analysed using the paired t-test, and non-normally distributed ones using Wilcoxon signed rank test and Sign test. As a sensitivity analysis, skewed data will be log10 transformed and analysed using the same parametric tests employed for the normally distributed outcomes.  

P value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant, with due caution in interpreting the results of multiple comparisons. Analysis will include those samples where paired data is available from both pre- and post-treatment time points. No comparisons between probiotic groups will be made.

POPULATION TO BE ANALYSED
The analysis will be performed on all data where results are available for both pre- and post-treatment time points. 

HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study prior to study completion will not be included in analyses. Participants with missing data (no data at pre- or post-treatment time point) will be excluded from analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the effects of probiotics on immune system function. 120 healthy adults  will take part and we will investigate the immune effects of six commercially available probiotics (20 participants in each probiotic group). Participants will take a probiotic for 2 weeks and provide a blood sample on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 (the day after their last probiotic dose). We will examine immune system function using the three blood samples provided. This study will provide important information on whether taking probiotics improves the function of the immune system. </summary>
