  <interventions>
    <interventions>After an initial measurement with acoustic rhinometry, rhinomanometry and Rhinolux the subjects are treated with CPAP while lying down. First they will have the nasal prongs of the CPAP fitted with no air pressure for 10 minutes, and then a CPAP pressure of 8 cm H2O will be applied for 20 minutes. The Rhinolux will be fitted during the CPAP provocation to assess changes in nasal mucosal blood flow. Finally, acoustic rhinometry, rhinomanometry and Rhinolux are repeated in sitting and reclining position. Subjective symptoms of nasal congestion will be registered by the subjects on a visual analogue scale sitting and lying down, before and after the CPAP intervention (4 times).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nasal hyper reactivity is characterised by a reflex mediated increased sensitivity to inhaled unspecific irritants such as cold air, perfumes and smoke. Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) are treated with a continuous positive air way pressure (CPAP) device that relies upon a good nasal patency during sleep. The present study aims at evaluating a new non-invasive device, the Rhinolux, to identify patients with an increased risk of having nasal hyper reactivity during CPAP treatment. The Rhinolux is an oximetry device that measures changes in nasal blood flow by light absorption in haemoglobin.
The majority of the patients in this study will not have tested CPAP before eventhough they have been given a description of the treatment procedure. To control for the bias that having prongs in the nose could effect the nasal blood flow, all subjects will initially wear the prongs for 10 minutes before the CPAP pressure is applied. In this sence the study could be considered to be single blind because only the examiner will be fully aware at what time the CPAP pressure is turned on.</summary>
