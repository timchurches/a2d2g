    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome used to analyse fracture healing will be a comparison of fracture callous volumetric tissue density (mg/cm3) and bone strength estimates. This continuous data set is assumed to be approximately normally distributed prior to collection of data, and will be described using mean, standard deviation and range. Summary tables of descriptive statistics will be provided for all baseline variable and efficacy variables. 95% confidence intervals will be presented as appropriate. A sample size calculation was unable to be performed for this study due to the lack of available data. As such the sample size is reflective of a pilot study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) is a novel tool that has the ability to assess trabecular bone independently of cortical bone, and to evaluate various measures of macroscopic bone geometry, which can be combined into indices of bone strength.

A randomised, placebo control trial of vitamin D treatment versus placebo will be performed. Muscle strength and cross sectional muscle area will also be assessed at each follow up time point for all eligible patients.
