  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion with clinical cure (i.e. complete resolution of respiratory symptoms and signs). - Children will have a standardised respiratory clinical assessment, completed by either a member of the study team (doctor, research nurse), or community health centre staff member (if required) weeks is a reasonable time frame to capture clinically important outcomes. These children will be reviewed at week 4, however many children will reside in geographically isolated locations, thus a range of 4-6 weeks is a reasonable time frame to capture clinically important outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical review week 4 (range 4-6 weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion without chronic respiratory symptoms and signs or bronchiectasis. - Any further chronic respiratory symptoms and signs or bronchiectasis though the child's medical records (community or hospital) will be captured. These children will be reviewed at 24 months, however many children will reside in geographically isolated locations, thus a range of 23-25 months is a reasonable timeframe to capture clinically important outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical review at 24 months (range 23-25 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to next respiratory-related hospitalisation assessed by chart reviews - Data will be captured through chart reviews of children's medical records (e.g. hospital and/or community health record) and/or information from parents in next 12 months</outcome>
      <timepoint>Chart reviews in next 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events - Adverse effects will be monitored ((anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rashes) while children are actively taking trial medication (e.g. 8 days). Parents will also keep a diary of adverse events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events monitored while participant taking trial medication</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nasopharyngeal bacteria antibiotic resistance patterns - Nasopharyngeal respiratory antibiotic resistance will be assessed using nasal swabs. Nasopharyngeal respiratory bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance will be assessed using research laboratory's previously published methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (admission to hospital, week 4 (range 4-6 weeks) and 12 months (range 12-14 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whole gene expression of target genes - Whole genome gene expression micro-arrays will be performed in a subgroup of children (where bloods can be obtained)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (hospital admission) and 4-6 weeks (where possible)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
