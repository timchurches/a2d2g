    <interventions>Pre-operative placement of sciatic nerve block (30ml of 0.25% bupivacaone) and catheter prior to commencement of below knee amputation. Local anaesthetic (3-5mL/hour 0.5% Bupivicaine) will continue to be infused continuously via the catheter for five days post-operatively (i.e. the infusion will continue around the clock). </interventions>
    <comparator>Intra-operative placement of sciatic nerve catheter (after below knee amputation) by the surgeon. This will be loaded by the surgeon with 30ml 0.25% bupivacaine and a continuous infusion of local anaesthetic via the catheter (3-5mL 0.5% bupivicaine) will continue for five days post-operatively (i.e the infusion will continue around the clock). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of phantom limb pain will be assessed with a 12 point questionnaire previously used in a survey study on phantom limb pain (Byrne K.  Survey of phantom limb pain, phantm sensation and stump pain in Cambodian and New Zealand amputees.  Pain Med 2011 May 12(5):794-98)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 5 days, 6 months and 1 year post amputation</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of Phantom limb pain assessed with a 12 point questionnaire usd in a previous study (as above, Byrne K.  Survey of phantom limb pain, phantm sensation and stump pain in Cambodian and New Zealand amputees.  Pain Med 2011 May 12(5):794-98)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 5 days, 6 month and 1 year post amputation. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Opioid consumption over the 5 days post operatively will be taken from the patients prescription chart and PCA chart. Different opioids will be converted to morphine equivalents by accepted conversion factors. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At 5 days post operatively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute pain as assessed using a 11 point numberical rate scale (0 = no pain, 10= worst pain imaginable)</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients booked for a below knee amputation at Waikato Hospital will be approached to participate in the study.   Prior to the commencement of the study, a person independent of the study team will prepare 80 envelopes, 40 containing a piece of paper stating contol group, and 40 containing a piece of paper stating study group.  These envelopes will then be ordered in a random fashion by the independent person.  When the patient presents to theatre an envelope will be drawn by the attending anaesthetist and the patient will either be allocated to the control group or the study group.  A member of the research team will place the sciatic nerve catheter in the study group, and the surgical team will place the catheter in the control group.  A person blinding to the study allocation will be responsible for follow up of the patients.</concealment>
    <sequence>The envelopes will alternately allocate a patient to the control group or intervention group. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The incidence of phantom limb pain at 5 days, 6 months and one year would be compared with Chi-squared testing for categorical data (Phantom limb pain present  yes or no).  The pain scores and fentanyl consumption would be described in terms of mean, standard deviation and range, and compared with students t test for comparing numerical data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Phantom limb pain after amputation is common and can be severe. This study will investigate whether blocking (anaesthetising) the patients sciatic nerve prior to having a below knee amputation will reduce the risk and or the severity of phantom limb pain. </summary>
