  <interventions>
    <interventions>A tailored mental health intervention that enhances the care roles and capacities of carers in out of home care in the northern and western metropolitan regions of Melbourne.  
The intervention involves specialist mental health practitioners working with case managers and CSOs to incorporate evidence-based practice (EBP) elements into work processes. The EBP elements will be drawn from empirically supported treatments (ESTs) including motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and the adolescent community reinforcement approach (ACRA).
The methods used by the mental health practitioners for sustainable knowledge and skills transfer include training, co-working to improve confidence and skills, embedding a clinician, mentoring and feedback at individual and organisational levels, mental health consultation and group work.
The intervention will be delivered over a period of two years on a fortnightly basis. The intervention will be delivered face-to-face to staff groups, or when secondary consultation is requested, one-to-one sessions with individual staff members. Group sessions will run for one to two hours. Individual sessions will run for one hour. Process evaluation will be conducted to monitor implementation of the intervention. This will include record keeping by mental health practitioners, six-monthly quantitative assessments with participants and annual focus groups and interviews to assess acceptability of the intervention. </interventions>
    <comparator>Young people receiving care as usual in the southern and eastern metropolitan regions of Melbourne. Each CSO has individual arrangements for training and professional development of carers and case managers, which can include mental health education. These arrangements will be monitored to assess levels of care that constitute 'care as usual' in each CSO and compared to the intervention. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations were conducted using IBM (registered trademark) SPSS (registered trademark) Sample Power (registered trademark) Release 3.0.1. Alpha (a) was set at the 0.05 level. Given the lack of EBP research in OoHC, it is difficult to base sample size calculations on a priori measures of effect size. However, with the numbers of young people expected in the intervention and control groups, and across the two time points (a total of 800), we would have 81% power to detect small effects (f=0.10) for main effects as well as the interaction between group and assessment occasion. With 280 carers recruited we will have 80% power to detect small-to-moderate effects (f=.20) for main effects and the interaction. To determine group differences over time on the proximal and distal outcome measures, a range of statistical techniques will be adopted. For categorical outcome measures, test statistics such as chi-square analysis, loglinear analysis, and logistic regression will be used. For continuous outcome measures, general linear models will be adopted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Ripple project concerns young people who are removed from their families of origin because of significant risk of harm and placed in State care. These young people often have multiple and complex needs, poor mental health, high risk of mental disorders and poor social outcomes. The overall aim of the project is to assess whether a mental health intervention that enhances the care roles and capacities of carers in Out of Home Care (OoHC) will improve (i) the consistency and quality of OoHC for all young people (12-17 years) in the OoHC sector, and (ii) access to early intervention when indicated for prevention and treatment of mental illness. Both aims will contribute to improving the mental health of young people living in OoHC.
