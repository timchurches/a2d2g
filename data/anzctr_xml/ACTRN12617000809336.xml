  <interventions>
    <interventions>International Nonproprietary Name (INN): nicotinamide
Intervention: daily nicotinamide supplementation for 12 weeks 
Dose: accelerated dose from 1.5 grams daily for 6 weeks to 3 grams daily for 6 weeks
Mode of administration: oral tablet

Study design: 2 participant groups with cross-over study design. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either nicotinamide or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by a cross-over (i.e. those on nicotinamide first will switch to placebo and those on placebo first will switch to nicotinamide) for a further 12 weeks. 
A washout period will not be utilised as the effect of nicotinamide does not have a persistent effect after intake is ceased. As participants will be seen in 6-weekly intervals, we do not expect a nicotinamide-induced effect on our measurements in the group that receives nicotinamide first and placebo second. As for those that receive placebo first, then a washout period is also unnecessary as no intervention has been given. 

Adherence monitoring: remaining tablets will be counted at each visit, participants will be asked to log each time they forget a dose. To improve adherence, weekly reminders via phone, e-mail or text message will be sent, and a daily alarm set on participant's phone (if they have a smartphone). A minimum 70% compliance rate will be deemed acceptable, which approximately equates to forgetting to take the intervention twice a week. </interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Short-term changes in retinal function after intervention, specifically changes to the photopic (light-adapted) electroretinogram (ERG). As nicotinamide leads to NAD+ repletion, which can drive energy repletion in the cells of the retina, the ERG can be affected in different ways. Specific parameters include amplitude and timing changes to the a-wave (photoreceptor), b-wave (bipolar cell) and photopic negative response (PhNR, retinal ganglion cell).  </outcome>

      <outcome>Changes to the spectral characteristics of the retinal tissue assessed by hyperspectral imaging. Hyperspectral imaging provides information on the spectral characteristics of the retinal tissue, and may allow for detection of minor alterations to retinal structure, in particular, the retinal nerve fibre layer, which may not be seen using optical coherence tomography.
As hyperspectral imaging of the retina is a novel technique, images are post-processed offline in Matlab to analyse the spectral information in order to detect structural changes in the retina that may manifest after nicotinamide supplementation. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation: Based on pilot data using the electroretinogram to detect functional changes in eyes after glaucoma surgery, an effect size of 0.56 was derived. A power calculation estimates that 48 eyes are required (power 80%, alpha = 0.05). To account for an attrition rate of 20%, we see to recruit 60 eyes all together with early glaucoma to effectively characterise the functional changes associated with NAD+ repletion with nicotinamide. 

Statistics: Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) will be used to assess changes in the electroretinogram with nicotinamide, and the interaction nested within stimulus intensity. Two-way RM-ANOVA will also be used to assess the effect of nicotinamide on the electroretinogram, and the interaction nested within treatment change. Dunnetts multiple comparisons tests will be used for post-hoc analysis to compare changes should they arise, between follow-up visits and baseline. One-way RM-ANOVA will be used to assess changes in individual locations on the 24-2 visual field. Correlations between the change in intraocular pressure and visual function will also be made in both nicotinamide and placebo groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to translate into the clinic a recently published study, demonstrating the protective role of vitamin B3 supplements (nicotinamide) in a mouse model of glaucoma. Glaucoma causes progressive loss of nerve tissue in the eye, and irreversible vision loss. This study investigates the short-term effect of taking nicotinamide supplements on the eyes structure and function compared to placebo. 
Primary aims of this study include: 1) determining whether nicotinamide supplements in participants with glaucoma leads to short-term improvement in visual function measured using visual fields and the electroretinogram (ERG) and 2) determining whether nicotinamide leads to structural changes to the nerve tissue, imaged using hyperspectral imaging and optical coherence tomography. 
Participants diagnosed with glaucoma by an ophthalmologist will be invited to undertake the 24-week study with crossover design. They will be randomly assigned to take nicotinamide or placebo daily for 12 weeks. The ERG, visual fields and imaging are performed at baseline, 6 and 12-weeks post-intervention. Participants then crossover to take placebo or nicotinamide for another 12 weeks and the same measurements are repeated at 6 and 12-weeks post-intervention.</summary>
