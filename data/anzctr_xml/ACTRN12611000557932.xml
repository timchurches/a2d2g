  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the present study, we used the weight loss program by  doctor Amir and colleagues recommended in 2009.(Amir Rashid lamir, Mahmood Goudarzi, Ali asghar ravasi: effect of gradual and acute weight loss on strength and endurance of well trained wrestlers. World journal of sport sciences, 2009, 2 (4).) Furthermore, we've used this protocol in our study (without any change in it).

Arm 1: Describe the twelve-day only Diet :
We used a weight reduction program (12 days), including researchers proposed twelve-day diet in three 4-day phases, in each phase in the  first three day a decrease in nutrition occurred  and in the  last  day a return diet to the previous phase.  In  the  first  phase, the subjects decreased  10% of  their food (lunch and dinner) and then  they  returned  to  their  usual  eating  habits (the food they received before their  diet).   In   the   second   phase,   first they   decreased 20%   in three day then they returned to 10%  reduction on the fourth day.   In   the third   phase, first they decreased 30% %   in three day then they returned to 20%  reduction on the fourth day.  There  was  no  limitation  on  drinking  water  and  no  decrease  in  breakfast, but the subjects avoided fat  in all meals. This weight loss method was extracted from Rashid Lamir's weight loss method.

Arm 2: Describe the twelve-day  Exercise + Diet:
We used a weight reduction program (Described above) along with twelve-day aerobic exercise (exercise intensity was 60 - 70 % HR max for 50 minutes) every other day. Subjects running in the outdoor environment. furthermore, they was supervised by a exercise physiologist.</interventions>

      <outcome>twelve-day diet group:
agrp in all subjects was significantly increased  and IL-6 in all subjects no changed at 24 hours after the end of the weight loss program
We've collected blood samples from subjects in two stages. It had two stages for 24 hours before and 24 hours after the execution of programs. Then blood samples by the methods for analysis and was made into a case of figures and data. Then, using the software spss (using one-way Analysis of variance) the increase was found.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: Agouti-related peptide is a neuropeptide (132-amino acid) produced in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is excreting by adiposities, which increased by overweight and obesity. We examined the Impact of exercise conjugated diet and only diet on plasma concentration of agouti-related peptide and Inerleukine-6 in obese and overweight sedentary female collage students

Research Methods and Procedures: A total of 30 subjects (age = 21.9 +/- 2.4; weight = 75.6 +/- 5.57; BF = 29.532 +/- 3.18 and BMI = 29.048 +/- 2.216) randomly divided into two experimental and one control groups. The experimental  group1 Experienced twelve-day diet (D), the experimental  group2 Experienced twelve-day diet (every day) with  twelve-day running  training (the intensity was  60 to 70 %HRmax for 50 minutes) every other day (AED) and control group remained sedentary with normal diet in this period. Blood samples were collected 24 hours before and after enforced protocol. Body fat percentage of subjects measured using 3 points method. After plasma separation, AGRP levels measured using ELISA method with special Kit. The data was analyzed by K-S, ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc.
Results: After doing protocols, the plasma AGRP in the D group increased significantly (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, resting plasma IL-6 for AED groups reduced significantly (p&lt;0.05). The data indicate that after enforced protocol, AED group was stable on resting plasma AGRP (p&gt;0.05).
Discussion: Aerobic Exercise conjugated Diet is better than only diet, because not only it was causing AgRP stable but reduced resting plasma IL-6 as well.
