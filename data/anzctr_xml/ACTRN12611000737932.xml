    <interventions>Arm 1: tracheal intubation using the SensaScope.
Arm 2: tracheal intubation suing the Bonfils retromolar scope.
After anesthesia induction, the anesthesiologist will use either the SensaScope or Bonfils Retromolar scope (based on randomization) to intubate the patient under direct vision. Tracheal intubation should be achieved within one minute. If not, the procedure is aborted and the patient is manually ventilated for 15 seconds, then a second attempt is made with the same device. After 3 unsuccessful attempts at intubation, the patient will be deemed difficult to intubate and the standard algorithm for difficult intubation will be followed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3: tracheal intubation using a conventional laryngoscope.
After anesthesia induction, the anesthesiologist will use the conventional laryngoscope (based on randomization) to intubate the patient under direct vision. Tracheal intubation should be achieved within one minute. If not, the procedure is aborted and the patient is manually ventilated for 15 seconds, then a second attempt is made with the same device. After 3 unsuccessful attempts at intubation, the patient will be deemed difficult to intubate and the standard algorithm for difficult intubation will be followed.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to determine the stress response to tracheal intubation using a non-invasive device that measures blood flow from the heart, blood pressure, and heart rate. In addition, it will determine the time required for tracheal intubation using two special airway devices and compare it with the time required using a conventional airway device. These special devices are used for difficult intubation cases but we will use them in patients with expected easy intubation in this study.</summary>
