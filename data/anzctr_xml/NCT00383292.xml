Experimental: A - 


Treatment: drugs: LY573636
LY573636 dose is dependent on patient's height, weight, and gender and is adjusted to target a specific Cmax based on patient laboratory parameters. LY573636 is administered intravenously every 28 days until disease progression or other criteria for patient discontinuation are met.

             drug.
