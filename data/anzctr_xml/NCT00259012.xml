  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peak Concentration (Cmax) - Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including peak plasma concentration, were determined following a single oral dose of pantoprazole</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 day</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Peak Concentration (Tmax) Profile - Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including time to peak plasma concentration, were determined following a single oral dose of pantoprazole.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 day</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disposition Half-life - Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including the terminal-phase disposition half-life, were determined following a single oral dose of pantoprazole. Half-life is the time required for half the quantity of absorbed drug to be metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 day</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) - Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including AUC, were determined following a single oral dose of pantoprazole. AUC is a measure of the plasma concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 day</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) - Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including apparent oral clearance, were determined following a single oral dose of pantoprazole. Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 day</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pantoprazole Plasma Concentration After Multiple-Dose Oral Administration - Plasma concentration of pantoprazole after multiple doses was measured to see if there was any accumulation of the drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intragastric pH - Intragastric pH is a method for evaluating gastric acidity scaled 0-9. A lower pH means more acidity. A longer duration of esophageal mucosa exposure to a gastric refluxate with a pH &lt;4.0 correlates with more severe mucosal injury in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Median Intragastric pH - Intragastric pH is a method for evaluating gastric acidity scaled 0-9. A lower pH means more acidity. A longer duration of esophageal mucosa exposure to a gastric refluxate with a pH &lt;4.0 correlates with more severe mucosal injury in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Time Intragastric pH Was &gt;4 - Intragastric pH is a method for evaluating gastric acidity. A lower pH means more acidity. A longer duration of esophageal mucosa exposure to a gastric refluxate with a pH &lt;4.0 correlates with more severe mucosal injury in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Intraesophageal pH - Intraesophagel pH is a method for evaluating acidity of gastric refluxate scaled 0-9. A lower pH means more acidity. A longer duration of esophageal mucosa exposure to a gastric refluxate with a pH &lt;4.0 correlates with more severe mucosal injury in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days</timepoint>

      <timepoint>7 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Time That Intraesophageal pH Was &lt;4 - Intraesophagel pH is a method for evaluating acidity of gastric refluxate. A lower pH means more acidity. A longer duration of esophageal mucosa exposure to a gastric refluxate with a pH &lt;4.0 correlates with more severe mucosal injury in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Normalized Area of Gastric Hydrogen Ion Activity Over Time - Normalized Area of Gastric Hydrogen Ion Activity Over Time is a measure of the area under the curve of the gastric hydrogen ion activity over time, which is normalized for a 24-hour period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Normalized Area of Esophageal Hydrogen Ion Activity Over Time - Normalized Area of Esophageal Hydrogen Ion Activity Over Time is a measure of the area under the curve of the esophageal hydrogen ion activity over time, which is normalized for a 24-hour period.</outcome>
