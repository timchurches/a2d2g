  <interventions>
    <interventions>Neuromuscular Program: Experienced musculoskeletal physiotherapists will deliver the exercise program. A total of eight treatments will be delievered over twelve weeks; two treatments sessions in week one, once in the second and third weeks and fortnightly thereafter. The duration of the first session will be 45 minutes with the remaining sessions lasting 30 minutes. The physiotherapists will individualise  the neuromuscular program to the ability of each participant. In addition to attending the phyisotherapist, participants will perform 5-6 exercises that will last 30-35min, 3 times each week unsupervised, at home for the 12 week period.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potentially eligible participants will be identified through orthopaedic surgeon's patient records. These eligible patients will receive a letter of information and the plain language statement. If the person is eligible the researcher will obtain written informed consent and invite the participant to have an x-ray of their knee. However, no x-ray will be required if individuals can provide us with a knee x-ray from the past 12 months. If the x-ray does not show signs of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis, the participant will be enrolled into the study and scheduled for baseline testing. 
Following baseline assessment participants will be consecutively randomised into the neuromuscular exercise group or the control group.</concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher with no additional involvement in the study will prepare consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes containing group allocation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis is a common musculoskeletal condition that is increasingly prevalent as the population ages. Knee osteoarthritis research has largely focused on treating pain and disability. However, to reduce the incidence of this burdensome disease, prevention is also vital. Individuals who have undergone an arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM), a common surgical procedure to repair, remove or trim the inner knee meniscus are at increased risk to develop knee osteoarthritis. Post-APM patients, have increased knee joint loading as compared to matched healthy individuals. It is widely accepted that increased knee joint loads may be one factor related to the initiation and progression of knee osteoarthritis. In young healthy individuals neuromuscular exercises can reduce knee joint loading during athletic tasks however, the effects of neuromuscular exercises on knee joint loads are unclear in those considered at high risk of developing early knee osteoarthritis. This research will primarily investigate the effects of a neuromuscular exercise program on knee load in those who have undergone an arthroscopy to repair, remove or trim the inner knee meniscus. The neuromuscular intervention includes exercises designed to improve co-ordination, knee alignment and balance. This study will help us to develop better rehabilitation programs that could help delay the onset of knee osteoarthritis following knee arthroscopy.</summary>
