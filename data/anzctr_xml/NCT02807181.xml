Treatment: devices - Radiation: SIRT + chemotherapy (cisplatin-gemcitabine)

Active Comparator: Chemotherapy (Cisplatin-Gemcitabine) - Cisplatin 25mg/m2 in 1000ml 0.9% saline given over 1 hour followed by 500 ml 0.9% saline over 30 minutes, followed by Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 in 250-500 ml 0.9% saline over 30 minutes by intravenous infusions on days 1, and 8 of a 21-day cycle.

Experimental: Radiation: SIRT + chemotherapy (Cisplatin-Gemcitabine) - A single treatment of hepatic arterial injection of SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres (SIRT) followed 14-16 days later by systemic chemotherapy (ABC-02 CIS-GEM protocol) with an intention to treat with 8 cycles of cisplatin + gemcitabine, or until progression, toxicity or patient choice. Treatment may be continued beyond 8 cycles in the absence of significant disease progression, at the treating clinicians' discretion.

    <summary>The study will evaluate the benefit of applying Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT)
      using SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres prior to receiving systemic chemotherapy treatment
      (cisplatin-gemcitabine, or CIS-GEM) in patients with unresectable intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma. Half of the patients will be randomized to CIS-GEM chemotherapy plus
      SIRT, and half of the patients will be randomized to CIS-GEM alone.</summary>
