    <interventions>Intermittent Fasting Group
Participants will be asked to follow a diet containing only 500kcal for two non-consecutive days per week and eat normally (unrestricted but encouraged to follow healthy eating guidelines) on the other five days for 6 months.  Participants will be taught how to count calories and recieve dietary advice regarding healthy eating and food portions (as per Australian Guide to Healthy Guidelines).  A calorie counting book will be provided.  They will receive regular dietetic review and monitoring during the first 3 months (baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks) and minimal contact during the remaining 3 months.  The initial session with the dietitian at baseline will be 45 minutes in duration and all subsequent reviews will be 30 minutes in duration.  Participants will have biochemical markers (fasting lipids and fasting glucose), biological impedence (to estimate percentage body fat), waist circumference and blood pressure taken at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.  They will also complete a food frequency questionnaire and a validated quality of life questionnaire (AQoL 8D scale) at these times.  Participants will have weight monitored and will be questioned about their compliance with the diet at all reviews (baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months).  In order to promote compliance, participants will be provided with sample recipes and will be able to contact the study dietitian during business hours for further clarification or dietary advice.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Treatment (Standard Calorie Restricted Group)
Participants will be asked to follow a diet approximately 500kcal less than energy requirements every day for 6 months.  Participants will recieve dietary advice regarding healthy eating and food portions (as per Australian Guide to Healthy Guidelines) to achieve this.  They will receive regular dietetic review and monitoring during the first 3 months (baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks) and minimal contact during the remaining 3 months.  Participants will have biochemical markers (fasting lipids and fasting glucose), biological impedence (to estimate percentage body fat), waist circumference and blood pressure taken at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.  They will also complete a food frequency questionnaire and a validated quality of life questionnaire (AQoL 8D scale) at these times.  Participants will have weight monitored and will be questioned about their compliance with the diet at all reviews (baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months).  In order to promote compliance, participants will be provided with sample recipes and will be able to contact the study dietitian during business hours for further clarification or dietary advice.</comparator>

A simple randomisation protocol will be used to allocate participants to one of two dietary
intervention groups; the Intermittent Fasting Group (IFG) or the Standard Calorie Restricted
Group (SCRG).  Numbered tokens representing
the total number of participants (i.e. numbered from 1-30) will be placed in an envelope. Once a participant has been recruited, an offsite administrator will then be asked to pull out a token for the participant and inform the principal investigator.  The offsite administrator will not be told what the numbers represent and is not involved in any other aspect of the trial.  Participants who are drawn an odd
number will be allocated to Intermittent Fasting Group (IFG) and participants who are
drawn an even number will be allocated to the Standard Calorie Restricted Group (SCRG).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study aims to determine whether the intermittent fasting approach leads to greater weight loss and greater improvements in blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure than a standard low energy diet in obese male war veterans.  Our primary objective is to determine whether obese, male war veterans who undertake intermittent fasting (5:2 method) achieve at least 5% weight loss in six months.</summary>
