  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Australia has one of the highest rates of asthma and allergy in the world. Both are strong
risk factors for perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE), which are the leading
cause of critical incidents in paediatric anaesthesia
It is already well established that the severity of current asthma, as well as the effect of
therapeutic asthma drugs, can be assessed by monitoring exhaled nitric oxide levels. In
addition, exhaled nitric oxide levels can be easily measured in children using a simple
non-invasive device.
The aim of this study is to assess whether the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide levels
may be used to identify children at a particularly high risk for respiratory complications.
By identifying this at risk group, the anaesthetist will be able to make a more informed
decision regarding the optimal time for surgery, as well as institute the appropriate
medical management prior to surgery for each individual child. Optimising the
anaesthesia management for this high-risk group would be expected to lead to a
reduction in perioperative respiratory complications. Since respiratory complications are
one of the leading causes for morbidity and mortality in paediatric anaesthesia, such a
reduction would lead to a major improvement in outcomes for high-risk children
undergoing anaesthesia. In addition to an anticipated reduction in the occurrence of
respiratory complications, this study has the potential to reduce the health costs
associated with the occurrence of these complications (e.g. unplanned hospital
admissions, prolonged hospital stay, additional treatment). We also anticipate that our
findings will lead to an improvement in waiting list times, aid the scheduling of surgery,
assist in the preoperative identification of children at a higher risk of PRAE and aid the
planning of appropriate preventive strategies, thereby reducing the cancellation of
surgery. Cancellations have associated adverse economic impacts for the health care
system, cause enormous emotional and financial burdens for the child and his/her family
as well as engender lack of confidence in the public health care system.
To conclude, we anticipate that this study will improve the safety of children undergoing
anaesthesia by providing early detection of high-risk patients which will aid the optimal timing
of surgery, enhance the anaesthesia management of our patients, help reduce the costs of
prolonged hospital stay associated with peroperative complications and optimise waitlist
times. Further benefits may include a reduced requirement for critical care facilities, a
decrease in unexpected intensive care admissions and enhanced child/parent satisfaction
rates.</summary>
