  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single 15-20 minute education session on hand hygiene delivered in classrooms late in school term 1.  Session consists of interactive teaching about hand hygiene and the use of a cream that glows under ultraviolet light.  Two children from each class will be asked to rub this cream on their hands then wash their hands, and an ultraviolet torch will be used to illustrate the fact that usual handwashing often misses parts of the hands.  The message will be that handwashing needs to be done thoroughly.  Pupils will also be shown how to use the hand sanitiser at this session, in preparation for terms 2 and 3.

In terms 2 and 3, hand sanitiser dispensers will be placed in primary school classrooms.  Teachers will be asked to ensure that children use the hand sanitiser at least twice a day - at the beginning of lunch and morning break - and also after coughing or sneezing in the classroom. This amounts to at least twice-daily use for a total of 20 weeks over the two school terms.  Alsoft solution will be supplied in 'no-touch' dispensers.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absence from school due to any illness.  Injury and infestation (headlice, scabies) are excluded.  Information will be collected from the school roll on all absences and parents who have given consent to be contacted following their children's absences ('follow-up children')  will be contacted for confirmation except where it is clear that the child was not unwell (e.g. on holiday, at a funeral, etc). An absence episode is defined as a group of days of absence with no gaps of non-absence of more than 2 days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Absence information will be collected from each school once a week from the first week of term 2; a total of 20 weeks over the two terms.  Parents who have consented to be followed up post absence will be telephoned on a week day 8 to 9 days after the date of the first day of absence from school.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absence due to respiratory illness among follow-up children. Information will be collected from the school roll on all absences and parents of follow-up children who have been absent will be contacted for confirmation except where it is clear that the child was not unwell (e.g. on holiday, at a funeral, etc).  The nature of the illness will be ascertained by asking questions about symptoms. An absence episode is defined as a group of days of absence with no gaps of non-absence of more than 2 days.</outcome>

    <concealment>The principals of all primary schools in within the city boundaries of Christchurch, Dunedin, and Invercargill will be approached to participate in the trial in November 2008. Schools meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised, all at once, within stratum, to receive either the intervention or the control. Three strata will be defined by geographical area (Christchurch, Dunedin, Invercargill). The trial statistician (Joanne McKenzie) will implement the randomisation. She will only be provided with school codes and district and will randomise schools to either “A” or “B”, so as to remain blinded to the group allocation. Patricia Priest will randomly allocate “A” and “B” to the intervention and control group, prior to receiving the allocation list.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random number for each school will be generated using the statistical package Stata/MP 10.1 for Windows (StataCorp. 2007. Stata Statistical Software: Release 10. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Within stratum, schools will be sorted by the random number. The first half of the schools within each stratum will be allocated to intervention “A”, and the second half to intervention “B”.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of hand sanitisers in reducing absence from illness in primary schools during terms 2 and 3 of 2009 . The study's aims are: 
1.	To assess whether regular hand cleaning with hand sanitiser, as an adjunct to usual hand cleaning, reduces the incidence of illness absence in primary school pupils.
2.	If illness is reduced, to measure the cost-effectiveness of the provision of hand sanitiser.
3.	To measure the cost to families of childrens school absences that are due to illness, including activities that caregivers were unable to do because they had to stay home from work to care for the child and cases of illness in other members of the family.</summary>
