  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a randomized parallel study, adult overweight and obese women and men will undergo either a continuous energy restricted diet (CON) of 4200 kJ / day for women and 5500 kJ / day for men, a week-on, week-off energy restriction (IER), or the 5:2 dieting regime (5 days of habitual eating with 2 days per week of a very low kilojoule diet. 2100kJ for women and 2500kJ for men). The initial weight loss period will be 8 weeks for continuous dieting (CON) or 16 weeks of dieting week-on, week-off (IER) &amp; the 5:2 group. In the initial weight loss period participants will visit the University Clinic every 2 weeks for the CON group and every 4 weeks for the IER &amp; 5:2 group, to be weighed and have the energy restriction reinforced. These visits will be of 20 minutes duration. The weight loss program will be administered by a dietitian, participants will be given dietary advice and a diet booklet in a one-on-one consultation. There will be a single 1 hour session at baseline. Compliance to diet will be assessed using 3 day diet diaries completed weekly in CON and 2 weekly in IER. Participants will be advised to increase the number of steps/day to 10000 and provided with a pedometer.

After the initial weight loss period of 8 weeks CON and 16 weeks IER &amp; participants will continue the same strategy on an energy restricted diet of approximately 6 MJ /day for women and 7 MJ / day for men. The 5:2 participants will remain on the same kJ intake. Participants will continue on this diet for the remaining study period 44 weeks for the continuous group and 36 weeks for the intermittent groups. Participants will be invited to attend the University clinic at 3 monthly intervals during this period to be weighed and return one 3 day diet record/month.

Participants from all groups will then also be followed up at 24mnths from the baseline visit.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of intermittent dieting compared to continuous dieting on weight loss after an intensive weight loss period, This period will last for 8 weeks for the continuous group and 16 weeks for the intermittent groups;  week-on, week-off strategy and the 5:2 strategy. We will also look at the effects on weight loss maintenance after 12 months. Another aim is to look at changes in muscle mass, blood lipids and glucose.
We hypothesize that those on the intermittent energy restriction patterns will achieve comparable weight loss maintenance at 12 months compared to those on the continuous energy restriction pattern.</summary>
