  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a mHealth comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme. All intervention participants will receive a tailored programme of text messages (SMS) via their mobile phone with evidence-based information on actions that will reduce risk of subsequent events (e.g., education about risk factors, the impact changes can have on their risk, the importance of taking CVD medications, improving diet and exercise, reducing stress, and getting help for stopping smoking).  

Each participant in the intervention group will receive at minimum the basic CR program, consisting of 5 messages per week for 6 months. These will be sent at times to suit participants and will be personalised (including participants name). Participants can  request extra messages on one behaviour they would like to focus on (physical activity, healthy eating, stopping smoking, or reducing stress), which would result in an additional 3 messages per week over the first 12 weeks. The intervention will be predominantly unidirectional but participants will be able to text an expert about lifestyle change, with questions answered within 24 hours. Participants will also be asked to text in their pedometer step counts and will receive a tailored response. 

Participants will also have access to an interactive website which contains a blog, a graph of their physical activity progress, role model video messages, and weekly healthy lifestyle tips.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control arm will be offered the standard outpatient CR programme provided by each hospital, which involves support and education provision to discharged patients, with supervised exercise offered at all three participating hospitals for those wishing to participate (Phase 2 CR usually of 6-12 weeks duration). During Phase 3 participants are encouraged to continue with their lifestyle changes and join a cardiac club. </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence to lifestyle behaviour change, measured using a composite health behaviour score. Participants are assigned one point for each positive health behaviour, including current non-smoking, not physically inactive, moderate alcohol intake, and fruit and vegetable intake of at least 5 servings a day. Absence of the respective behaviours equates to a zero, thus scores range from 0-4. </outcome>

    <concealment>Eligible participants will be identified by research nurses from two participating hospitals in Auckland. Potential participants will be identified during hospital admission for IHD. They will be informed about the study prior to discharge and asked if they wish to participate or would like more information. Those not interested in participating will be offered usual CR care. The research nurses will forward the contact details of interested potential participants to the study team, who will then contact the potential participant to explain the study and book their baseline assessment.

Following baseline assessment procedures, participants will be randomly assigned to either the mHealth intervention or usual care control group.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a programme designed to educate patients about their cardiovascular risk factors and encourage lifestyle change, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular deaths and hospital readmissions by 25%. However patient attendance at CR is minimal, often due to a lack of time or transport to attend centre-based sessions. Mobile technology potentially offers a solution. We propose a randomised controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile phone delivered comprehensive CR programme on adherence to lifestyle change compared to usual care (encouragement to attend CR). The programme, Text4Heart, consists of a package of text messages and an interactive website to increase and maintain positive lifestyle changes, such as starting and maintaining regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, stopping smoking, and taking prescribed medications. If effective, this approach has potential to improve the delivery of comprehensive CR and could be scaled up nationally and internationally.</summary>
