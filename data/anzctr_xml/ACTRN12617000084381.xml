    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>trial is a proof of concept trial.An observed event-free rate of 63% at 2 years is deemed to be an important signal. The lower clinical threshold for futility will be set at 50% at 2 years.
Using the Neuenschwander Proof of Concept (PoC) approach  the criteria for PoC will be set to;
An observed event-free rate at 2 years of =63%
Posterior probability that the true rate exceeds 50% is &gt;90% (given observed data)

It could be described as the Bayesian power in this context and if the true rate is &gt; 67%, a sample size of 60 is a justifiable upper limit on the sample size; with higher, true event-free rates the probability that both PoC criteria are met exceeds 80% at substantially smaller sample sizes. With a sample size of 30 there is a reasonable probability (&gt;80%) of meeting the PoC criteria for the primary endpoint when the true event-free rate at 2 years is 70% or more.  The probability that the PoC criteria will be met when the true rate is 50% or less, is 10% or less when more than 25 patients have been assessed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a Blinatumomab, Cytarabine (AraC) and Methotrexate therapy protocol for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 40 to 65 years, and have been newly diagnosed with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia without Ph positive disease.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will receive the same therapy protocol. This involves a 15-day debulking treatment with oral and/or intravenous vincristine followed by eight 28-day cycles alternating between intravenous blinatumomab therapy and intravenous methotrexate, methylprednisolone and cytarabine. After completing these alternating cycles, maintenance treatment will continue in 28-day cycles for 24 months with a combination of intravenous vincristine and oral prednisolone, mercaptopurine and methotrexate.

Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their quality of life and will undergo assessments for disease progression, side effects and survival for 5 years.</summary>
