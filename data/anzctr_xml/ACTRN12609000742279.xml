  <interventions>
    <interventions>8 weeks of gym-based exercise training, consisting of both cardiovascular and resistance training, 3 times a week for an hour each sessio.  In addition, subjects will participate in a progressive walking program consisting of daily walking at a rate of perceived exertion of 13 on the Borg scale, increasing duration at this intensity.  Initially patients may only be walking for 5 minutes, and this duration will be increased on an individul basis.  subjects will complete the walking program for 8 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of an eight week cardiovascular and strengthening exercise program on maximum exercise capacity (VO2 peak), quality of life scores and six minute walk distance in patients with a LVAD.  The experimental hypothesis is that patients with a LVAD who participate in the eight week gym-based exercise program, in addition to a progressive walking program, will have significantly greater improvements in maximal and submaximal exercise capacity and quality of life compared to those that participate in a progressive walking program alone.</summary>
