  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 2 interventions:
1. A 20% discount on sell price of fresh and frozen fruit, vegetables, water and diet soft-drinks for six months;
2. A combined price discount (as described above) with an in-store nutrition education strategy. The in-store nutrition education strategy is based on social-cognitive theory and best available evidence of determinants of diet in remote Aboriginal communities. The reduced cost and benefits of consuming more of the healthy foods will be promoted through the nutrition education strategy, and suggestions and activities provided on how to increase fruit and vegetable intake and substitute water or diet soft-drinks for sugar-sweetened soft-drinks. Six themes have been developed with a supporting set of activities to be implemented over the six-month intervention period including posters, activity sheets, cooking demonstrations and taste-testing activities and competitions. </interventions>

    <concealment>There are 38 stores in the Northern Territory managed by ALPA or OBS. Twenty of these stores that met the study criteria and were invited to participate in the study agreed to participate. We predetermined that there would be five administrative sets of four stores and that each of the store sets would consist of mostly two ALPA stores (of which one would be randomly allocated to receive the nutrition education strategy) and two OBS stores (of which one would be randomly allocated to receive the nutrition education strategy). Using two opaque envelopes with the ALPA store names in one envelope and the OBS stores in the other, we randomly selected a store from each of the envelopes in turn and continued to consecutively allocate stores to the fixed store set framework until all stores had been allocated. </concealment>
    <sequence>We firstly fixed the framework of five sets of four stores with around 2 ALPA stores and 2 OBS stores in each set and with 1 ALPA store and 1 OBS store in each set to receive the combined price discount/ nutrition education strategy. Using two opaque envelopes with the ALPA store names in one envelope and the OBS stores in the other, we randomly selected a store from each of the envelopes in turn and continued to consecutively allocate stores to the fixed store set framework, starting with the first store in the first store set, until all stores had been allocated. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Mixed models will be used to analyse the store point-of-sale data; random effects will include the store; fixed effects will include the step (of 8 weeks in length which corresponds to the lag in the roll-out of the intervention across sets of stores), the phase (baseline, intervention, post-intervention) and the in-store nutrition education strategy. Additional covariates (the contextual factors - such as distance to competing food outlet, community level income, population size) will be described and tested and may be introduced as additional fixed effects. It is expected that there will be some additional correlation within each store and a variance-covariance model (VCVM) for this will be identified prior to the formal testing of the fixed effects and other covariates. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Indigenous Australians suffer a disproportionate burden of preventable chronic disease compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts  much of it diet-related. Increasing fruit and vegetable intakes and reducing sugar-sweetened soft-drink consumption can reduce the risk of preventable chronic disease. There is evidence from some general population studies that subsidising healthier foods can modify dietary behaviour. There is little such evidence relating specifically to socio-economically disadvantaged populations, even though dietary behaviour in such  populations is arguably more likely to be susceptible to such interventions. 
Aim: This study aims to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of a price discount intervention with or without an in-store nutrition education intervention on purchases of fruit, vegetables, water and diet soft-drinks among remote Indigenous communities. 
Methods/ Design: We will utilise a randomised multiple baseline (stepped wedge) design involving 20 communities in remote Indigenous Australia. The study will be conducted in partnership with two store associations and twenty Indigenous store boards. Communities will be randomised to either i) a 20% price discount on fruit, vegetables, water and diet soft-drinks; or ii) a combined price discount and in-store nutrition education strategy. These interventions will be initiated, at one of five possible time-points, spaced two-months apart. Weekly point-of-sale data will be collected from each community store before, during, and for six months after the six-month intervention period to measure impact on purchasing of discounted food and drinks. Data on physical, social and economic factors influencing weekly store sales will be collected in order to identify important covariates. Intervention fidelity and mediators of behaviour change will also be assessed. 
Discussion: This study will provide original evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of price discounts with or without an in-store nutrition education intervention on food and drink purchasing among a socio-economically disadvantaged population in a real-life setting.
