  <interventions>
    <interventions>Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) will be measured non-invasively in the muscles of the hand using near infrared spectroscopy. This  gives an estimate of the adequacy of the circulation and may be an early indicator of developing shock. These measurements take a few seconds to perform and will be taken on initial assessment in the Emergency Department and three hours subsequently in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with infections. The aim is to evaluate if StO2 is useful to identify patients who are at risk of deteriorating and developing organ failure in the subsequent days following admission to hospital.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Severe sepsis accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in the community and is a large contributor to healthcare costs. The hallmark of severe sepsis is organ failure or shock. Patients with community acquired sepsis are initially assessed in the Emergency Department (ED). The signs of early organ dysfunction or shock may not be present when the patient is seen in in the ED, leading to delayed treatment and increased costs. 

This study will investigate a new technique to measure tissue oxygenation (StO2) non-invasively called near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using a commercially available device. StO2 is a measure of impaired circulation and may be an early indicator of developing shock. We will measure StO2 in the ED  in patients who are being admitted to hospital with sepsis. The study hypothesis is that StO2 is associated with organ failure and so can be used to identify patients at risk in this setting.

We aim to recruit 300 patients presenting to two metropolitan Emergency departments in Western Australia during this study.

This study is investigator initiated and has been designed and funded independently from the manufacturer of the NIRS device or any other industry sponsor.</summary>
