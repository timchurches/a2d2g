  <interventions>
    <interventions>Encapsulated Berryfruit extract (1000mg), once daily, by mouth, for 28 days. Subjects will go through a washout period of 28 days between each intervention period of the study.
Study extract/ placebo compliance will be captured via a capsule count, performed at the end of each intervention period (at visits 2 and 4) - study product will be collected and counted by study staff and a compliance log completed for accountability purposes.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be by a mixed linear model to account for the cross-over design with a random effect for participant and baseline FENO as a co-variate. The FENO will be logarithm transformed for analysis purposes as our past experience is that this variable has a highly skewed distribution. Exponentiation of the difference in logarithm FENO can be interpreted as the ratio of mean FENO between two randomised groups.
A sample size of 24 has 80% power, alpha 5%, to detect a difference in logarithm FeNO of 0.227, equivalent to a ratio of mean values of 1.25; based on paired SD for the difference in logarithm FeNO at two visits in a group of steroid naive asthmatics taking a placebo.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is being done to find out whether a New Zealand berryfruit extract is able to reduce markers of airway inflammation in people with asthma. The aim is to provide scientific evidence to support the berryfruit extract as a functional food, able to assist with human health.</summary>
