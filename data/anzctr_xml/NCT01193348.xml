             for unrelated medical condition (e.g., Hypogammaglobinemia), or chronic Rituximab

         18. Patients receiving other immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids, mTOR
             inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine or tacrolimus are excluded

             patient has confirmed anti-Complement Factor antibodies antibody requiring
             immunosuppressive therapy or [3] steroids are being used for a condition other than
             aHUS (example asthma).

         19. Participation in any other investigational drug trial or device trial, or procedures
             beginning four weeks prior to screening and throughout the entire trial

         20. Prior use of eculizumab, hypersensitivity to eculizumab, to murine proteins or to one
