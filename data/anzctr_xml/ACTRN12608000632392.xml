  <interventions>
    <interventions>Citicoline Intravenous (IV) injection starting with 1 gram of the drug twice a day from three days before routine surgical treatment until the end of the day of operation. In the first three postoperative days the dose given was 500 milligrams twice a day and in the seven following days the patients were treated with 250 milligrams daily of citicoline intravenously.
Citicoline (cytidine_5_diphosphocholine) is an essential intermediate material in the biosynthesis of structural cellular membrane phospholipids specially phosphatidylcholine.
Citicoline is considered as a safe drug without any significant and dangerous side effects.</interventions>
    <comparator>The patients are randomly divided into two groups.
In the control group water for injection is prescribed as the placebo made in the same shape of the original drug ampules (citicoline).
The placebo is administered intravenously identical to the drug itself.
The frequency of administration of the placebo is two ampules of it twice a day  from 3 days before routine surgical treatment until the end of the day of the operation, following by injecting one ampule of the placebo every 12 hours in the first three postoperative days and one ampule daily in the seven consequent days.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Relatively high mortality and neurological morbidity can be attributed to chronic subdural hematomas even after accepted surgical interventions. Citicoline is a   neuroprotective agent known to have positive effects in cerebrovascular surgeries and suggested to be beneficial in different cognitive disorders, traumatic brain injury and various surgical interventions.
In this study the authors examine the effect of perioperative prescription of citicoline on mortality and morbidity of chronic subdural hematomas.
The null hypothesis is perioperative prophylactic administration of citicoline has no significant effect on mortality and different neuerological morbidities of chronic subdural hematomas treated with surgery.</summary>
