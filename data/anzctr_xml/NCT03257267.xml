  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective is to compare overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent or
      metastatic platinum-refractory cervical cancer treated with either REGN2810 or investigator's
      choice (IC) chemotherapy.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of REGN2810 versus IC chemotherapy

        -  To compare overall response rate (ORR) (partial response [PR] + complete response [CR])
           of REGN2810 versus IC chemotherapy per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1

        -  To compare the duration of response (DOR) of REGN2810 versus IC chemotherapy

        -  To compare the safety profiles of REGN2810 versus IC chemotherapy by describing adverse
           events (AE)

        -  To compare quality of life (QOL) for patients treated with REGN2810 versus IC
           chemotherapy using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
           Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</summary>
