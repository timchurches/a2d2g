Other interventions - Necator americanus-hookworm larvae L3-20
Other interventions - Gluten free diet

Experimental: Necator americanus-hookworm larvae L3-10 - A total of 40 participants week 0 and week 8 will have low dose hookworms present in 2-3 drops of water applied to their skin and then covered in a light dressing. The hookworms are Necator americanus-hookworm larvae L3; 10 L3 in 200 microliter (uL) of deionized water presented in an Eppendorf tube. All participants will undergo interventions of Gluten free diet, Gluten micro-challenge, Inadvertent gluten challenge and Moderate gluten challenge. At week 42, participants will have the option of going on the liberal diet.

Placebo Comparator: Tabasco® Sauce - A total of 10 participants at week 0 and week 8 will have Tabasco® Sauce present in 2-3 drops of water applied to their skin and covered in a light dressing. Tabasco® Sauce is an ideal placebo as the sensation to the skin is similar to a hookworm. All participants will undergo interventions of Gluten free diet, Gluten micro-challenge, Inadvertent gluten challenge and Moderate gluten challenge.

Experimental: Necator americanus-hookworm larvae L3-20 - A total of 10 participants at week 0 and week 8 will have medium dose hookworms present in 2-3 drops of water applied to their skin and then covered in a light dressing. The hookworms are Necator americanus-hookworm larvae L3; 20 L3 in 200 uL of deionized water presented in an Eppendorf tube. All participants will undergo interventions of Gluten free diet, Gluten micro-challenge, Inadvertent gluten challenge and Moderate gluten challenge. At week 42, participants will have the option of going on the liberal diet.


Other interventions: Gluten micro-challenge
From week 12 to week 24, all participants will start a gluten micro-challenge from 10mg/day for the first 2 weeks escalating over the this period to 50mg/day at the end of week 24.

Other interventions: Inadvertent gluten challenge
From week 24 to week 36, all participants will be on gluten 50mg/day and 1g twice weekly.

Other interventions: Moderate gluten challenge
From week 36 to week 42, all participants will be on gluten 2g/day.

Other interventions: Liberal diet
From week 42, all participants will be unblinded and those who have received hookworm therapy have the option to go on a liberal diet of more than 10g of gluten/day from week 42 to week 94.

Other interventions: Necator americanus-hookworm larvae L3-10
A total of 40 participants at week 0 and week 8 will have hookworms L3-10 present in 2-3 drops of water applied to their skin and then covered in a light dressing.

Other interventions: Tabasco® Sauce
Arm: Placebo Comparator: Tabasco® Sauce A total of 10 participants at week 0 and week 8 will have Tabasco® Sauce present in 2-3 drops of water applied to their skin and covered in a light dressing

Other interventions: Necator americanus-hookworm larvae L3-20
A total of 40 participants at week 0 and week 8 will have hookworms L3-20 present in 2-3 drops of water applied to their skin and then covered in a light dressing.

Other interventions: Gluten free diet
From week 0 to week 12, all participants will be on a gluten free diet.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is a Phase 1b multicentre, multinational, randomized, double-blind with
      single-blind arm and open label extension phase, placebo controlled, clinical trial
      evaluating the safety and predictability of an escalating gluten consumption to activate
      Coeliac Disease (CeD) in (a) a small cohort of people with diet-managed CeD treated with a
      placebo (n=10), and in (b) cohorts following low (L3-10; n=40) and medium (L3-20; n=10) dose
      hookworm inocula.

      The investigators 4 aims for the study are:

      Aim 1: Undertake a multiple-phase and escalating gluten challenge assessing safety to gluten
      exposure in hookworm-naïve and hookworm-infected people with CeD.

      Aim 2: This phase Ib study recognizes that the evidence supporting this novel intervention is
      rudimentary and addresses amongst others the following questions: (a) The importance of L3
      dose on Participant health, and (b) the importance of L3 dose on the safety of escalating
      gluten challenge and (c) the need for a comparator group should a phase II trial be
      warranted.

      Aim 3: Examine the changes in intestinal T cell responses induced by hookworm infection and
      gluten exposure.

      Aim 4: Assess the impact of hookworm infection and purified hookworm-derived proteins on
      gluten peptide-specific immune responses ex vivo.</summary>
