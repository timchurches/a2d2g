    <statisticalmethods>Patlak graphical analysis will be used to compute 18F-DOPA influx rate constants (Ki values)
fMRI data will be processed and analysed. Specifically, six spherical seed regions will be placed in the dorsal and ventral striatum to extract representing time courses of activity fluctuations in each sub-region. These time courses will be entered as covariates along with other signals modeling various noise sources in the data into a general linear model. This model will be fitted to each individuals functional data on a voxel-wise basis to identify regions showing significant functional connectivity with each striatal area. Group differences in striatal functional connectivity will be compared using two-sample t-tests. Effective connectivity within these networks will be modeled using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) an established fMRI procedure for inferring causal influences between neural systems. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Psychosis is a debilitating neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and cognitive and emotional disturbances. It is a defining characteristic of schizophrenia, and occurs frequently in other major mental illnesses such as depression and bipolar disorder. All current treatments for psychosis modulate levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA), and it is thought that DA  dysregulation within circuits linking frontal brain regions with a set of subcortical nuclei called the striatum (the so called frontostriatal circuits) is a final common pathway for the emergence of psychotic symptoms. Precisely how this dysregulation arises however, remains a mystery.
This study will be the first to combine Positron Emission Technology (PET) measures of striatal DA function with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measures of frontostriatal connectivity to investigate the way in which altered subcortical dopamine may give rise to, or arise from, aberrant frontostriatal connectivity.
The project has three specific aims:
1. characterise the direct relationship between PET markers of striatal DA function and fMRI measures of frontostriatal functional dysconnectivity;
2. determine whether striatal DA abnormalities are a cause or consequence of frontostriatal dysconnectivity; and
3. investigate the potential of these two phenotypes as clinical biomarkers by determining whether they can predict patients 12month clinical outcome.
We will recruit 50 First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients and 50 healthy controls to take part in the study. All participants will complete a clinical and brain imaging assessment at baseline. The brain imaging assessment will involve MRI and PET.
FEP patients will additionally complete a clinical assessment after a 12 month
followup period. No brain imaging will be conducted at this time. No followup of controls will be performed.
During the followup period, the research staff will maintain regular contact with the patients' clinical team. Information on treatments will be acquired, enabling us to account for variations in treatment protocols in our analyses.</summary>
