  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the intervention group will undergo an initial nutritional assessment via telephone within 2 days of receipt of referral from the treating consultant. Participants will receive individualised nutrition care in the form of weekly intensive nutrition assessment and nutrition intervention by the research dietitian via telephone contact interview or face to face interview if attending Monash Medical Centre and written nutritional education information regarding nutrition impact symptoms and dietary management.  Dietitian interviewers will try to ascertain information in the areas of; i) oral intake/food intake, ii) presence/absence of nutrition impact symptoms, iii) physical function, and iv) other relevant dietary information. The initial telephone call will last approximately 30 minutes as a detailed dietetic interview will be conducted.  Follow-up telephone calls are anticipated to last approximately 15 minutes.  Motivational interviewing techniques will be incorporated into the follow-up telephone calls to promote adherence to the recommended course of action. Oral nutritional supplement samples will be provided as required at the discretion of the treating dietitian. Patients will be consulted weekly for 18 weeks and then at week 26.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive usual nutrition care services. Usual nutrition care involves no dietetic input until the patient is admitted for surgery or chemotherapy.  A dietitian sees the patient at the point of surgery or commencement of chemotherapy.  A malnutrition screen (Malnutrition Screening Tool) is then completed at chemotherapy and patients scoring above the threshold of 2 are then referred for hospital based dietitian services.  These are individualized services of length and frequency at the discretion of the treating dietitian in response to their perception of patient need.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients under the care of Southern Health, Upper Gastro-intestinal Cancer consultants with a new diagnosis of histological proven oesophageal or stomach cancer who met the inclusion criteria will be referred to the Department of Dietetics, Monash Medical Centre, Clayton. Patients will be provided with a brief verbal description and information sheet of the project by their treating consultant.  Consultants will ask whether the participant is happy to be contacted by the research dietitian to have the project explained in further detail. A referral will be sent to the research dietitian by the consultant.
Agreeable participants will then be contacted by a research dietitian and will be provided with a full verbal description of the project via telephone.  Potential participants who agree to participate will be asked to provide verbal consent to participate in the trial via the telephone. Verbal consent will be recorded.

Consenting participants will receive in the mail a letter explaining the research, a withdrawal to consent form and written copies of survey-based outcome measures. If a participant decides to withdraw from the trial they will be asked to complete the withdrawal to consent form and return to a research dietitian. A research assistant will collect the information via telephone 2 days later.
Participants will then be randomised into the intervention or control group.  The method of randomization will be through use of opaque, consecutively numbered, sealed envelopes with the group allocation written on a piece of paper inside.</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation sequence will be constructed using a computer random number generator.  Randomisation will be stratified by diagnosis (oesophageal or stomach cancer).  Permuted blocks will also be used to help ensure relatively even numbers of participants between groups within strata.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the efficacy of an early and frequent nutrition intervention model, compared to usual care, for improving the quality of life in people with oesophageal or stomach cancer

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have cancer of the oesophagus or stomach and will have surgery and/or chemotherapy at Southern Health in Victoria.

Trial details
Participants will be i n two groups. One group will receive the usual dietetic consultation at the time of surgery or chemotherapy which involves a completing a malnutrition screening questionnaire and referral to hospital dietician services if appropriate. The other group will receive early (at the time of diagnosis) and frequent dietetic assessment. This will involve an initial telephone or face-to-face interview lasting at least 30 minutes and weekly follow-up telephone calls lasting 15 minutes for 18 weeks and then at week 26. Oral nutritional supplement samples will be given to participants at the discretion of the treating dietician.

The aim of the study is to compare the quality of life, nutritional status and patient satisfaction with dietetic intervention in the two groups.</summary>
