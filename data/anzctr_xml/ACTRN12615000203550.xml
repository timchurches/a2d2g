  <interventions>
    <interventions>Catheter-based renal denervation which is a medical procedure using a device. In this study, a multi-electrode catheter-based renal denervation system known as the EnligHTN System, is used.  The renal denervation catheter delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy through the wall of the blood vessels supplying the kidneys (renal arteries) in order to disrupt the sympathetic nerves that lead to the kidneys. Each electrode on the catheter may independently administer 8 W of power over 60 seconds per ablation set. The number of ablation sets is determined by the number and area of vessels to be treated. The average duration of the overall procedure is 1 to 2 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Treatment. The standard treatment employed in this study for people experiencing heart failure will be in accordance with the 2013 ACCF/AHA Heart Failure Guidelines. All participants will continue to receive optimal medical therapy for heart failure including anti-congestive heart failure (CHF) medications and lifestyle counselling. 

Control group participants will be maintained on medical therapy for 6 months. Once 6 month follow-up is complete, participants will have the option to undergo treatment with catheter-based renal denervation.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of renal denervation in heart failure patients using a multi-electrode catheter-based renal denervation system.

The primary safety endpoint is the occurrence of any serious adverse events (SAEs) attributed to the renal denervation procedure.  Such SAEs will include: renal artery dissection or perforation; serious groin site complication; reduced renal function or new renal artery stenosis.
</outcome>
      <timepoint> The primary safety analysis will be performed on  acute procedural Safety (incidence of renal artery dissection or perforation requiring intervention and incidence of serious groin complications); incidence of new renal artery stenosis at 6 months post procedure and reduction in renal function (defined as eGFR drop of &gt;25% in comparison to baseline) at 6 months post procedure.

    <concealment>Approximately 20 participants, with symptomatic congestive heart failure despite maximal medical treatment, will be enrolled in the study. Eligible participants will undergo screening procedures to determine individual suitability to undergo renal denervation.

    <designfeatures>Approximately 50% of the participants will be randomised to receive up-front treatment whilst the remaining 50% of participants act as the control group. After 6 months, the control group participants may cross-over to receive renal denervation treatment.
  </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>As a pilot study, the sample size is limited to 20 patients.  The study is designed to provide initial evidence of safety and demonstration of physiologic response.  The data from this 20 patient study may be used to provide information to  design and conduct a larger multi-center, controlled clinical trial, which will be performed to provide valid scientific and clinical evidence and reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective.  

All clinical test results will be listed and summarized by treatment and time with appropriate descriptive statistics (number of observations, mean and standard deviation (SD) or median with minimum and maximum) for continuous measures. Nominal and ordinal scale measures will be summarized with frequency tables, and percentages, as appropriate.

Demographic data, medical history, concomitant disease and concomitant medication will be summarized by means of descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) or frequency tables, stratified by treatment.

Review of safety tables, listings and figures will be performed by a designated medical monitor. The safety tables will allow a view of changes from baseline in findings from 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory values, and adverse events. No statistical testing will be executed for safety measures. 

The efficacy endpoints of TTE parameters, time to MACCE, 6-Minute Hall Walk, NYHA class, metabolic and renal function, Pro BNP, blood pressure and quality of life survey scores will be compared at baseline and at 6 months using a paired t-test.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Renal Denervation in Heart Failure (RDN HF) is a physician-initiated pilot study involving staff of the Cardiology, Radiology and Nephrology Departments of the John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, NSW. 

RDN HF is a first-in-human clinical trial of catheter-based renal denervation in heart failure patients. It uses a TGA approved device called the EnligHTN System, manufactiured by St Jude Medical. 

The study aims to evaluate the safety of renal denervation using the device and the effectiveness of the technique in improving the symptoms of heart failure.

This is a prospective, randomised, controlled single centre study that will enrol approximately 20 participants with symptomatic congestive heart failure despite maximal medical treatment.</summary>
