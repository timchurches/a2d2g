  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational study which will evaluate participants dietary intake, weight status and taste sensitivity (taste detection threshold, supra-intensity rating and preference testing). This data will be compared with allelic variation and expression of genes involved in taste from tissue collected from blood and the oral cavity. Participants will be required for a minimum of 4 testing session, which will take place over a one month period, and each testing session will be seperated by at least 24 hours. Visit 1 will provide participants with information about the study, body measurments will be completed (weight, height, waist circumference and papillae density) and blood will be drawn (participants will attend after an overnight fast) - total time for visit 1 will be 1.5 hours. Visit 2 and 3 will collect the same data with each visit being 2.5 hours each. Participants will first provide oral samples though a non-invasive scraping technique, followed by tasting of sensory samples to determine individual sweet and fat taste measures (taste detection threshold, supra intensity ratings and preference testing). Particiapants will attend visits 2 and 3 after a 2 hour fast. During visit 4, 4-6 tastebuds will be collected from the anterior of the tongue by a medical practitioner after a 2 hour fast - total time of visit 1 hour. Additionally, a subset of particpants (n=10 - half lean half obese) will be required for a single visit (4 hours) to assess breath volatiles after the consumption of an lipid emulsion beverage. Participants will be tested after a overnight fast, and breath volatiles measured every 30-45min.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Taste sensitivity measures for sweet and fat taste using taste detection thresholds, supra-treshold intensity ratings and preference testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All testing procedures will be measured in duplicate, once during both visit 2 and 3, which will be seperated by at least 24 hours. Taste measures will be compared with all secondary outcomes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dietary intake of participants through the use of a 4-day weighed food diary to assess macro- and micro-nutrient intake.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4-day weighed food diary will be completed during the study (but not on days of testing sessions). Information about the weighed food diary will be given during the first visit, along with the food diary and weigh scales. Participants will record all food and drink consumed on any 3 week days and 1 weekend day over the course of the 4 week testing procedure (therefore, total of 4 days of food intake will be measured).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Analysis of genetic variants and gene expression of genes associated with both sweet and fat taste from samples collected from blood (genetic variants and gene expression) and oral tissue (gene expression).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood and oral taste tissue will be collected first during both visits 2 and 3 after fasting for at least 2 hours and prior to taste sensitivity measures.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anthropometric data (weight, height and waist circumference) will be collected from participants. Weight will be measured using dedicated scales (in Kg), height will be measured using a stadiometer (cm) and waist circumference using a measuring tape (cm). BMI will be calculated based on the weight and height of each participant (BMI=weight(Kg)/height(cm)^2</outcome>
      <timepoint>Anthropometric data will be collected during the first testing session.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fungiform papillae count will be completed by counting the number of taste papillae within a 6mm area on the anterior tongue. The fungiform papillea count is a measure of the amount of a participants taste tissue.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fungiform papillae count will be collected during the first testing session.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Analysis of breath volatiles after consumption of lipid beverage emulsion. Participants (half lean and half obese) will consume a lipid beverage after an overnight fast and breath volatiles will be measured at base line and over four hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Testing will be seperated by at least 24 hours and will be completed between visits 1 and 2. Particpants (n=10) will consume the lipid beverage after an overnight fast and breath volitiles will be measured every 30-45mins for 4 hours.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Analysis of satiety markers and inflammatory markers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Satiety and inflammatory markers will be assessed from blood collected during the visit 1 after an overnight fast.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
