    <statisticalmethods>Based on our primary outcome of anxiety as measured by using Beck Anxiety Inventory  (BAI), a sample size of 56 in each group will have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 5.0 assuming that the common standard deviation is 9.3 using a two group t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Since outcome is being measured at baseline and post-intervention, use baseline adjustment reduces the required sample size. Namely, the required sample size is (1  r2) n where r is the correlation between baseline and post-intervention readings, and n is the above sample size from a simple t-test. Assuming r = 0.5, then the required sample size per group is 0.75n, ie 42 per group. Allowing for 15% withdrawal, we therefore aim to recruit 50 patients per treatment arm.

Descriptive statistics, response rates and follow-up prevalence of anxiety will be calculated. The primary hypothesis comparing prevalence of anxiety after 4 months by treatment arm will be undertaken using a two-sided chi-squared test. A log binomial GLM model will be used to explore changes in anxiety levels over time as part of secondary analyses. The results presented will follow the Consort Statement Performa, and will be on an intention to treat basis. The statistical package STATA 11 and SPSS 19, with intention to treat, will be used for all analyses. Imbalances in all outcome measures at baseline will be controlled using linier regression modeling</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An association between increased dyspnoea scores, mood disorders and anxiety levels in patients with COPD has been well established. On a neurochemical level, this association has been further explained in rat models showing that prolonged hypoxia affects the areas of the brain involved in mood control. The understanding of mechanisms of mood control by antidepressants has evolved over time. The strong antidepressant activity of Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) has supported the role of both norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT) in mood disorders. The next generation of antidepressants included the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitos (SSRIs), further supporting the role of serotonin. Furthermore, antidepressants have been hypothesised to work in COPD patients by decreasing autonomic over-activity, or detaching excessive distress associated with COPD, thus enabling patients to better endure increased physical activity and physiological changes.

Hence, our hypothesis is that subjects recruited from public hospitals with COPD and clinically significant depression and/or anxiety that are given paroxetine 20 mgs daily  for 4 months will:

(Hypothesis 1: principle hypothesis): have a significant reduction in their anxiety symptoms as compared with the placebo at 4 months follow-up, and;

(Hypothesis 2): these improved levels of anxiety will be associated with:
improved quality of life and exercise capacity, and

(Hypothesis 3): these improved levels of anxiety will be associated with:
a.) a reduction in hospital bed utilisation, and;
b.) a reduction in health care costs in relation to existing practice in long term (12 months)
