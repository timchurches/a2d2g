  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised trial where participants with dysfunctional haemodialysis access are assessed by pre-treatment duplex ultrasound. Patients will assessed, counselled and consented by the same vascular team.
They will then be allocated to receiving percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with either paclitaxel coated balloon or plain ( control) balloon.  
A single one-off intervention will be performed the same vascular surgeon in the vascular operating theatre in the same hospital. Surgical techniques will be standardised, performed under local anaesthetic, diagnostic angiogram performed and the appropriate sized balloon inflated to 1 minute to nominal pressure. For device failure, further angioplasty is performed with introduction of a high-pressure balloon of appropriate size and inflation to appropriate pressure for three minutes. In case of a flow-limiting dissection, a bare metal nitinol stent of appropriate size is introduced and placed; and in case of a rupture, a covered stent of appropriate size is introduced and placed. A post-procedure angiogram is performed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dysfunction haemodialysis access is one of the common problems encountered in renal patients. Endovenous intervention with plain balloon angioplasty is one of the common and  effective methods to maintain the arteriovenous flow with high success rate. However, the patency rate is low from six months onwards. Repeated interventions on these patients create morbidity and also increases the financial burden on the hospital. Drug eluting balloon may help to reduce the re-stenosis rate and hence lower the morbidity to patients and reduce the cost. 

The purpose of this study is to compare the target lesion primary patency rate at 12 months between paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) vs plain balloon angioplasty (BA) for the treatment of venous stenoses of the dysfunctional vascular access patients undergoing haemodialysis</summary>
