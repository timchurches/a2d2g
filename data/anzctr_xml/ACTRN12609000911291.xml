      <outcome>Cardiovascular Events (myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, coronary vascularization procedures, sudden cardiac death, stroke, peripheral artery disease, pulmonary embolism, and thromboses (shunt thromboses were not regarded as an endpoint))
Assessment:
Cardiovascular events were identified by reviewing medical records and by consultation with the responsible physicians. Myocardial infarction was diagnosed if at least two of the following criteria had been fulfilled according to standard procedures: clinical status, elevated laboratory parameters (myocardium-specific enzymes, myoglobin), and changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Catheterization was performed in cases of suspected myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris. Surgical revascularization was carried out after myocardial infarction, in unstable angina pectoris, or where clinical signs had been detected by catheterization and the patients general conditions permitted surgery. Strokes and ischemic insults were verified by computer tomography (CT). Peripheral artery disease was diagnosed according to Fontaines stages or on the basis of by angiographically or sonographically detected &gt;50% stenoses in major arteries and of the lower limbs.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In observational studies hyperhomocysteinemia has been found to be associated with risk for total mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage renal disease. These patients have grossly elevated homocysteine levels that can be lowered by supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12. 
We therefore conducted a randomized clinical trial with B-vitamins to reduce homocysteine levels and therefore also cardiovascular events and total mortality.</summary>
