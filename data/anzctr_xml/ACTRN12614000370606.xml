  <interventions>
    <interventions>For the duration of the trial (6 months), patients in the detoxification ward will be allowed access to E-cigarettes containing nicotine, whilst they are in hospital. They will also have access to more usual forms of nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum).  The choice will be entirely theirs. Patients are usually admitted to the detoxification ward for up to a week, so that the duration of the intervention for each patient will be 5-7 days, . </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients choosing not to use E-cigarettes during the same 6 month trial period. 
Comparable previous group of patients coming to the ward in the 6 months prior to the trial start. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>No of cigarettes smoked while on the ward decreases, assessed by questionnaire supplied to patient on entry into the trial, and collected on leaving the ward.
Nursing and clinical staff will also be assessing differences in their workload, once e-cigarettes are available, and compiling their observations. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Recorded daily by the patient while in the detoxification ward.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient data on cigarettes smoked will be assessed  by P Truman for statistically significant reductions in smoking behaviour. It is anticipated that missing data may preclude any strong statistical conclusions from being drawn. However, a strong trend is likely. 
Patient and clinician/nursing impressions and comments will also be collated and assessed.  Unless there is a strong favorable reaction from the staff it is unlikely that E-cigarettes are making a strong impact on patient welfare, whatever the patients themselves report. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Questionnaire data from patients before they leave the detoxification ward (usual duration of stay 5 days to 1 week) plus  monthly discussions amongst clinical staff during and immediately after the project</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study hypothesis is that availability of E-cigarettes for heavy smokers, in hospital for detoxification for other drug use, will help them refrain from smoking while in hospital, will reduce their stress, and will aid treatment.
We will make E-cigarettes available, and see whether patients using them are able to refrain from smoking. We will gather patient and clinical impressions, and make a decision as to whether further, and more extensive study is warranted.  </summary>
