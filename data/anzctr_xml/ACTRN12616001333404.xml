  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention = Early initiation of discussions regarding a palliative approach to care.

Intervention Procedures = The early initiation of a palliative approach to care will involve the addition of sensitive discussions with participants and their nominated close associates on themes of prognosis, disease trajectory, palliative care, doctor-patient relationships and advanced care directives, in addition to standard care. This intervention will occur immediately post study randomisation into the intervention arm of the study independent of time since diagnosis.

Intervention Materials = Discussions will be guided using Intervention Checklists and written patient information booklets will be provided to participants. 

Mode of delivery and location of intervention = 1x face-to-face session at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital which will require attendance at the clinic for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes (this will include time for the completion of paperwork and questionnaires and for the interventional discussion of duration = 45 minutes) and 1x follow-up phone call at 1 month after initial face-to-face session of duration no greater than 15 minutes.

Who will deliver intervention = The intervention will be delivered by a member of the study team. This will be a medical student who has completed palliative care on-line training modules, a doctor or a nurse.

How intervention is personalised or adapted = As occurs in real-life settings participants will be first asked for consent before discussing any topics.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care alone. 

In this study standard care is defined as the usual standard of care being offered to patients with heart failure at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. This involves being under the care of a treating cardiologist, attending clinic appointments booked at the discretion of the treating cardiologist, hospital admissions when required, usual access to allied health services, management by the Cardiac Rehabilitation and Heart Failure service and usual utilisation of General Practice care. Standard care does not exclude involvement in formalised palliative care if requested by patients or their usual treating team. However, involvement in such a service will be recorded for study results discussion. 

Participants receiving standard care alone will not be offered the intervention discussion as part of the study, but will not be discouraged from having discussions on similar topics with their usual health care team.</comparator>

    <inclusivecriteria>The study will enrol men and women greater than or equal to 18 years old who are under the care of the Cardiovascular Medicine Department, at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth WA, with a diagnosis or past diagnosis of chronic non-valvular heart failure of NYHA classification III or IV. 
Close associates nominated by patients will also be invited to be involved in the study (these close associates may be healthy volunteers and must be greater than or equal to 18 years old).

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 90 patients is required to have an 80% chance of detecting an increase in the primary outcome measure of 10 points of difference in the FACIT-Pal questionnaire for quality of life with statistical significance at the 5% level. This is a pilot study in patients with heart failure so sample size has been approximated from a study in patients with cancer. This calculation of sample size was based on a standard deviation of 16.74 which was the mean standard deviation of the two groups in a study by Bakitas and colleagues 10 which used the FACIT-Pal questionnaire to evaluate quality of life in oncology patients. The calculation was made using the Power (Sample Size) Calculator for Continuous outcome superiority trials provided online by Sealed Envelope Ltd (https://www.sealedenvelope.com/power/continuous-superiority/).

Analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22. Baseline variables will be analysed to assess adequacy of randomisation. Continuous variables will be assessed by ANOVA. Categorical variables will be compared by Chi-square for proportions and logistic regression. Non-parametric analyses will be used where appropriate for small samples or non-normally distributed data. Subject data will be assessed on an as randomised basis.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to determine how different information discussed with, or given to, people suffering with heart failure might affect their quality of life, mood and overall well-being. Studies in this area of research may improve our understanding of how best to provide information and a palliative approach to care patients for with heart failure.</summary>
