  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study treatment is open label Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) vs. Histamine-2 Receptor Blockers (H2RBs) as the default routine therapy for ulcer prophylaxis. Each study ICU will use PPIs or H2RBs as routine therapy for a period of six months.  At the end of this six month period, the ICU will then swap to the opposite routine ulcer prophylaxis strategy which will then be used for the next six months.  The specific PPI or H2RB, dose, mode of administration and duration of study treatment will be the individual ICU clinicians decision or until the patient is discharged from ICU (whichever is shorter).  The PPI and H2RBs will be given as per routine medication (usually by the ICU nurse).  Study treatment will only be administered in situations where the treating clinician believes ulcer prophylaxis is in the patients best interests and, irrespective of the treatment assigned to the ICU, either a PPI or an H2RB can be used for an individual patient, if the treating clinician believes that a particular treatment is indicated. Intervention adherence will not be checked for individual patients; however once a month, at a set time, stress ulcer prophylaxis use will be recorded for all mechanically ventilated patients.</interventions>
    <comparator>We are comparing PPIs with H2RBs.  Both medications are considered standard treatment for ulcer prophylaxis in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, so neither is considered to be the control.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>The primary data repository for this study is the ANZICS APD.  This established registry identifies each individual patient by a unique number.

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Analyses of the primary composite endpoint will involve cluster (ICU) summary measures obtained by aggregating the composite endpoint to a rate per ICU per time period and calculating the difference in event rates between the first and second periods for each ICU. These differences will then be entered as the dependent variable into an unweighted linear regression with randomised sequence as the independent variable, from which the coefficient of the randomised sequence is then the estimated PPI versus H2RB difference. Such analyses appropriately control for all clustering effects within ICU and common secular time trends across ICUs. Uncertainty concerning treatment effects will be estimated using standard 95% confidence intervals. For secondary outcomes on a binary scale the same methods will apply, and for outcomes on a continuous scale the linear mixed model methods of Turner et al will be applied. Sensitivity analyses will be performed for the impact of patients with missing outcome data using multiple imputation methods.  Analyses will be performed using the Stata software package (StataCorp, Texas, USA).

Our planned sample size of approximately 25360 patients will provide 90% power to detect a 2.4% absolute difference in our composite endpoint in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.  This sample size is based on a baseline composite endpoint rate of 12.0% with 40 participating ICUs enrolling an average of 317 patients per 6 month study period with a coefficient of variation of 0.60 in numbers of patients per cluster per period.  It incorporates a within-cluster-within-period correlation of 0.030 and within-cluster-between-period correlation of 0.024, as observed in the ANZICS APD in 2013 for duration of mechanical ventilation &gt;10 days, which is the most frequent component of the composite endpoint.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients who require treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) can develop stomach ulcers or duodenal (small intestine) ulcers.  This occurs most commonly when life support (a breathing machine) is required or when the patient develops a bleeding tendency as a result of their illness.  These kinds of ulcers are known as stress ulcers and may cause life-threatening bleeding.  Patients who require life support in the ICU are typically given one of two types of medicine to try and prevent the development of stress ulcers.  The two types of medicines are called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2RBs).  While the prevention of stress ulcers is very important, the medicines used to prevent ulcers may have important side effects including an increased risk of developing certain kinds of infections.  The risk of side effects may depend on the medication used. This study will establish which of the two types of medicines that are commonly used for stress ulcer prophylaxis in ICU patients who require life support leads to the lowest risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and Clostridium difficile infection.     The study will use a design known as a cluster crossover registry design. In this type of study, data are collected primarily from existing data sources rather than the medical records of individual patients. There will be two study treatment periods. During the first treatment period, half of the participating ICUs will be randomly (like the toss of a coin) instructed to use PPIs for stress ulcer prophylaxis in patients who require life-support while the other half will use H2RBs. During the second treatment period each ICU will swap to using the opposite treatment. This means that, in situations where PPIs and H2RBs are regarded as being equivalent by the treating clinician, the treatment administered to the patients will be determined based on the treatment assigned to the patients ICU. However, if there is a specific indication for either PPI treatment or H2RB treatment (for example, an allergy), the treatment indicated for the particular patient concerned will be administered irrespective of the treatment assigned to the ICU. </summary>
