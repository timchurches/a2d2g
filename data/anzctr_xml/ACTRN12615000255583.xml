  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial will test the acute effect and dose-response of 2 doses of cocoa  (Dose 1: 2 tablets: 6116 mg Theobroma cacao seed extract standardised to 500 mg catechins polyphenols and 11.12 mg theobromine; Dose 2: 4 tablets containing 1g of catechins polyphenols and 22.24 mg theobromine) compared to flavanols-free placebo on cognition using the computerised SUCCAB test battery in a middle aged population in the NIIM cognitive function lab. On Day 1, after baseline assessment cocoa or placebo tablets will be given to participants, and cognition will be tested on 2 hours after ingestion of the trial tablets. Cognitive assessment will be repeated 4 weeks later on the same participants using a different dose of cocoa. </interventions>

    <concealment>Recruitment: In the first instance we will contact past trial participants, who agreed to be contacted again to be invited to participate in a trial at NIIM. In addition, we will distribute flyers in letterboxes in the local area, as this recruitment strategy has worked well in the last trial (30% of participants had been recruited through letterbox drop).
Allocation: Cocoa tablets and placebo tablets will be matched in colour, size, and number (Dose 1 = 2 tablets; Dose 2 = 4 tablets), and packaged in identical containers labelled consecutively.

</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisations will be conducted using a computer-generated random number table by an independent researcher not involved in data collection. We will undertake two randomisations: Randomisation 1: Participants will be randomly allocated to either dose 1 or placebo on day 1;  Randomisation 2: Participants will be randomly allocated to either dose 2 or placebo on day 28</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Primary outcome will be cognitive function in accuracy and speed using the SUCCAB test battery (30 minutes) at 2 hours after ingestion of cocoa tablets (Dose 1) or placebo on Day 1, and at 4 weeks ingestion of cocoa tablets (Dose 2) compared to baseline. Cocoa tablets will be analysed for flavanols and theobromine content.
Secondary outcome will be assessment of mood, mental fatigue, and stress using the Bond-Lader Visual Analogue Mood Scale and the Spielberger State Anxiety Trait Inventory (STAIT) before and after each testing session.
All comparisons will be made using ANOVA and t-tests.

A sample size of 40 participants (20 in each group in part 1 and in part 2) was calculated based on the following assumptions: 
a) To detect a difference of 57 Â± 90 msec in the working memory reaction time test of the SUCCAB test battery with a power of 80% and 95% confidence (Macpherson H et al Psychopharmacology 2012, 220: 351-365)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cocoa flavanols have been associated with several health benefits including cardiovascular and cognitive functions. Cocoa flavanols increase the formation of endothelial nitric oxide, responsible for the increased blood flow and improved cardiovascular and vascular function.

A small number of studies have tested the acute effect of cocoa on cognitive function, demonstrating benefits on alertness, fatigue, and mood using a cognitively demanding test in a population of young students. While early studies used high-flavanol cocoa powder compared with low-flavanol powder as control, a truly double-blind design using cocoa versus non-flavanol containing placebo tablets have been tested in a previous study undertaken by this team, eliminating potential confounding of low-dose flavanol products.
While the team's previous study tested a population of young students (mean age = 23 years), the proposed project aims to explore an older population (mean age = 60 years) using the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB) test, assessing speed and accuracy, which has been shown to correlate to cognitive decline through ageing.
the study will test the hypothesis whether an acute dose of cocoa improves cognitive function in a middle aged population.</summary>
