  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cryoablation will be performed using the Arctic Front device (Medtronic, St Paul, MN, USA) and Enquiry mapping catheter. This device is inflated within each vein orifice. The current recommended approach is to perform two 4 minute inflations within each pulmonary vein with additional freezes if electrical isolation has not been achieved. A 28mm balloon will be used where possible. The procedural end point will be durable (&gt;30minutes) electrical isolation of all pulmonary veins.</interventions>
    <comparator>Percutaneous catheter ablation will be performed using irrigated radiofrequency catheters and guided by an electroanatomical mapping system.  The single ring technique will be used to isolate all four veins and the posterior left atrium. This creates a wider isolation compared to that produced by the cryoablation balloon. The procedural end point will be durable (&gt;30minutes) electrical isolation of the entire posterior wall including the pulmonary veins.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size required to have an 80% statistical power to resolve a 20% greater efficacy in achieving the primary outcome of arrhythmia free survival from atrial fibrillation with single ring isolation compared to cryoballoon ablation is 182 (91 in each arm). Assuming a loss to follow up rate of up to 15%, we therefore aim to recruit 220 patients.

The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of the primary endpoint for each group and the log-rank test used to compare the distributions between the treatment groups. Possible covariates will be evaluated using a proportional hazard model. The Chi-square test will be used to test the secondary outcomes. Descriptive measures and a repeated measures ANOVA will be performed on the QOL measures. Analysis will be performed on groups as originally assigned using an intention to treat analysis approach. Further analysis will be performed on an as treated basis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder and develops in 20-25% of people over their lifetime. The initial treatment has been medication therapy, however in the past decade, a catheter ablation procedure called pulmonary vein isolation has become increasingly widely practiced and is more effective than medical therapy at treating AF. This is performed by introducing catheters via the groin veins to the heart. There are two methods available in Australia for performing this procedure which aims to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the rest of the left atrium to which they connect in the heart as these usually contain abnormal foci that trigger the initiation of AF. The first of the two methods utilises radiofrequency ablation to create burns to the inside of the left atrium to encircle the pulmonary veins and the back wall of the left atrium. From a recent randomised clinical trial, we have found that the use of a large single ring was better than the conventional two separate rings in preventing the recurrence of AF. The second method uses more recent technology and involves a cryoballoon catheter that freezes the tissues around the pulmonary veins to achieve the same effect. Recent studies of this technique has shown it to be a safe and effective means of performing pulmonary vein isolation. It is not known which of the two procedures is more effective. We aim in the present randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the relative efficacy and safety of the two procedures.</summary>
