  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects with low back pain and healthy controls were assessed in three consecutive days: their lumbar multifidus muscle and transverse abdominal muscle thickness were measured by ultrasound at rest and during contraction. During measuring the thickness of transverse abdominal muscle, subjects were in supine position, and the measurements were taken at rest and while draw in their anterior abdominal wall. The measurement of lumbar multifidus muscle was taken while subject were in prone position at rest and while lifting the contralateral arm. The assessment lasted about 10 minutes per subject. Two raters, blinded to each other's measurements, assessed all the subjects on all 3 days</interventions>

    <summary>Study design: Two-group repeated-measures reliability study 
Objectives: Determine inter- and intra-rater reliability of ultrasound (US) measurements of transverse abdominis (TrA) and lumbar multifidus (LM) thickness during rest and contraction by an experienced and a novice raters.
Background: No previous reliability study included larger samples of low back pain (LBP) and healthy subjects, assessed thickness of TrA and LM during rest and contraction, over several days, and by raters with different experience.
Methods:  Two blinded raters measured TrA and LM thickness in 42 healthy and 56 LBP subjects during rest and contraction over 3 consecutive days. The thickness change from rest to contraction was also calculated (%).  Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,k) and 95% minimal detectable differences (MDC95) were derived.
Results: Inter-rater ICC2,1 for single-measure muscle thickness were 0.71-0.87 for LBP subjects and 0.94-1.0 for healthy subjects.  The inter-rater ICC2,3 for averaged measures over 3 days were similar (LBP 0.73-0.84, healthy 0.93-1.0).  Both single-measure ICC2,1 and average-measure ICC2,3 were lower for the relative thickness change (0.61-0.96). Intra-rater ICC2,1 across 3 days were high for both raters (LBP 0.95-1.00, healthy 0.93-1.00), albeit lower for the relative thickness change (0.79-0.99). The MDC95 were &lt;10% of the respective muscle thickness means.
Conclusion: Good-to-excellent reliability was found for US measurements of TrA and LM muscle thickness performed by the experienced and novice raters in subjects with and without LBP.  One-time thickness measurements appear sufficient. The estimates of absolute measurement error (MDC95) indicate that &gt;10% difference in muscle thickness may be considered true change over time.
