  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus are two prevalent medical
      conditions with significant associated cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Research indicates that the prevalence of OSA is increased in diabetic patients
      when compared with normoglycemic patients and that OSA is independently associated with type
      2 diabetes. Further research suggests that effective treatment of the OSA with continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves insulin responsiveness in both non-diabetic OSA
      patients and diabetic-OSA patients. We are proposing a clinical trial to evaluate the impact
      of 6 months of CPAP therapy on glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients with OSA.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of CPAP in improving
      glycemic control (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetic patients with newly diagnosed OSA. Secondary
      objectives of this study include: assessment of fasting and post prandial glucose,
      determination as to whether there are any biochemical markers for OSA in the type 2 diabetic
      population; assessment of any improvements in cardiovascular outcomes; evaluation of any
      improvement in quality of life. Patients with OSA will be randomized into one of two groups:
      either a CPAP treatment group or a non-treatment group. Patients will be followed at 3 months
      and 6 months with collection of various lab tests to assess glycemic control.</summary>
