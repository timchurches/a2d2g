  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy or more commonly known as the McKenzie method - This is a system of exercises and manual therapy that uses repeated end range lumbar spine movements that promote a reduction in pain from its most distal point on the limb towards the centre of the back.  The exercises are done in a specific direction (for example lumbar extension) which has been determined by a trained therapist during the patient assessment. Following the consultation the patient is asked to perform these exercises at home and implement postural correction 5 to 6 times per day for a few minutes each time.  The patient is required to attend for regular reviews as clinically warranted.  The patient may attend for a maximum of 12 treatments over an 8 week period.  Each session may last up to 30 minutes.

Arm 2: motor control exercises - These are exercises that are specifically designed to improve the co-ordination of the trunk muscles.  They are given under the guidance of a Physiotherapist who has been trained in there implementation.  They are initially done in the lying position and as able are progressed to be done in sitting, standing and functional activities.  Patients will receive what is clinically required as decided by the therapist.  Patients may receive up to 12 sessions over an 8 week period.  Each session may last up to 30 minutes. Patients will be given a home exercise program to practice at home for 30 minutes each day.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of flare ups following discharge and how the patient self managed the flare up.  Patients may choose to be emailed or phoned by a research assistant to ask questions regarding weather they have had a flare up of there symptoms since being discharged from active treatment.  A flare up is defined as an increase in pain of more than 2 points on a 10 point scale over the last week.  If they had a flare up they will be asked questions on how they managed these symptoms. and if they needed to consult a health practitioner.</outcome>

    <concealment>Patients must read the patient information booklet then sign the consent form. 

They are then assessed by a qualified Physiotherapist which includes a complete subjective and objective examination 

The findings of the lumbar movement testing section are then assessed to see if the patient demonstrates centralisation or directional preference of there symptoms. If this is identified from the examination the patient is then included  

Allocation is done by a blinded person opening a sequentially numbered and sealed envelope</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Once a patient has been included, before they are allocated to a treatment arm they must under go an examination using a real time ultras sound machine to obtain images of there lower abdominal muscles.   While the scan is being done the patient must perform simple lower limb exercises in a specially built frame to activate the lower abdominal muscles so they can be identified by the operator of the ultra sound scanner.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect that the McKenzie method or lower abdominal exercises have on the thickness of the lower abdominal muscles in patients who have chronic low back pain when measured from images taken from real time ultrasound scans.  We believe that patients who receive specific lower abdominal exercises will show an increase in thickness of these muscles while those who receive the McKenzie method will not show any thickening of these muscles, while pain and disability will improve similarly in both groups.</summary>
