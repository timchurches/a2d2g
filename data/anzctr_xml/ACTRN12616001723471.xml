  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prophylactic oral antibiotics: For up to 12 months.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) 160mg/800mg once daily tablet. 
For patients with hypersensitivity to co-trimoxazole, doxycycline 100mg once daily tablet. 
If a participant on the antibiotic arm has a Grade 3 or higher infectious complication, he/she will be discontinued on the treatment arm and be allowed to cross-over into the Ig (IVIg/SCIg) arm. Patients will not come off study. Data about such an event will be collected using a specific case report form. The decision to discontinue treatment will be made by the treating clinician
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is standard care treatment with IVIg or SCIg for up to 12 months
IVIg:
In accordance with National (Australian) Criteria for the Clinical Use of IVIg in Australia. Monthly (every 4 weeks +/- 1 week) dose starting at 0.4g/kg, modified to achieve an IgG trough level of at least lower limit of serum IgG reference range.  In the first month of therapy, if IgG &lt; 4g/L then an additional (loading) dose of 0.4g/kg may be given at the clinicians discretion.
SCIg: 
Subcutaneous immunoglobulin weekly may be used in patients who meet local criteria for home-based self-administration in centres with established SCIg programs.  A loading IVIg dose may be given in the first month if required.  Thereafter, dosing at 100mg/kg/week, modified to achieve an IgG steady state level of at least the lower limit of the serum reference range.  Study participants may transition to or from IVIg to SCIg, using a conversion factor of 1:1 for total monthly IV to SC dosing.   Where the term IVIg is used in this protocol, unless explicitly stated, it shall be taken to include SCIg.
For patients on Ig who have a Grade 3 or higher infectious complication, their treatment will be according to usual standard care. If patients have a grade 3-4 adverse event they will be discontinued on allocated treatment. Patients will not come off study and will continue to have data collected. The decision to discontinue or change treatment will be made by the treating clinician. </comparator>

Our chosen sample size (n=60) is based on primary outcome of proportion of participants (alive) who remain on assigned treatment arm at 12 months following randomisation.
With a sample size of 60 patients (40 in the antibiotic arm and 20 in the IVIg arm), we will be able to estimate an adherence rate to the protocol of 80% to within a 95% confidence interval of +/- 10%.
Our cautious estimate is for 1-2 patients/month per site, allowing recruitment of 60 participants over 12-18 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine whether oral antibiotics can be used instead of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) to reduce the risk of infections in people with blood cancers. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have an acquired hypogammaglobulinaemia secondary to a haematological malignancy.

Study details
Participants will be randomised (allocated by chance) to one of two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio meaning that you are twice as likely to receive intervention treatment. Participants in one group (intervention) will receive co-trimoxazole (Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) 160mg/800mg orally once a day or doxycycline 100mg once daily for those hypersensitive to co-trimoxazole. Participants in the second group (control) will receive standard care treatment with intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIg or SCIg) in accordance with national Criteria: Monthly (every 4 weeks +/- 1 week) dose of 0.4g/kg, modified to achieve an IgG trough level of at least lower limit of age specific serum IgG reference range. 

The duration of each treatment is for 12 months from study entry, or until the treating physician determines that the patient should come off the treatment.

The following data will be collected: Patient demographics (age, gender, diagnosis, stage of disease), baseline investigations (including IgG levels), grade 3 or 4 infections and other clinically significant infections  at monthly intervals for 12 months. 

This project aims to improve how we use IVIg in Australia by asking: Are prophylactic (preventive) oral antibiotics equivalent to immunoglobulin
