    <interventions>We evaluated 40 participants. Tests were used to assess receptive and expressive vocabulary. Each participant was seen in 4 sessions of 50 minutes each.
The same evaluator applied the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the Test ABFW Language of children - Vocabulary Part B, all participants in the evaluation sessions.
Each participant was seen in 4 sessions of 50 minutes each, one on one with a therapist, one session per week over 4 weeks</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group consisted of 20 typically developing children and those submitted to the same assessment procedures that children with Down syndrome. The control children were matched with children with Down syndrome through sex and mental age.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: To check the lexical performance, receptive and expressive children with DS and compare it with the lexical performance of typically developing children matched for sex and mental age. Methods: The study included 40 children, 20 with Down syndrome (experimental group - EG), of both sexes, with age varying between 36 and 71 months and 20 typically developing children (control group - CG) and matched according to sex age and mental (psychological assessment instrument with the new version of the Stanford-Binet method, adapted by Terman and Merrill) in EG. After signing the consent by the guardians, they responded to an interview protocol containing information about the previous life of the participant. The evaluation was made by applying Test Peabody Picture Vocabulary (PPVT), which assesses receptive vocabulary, and Vocabulary Test ABFW - Vocabulary Part B, which assesses expressive vocabulary. Results: Participants in the EG had underperformed in the GC and the PPVT verbal description ABFW usual, with significant differences. There was a correlation between performance on receptive and expressive vocabulary of both groups. Conclusion: We found that the lexical performance, receptive and expressive children with DS is lower than typically developing children, even when matched for mental age.</summary>
