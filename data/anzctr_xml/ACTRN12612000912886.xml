  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial aims to show that a drink containing protein and a mix of protein and soluble fibre (guar) slows starch hydrolysis and absorption of glucose.  

On each of the 4 test days participants will attend the research centre at 9am having fasted overnight for 12 hours. On the first test day a continuous glucose monitor will be inserted. It will remain in place for 5 days and calibrated daily using fingerprick glucoses 4 times/day. 

On each test day participants will be fed a morning meal consisting of 4 slices of white bread (50g of carbohydrate) with 5g jam on each slice. No fat topping will be provided.  On two occasions the bread and jam will be preceeded by 150ml of water (control) and on the other 2 occasions preceeded by a 150ml drink containing 20g protein plus 5 g guar (treatment). The drink (control or treatment) will be taken 15 minutes before consuming the bread and jam.

The tests will be performed across four consecutive days with 12 volunteers, with the first two days randomised to treatment or control, and the second two days randomised to treatment or control.</interventions>
