          5. Suspected aortic dissection based on medical history and CTA/MRA

             anterior circulation/vertebrobasilar system) as confirmed on CTA/MRA, or clinical

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the hypothesis that Trevo thrombectomy plus medical
      management leads to superior clinical outcomes at 90 days as compared to medical management
      alone in appropriately selected subjects experiencing an acute ischemic stroke when treatment
      is initiated within 6-24 hours after last seen well.</summary>
