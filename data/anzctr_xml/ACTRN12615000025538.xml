  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device failure (due to occlusion and/or infiltration).

PIVC occlusions may be thrombotic or nonthrombotic and may be partial or total in nature. Infiltration is when the IV fluid or drug enters the surrounding tissues rather than vein. PIVC patency is assessed by clinical nurses each shift in line with normal practice and will be documented on a data collection chart generated specifically for the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>While PIVC is insitu.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection.

Electronic pathology results will be check 48 hours after PIVC has been removed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>While PIVC insitu or within 48 hours of PIVC removal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dwell time - will be calculated from the insertion date and removal date fields</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phlebitis</outcome>
      <timepoint>Phlebitis scores will be collected daily while PIVC is insitu and on removal of PIVC.

Phlebitis indicators will be measured as follows:

Pain from site:  (no pain) 0..1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8..9..10 (acute pain)

Tenderness: (no tenderness) 0..1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8..9..10 (acute tenderness)

Erythema: should be measured from entry point with a ruler and scored:
None, &lt;1cm, &gt;1cm but &lt;2.5cm, &gt;2.5cm but &lt;5cm, &gt;5cm

Swelling: should be measured from entry point with a ruler and scored:
None , &lt;1cm, &gt;1cm but &lt;2.5cm, &gt;2.5cm but &lt;5cm, &gt;5cm

Palpable Cord or Vein Streak: Yes/No  
		Less than 7.5cm, greater than 7.5cm
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dislodgement</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data will be collected at the daily check when PIVC has been documented as dislodged</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost

Cost will be calculated based on the days each PIVC was insitu (per 1000 catheter days)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cost will be calculated at the completion of the trial</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Venous cannulation via peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVC) is the simplest and most frequently used method for drug, fluid and blood product administration. Researchers estimate that up to 70% of patients in acute care hospitals require a PIVC. However, PIVC are associated with inherent complications which can be mechanical or infectious. Failure rates of these devices is unacceptably high, affecting up to 40% of patients receiving this therapy.
Of these, 30% failed due to occlusion and infiltration (fluids into surrounding tissues) meaning patients had to have the PIVC replaced, which has implications for patient comfort, therapy and health care costs.There have been a range of strategies developed to prevent or reduce PIVC related complications including flushing regimes to maintain PIVC patency. However, current flushing practice is widely varied, with poor outcomes. There is little evidence that flushing of PIVC is actually happening in practice. To achieve best and evidence based practice it imperative that trial research is conducted to establish the best regime for maintaining PIVC patency.
The study aims to establish the feasibility of conducting a four arm, factorial, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and cost effectiveness of different flushing frequencies and volumes.</summary>
