  <interventions>
    <interventions>Environmental reorientation program which includes erecting a memory orientation board with a clock, automatic calendar (day of the week plus date), memory prompting posters, family education brochure (requesting families to re-orient patient) and a poster requesting consistent prompting from all healthcare staff and family members.

The duration of the intervention is 2 weeks. Occupational therapy staff will complete a daily check of the environment to monitor adherence to the environmental reorientation program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: that is, daily assessment of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) by an occupational therapist and reorientation of the patient by staff and family members as currently provided within the participating hospital.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Orientation interventions have been recommended as being important within cognitive rehabilitation (e.g. Corrigan et al, 1985) and researchers have also suggested that environmental stimuli which may aid in reorientation, such as familiar pictures or personal possessions (Watanabe et al, 1998). However critical evaluation of how effective these interventions are has been limited to date, with only controlled studies investigating the use of daily screening (Tate et al, 2000) and the use of calendars (Watanabe et al, 1998), and none of the studies have investigated this issue in acute care. This trial will test the efficacy of a standardised reorientation program that can be administered in acute care is developed to reduce the length of time a person remains in PTA after TBI</summary>
