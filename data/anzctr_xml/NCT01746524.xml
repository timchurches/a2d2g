  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) activities of daily living (ADL) sub-score change from baseline. - The KOOS ADL will be measured before surgery and at a minimum 1 year after surgery. The KOOS is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 42 questions. The KOOS consists of 5 subscales; pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreational function and knee-related quality of life. Each question has 5 Likert-like response options. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The change from baseline is the minimum 1 year (approximately 304 to 668 days) measurement minus the baseline measurement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One year or later (approximately 304 days or later)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Reported Outcome: Oxford Knee Score (OKS) - The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a patient self-administered 12-item questionnaire with each question having 5 Likert- like response option. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, and the items are summated, with lower total scores indicating poorer performance. The OKS measures pain and general activities of daily living.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-op (-90 to -1 days before surgery), &lt; 1 year (1 to 303 days), minimum 1 year (304 to 668 days), minimum 2 year (669 to 1763 days)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Reported Outcome: Pre-surgical/Post-surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) - The Pre Surgical and/or Post-surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) questionnaire is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 25 questions relating to the patient's awareness of their knee. Questions include the patient's self-confidence about the current status of their knee performance, stability, and overall satisfaction. Each question has a 5, 6 or 10 Likert- like response option.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-op (-90 to -1 days before surgery), &lt; 1 year (1 to 303 days), minimum 1 year (304 to 668 days), minimum 2 year (669 to 1763 days)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the functional knee performance of Subjects
      who have undergone primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Data from Subjects who receive one
      of four contemporary knee configurations will be pooled to establish a contemporary dataset.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pre-operative (approximately -90 to -1
      day before surgery) to minimum one year (approximately 304 to 668 days) postoperative
      functional performance improvement for the Attune primary, cemented TKA system as measured
      by the activities of daily living (ADL)subscore of the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score
      (KOOS)questionnaire (KOOS-ADL sub-score). This will be carried out for all four implant
      configurations: cruciate retaining fixed bearing (Attune CR FB), cruciate retaining rotating
      platform (Attune CR RP), posterior stabilized fixed bearing (Attune PS FB), and posterior
      stabilized rotating platform (Attune PS RP).</summary>
