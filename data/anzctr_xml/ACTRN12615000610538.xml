  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twelve week treatment program delivered during one 60min session once per week. All treatment sessions are one-on-one. There is a home training component - 30mins 5x/week. The intervention comprises discussion of the low back pain experience, laterality recognition and tactile acuity training, motor imagery and feedback enhanced functional movement training. The treatments are not mutually exclusive and are likely to overlap. 
Discussion of the low back pain experience
- delivered over twelve weeks
Laterality recognition training
- delivered over eleven weeks
- involves distinguishing between images of trunks rotated to left or right using Recognise (NOIgroup) software package
Tactile acuity training
- delivered over ten weeks
- involves localising and/or discriminating between different types of non-noxious tactile stimuli or multiple simultaneous non-noxious tactile stimuli applied by the therapist to the lower back.
Motor Imagery
- delivered over ten weeks
- involves mental visualisation of movements of the lower back and lower limbs, with or without videos
Feedback enhanced functional movement training
- delivered over seven weeks
- involves graded, individualised training of functional movement patterns with mirror visual feedback
Interventions will be monitored using an individual treatment diary</interventions>

Discussion of the low back pain experience
- delivered over twelve weeks
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
- delivered over eleven weeks 
- involves application of tDCS whilst comfortably seated for 10-20mins

Low-intensity laser therapy 
- delivered over ten weeks 
- involves application of low-intensity laser to the lower back whilst lying comfortably

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment will be via community distribution of posters. The phone and fax numbers and email address for the RESOLVE trial will be listed on the posters and participants will be invited to contact the RESOLVE research team. Once being contacted by a potential participant, RESOLVE study researchers will screen them for eligibility to enter the trial. 
Participants will also be recruited via primary care practitioners  in the greater Sydney area. These practitioners will be contacted using the database of practitioners from the PREVENT trial and using contact information freely available on the Internet. Practitioners will be invited to participate in the RESOLVE study and provided with training on recruitment should they consent to participate. Posters will be placed in the waiting rooms of the practitioners clinic, should they consent to this. Participants will be given contact details of the researchers by their practitioner if they consider their client to be eligible. Potential participants can contact the researchers immediately while they are in their practitioner's room or at a later  point of time. RESOLVE study researchers will screen the potential participant for eligibility to enter the trial on the phone. </concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher not involved in patient recruitment or data collection will create a randomisation schedule using randomisation software. The randomisation schedule will be used to create 275 consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes containing allocations</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary concern of people with chronic low back pain (CLBP) is pain relief, for which current treatments are not very effective. Our current understanding of pain and CLBP indicates that we should target the central nervous system in new treatment approaches. This project will test two new treatment approaches that target the central nervous system as part of the treatment of chronic low back pain. We predict that one of the new treatment approaches will result in a clinically meaningful reduction in pain intensity at six weeks post intervention</summary>
