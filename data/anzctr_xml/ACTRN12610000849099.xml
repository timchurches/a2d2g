    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through advertising in local newspapers and community bulletin boards. They will be screened over the phone to ensure they are able to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly allocated to a treatment one or two for the first active test session (after the practice day) and will then receive the corresponding treatment in the following active test session. Randomization of participants to treatment groups will be determined by random allocation. All 50 participants will be assigned a treatment order (either treatment ‘a’ then ‘b’, or ‘b’ then ‘a’) using a computerised random number generator. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The treatment number that has been placed next to the participant’s number will be the allocated treatment order for that individual.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computerised random number generator will determine whether participants take treatment a or b on their first testing day. This will be performed by a disinterested third party.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design study in which all participants will be administered both the active and inert capsules on separated testing sessions (the order of which will be randomized) after controlling for baseline scores the test scores achieved after treatment will be compared to these scores achieved following placebo.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the study is to determine the acute neurocognitive effects of a dose of Panax quinquefolius in healthy middle aged volunteers. The Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerized assessment battery will be used to evaluate effects of Ginseng on attention, working memory and secondary memory. Mood will also be assessed. Several paper and pencil questionnaires will also be completed which are designed to evaluate state and trait feelings of anxiety and depression and also to asses any symptomatology associated with the extract. Furthermore the neurophysiological effects will be measured using high spatial resolution electrical brain recordings measured by the Steady State Probe Topography technique (SSPT)</summary>
