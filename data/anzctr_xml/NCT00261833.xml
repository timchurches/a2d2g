  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annual Rate of Change in Lung Density - As measured by centralized, standardized computer tomographic (CT) lung densitometry. CT scans were acquired at 2 inspiration states: TLC (ie, full inspiration) and FRC (ie, full expiration). Results were adjusted for total lung volume and are presented as point estimates for the average rate of decline in each treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over a 2-year period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annual Rate of Pulmonary Exacerbations - Primary diagnostic criteria for exacerbations were increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence. Supporting diagnostic criteria were upper respiratory tract infection, fever without other apparent cause, increased wheezing, and increased cough. For diagnosis, participants had to meet 2 of the 3 primary criteria or 1 primary criterion and 1 supporting criterion. The annual rate was based on the total number of exacerbations and the total number of participant study days for all participants in the specified analysis population and adjusted to 365.25 days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over a 2-year period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change in FEV1 - Percent change from baseline to Month 24.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Pulmonary Exacerbation - Primary diagnostic criteria for exacerbations were increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence. Supporting diagnostic criteria were upper respiratory tract infection, fever without other apparent cause, increased wheezing, and increased cough. For diagnosis, participants had to meet 2 of the 3 primary criteria or 1 primary criterion and 1 supporting criterion.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Lung Density - Change from baseline to Month 24 as measured by centralized, standardized CT lung densitometry. CT scans were acquired at 2 inspiration states: TLC (ie, full inspiration) and FRC (ie, full expiration). Results were adjusted for total lung volume.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Exercise Capacity - Exercise capacity was measured as distance walked, using the incremental shuttle walk test. Change from baseline to end of treatment (2 years) in exercise capacity was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Patient-reported Symptoms - Patient-reported symptoms were measured using the symptoms score component of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). SGRQ scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations and negative values for change indicating improvement. Change from baseline to end of treatment (2 years) in SGRQ was analysed using an ANCOVA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency and Intensity of Adverse Events (AEs) - Number of participants with at least one AE, and the number of participants with mild, moderate or severe AEs. AE intensity was defined as mild (does not interfere with routine activities), moderate (interferes with routine activities), or severe (impossible to perform routine activities).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Pulmonary Exacerbations Relative to Treatment Duration - Defined as the percentage of total treatment duration across participants for 1) exacerbations overall, 2) antibiotic treatment for exacerbations, and 3) hospitalization for exacerbations. Primary diagnostic criteria for exacerbations were increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence. Supporting diagnostic criteria were upper respiratory tract infection, fever without other apparent cause, increased wheezing, and increased cough. For diagnosis, participants had to meet 2 of the 3 primary criteria or 1 primary criterion and 1 supporting criterion.</outcome>

Primary diagnostic criteria for exacerbations were increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence. Supporting diagnostic criteria were upper respiratory tract infection, fever without other apparent cause, increased wheezing, and increased cough. For diagnosis, participants had to meet 2 of the 3 primary criteria or 1 primary criterion and 1 supporting criterion.

    <summary>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase III/IV study to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Zemaira® with placebo in subjects with emphysema due to
      alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. The effect of Zemaira® on the progression of
      emphysema will be assessed by the decline of lung density, measured by computed tomography
      (CT).</summary>
