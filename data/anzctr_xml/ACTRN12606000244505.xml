  <interventions>
    <interventions>ravelan tablets 200mg x 6 daily (3TDS) orally for 2 months.
Participants have:
Baseline measurements
one month pre-intervention observation,
two months intervention, then
one month post-intervention observation.
Data gathered during the initial month of observation allows each individual to act as his own control.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>20% reduction in laboratory markers (serum inflammatory markers)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline then monthly. Outcome effect will be determined after 2 months intervention, then confirmed after a post-intervention observation period of one month.
That is: one month preintervention observation &amp; measurement, 2 months intervention &amp; measurement, one month post intervention observation &amp; measurement.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>20% reduction in symptoms according to patient's self assessment records</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline,  then after one month of pre-intervention observation. Outcomes determined after 2 months intervention &amp; measuremnt then further reassessed after one month post intervention observation and measurements.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>20% change in antibody levels within the gut (stool samples)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline,  then after one month of pre-intervention observation. Outcomes determined after 2 months intervention &amp; measuremnt then further reassessed after one month post intervention observation and measurements.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A reduction of faecal blood loss</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline,  then after one month of pre-intervention observation. Outcomes determined after 2 months intervention &amp; measuremnt then further reassessed after one month post intervention observation and measurements.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effectiveness of Travelan, given alongside a patient's current medications, to reduce inflammation in ulcerative colitis.
Travelan is a hyper-immune bovine colostrum extract from cows that have been vaccinated against the agents which commonly cause travellers diarrhoea. (ie a variety of E.Coli's).  Travelan is currently sold as an over-the-counter medication in Australia to reduce the risk of traveller's diarrhoea.  Medical Practitioners report that patients with a variety of chronic diarrhoea syndromes have a reduction in symptoms when taking Travelan to avoid traveller's diarrhoea.  
The 4 month pilot-study will review symptoms, blood and stool samples to evaluate if 2 months intervention with Travelan has an effect on bowel inflammation in ulcerative colitis.</summary>
