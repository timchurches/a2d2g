  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will compare post-operative radiological and clinical outcomes in patients who undergo primary total hip replacement surgery, using two different modular cementless femoral stems (K2 and Apex stems).

K2 (Global Orthopaedic Technology, Sydney Australia) modular hip systems geometry comprises a dual longitudinal taper with rectangular cross-section. The rationale is to provide axial stability through the dual longitudinal taper and rotational stability through compaction of cancellous bone and the contact between the femoral cortex and the corners of the stem. Apex (Global Orthopaedic Technology, Sydney Australia) modular hip systems geometry comprises a modular titanium construction with circumferential proximal porous coating of the fit and fill body section.

A standard posterior surgical approach will be employed for both stems, while surgical duration should not differ.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study will compare outcomes following primary total hip replacement surgery, in combination with two modular cementless femoral stems. Both stems (K2 and Apex) are used routinely in hip replacement surgery.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA) is the primary outcome measure, and is the gold standard for assessing the stability of implants within bone. Small tantalum beads will be implanted into the patient's bone to measure micromotion (&lt; 1 mm) at the bone/implant interface. In doing so, we will measure permanent implant migration and instantaneous inducible displacements created by external loading. The pattern of micromotion exhibited by various prostheses and fixation techniques within the first two post-operative years has been shown to be predictive of the long-term fixation of the component to bone.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1-week, 3-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years post-surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) will be used to calculate bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) in the peri-prosthetic bone of the total joint arthroplasties. The combination of BMD information with RSA derived implant micromotion will enable a comprehensive assessment of the processes which determine implant fixation and long-term survival.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-surgery and 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years post-surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Harris Hip Score (HHS): The Harris hip score is a disease-specific test used to provide an evaluation system for various hip disabilities and methods of treatment. The HHS gives a maximum of 100 points and the domains include pain, function, deformity and motion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-surgery and 6-weeks, 3-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years post-surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12): The multi-purpose 12 item questionnaire looks at physical and mental scores for patients undergoing clinical trials.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-surgery and 6-weeks, 3-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years post-surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oxford Hip Score (OHS): The Oxford hip score is a disease-specific assessment that evaluates hip pain, symptoms and related function.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-surgery and 6-weeks, 3-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years post-surgery.</timepoint>
