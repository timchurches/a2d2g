  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study interventions were the probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus  (10**9 colony forming units) and Bifidobacteria lactis  (10**9 colony forming units) administered orally.  In mothers this was taken daily from 35 weeks gestation till 6 months if breastfeeding.  In infants this was administered daily from birth for 2 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo contained dextran, salt and a high quality refined yeast extract, developed to be similar in appearance and odour to the active intervention.   In mothers this was taken daily from 35 weeks gestation till 6 months if breastfeeding.  In infants this was administered daily from birth for 2 years.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Probiotics (found in fermented foods) when given to infants may exert a protective effect on the development of allergy by influencing the developing immune system.  This study aims to determine whether dietary supplementation in infants with 2 different probiotics results in differences in atopy and eczema prevalence at age 2 years.</summary>
