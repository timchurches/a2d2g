  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of chronic treatment with
      inhaled dry powder mannitol in subjects with cystic fibrosis. Previous studies have
      demonstrated an improvement in lung function related to small airways obstruction and a
      significant improvement in respiratory symptoms and quality of life after a 2 week treatment
      with mannitol. This current study seeks to support these early findings and to extend the
      evidence to support its use as a mucoactive therapy in cystic fibrosis. In particular, the
      hypothesis that enhanced mucus clearance will improve the lung function and clinical
      presentation in this population, will be investigated. We also hypothesize that enhanced
      mucociliary clearance will result in a sustained reduction in mucus load, thus providing less
      opportunity for bacteria to proliferate, affording a reduction in antibiotic use and
      hospitalizations. The initial 6 month blinded phase will be followed with an additional 6
      months of open label treatment.</summary>
