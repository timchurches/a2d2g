    <interventions>Patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive one treatment of the tested drugs; 
1- Group I (G I) Silymarin (7 mg/ml) cream, applied topically to the affected areas; twice daily for 4 weeks, and advised to avoid sun exposure and to use topical sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of 15+ during the entire period of treatment and thereafter. 
2- Group II (G II) Silymarin (14 mg/ml) cream, applied topically to the affected areas; twice daily for 4 weeks, and advised to avoid sun exposure and to use topical sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of 15+ during the entire period of treatment and thereafter.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group III (G III) placebo; aqueous cream base without the active ingredient (silymarin), applied topically to the affected areas; twice daily for 4 weeks, and the patients advised to avoid sun exposure and to use topical sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of 15+ during the entire period of treatment and thereafter.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After diagnosis by a dermatologist, the trial manager decided which one was eligible according to the inclusion criteria. Each patient had a unique code number in the first visit, these numbers were entered in the computer software.
The allocation was done by central randomization by computer.
