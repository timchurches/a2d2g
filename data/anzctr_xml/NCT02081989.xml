  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Renal denervation (the use of radio waves to oblate the renal artery) has been shown to be an
      effective treatment for high blood pressure. It is currently being tested in heart failure
      patients and we would now like to look it its effects on diabetes.

      We therefore plan to enrol 20 participants with type II diabetes into this study. Half will
      undergo renal denervation in addition to their standard care and the other half will act as
      controls and only receive standard care. Treatment allocation will be randomly assigned.

      All participants will undergo screening (including a physical exam, blood tests, ultrasounds
      and a muscle biopsy). All patients will have follow up tests (including physical exams and
      blood tests) 1, 3 and 6 months later.</summary>
