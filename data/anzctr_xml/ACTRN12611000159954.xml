    <interventions>In the Phase I dose-escalation phase of the study, patients were assigned to dose levels in successive cohorts starting with a dose in the first cohort of 100 mg/day.  Dose-escalation proceeded initially with a 1.5-fold increment, however, based on toxicity and efficacy information at a specific dose level, the dose escalation increment may have been reduced to a 1.25-fold escalation at the discretion of the investigator. At any dose level, if one patient experienced a Grade 2 toxicity or higher, the dose-escalation could only proceed with 1.25-fold increments.  The dose escalation proceeded as follows:
Cohort 1 = 100 mg
Cohort 2 = 150 mg
Cohort 3 = 200 mg
Cohort 4 = 300 mg
Cohort 5 = 400 mg

CYT387 will be orally self-administered as a single daily dose beginning on Day 1 of the study, and thereafter at approximately the same time each day of the 28-day cycle. It is recommended that all doses be preceded by a 2-hour fast from food and beverages, and be followed by a 1-hour post-dose fast from food and beverages.  Patients will receive up to 9 cycles of therapy unless one of the following occurs:
- disease progression (Progressive disease; PD) by IWG-MRI consensus criteria
- Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment
- Unacceptable adverse event(s)
- Patient decides to withdraw from the study
- General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator

Twenty additional patients will be assigned to a 150 mg BID (twice daily) dosing schedule. CYT387 will be orally self-administered twice-daily with doses approximately 10-12 hours apart beginning on Day 1 of the study, and thereafter at approximately the same times each day of the 28-day cycle.  Patients will continue for up to 9 cycles as above. 

For the Part 2 dose confirmation portion of the study, 60 additional patients will be assigned to either 150 mg or 300 mg QD (once daily) dose groups.  As with Part 1 of the study, patients will receive up to 9 cycles of CYT387, at 28 days per cycle as above.</interventions>

    <summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in two phases: a single-centre dose-escalation phase with supernumerary patient addition (Part 1), to determine the safety and tolerability of CYT387, and to identify a therapeutic dose for the confirmation portion of the study; and a multiple-centre dose-confirmation phase (Part 2), which will be a cohort expansion at or below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CYT387.</summary>
