    <interventions>Observational study to assess the spread of local anaesthetic solution throughout the pharynx and larynx.

Children having a general anaesthetic requiring a tracheal tube will have local anaesthetic poured into the back of the mouth. The local anaesthetic will be stained with methylene blue dye, so that the investigator is able to determine which parts of the patient have come into contact with the local anaesthetic.

The study is expected to be completed within two years.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events during induction of anaesthesia including: coughing, laryngospasm (spasm of vocal cords), reduced oxygen saturation of blood, reduced heart rate.

These will be assessed by the investigator present by observation of the patient and monitoring equipment during approximately 10 minutes after induction of anaesthesia.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has been designed to determine the effectiveness of a routine anaesthetic practice at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) in Melbourne. At this institution, we pour local anaesthetic into the pharynx (throat) of children having general anaesthesia with a tracheal tube (breathing tube) in the hope that the larynx will become partially anaesthetised in order to reduce adverse events during anaesthesia such as coughing, laryngospasm (the vocal cords clamping together), oxygen levels dropping in the patient's blood, or slowing of heart rate.</summary>
