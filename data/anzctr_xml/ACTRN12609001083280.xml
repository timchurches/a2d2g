  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Participants of the training group will participate in individual weekly 20 minutes sessions of pelvic flor muscle training (PFMT) supervise by two physiotherapists with the same background during 12 or 17 weeks. The number of sessions during pregnany will be determined according to the gestational age at which it is in the first evaluation</interventions>
    <comparator>The participants of the control group will be evaluated at 20, 25 and 36 weeks of gestational age and 6 weeks after the labor. The volunters in the control group do not training the pelvic floor muscles weekly.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the efficiency of the pelvic floor muscle training on reducing clinical signs of urinary incontinence by validated questionaries.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the impact of the pelvic floor muscle training on electromyographic activity using a eletromyograph device and on a pelvic floor muscle strenght assessed by a perineometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The assessment with the eletromyograpy and perineometer devices will be done with 20, 25 and 36 of gestational age and with 6 weeks after the labor.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the rates of urinary incontinence during pregnancy and the postpartum period by a validaded questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The questionaries will be aplicated with 25, 28 and 36 weeks of gestational age and 6 weeks after labor</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hemodynamic responses maternal and fetal resulting from implementation of the contraction of the pelvic floor muscles evaluating the blood pressure, temperature, heart rate maternal and the fetal condition by ultrasound examinations during the exercise</outcome>
      <timepoint>The maternal responses will be evaluated in each supervised pelvic floor training and the ultrasound examinations will be done with the participants with 20, 25, 28, 32 and 36 weeks of gestational age</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The impact of the exercise of contraction of the pelvic floor in relation to variables related to childbirth and the newborn. The medical records will be assessed after labor  to collected this data and a blinded assessor will be collected this.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Histomorphometric features of the levator ani muscle in postpartum women who were treated or not a program to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles during pregnancy. The women who will have a vaginal delivery with episiotomy will have a sample of the pelvic floor muscle collected and this sample will be analyzed histologically.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The collect of the sample of the pelvic floor muscle will be done during the labor.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The quality of life of pregnant women of control or training group will be evaluated by a validade questionnarie.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The assessment of the quality of life will be done with the participants with 25, 28 and 36 weeks of gestational age and 6 weeks after labor.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Heart rate, blood pressure and temperature through the implementation of PFMT will be evaluated with especifics equipaments like a frequencimeter, sphygmomanometer and thermometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be implemented in all supervisioned pelvic floor muscle training (once a week) with a total of 12  or 17  measures</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The sexual functions between the participants of training or control group will be assessed by a validaded questionnarie.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The application of the questionnaires will be held with 25, 28 and 36 of gestational age and 6 weeks after labor</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our purpose is to evaluate the pelvic floor muscles during pregnancy and after childbirth, comparing the results of these evaluations, and the training of these muscles has some efficacy in the incidence of urinary incontinence in labor and delivery in perineal lacerations in type of delivery, if you change the blood glucose levels after exercise, if there is any difference in muscle fibers in women who performed compared with those who do not exercise, assess the level of sexual function and quality of life of the volunteers</summary>
