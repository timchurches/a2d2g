  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with rectal hyposensitivity usually complain of fecal incontinence. Sacral nerve stimulation might help to increase the sensitivity of rectal mucosa, power of discrimination and continence. Sacral nerve stimulation will be done as a continuous stimulation . Temporary stimulation was performed with unilateral percutaneous nerve evaluation performed by insertion of a stimulating electrode (3065USC; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) into the S3 sacral foramen under local anesthesia and/or intravenous sedation. Default stimulation parameters were set at 210 microsecond pulse width, 15 Hz frequency, and a subsensory amplitude ranging between 0.5 and 10 V. Stimulation was done for 4 weeks followed by one week OFF. Successful percutaneous nerve evaluation (on basis of clinical improvement as judged by physician and patient) was followed by the offer of permanent stimulation. </interventions>
    <comparator>Randomized trial comparing intermittent (4 weeks stimulation for 24 hours daily followed by one week without stimulation followed by one week stimulatiob ) and continuous (4 weeks on) sacral nerve stimuation in treatment of fecal incontinence due to rectal hyposensitivity. Intermittent sacral nerve stimulation will be administered to participants in the comparator group.Temporary stimulation was performed with unilateral percutaneous nerve evaluation performed by insertion of a stimulating electrode (3065USC; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) into the S3 sacral foramen under local anesthesia and/or intravenous sedation. Default stimulation parameters were set at 210 microsecond pulse width, 15 Hz frequency, and a subsensory amplitude ranging between 0.5 and 10 V.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with fecal incontinence due to rectal hyposensitivity will have S3 or S2 sacral nerve stimuation. They will be randomized to either continous stimulation or intermittent stimulation. Score of continence, power of discrimination of flatus and feces and quality of life will be assessed</summary>
