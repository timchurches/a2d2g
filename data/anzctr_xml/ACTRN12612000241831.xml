  <interventions>
    <interventions>There have been two government initiatives to improve iodine intake and status. These are the mandatory fortification of bread with iodised salt and the provision of a subsidised iodine supplement for all pregnant and lactating women. This study will investigate how much fortified bread women habitually consume, the uptake of the subsidised supplement and the effect of both on iodine intake and status. This is an observational study investigating the behaviour of free living indiviuals no intervention will be given. Recruitment will last 6 months</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Iodine and selenium intakes are known to be low in New Zealand. Two government initaitives have been introduced to improve intake among pregnant and lactating women. This study will investigate the effect of these initiatives on iodine intake and status. Selenium intake and status and the intake of other nutrients will also be assessed.</summary>
