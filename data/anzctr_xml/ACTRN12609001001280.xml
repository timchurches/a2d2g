  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two intervention groups, laser acupuncture and needle acupuncture. Needle acupuncture involves the use of acupuncture needles and laser acupuncture involves the aiming of laser light with a small pen-like device which is applied to the skin. The acupuncture (for both needle and laser groups) is delivered by General Practitioners who are Fellows of the College of Medical Acupuncture. There will be 8-12 treatment sessions over 12 weeks of 20 minutes per treatment. the number of treatment sessions will be determined by the treating General Practitioner (GP).</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two comparator groups. Sham laser acupuncture and a Zelen control group (no intervention). Half of the 280 people in the study will be invited to take part in the laser acupuncture arm of the study. People in this arm of the project will have a 50% chance of receiving real laser acupuncture and a 50% chance of receiving sham laser acupuncture, which appears like real laser acupuncture, but it does not emit a laser beam. Both real and sham treatment will be provided by the same laser acupuncture machines. Each participant will be provided with a 4-digit numeric code that can be input into the laser machines. This code will be linked to either real laser or sham laser treatment. Neither the GP nor the patient will know which form of treatment is being provided and they will not be able to tell. Hence participants in the real laser and sham laser groups will have the same number of treatment visits over 12 weeks for the same period of time.</comparator>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A standard single consent Zelen methodology will be used whereby participants are initially enrolled into a longitudinal study. Following enrolment into the study, participants will be covertly randomised into one of four groups: (1) a no treatment control group, (2) laser acupuncture, (3) sham laser acupuncture and (4) needle acupuncture.  

The allocation will be concealed and will be done using a computer program controlled by an administrator of the randomization sequencing, not involved in screening, recruitment or data management.

The participants in the no treatment control group are not informed about the other treatment groups.</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomisation which will be done with the use of a computer program.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study firstly aims to compare the effectiveness of laser acupuncture to sham laser acupuncture in people suffering from chronic knee pain. Secondly, the study aims to compare laser acupuncture to needle acupuncture in people suffering from chronic knee pain. And thirdly, the study aims to compare laser acupuncture, sham laser acupuncture and needle acupuncture to no treatment for chronic knee pain. The study hypothesis is that laser acupuncture will be more effective than sham laser acupuncture or no treatment and will be equal or more effective than needle acupuncture in treating people suffering from chronic knee pain.</summary>
