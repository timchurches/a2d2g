  <interventions>
    <interventions>In random order subjects will take orally flaxseed lignan 50mg/ day for 7 weeks, orally flaxseed lignan 100mg/ day for 7 weeks, placebo orally 1/ day 7 weeks with at least a 7 week washout period between each intervention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The lignan supplement contains 48% Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (lignan precursors), 27% calcium hydrogen phosphate, 19% microcrystalline cellulose, 0.5% hydrogenated vegetable oil, 0.5% stearic acid, 1%magnesium stearate, 2% crospovidone, 2% colloidal silica anhydrous.  All tablets are coated in opadry clear PI4029. The only active ingredient in the lignan supplement is Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo orally 1/ day 7 weeks. The placebo tablets contain the same ingredients as the lignan supplements without the Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Data suggests that foods high in lignan precursors are plausibly associated with a lower risk of sex-hormone-related cancers, however the human evidence for this is not strong. Currently, no direct assessment of dietary consumption of lignans and breast cancer risk is available. 

The objectives of the proposed research are:
1. To directly assess the relationship between dietary consumption of flaxseed lignans and breast cancer risk.
2. To assess the relationship between dietary consumption of flaxseed lignans and concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin and free estradiol.
3. To examine the effects of flaxseed lignans as a dietary constituent on hormonal status in vivo.

Research Questions
This research will attempt to answer the following questions:
1.	What effects does controlled dietary consumption of lignans have on hormonal status?
2.	What effect does controlled lignan dietary consumption have on enterolactone from matairesinol and enterodiol from secoisolariciresinol in urine?
3.	What effect does controlled lignan dietary consumption have on hormonal breast cancer risk markers?</summary>
