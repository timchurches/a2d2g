  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Program will deliver advice from Aboriginal Health Workers on Toothbrushing,diet and use of fluoride toothpaste to Aboriginal families over a two year period.The Program will consist of 6 home visits. The time per visit will be approximately 45 mins,but there will be built in flexibility for the AHWs.

 Visit 1 when the child is 6 months old will focus on avoiding the night time comforter bottle and not adding sugar to the liquids used. Visit 2 at 9 months, reinforce bottle advice,toothpaste and tooth brushes supplied for all the family. Visit 3 at 12 months. Screen for early caries, toothpaste and brushes provided,advice on toothpaste storeage and diet advice.Visit 4 at18 months Check child is not using night time bottle,provide more brushes and toothpaste,advice on safe storeage of toothpaste,safe snacking advice,and screen for early dental caries. Visit 5 at 24 months, simple diet advice,check toothbrushing behavior,toothpaste ,toothpaste given,and screen for early dental caries. Visit 6, final part of intervention, full dental examination by dental examiner,further supplies of toothpaste and brushes, plus research interviews with carers and AHWs.</interventions>
    <comparator>A historical control group of children aged 3-4 years will be examined in preschools in the AMSs where the program is being implemented during 2012 and their dental caries rates recorded. The oral health of the active group will be compared with the historical controls at the end of the trial.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early dental decay causes much pain and suffering to very young Aboriginal children. Unfortunately dental services for many of these communities are very limited, so it is vital to utilise local health care workers to give parents advice on how to prevent dental decay. Simple dietary changes,especially night time bottle use and ealy introduction of fluoride toothpaste can greatly reduce dental decay. We wish to recruit Aboriginal Health Workers to take on this educaton program as they are well known in their communities and have an existing committment to health promotion. In addition we will be teaching them how to screen for ealy signs of decay, so children with dental problems can be fast tracked for the appropriate care. Our pilot work has led to the development of a culturally acceptable program which the AHWs feel is practical and sustainable. This trial seeks to determine whether the program will actually reduce the prevalence of dental decay in young Aboriginal children and is acceptable to parents and the AHWs.. If successful Aboriginal Medical Services will have evidence based information on which to base their dental preventive programs.</summary>
