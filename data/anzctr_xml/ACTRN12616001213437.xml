  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single-dose of study drug (Ondansetron vs Placebo syrup) by mouth, 30 minutes prior to procedural sedation. The following weight-based dosing will be used:
15-30kg = 5 ml of study drug (Ondansetron 4 mg or Placebo)
over 30 kg = 10 ml of study drug (Ondansetron 8 mg or Placebo)
At the time of randomisation, the investigator will access the study drug supply in the paediatric emergency department and dispense to the participant the next available box containing the appropriate weight-based dose. A research assistant may complete this task as long as it is counter-signed by a medically qualified staff. </interventions>

      <outcome>Adverse events associated with procedural sedation.
This outcome will be recorded on the case report form by the medical staff caring for the participant during the emergency visit. When an adverse event is reported in the case report form, a member of the research team will review the participant's electronic medical record to corroborate the event.
Possible adverse events include:
a.	oxygen desaturation: oxygen desaturation and one or more interventions are performed with the intention of improving the oxygen saturation 
b.	apnoea: cessation or pause of ventilatory effort and one or more interventions are performed with the intention of stimulating or assisting ventilation
c.	laryngospasm: partial or complete upper airway obstruction, with oxygen desaturation caused by involuntary and sustained closure of the vocal cords and is not relieved by routine airway repositioning manoeuvers, suctioning, or insertion of a nasal or oral airway
d.	pulmonary aspiration: suspicion or confirmation of oropharyngeal or gastric contents in the trachea during the sedation or physiologic recovery phase and the appearance of respiratory signs and symptoms that were not present before the sedation
e.	bradycardia: pulse rate decreasing 2 standard deviations below normal for age as described by the electronic medical record 
f.	hypotension: mean blood pressure less than the fifth percentile for age, as defined by the electronic medical record

    <sequence>Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: ondansetron or placebo. Randomisation will be stratified by weight (15-30 kg and &gt;30 kg).

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome is the proportion of participants experiencing vomiting during PSA with INF and N2O. There is currently only one report on the rate of vomiting associated with the administration of INF and N2O. In this report of 41 children receiving INF and N2O at the RCH, the vomiting rate was 19.5% (95% exact binomial CI [8.8%, 34.9%]). In a separate study we found an incidence of vomiting of 27.6% in 29 children (95% exact binomial CI [12.7%,47.2%]) undergoing PSA with INF and N2O at this institution. Based on clinical opinion, we propose that reducing the incidence of vomiting to 10% would be a clinically significant improvement and one that would potentially change practice. Assuming conservatively, that 20% of children in the placebo group will vomit during PSA, we therefore power our study to identify an absolute reduction of 10% (from 20% to 10%). A similar reduction in the incidence of vomiting, from 18.9% to 7.8%, was previously found in a trial where ondansetron was administered to children undergoing  PSA with ketamine. Assuming 20% vomit in the placebo group, a sample size of 398 patients would be required in order for us to detect a reduction to 10% or lower (i.e. odds ratio of 0.44 or number needed to treat of 10) with 80% power, based on a two-sided test with type 1 error of 0.05.  We therefore aim to recruit 442 participants to allow for 10% loss to follow-up.

Baseline characteristics will be compared between the ondansetron and placebo groups using summary statistics (means and standard deviations for continuous variables and numbers and percentages for categorical variables).

The primary outcome of the incidence of vomiting during PSA will be presented as the number and proportion in each treatment group, with a comparison between the groups presented as a difference in proportions and as an odds ratio from a logistic regression model adjusted for weight (15-30 kg and &gt;30 kg), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value (primary objective).  In addition, we will present the results as Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) and its 95% CI.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We set out to assess the impact of ondansetron on the incidence of vomiting in children undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) with the combination of intranasal fentanyl (INF) and inhaled nitrous oxide (N2O) compared with placebo. We hypothesize that ondansetron can significantly decrease the rate of vomiting associated with the combination of INF and N2O. Currently, there exists no report of any strategy to reduce the occurrence of vomiting in patients receiving INF and N2O.

This is a phase III, double-blinded, placebo-controlled superiority trial of ondansetron for prevention of vomiting associated with PSA with the combination of INF and N2O. Participants will be randomized to receive one dose of ondansetron oral syrup (4 mg for patients 15-30 kg; 8 mg for patients &gt;30 kg) or matched placebo during PSA. 

The treatment period will be limited to the participants emergency visit requiring PSA. The follow-up period will be of a maximum of one week (aiming for less than 72 hours) for each individual, ending at the time of the phone follow-up. 

The primary outcome is to determine if ondansetron decreases the incidence of vomiting during PSA with the combination of INF and N2O in children aged between 3 and less than 18 years compared with placebo. Secondary outcomes are to determine the effect of ondansetron compared with placebo on:
a. Number of vomits during PSA
b. Vomiting in the PED after PSA
d. Vomiting within 24 hours of the start of the procedure
c. Retching during PSA
d. Procedure duration
e. Procedure abandonment
f.  PSA-associated adverse events during the emergency visit
g. To explore parental satisfaction
h. To explore value parents put on vomiting
