  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study consists of 3 separate groups of patients. Each group of the patients  will be assigned to take orally after meals one of the following Lycosome formulations of phytochemicals:
1.	Phospho-PTDC-chaperone (450 mg twice daily).
2.	Combinatory lycosomal formulation of Lycopene (7 mg) fused with Phospho-PTDC-chaperone (450 mg) taken twice daily.
3.	Combinatory lycosomal formulation of trans-Resveratrol (240 mg), lycopene (7 mg) and phospho-PTDC-chaperone (450 mg) taken twice daily.

All formulations will be taken for the same period of 6 months. 
Adherence to the protocol will be monitored by questioning of the patients and determination of plasma levels of lycopene and resveratrol before and after completion of the study by methods of analytic chemistry.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control patients will be given oral tablets with 450 mg of  Phosphatidylcholine chaperone alone for a period of 6 months twice daily.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Medical personal of outpatient clinic of the Institute of Immunology UzAS will be informed about launching the trial, its major goal and selection criteria for volunteers. Suitable individuals will be invited for preliminary check-up (physical and laboratory investigation) during the initial phase of enrollment. All suitable individuals will be re-screened after wash-out period of the trail before final decision on trial enrollment is made.
Allocation is not concealed. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization of volunteers in the trial will be performed using widely accepted methods such as simple randomization and stratified randomization. Briefly, the software containing random number generator will be applied to database of the volunteers. They assigned group will be considered as a final. The groups will be balanced according to numerical age and gender with special software. Stratified randomization will be used to enhance statistical power of the final results and will ensure equality of groups in secondary selection criteria.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis of results will be performed by independent statistician. If statistical methods as well as the statistical settings listed above will be not appropriate for newly obtained results due to specificity of variant distribution, other methods of statistical analysis will be applied.  Any deviations from the statistical plan described above will be explained and justified in a protocol amendment and/or in the final report submitted to the Institutional Ethics Committee.  
Sample size determination for the study groups was based on the results of a pilot clinical trial. It was determined that according to the values of standard deviation the required number of patients in each group is 30 patients. The actual size of groups was set at 40 patients per group due to drop-outs.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hepatitis C treatment is a challenging task in the modern internal medicine. Diet, exercise and antiglycemic drugs are among pharmacological options in the hepatitis c. There is a recent piece of evidence that vitamin and possibly other antioxidants therapy may attenuate hepatitis c. That is why use of lycosomal formulation of lycopene and resveratrol chaperoned with phosphatidylcholine may represent a novel strategy in managment of hepatitis c. </summary>
