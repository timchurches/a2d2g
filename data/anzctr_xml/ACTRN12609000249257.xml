  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be invited to complete a computer-administered self-directed programme (CCBT) over 4-8 weeks under minimal supervision from a health professional in primary care setting/school guidance counselling/youth one stop shop.

The computer-administered self-directed programme is based on Cogntive Beahvioural Therapy (CBT) and consists of 7 modules each taking approximately 30 minutes to complete. The programme is steeped in a 3D fantasy game with challenges and puzzles, as well as information about ways of managing mood.  Participants are encouraged to complete the 7 modules over a period of 4-8 weeks (in total about 4 hours). Content-specific challenges are set at the end of each module and reviewed at the beginnign of each new module. Participants can complete the programme at school/health clinic or take it home. The programme is accompanied by a printed Notebook where the participants can take notes and track their progress. The overall duration will be determined on a case by case basis.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive treatment as usual (TAU) as provided by health professionals in a primary care setting/school guidance counselling/youth health clinic.

Treatement as usual will differ on a case-by-case. It is likely to include psychotherapy, group counselling, individual counselling and psychoeducation, etc and may include other support. The detailed descripton of treatment as usual will be collected from each clinician at the end of the treatment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is a major health issue amongst adolescents in New Zealand with rates of 4-8% at the age of 15 rising rapidly to 17-18% by the age of 18. The effect of depressive disorder in young people is pervasive and affects not only function but overall development. Treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), and anti-depressants for serious depressive disorder. Workforce strategies mean that CBT and IPT are often unavailable. This study is to evaluate self-administered CBT that is computer-based. This self-help treatment is a form of therapy that has several advantages over traditional therapist-administered help in that patients can go through the programme at their own pace. It is less costly to administer, easily accessible, and may not carry the stigma often associated with seeking mental health treatment.  This study will compare the efficacy of computerized CBT (CCBT) with the usual therapy in adolescents with mild to moderate depression. Study participants will be assessed after a 2 month treatment period and again 3 months after completion of therapy.</summary>
