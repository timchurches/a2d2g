  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Overall response rate (ORR) - The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 3.5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of response (DoR) - Duration of response (DoR) will be duration from the date of the initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of PD (or relapse for participants who experience CR). For those participants who are still without progression/relapse, DoR will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 3.5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - The PFS is defined as the duration from the date of the first daratumumab dose to the date of Progression/relapse or death, whichever comes first. For those participants who are still alive without progression/relapse, PFS will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 3.5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS) - Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the date of the first daratumumab dose to the date of death. For those participants who are still alive without progression/relapse, OS will be censored at the last date known to be alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 3.5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to response - Time to response is defined as the duration from the date of the first dose of daratumumab to the earliest date that a response (CR/PR) is first documented.

          -  Participants must have available archival or fresh tumor tissue or both to submit to a
             central laboratory for CD38 assay. Expression of CD38 is measured by

             CD38 investigational IHC assay under development: a) Stage 1: participants whose
             tumors are more than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) positive for CD38, b) Stage 2:
             participant has less than (&lt;) 50% CD38+ or greater than (&gt;) 50% CD38+ depending on the
             distribution of CD 38 expression of enrolled participants during Stage 2. The sponsor
             will advise on which eligibility criterion is permitted during the enrollment period

             injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); barrier methods: condom with spermicidal

             treatment regimen)

             methods of reliable birth control simultaneously

          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control example, either condom

             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository,
             and all men must also not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after
             receiving the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen. The exception to
             this restriction is that if the participant's female partner is surgically sterile, a
             second method of birth control is not required</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess overall response rate [ORR, including complete
      response (CR) and partial response (PR)], of daratumumab in participants with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma [a cancer of the lymph nodes (or tissues)-NHL] and to evaluate association between
      ORR and CD38 expression level in order to determine a threshold for CD38 expression level in
      each NHL subtype, above which daratumumab activity is enhanced in participants with relapsed
      or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma.</summary>
