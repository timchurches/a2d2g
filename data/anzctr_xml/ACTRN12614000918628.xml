  <interventions>
    <interventions>The children will be randomised into two groups, to receive either GUMLi or homogenised cows milk and will be followed for 12 months.  The Growing Up Milk - "lite" is a toddler milk similar in composition to a commercially available toddler milk, but with reduced energy.  

Intervention: Growing Up Milk Lite 

Dose: 2 * 150ml of formula per day for a total of 12 months (from when the child turns 1 year of age until they turn 2 years of age).

The Growing Up Milk  is lower in energy than cow's milk and contains added micronutrients, dietary fibre and probiotics.
Key differences in Growing Up Milk are:
- 89.3kJ per 150mL serve
- 1.1mcg Vitamin D per 150mL serve
- 2.5mg Iron per 150mL serve
- 174.3mg Calcium per 150mL serve

Compliance will be measured sing information from monthly telephone interviews on the volume of milk consumed by the children in the previous 24 hours. Both study groups consume the same amounts of milk and have measures taken at identical time points.

    <concealment>Enrolment:
Children will be eligible to be enrolled if they are healthy and aged less than 12 months.

Children will be recruited from urban central Auckland and Brisbane. Recruitment will occur via Community Outreach Campaigns including media releases, posters and flyers displayed in GP practices, early childhood centres and through Well Child providers e.g. Plunket (NZ)

Multiple recruitment strategies will be used, including self-referral, consent to contact via a health professional or early childhood workers etc.  The product complies with Food Standards Australia and New Zealand guidelines.

Study intervention: 
Participants will be randomised to one of two treatment groups; either Growing up Milk ‘Lite’ or whole pasteurised and homogenised cow’s milk. 

The Growing up Milk ‘Lite’ is a toddler milk similar in composition to the commercially available Aptamil Gold+ toddler milk (Danone Pty Ltd), but with reduced energy content. The product complies with Food Standards Australia and New Zealand guidelines.

Both milks will be supplied by the researchers at no cost to the participant. Parents will be required to have their toddler consume 300ml of the supplied milk each day for a total of 12 months (that is, from when the child turns 1 year of age till when they turn 2 years of age).

</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation and blinding: 
Both the Growing up milk ‘lite’ and the cow’s milk will be packaged in identical 900g tins. The milks will be allocated using a random number allocation (the number of variables currently being determined).  The researchers will be blinded to which milks constitute each letter allocation. Block randomisation will be completed in consultation with a statistician and allocation sequence will be concealed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study Aims 
To determine if consuming Growing up milk lite (GUMLi) compared to standard cows milk improves nutritional status, cognitive development and body composition profile (and health outcomes) in 1-2 year olds. 

Specific Objectives 
1. To recruit an ethnically diverse sample of children aged prior to 1 year of age; 
2. Randomise children to receive GUMLi or cows milk and retain children in study on intervention for 12 months from 1 year of age (+/- 4 weeks); 
3. Measure anthropometry, biomarkers of macro- and micro- nutrient status, cognitive functioning, and dietary intake from 1 (+/- 4 weeks) year of age to 2 (+/- 4 weeks) years of age

Study hypotheses 
1. Children who consume GUMLi from age 1-2 years have a linear growth rate that is similar to children who consume cows milk from age 1-2 years and a % body fat increase that is less than children who consume cows milk from age 1-2 years. 
2. Children who consume GUMLi from age 1-2 years compared to children who consume cows milk from age 1-2 years will be less likely to have vitamin D and iron insufficiency as defined by measurement of relevant serum biomarkers. 
3. Children who consume GUMLi from age 1-2 years will have improved dietary profiles in comparison to children who consume cows milk from 1-2 years. 
4. Children who consume GUMLi milk from age 1-2 years will have better developmental scores on the Bayleys Scales of Infants Development in comparison to children who consume cows milk from 1-2 years.
