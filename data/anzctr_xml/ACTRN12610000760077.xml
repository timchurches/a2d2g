  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will have paired ulcers randomly treated with intradermal injection of cultured allogeneic fibroblasts (5 x10^6 per cm2) in a plasmalyte and 2% albumex solution. This will be performed during the baseline visit. 

Each paired ulcer site (placebo and treatment) will be treated with plasmalyte and 2% albumex solution injections or fibroblasts in a plasmalyte and 2% albumex solution.  These paired sites will be injected at the same time or shortly after one another during the baseline visit.

At 6 months, if the patient chooses to have the treatment sites re-treated with fibroblast injections, then the opportunity will be provided for patients to have this performed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome will be difference in area of the wound size from baseline to predetermined time points of the fibroblast injected wounds vs the placebo injected wounds. This will be achieved using the Visitrak wound measurement system [Smith &amp; Nephew Healthcare Ltd., Hull].  Wounds will be serially measured for ulcer size and healing will be determined based on reduction in ulcer size from baseline measurements.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over a 12 month period, patients are monitored at:
Baseline, Weeks 2,4,8,12,24,48.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the effect of cell therapy with cultured allogeneic fibroblasts on increasing the production of collagen VII in skin and restoration of normal skin electron microscopy ultrastructure (i.e. anchoring fibrils). Change in Col VII expression levels between base of ulcer at baseline and predetermined time points between the fibroblast injected ulcers and placebo injected ulcers. Collagen VII levels will determined via skin biopsies and direct immunofluorescence testing for collagen VII using LH7.2 and FNC1 antibodies to collagen VII. Anchoring fibril development will be determined via electron microscopy.</outcome>

Baseline, Weeks 2,4,8,12,24,48.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent change in size of wounds for each treatment group.
This will be achieved using the Visitrak wound measurement system [Smith &amp; Nephew Healthcare Ltd., Hull].  Wounds will be serially measured for ulcer size and healing will be determined based on reduction in ulcer size from baseline measurements. Percentage reduction will be mathematically calculated uby comparing ulcer sizes at each time point with baseline values.</outcome>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients with a diagnosis of RDEB-GS seen at St George Hospital (Kogarah) will be recruited for the study. This study will be offered to patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. Clinical investigators will discuss with the patient his/her diagnosis, risks and benefits of study participation, as well as treatment alternatives. All approached patients will be documented and consented by an investigator prior to enrolment on the study. Patients will be reassured that participation in the trial is voluntary, and that their decision would in no way influence their ongoing care. Patients have a screening biopsy of their inner arm which must have reduced but detectable collagen VII expression and no history of squamous cell carcinoma.
For each enrolled patient, two to eight symmetric wounds on each side of the body (arms, chest/abdomen, legs) of approximately the same size and duration (at least 4 cm2 as measured accurately by the Visitrak wound measurement system [Smith &amp; Nephew Healthcare Ltd., Hull], will be identified by a study dermatologist. Patients will then be scheduled for study treatment within a week. 

Each paired site will be treated with either fibroblast or placebo solution. It was determined ahead of time on test shipments that the cloudy nature of the fibroblast solution could best be concealed from the clinical investigators and patients by covering the syringes with several layers of parafilm. The sterile 2ml with 0.25ml gradations luer-lock syringes were pre-labelled A or B, covered with parafilm and given to the research pharmacist. The randomization code was generated according to a computer generated randomization list and ensured that A and B syringes did not remain for the same treatment for consecutive patients. The master randomization list was kept in an opaque sealed envelope at the Pharmacy, St George Hospital (Kogarah) until the completion of the study. The pharmacist drew up the active and placebo solutions into the pre-labelled syringes (A and B) and these were delivered to the procedure room for injection along with a sheet showing which site numbers these were to be injected into.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization code was a computer generated program which alternated A and B for each wound for up to 8 paired wounds per patient.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized, single-institution double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Enrolled patients with a diagnosis of RDEB-GS will be randomized to receive either cell therapy with intradermal injection of cultured allogeneic fibroblasts in transport media or placebo (i.e. transport media alone) on two to eight symmetrical wounds on each side of their body (arms, trunk, upper and lower legs).  

Up to 5 patients will be enrolled. All patients will undergo  clinical examination, photography and skin punch biopsies for immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies (if not previously done). The efficacy endpoint for the primary objective is median healing time of lesions for each treatment group (fibroblast-treated versus placebo). Secondary efficacy end points  are percentage change in size, change in appearance score (VAS), pain score (VAS) and pruritus score (VAS) of wounds for each treatment group. 
The efficacy endpoint for the co-primary objective are  quantitative change in  expression of collagen VII on immunofluorescence mapping and change in electron microscopy ultrastructure (i.e. numbers and appearance of anchoring fibrils) after cell therapy.</summary>
