  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Appropriate use of child restraints in children aged 3-5 years.  
An appropriate restraint is a forward facing child restraint (6 months - 4 years) and a booster seat (4-7 years).</healthcondition>
    <healthcondition>Misuse of child restraints in children aged 3-5 years.
Misuse of restraints can also degrade the level of protection provided in a crash. Restraint misuse is when the restraint system is not used as intended and can occur in both child restraints and adult seatbelts with or without booster seats. Examples include incorrect alignment of the belt and incorrect attachment of the restraint to the vehicle. Restraint misuse substantially increases injury risk.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Those centres allocated to the intervention will receive a targeted education and distribution program, incorporating targeted parent education including individual checking and installation advice, pre-school based information with reinforcement through teacher in-service workshops on curriculum appropriate programs and additional educational resources provided to centres.  
The educational component will be delivered under the badging of the Kids and Traffic program by early childhood educators and will include:
1.  Enhanced Kids and Traffic workshop for staff on child restraints.  This will be delivered on a single occasion at the beginning of the school year and will be run in the evening for 2 hours.
2.  Parent afternoon tea, with hands-on demonstration of child restraints.  Restraint checks by research assistants trained in restraint inspection and referral to Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) -certified restraint fitters for bolt fitting when required.  This will be run for 1 hour on several days to ensure that all parents have the opportunity to attend.
3.  Ongoing reinforcement and support to centre
Pamphlets and posters
Individualized brochures
Ongoing reinforcement with information in newsletters and updated posters and materials throughout year
Low cost restraint will be made available to those in need and will be subsidized to 25% of the recommended retail price (approximately $50).</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Kids and Traffic program, rather than enhanced program.  All child care centres in NSW are offered staff in-service workshops from Kids and Traffic on road safety.  These will continue to be available to control centres through newsletters and website information from Kids and Traffic.  
The workshops offered by Kids and Traffic are 2 hour evening workshops which are administered by trained educators from the Kids and Traffic Program.  The schedule can be accessed on the Kids and Traffic website: http://www.kidsandtraffic.mq.edu.au/ 
The workshops routinely available do not include a workshop dedicated to child restraint use.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Observed use of a child restraint which is appropriate for the child's age.
This will be assessed by research assistants who will observe restraint use in the car when children arrive at the centre.
An example of an inappropriate child restraint would be a 3 year old in a booster seat (rather than forward facing child restraint with harness) or a 4 year old in an adult seatbelt without a booster seat.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Observed misuse of a child restraint.
Misuse will be assessed by research assistants who will observe restraint use in the car when children arrive at the centre.
An example of misuse is child in a forward facing child restraint who has both arms out of the harness.</outcome>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Preschools and childcare centres will be invited to participate in this cluster randomised trial.  The director will be sent a letter, followed by a visit to the centre where information about the study design will be provided.  They will be advised that if they particiipate they could be allocated to the intervention or control group.  The director, as the authorised representative,  will sign a record of informed consent for the centre to participate in the study.
Group assignment will be randomly assigned by a non-blinded research assistant using the next sequentially-numbered opaque envelope containing group assignment.

Parents of children aged 3-5 years enrolled at the centre will be invited to complete an anonymous self-report questionnaire in the initial assessment.  In the final outcome assessment, parents of children aged 3-5 years enrolled at the centre will be invited to participate in an interview and inspection of child restraint use in their vehicle on arrival at the centre.  Informed consent will be gained from each participating parent.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization was by center. We used restricted randomization to balance service types (preschool or long daycare) and to limit differences in the proportion of children using age-appropriate restraints at baseline (self reported) to within 5% and families with household income &lt;AU$60,000 per annum, families who speak a language other than English at home and the number of children enrolled at the centers to within 10%, between the two arms of the study.  Randomization was performed by a study investigator (JS) who was not involved in recruitment or contact with the centers and who was blind to center identity.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see if hands-on demonstration of child restraints, seat distribution and explanation of the right child restraint for a pre-school child can increase the use of appropriate child restraints in children aged 3-5 years.  This program will be given to parents and guardians in their childs pre-school.  We will determine whether it works by comparing 14 pre-schools who get the program to 14 pre-schools who do not at the end of the school year.  The number of children correctly using appropriate child restraints will be compared between the two arms of the study.  
It is known that a large proportion of pre-school aged children are not in appropriate child restraints, and/or are not restrained correctly, increasing their risk of injury in road crashes.  We will develop and evaluate an educational intervention to increase correct and appropriate child restraint use in 3-5 year olds.  The study design is a cluster randomised controlled trial and this type of design is considered a gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention.  Each of 28 pre-schools involved in the study will be randomly allocated to either receive the intervention or to continue with usual road safety programming.  This randomised trial will be one of a small number of similar studies conducted internationally and the findings of this study will contribute important evidence for policy makers and road safety educators.</summary>
