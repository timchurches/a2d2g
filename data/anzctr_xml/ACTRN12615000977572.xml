    <interventions>Patients in this study have central venous access devices (CVADs) used in to assist treatment while they are admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit. Consenting parents or legal guardians, andpatients (if appropriate) will have their non- tunnelled  CVADs secured with one of the following randomly assigned dressings and securements:

Arm 1: Tissue Adhesive (TA) is a medical grade 'superglue'
(cyanoacrylate) used mainly to close skin lacerations/wounds as an alternative to sutures and staples. A bordered polyurethane dressing, prolene suture and a chlorhexidine-impregnated disc will also be applied.

Arm 2: Integrated dressing - securement product: extra-reinforced borders, with an absorbent layer around the polyurethane claimedto wickÂ moisture away from the wound. This will be used in addition to prolene suture and a chlorhexidine-impregnated disc.

Arm 3 (Control): Bordered polyurethane (BPU) dressings involve a clear polyurethane with an added external adhesive border of foam or cloth fabric. They will also have their CVAD secured with prolene sutures and a chlorhexidine-impregnated disc.

The randomly allocated dressing will be applied until completion of therapy, hospital discharge or at 4 weeks. The dressing will be applied at CVAD insertion and then changed every 7 days, or on disruption of the dressing integrity. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>All randomised patients will be analysed by intention to treat, regardless of treatment received. The patient is the unit of measurement with one CVAD per patient.
Feasibility outcomes will be described using descriptive statistics
including mean, median, range, IQR, counts and percentages.
Comparability of groups at baseline will be assessed using  clinical parameters. Relative incidence rates of CVAD  failure and complication per 100 devices and per 1,000 device days with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will summarise the impact of each dressing, and to test difference between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (with log rank Mantel-Cox test) will compare CVAD failure and complication over time. Secondary
endpoints including CVAD dwell-time, costs, dislodgement, occlusion, CVAD breakage, patient/staff satisfaction scores and adverse events will be compared between groups using parametric/nonparametric techniques as appropriate. Data will be exported into PASW 22.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Prior to analysis, data cleaning of outlying figures, missing, and implausible data will be undertaken, and a random 5% sample of source data rechecked. All attempts will be made to collect the primary endpoint. Missing data will be modelled for best- and worst-case outcomes to assess for effect on overall results. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol
violations. P values of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

Sample size and study power: This is a pilot study to gain information to prepare for an efficacy trial. Sixty participants per study arm will be recruited - totaling 180 participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit frequently require the insertion of a CVAD for the administration of medication and fluids. These CVADs are associated with a high rate of failure, including CVAD-related bloodstream infection (BSI). In order to prevent failure, dressings, such as bordered polyurethane (BPU) and chlorhexidine-impregnated discs, are used to protect the CVAD insertion site from contamination. Additional securement devices, such as sutures, are used to reduce movement of the
catheter. New products, including tissue adhesive (TA), and integrated securement and dressing products (ISD), are
available to clinicians to provide securement and dressings for CVAD. It is not known whether these new products are effective at reducing CVAD failure, in comparison to standard care (BPU and suture). The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the feasibility of launching a full-scale efficacy trial, using pre-defined feasibility criteria for recruitment,
retention and protocol fidelity. The secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of dressings and securement products on CVAD failure and complication due to infection, occlusion, dislodgement, thrombosis, or breakage, for children
with non-tunnelled CVAD in the paediatric intensive care.
