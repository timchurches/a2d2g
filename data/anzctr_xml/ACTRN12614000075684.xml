  <interventions>
    <interventions>One hundred farming participants (with self-reported hearing problems) will be allocated to either (a) the intervention group  (N=50), in which they will receive the Montreal Health Hearing Program (MHHP) via a workshop,  an on farm noise audit, and a follow up workshop or (b) the control group (N=50). Outcomes for each group will be tracked from pre-intervention to six month follow-up.

The MHHP will be delivered by Health Professionals trained in the MHHP and experienced in working with farming populations to the intervention group of farm men and women in addition to on-farm noise audits. The MHHP will occur over two days in 2 x 4 hour sessions in the participants local community. The first workshop will occur at the beginning of the intervention and the second workshop 6 months  later. 

The on-farm noise audit will be undertaken at the beginning of the intervention.  Field measurements will be carried out by trained health professionals using a CEL244 digital integrating Sound Level Meter, for the direct noise measurement for sampled farm activities and CEL-350/K4 dBadge personal noise exposure dosimeters in accordance with the measurement and calibration procedures provided in AS/NZS 1269.1: 2005.

 </interventions>
    <comparator>Farming participants allocated to the control group will not receive any workshop intervention (MHHP) from the research team. Data will be collected at baseline and 6 months. Control group will be offered an on-farm noise audit and sent  an information booklet on easier listening. Allocation will occur at an geographical level.  This design will be a partial single blind study, in which participants are unaware of interventions being implemented other than in their own setting.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in the impact of hearing loss on farmers and their families. 
Change will be assessed using pre and post survey tools measuring the social impact of hearing loss and mental health. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the commencement of the intervention and 6- 8 months  following the intervention change will be assessed on both the individual  and  partner/  family member using tools (surveys, focus groups and action plans). 

Mental health assessment 
The DASS-21, made up of three seven-item subscales that measure the three dimensions specified in Lovibond and Lovibonds (1995a) tripartite model of affect: low positive affect (Depression), physiological hyperarousal (Anxiety), and negative affect (Stress). 
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Farming participants capacity to reduce their noise exposure has increased. 
This will be measured following on-farm noise audit and completion of the workshops.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the commencement of the intervention and at 6-8 months  (following completion of the final workshop) using tools (surveys, focus groups and particpant action plans). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Registered nurses working with farm men and women are trained in the Montreal Health Hearing Program (MHHP) and have increased knowledge of hearing problems and are able to recognise symptoms of hearing loss including personal and social reactions and responses.  Participating health providers will complete pre and post training surveys  to assess  
1. Knowledge of hearing problems and their 
2. Understanding of the social impact of noise induced hearing loss </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An estimated 4 million Australians have a hearing loss. People with hearing loss are reluctant to seek or accept help for their hearing and listening problems. The literature shows that this reluctance is driven by a fear of stigmatisation and serves as a major barrier to the effective delivery of services which have been designed to reduce the health and social impacts of  hearing loss.  A population group at risk are farmers with two out of three affected by hearing loss. Permanent hearing damage can be caused by prolonged exposure to noise or immediately by sudden, extremely loud or explosive noises. There are many different and unique sources of noise on farms.
This project tests the hypothesis that participating in early intervention hearing services focussed towards farming families will contribute to (a) significant reduction in the impact of hearing loss on farmers and (b) educate and empower farmers on their capacity to reduce their noise exposure.</summary>
