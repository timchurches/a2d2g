  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive print-based materials and telephone follow-up designed to increase  physical activity participation for 12-weeks.   Telephone follow-up and print materials mailout will occur weekly for one month, with fortnightly contact for the last two months.  All physical activity will be home-based.  Constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior informed the intervention materials.</interventions>
    <comparator>The attention control group will receive phone calls during the intervention period to ask about their general health and well being over 12-weeks. At 6-months, following the final questionnaire assessment the control group will receive all print-based materials.</comparator>

Assignments will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes and designated colours will be assigned for each group. The subject will open these envelopes after completion of all baseline testing. Subjects who dropout prior to completion of baseline testing will not be randomised.</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects are randomised after the baseline assessment has been completed to: 1. Physical activity interevntion or 2.  attention control. Randomisation is at the level of the individual patient. Patients will be stratified on gender (male/female) and age (&lt;65 / greater than or equal to 65) The list will be generated and maintained by a research assistant not otherwise involved in the study. The sequential treatment assignments are based on a computer-generated randomisation scheme (by using the Web site www.randomization.com set up by Dr Gerard E. Dallal).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the if telephone support and print materials can increase physical activity participation in lung cancer survivors .

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer, have no metastatic disease, and are no longer on treatment.

Trial details.
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will receive print-based materials and telephone follow-up designed to increase physical activity participation for 12-weeks.  The other group will receive print-based materials and telephone follow-up for 12-weeks to ask about their general health and well being. After this time participants in this group will be given print-materials designed to increase physical activity levels.

Participants will complete questionnaires about physical activity levels, fatigue and quality of life as well as wear a physical activity monitor at baseline,3 months and six months.  It is thought that the intervention will increase physical activity participation when compared to the control.</summary>
