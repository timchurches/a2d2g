  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a single blind randomised controlled trial investigating whether response to repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) can be substantially enhanced through the use of an accelerated Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) treatment protocol. The relative efficacy of standard rTMS and  two different strengths of TBS will be compared to explore this, and the most effective TBS treatment parameters.

Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three treatment conditions: 
	standard rTMS 
	standard intensity TBS, or
	high intensity TBS.

All groups will receive 20 active treatments. All participants will take part in weekly interviews over four weeks, with a one month follow up. Participants responding to the treatment will be followed up for six months. The participant and the treater will be aware of the treatment condition. The person conducting weekly reviews will be blinded to the participants treatment group.

Treatment

Standard rTMS
Participants in standard rTMS will receive one treatment a day for 20 treatment days over 4 weeks. Each treatment session will involve the provision of 75 trains of 10 Hz rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in 4 second pulse trains, with 26 second inter-train intervals. Each treatment session will take approximately 37.5 minutes. 

TBS treatment
Participants in the TBS groups will receive 11 sessions over 4 days in week 1 (2 sessions on day 1, and 3 sessions each on days 2, 3 and 4), and 9 sessions over 3 days in week 2 (3 sessions per day). Each treatment session will involve 3-pulse 50 Hz bursts applied bilaterally, to the right then left to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, at 5 Hz (ie 50 Hz burst of 3 pulses delivered every 200 msec). Right sided cTBS will involve a continuous 600 pulse sequence over 40 seconds. Left sided iTBS will involve a 2-seconds of TBS repeated every 10 seconds (i.e. 2 seconds of TBS followed by an 8 second rest), delivered over 180 seconds. Each TBS treatment session will take approximately 4 minutes. Where multiple sessions are provided in one day, there will be a minimum of 15 minutes break between the treatment sessions.

Both rTMS and TBS treatments involve the application of magnetic stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). During treatment patients will be reclined in a comfortable chair and will be alert and awake. The sensation associated with treatment is usually well tolerated, with most people describing it as a tapping sensation. The treatment intensity for each person for both rTMS and TBS is determined as a percentage of their resting motor threshold (RMT), which is measured by administering single pulse TMS to the motor cortex (area of the brain responsible for muscle control). Standard rTMS treatment will be applied at 120% of the RMT, standard intensity TBS at 80% of the RMT, and high intensity TBS at 120% of the RMT.  All treatments will be conducted by a qualified TMS nurse. Participants will be monitored at all times, and each treatment time, date and dosage will be logged on a participant's treatment sheet. Intervention adherence and fidelity will be monitored by the TMS accredited nursing staff providing the treatments, and study personnel, including Principal and Associated Investigators, who are trained in the provision and clinical supervision of rTMS/TBS therapy.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study aim is to investigate whether accelerated TBS is as efficacious as standard daily rTMS, and the most effective TBS treatment parameters. Standard unilateral left high frequency rTMS is the comparator treatment. Standard and high intensity TBS will also be compared. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis will take place after all participants, apart from those who may have withdrawn, have had their final assessments. This analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle (i.e. subjects will be analysed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomised and the notified stratum to which they belonged at randomisation).  A per protocol sensitivity analysis will be restricted to participants who did not have a major protocol deviation.  Major protocol deviations will be identified prior to database lock. 

The primary analysis will compare the proportion of patients who achieve response criteria 2 weeks after commencement of treatment (chi square test) on the QIDS (defined as a 50% reduction in total score).

Following this, a repeated measurements of all the outcome variables will be analysed by fitting linear mixed models using restricted maximum likelihood (REML).

With regard to the secondary hypothesis, to demonstrate non inferiority in the overall efficacy of the accelerated TBS and standard rTMS approaches, we will calculate and report the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between the treatment arms in their mean QIDS levels at week 8.  Additional exploratory secondary analyses will be conducted on the secondary measures including suicidality and quality of life using the same mixed model approach. 

The projected sample size was based on hypothesised response rates after the initial two weeks of treatment:
-	Results from previous studies indicate TBS will induce more rapid treatment 
        response than standard rTMS.
-	At 2 weeks, there will therefore be a greater proportion of treatment responders 
       in the TBS group than the rTMS group.
-	At 2 weeks, we predict a response rate of:
--~45% in the TBS group (expected response rate after a full course of rTMS treatment)
--~20% in the rTMS group (based on previous study response rates)
-	Comparing these proportions with a power of 0.9 requires a sample size of 79 
        per group.
-	Recruiting 90 patients per group allows for a 12% drop out rate (typical drop out 
        rates in our studies are &lt;10%).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is a common, severe and often difficult to treat illness. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, is an effective and well tolerated treatment for depression. TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate and change the activity in areas of the brain related to depression, using a specialised coil placed on the head while the patient is awake and alert. Although TMS is effective, it takes a long time to induce clinical response, often 4-6 weeks. This limits its applicability in clinical practice and is associated with considerable treatment costs. Response to rTMS can be accelerated with intensive treatment schedules involving a number of treatments a day, but these are also time consuming. Theta burst stimulation (TBS), a type of TMS, appears to produce similar effects to standard TMS when applied on a daily basis but with markedly less time demands (3 minutes compared to 40 minutes per session). TBS would appear to be an ideal intervention to use in an intensive / accelerated format where multiple daily sessions could be applied but still in a limited amount of time. However, the optimal TBS treatment parameters, such as treatment intensity, are still unknown and require investigation. This study is therefore a randomised controlled trial to compare an accelerated TBS intervention to standard once daily TMS to evaluate its relative effectiveness and rapidity of antidepressant effect. We will also compare the relative efficacy of two different strengths of TBS to investigate the most effective TBS treatment parameters. Participants will receive 20 sessions of lower intensity TBS, higher intensity TBS or standard TMS over a 2 - 4 week period. Participants will take part in weekly interviews over four weeks, with a one month follow up. Participants responding to the treatment will be followed up for six months.</summary>
