  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prior to the operation and following application of emlar cream, 0.2-0.6 ml of 60-MBq technetium-99mlabeled nanocolloid (or similar) is injected by the surgeon intradermally in 4 locations around the primary tumour (0.05 ml each in each site) or clearly identifiable scar from recent excision biopsy. XRay pictures are then taken over the next 2 1/2 hours to identify the first appearing persistent focal accumulation or sentinel node. The site of the sentinel node is marked on the overlying skin. 
On the day or the afternoon after the injection of the radioactive tracer, following induction of anesthesia for surgery, approximately 0.5-1.0 ml of the blue dye (eg. Patente blue-V) is injected intradermally on the same 4 locations around the primary tumor approximately 5-10 minutes prior to the surgical procedure. The surgical procedure starts with identification and removal of the sentinel nodes. During the operation a handheld gamma-ray-detection probe is used to confirm the marked area of greatest activity in the groin. A small skin incision is made at the marked spot and a sentinel node excision biopsy is performed using the handheld gamma-ray detector and by dissection of blue-stained lymph vessels. Sentinel nodes are sent to the pathologist. Subsequently resection of the vulvar lesion is performed. 
Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. If women do not wish to take part in this study, they will receive one standard management of early vulval carcinoma which is wide excision or vulvectomy and removal of all groin nodes. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Considerations.
The following matters are taken into consideration.
a)	Vulval carcinoma is a rare disease.
b)	GROINSS study revealed a recurrence rate of 2.3% following negative sentinel nodes.
c)	Expected node positivity rate between 10 and 30 %
d)	A groin recurrence rate of greater than 5% in women with negative sentinel nodes would be considered unacceptable. 
e)	Successful recruitment accrual within 3 years will depend on the initiation of several sites in New Zealand and Australia. With 24 months follow up the audit will be completed within 6 years.

It would be prudent to plan the study to allow for the possibility that centres may differ somewhat, because of differences in treatment regimes or in the characteristics of patients. The statistical impact of clustering within centres is captured by the DEFF (design effect) which is the ratio of the variance of an estimate from a complex sample compared with that from a simple random sample.
DEFF = 1 + (m-1)p  where m is the average cluster size (n per centre), and 
p(rho) is the coefficient of intra-class correlation
Let m=13 and 
p=.03 (a lowish value as patient within a centre would not be expected to be much more similar to each other than to patients at other centres)
DEFF = 1 + (13-1)*.03 = 1.36
Therefore the number required for the 95% CI to be below 5% would be 280*1.36 = 380.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to prospectively collect clinical data following sentinel node biopsy for vulval carcinoma in Australia and New Zealand. You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or above with histologically confirmed, unifocal invasive squamous cell carcinoma of vulva less than 4cm in greatest dimension. 
Women in Australia and New Zealand women with early vulval cancer will be offered sentinel node procedures in place of groin node dissection. 
On the day before or the morning of your operation, you will have a small injection of a radioactive marker into the skin next to the cancer. A local anaesthetic cream will be used to reduce any discomfort from this injection. Pictures will then be taken over the next 2 1/2 hours to see which glands the marker has spread to. The marker will also help us find the sentinel nodes during your operation.
Either on the afternoon after the injection or the next day you will have your operation as planned by your doctor. Whilst you are asleep we will inject some blue dye around the cancer which will also help us to identify the sentinel glands. During the 60 minute operation we will remove the cancer. We will identify and remove the sentinel lymph gland(s) from one or both groins. When sentinel nodes in one or two groins can not be identified a full removal of the groin nodes (lymphadenectomy) on either one or both sides will be performed. The gland(s) will be sent to the laboratory for detailed assessment by the pathologist. 
Follow up clinical data will be collected from your clinical records at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months after surgery, from information obtained when you attend outpatients clinic. 
The majority of women with early vulval carcinoma do not have groin node metastasis and these women are unlikely to benefit from groin node dissection.  The use of sentinel node dissection is safe and should be part of the standard treatment for women with early stage vulvar cancer.
