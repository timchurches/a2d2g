  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The participants will be randomised by a computerized randomization program. Only the IT person who writes the codes to implement the proposed randomised allocation has permission to access the randomization program.  This is an open label trial because blinding of the participants to study medication allocation will not be possible as usual care is used as the comparator. However laboratory assessment of the cholesterol primary endpoint will be blind to group allocation.  After the study has finished and during the review of the results within the study team, all investigators will be blinded to treatment allocation (all results will be presented as treatment A and B). The results will remain blinded until the final statistical report has been completed.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computerized randomization program which employs the minimization method will be used to generate the random allocation sequence. The stratification factors are: PHO, cardiovascular history (yes; no), level of baseline prescribing (i.e. whether or not the participant was being prescribed combination therapy â€“ aspirin, statin, and two blood pressure lowering agents - prior to entry into the study), and ethnicity (Maori; non Maori). When a new participant comes to randomisation, we first determine his/her status for each of the stratification factors. We then count the number of participants who have the same status as the new participant in the intervention group and the control group. The new participant will be allocated in favor to the group that has smaller number of participants (p&gt;0.5). If the numbers of participants who have the same status as the new participant are the same in the two groups, the new participant will be allocated to either the intervention or the control group at equal probability (p=0.5).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of hospitalisation and premature death in New Zealand and the main reason for shorter life expectancy among Maori. The latest New Zealand guidelines recommend people at high risk of CVD receive long-term aspirin and medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, which together would cut CVD risk by around two-thirds. However most people do not receive all these medications, often because of cost, complexity and a reluctance to take (or to prescribe) multiple pills. This primary care-based trial aims to assess whether a single combination capsule (the Red Heart Pill) improves adherence to these effective medications and reduces costs compared to standard practice. Individuals will be allocated at random to receive the Red Heart Pill or to usual care. Most cardiovascular deaths occur among the group targeted in this trial, and so this new preventive approach could reduce the overall impact of CVD in New Zealand.</summary>
