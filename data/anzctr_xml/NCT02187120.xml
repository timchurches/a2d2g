  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tranexamic Acid
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Tranexamic Acid - As soon as possible after injury, emergency medical services clinicians will administer 1g Tranexamic Acid (10ml ampoule containing 100mg/ml Tranexamic Acid in water for injection) delivered intravenously using a slow push of the syringe.
As soon as possible after the patient arrives at hospital, clinicians will administer 1g Tranexamic acid (10ml ampoule containing 100mg/ml Tranexamic Acid in water for injection) added to up to one litre 0.9%w/v Sodium Chloride and the entire volume infused intravenously over 8 hours.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - As soon as possible after injury, emergency medical services clinicians will administer a 10ml ampoule containing 0.9%w/v Sodium Chloride via intravenous injection using a slow push of the syringe (ampoules containing Sodium Chloride appear identical to the ampoules containing Tranexamic Acid).
As soon as possible after the patient arrives at hospital, clinicians will administer a second 10 ml ampoule containing 0.9%w/v Sodium Chloride added to up to one litre 0.9%w/v Sodium Chloride and the entire volume infused intravenously over 8 hours.


Treatment: drugs: Tranexamic Acid
Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine derivative that inhibits fibrinolysis by blocking the lysine binding sites on plasminogen therefore inhibiting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Intravenous injection of 1g Tranexamic Acid will be administered in the pre-hospital setting followed by 1g Tranexamic Acid infused intravenously over 8 hours initiated in the hospital emergency department.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research is to determine whether giving severely injured adults a drug
      called tranexamic acid (TXA) as soon as possible after injury will improve their chances of
      survival and their level of recovery at six months.

      After severe injury, a person may have uncontrolled bleeding that places them at high risk of
      bleeding to death. Coagulation (the formation of blood clots) is an important process in the
      body that helps to control blood loss. Up to a quarter of people that are severely injured
      have a condition called acute traumatic coagulopathy. This condition affects coagulation and
      results in the break down of blood clots (fibrinolysis) that can lead to increased blood loss
      and an increased risk of dying.

      TXA is an anti-fibrinolytic drug that might help to reduce the effects of acute traumatic
      coagulopathy by preventing blood clots from breaking down and helping to control bleeding. In
      Australia, TXA is approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to reduce
      blood loss or the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing surgery (i.e. cardiac
      surgery, knee or hip arthroplasty). Recent evidence from a large clinical trial (CRASH-2)
      showed early treatment with TXA reduced the risk of death in severely injured patients,
      however the majority of patients involved in the study were injured in countries where
      prehospital care is limited and rapid access to lifesaving treatments is limited compared to
      that available in countries like Australia and New Zealand. It is unclear whether TXA will
      reduce the risk of death to the same degree when it is given alongside other lifesaving
      treatments that are available to patients soon after injury in these countries.

      The hypothesis is that TXA given early to injured patients who are at risk of acute traumatic
      coagulopathy and who are treated in countries with systems providing advanced trauma care
      reduces mortality and improves recovery at 6-months after injury.</summary>
