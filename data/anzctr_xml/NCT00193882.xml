  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To compare the treatment of gullet cancer with radiotherapy alone and assess the advantage
      and toxicity of adding chemotherapy. The hypothesis to be tested is as follows: That the
      addition of chemotherapy to a short course of radiation treatment improves the proportion of
      patients who achieve relief of dysphagia and improves quality of life compared to radiation
      alone in patients with advanced oesophageal cancer.</summary>
