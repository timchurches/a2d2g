             IEC;

          3. Good health, as determined by medical history, and a targeted physical examination;

          4. For participants aged &lt; 9 years, born after a normal gestation period (between 36 and
             42 weeks);

          5. Females of childbearing potential (defined as having experienced their first menstrual
             cycle) must be abstinent or be using adequate contraceptive precautions e.g.
             intrauterine contraceptive device, oral contraceptive, or equivalent hormonal
             contraception (e.g., progestogen-only implant, vaginal contraceptive ring, cutaneous
             hormonal patch or injectable contraceptives) for at least 2 months after vaccination.
             Females aged = 9 years must also return a negative urine pregnancy test at enrolment.</inclusivecriteria>

             chicken protein, neomycin, polymyxin, or any components of the Study Vaccine;

          2. Clinical signs of significant active infection and/or an elevated temperature (=
             38.0°C oral or = 37.5°C axillary) at study entry;

          3. Vaccination against influenza virus in the previous 6 months with a seasonal IVV;

          4. Vaccination with an experimental IVV (e.g. a candidate pandemic IVV or a novel IVV) in
             the previous 6 months;

               -  For chronic conditions: the Investigator feels that the chronic condition is
                  unstable, such as illness exacerbations within the previous month:

                  i. requiring hospitalisation; ii. with significant organ function deterioration;
                  iii. with major changes to treatment dosages; iv. requiring major new treatments;
                  or

             human immunodeficiency virus infection);

             oral prednisolone or equivalent daily; ii. Age 9 years and above: = 15 mg/day of oral
             prednisolone or equivalent daily;

              Sporadic corticosteroids: i. Age less than 9 years: = 1 mg/kg/day of oral
             prednisolone or equivalent for 2 or more short courses of &gt; 3 days in the 3 months
             preceding vaccination; ii. Age 9 years and above: = 40 mg/day of oral prednisolone or
             equivalent for two or more short courses of &gt; 3 days in the 3 months preceding
             vaccination; Note: Use of topical or inhalant corticosteroids prior to administration
             of the Study Vaccine or throughout the Study is acceptable

         13. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the Study Vaccine or during the study;

             receiving the Study Vaccine or entry into such a study during the on study period;

         16. Evidence, or history (within the previous 12 months) of drug or alcohol abuse;
