  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will each perform three periods of 10 minutes of External Cardiac Compressions (ECC), swapping with their partner (research assistant) every 2 minutes as recommended by the Australian Resuscitation Council.  

Each participant will perform on a resuscitation practice manikin:
1.	ECC with room air (control: ECC-RA)
2.	ECC with air via Nasal Cannula (NC) at 4 litres per minute (inspired oxygen fraction 21%)(intervention 1: ECC-A)
3.	ECC with oxygen via NC at 4 litres per minute (estimated inspired oxygen fraction 36%)(intervention 2: ECC-O)

The NC will be administered administered continuously for the full 10 minutes of CPR. A washout period of 20 minutes will be performed between each arm.

    <statisticalmethods>Mean time to fatigue (defined as the instant the rescuers quality of ECC dropped below the accepted benchmark) will be the primary outcome of interest and will be compared between study arms using an independent t test. Changes within individuals will be analysed using a paired t test.

Global ratings (comfort and convenience) will be treated as ordinal variables, and will be described using medians and inter-quartile ranges and compared between groups using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests.

Statistical significance will be set at alpha=0.05.

We require 32 participants to ensure a power of 80% with an alpha level set at 5%. This calculation is based on a clinically important difference of 30 seconds and a standard deviation (of the difference in time to inadequate CPR for each participant) of 60 seconds.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Performing chest compressions for patients in cardiac arrest is tiring, and as rescuers become more tired their performance has been shown to deteriorate.  Quality of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), especially chest compressions, is adversely affected by fatigue and is one of the few factors shown to be independently associated with the likelihood of a person surviving a cardiac arrest.  The administration of supplemental low flow oxygen to a rescuer via nasal cannula may slow their fatigue, and increase the length of time that that the rescuer is able to provide good quality chest compressions.  We intend to undertake a study to assess the effectiveness of supplemental low flow oxygen on healthy, volunteer rescuers in improving their quality and length of performance of chest compressions on a resuscitation manikin.</summary>
