    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from advertisements in the media and from flyers within the Alfred Hospital and Monash University web site. All participants will have voluntarily provided their telephone details before being contacted by the Research Unit.
Participants will initially be contacted by telephone by researchers working on the study. They will be assessed with regards to their suitability to be involved in the study. Those who are deemed suitable will be mailed the participant information sheet to read at their leisure. Those patients who wish to participate will be instructed to contact the Trial Co-ordinator to arrange a visit to the Womenâ€™s Health Program, Monash Medical School, Alfred Hospital, for a screening visit.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Primary Objective of this study is to determine whether treatment of older postmenopausal women (55 to 65 years old) with transdermal testosterone gel (Libigel Registered Trademark) which delivers 300mcg of testosterone/day, improves cognitive performance.

Study Hypotheses
That restoration of testosterone levels in older postmenopausal women to levels seen in younger women will result in improved verbal and visual learning and memory using a highly sensitive measure of cognitive performance (Cogstate Trademark).
That this research will provide the first substantial data indicating that restoration of testosterone levels to those of younger women may protect against/delay the onset of cognitive decline.</summary>
