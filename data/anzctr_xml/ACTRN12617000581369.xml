  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventions, the Wellbeing Neuro Course, is an internet-delivered self-management program, which consists of'

(a)	6 online lessons provided over 10 weeks. The Lessons will include information about identifying symptoms of poor wellbeing including mental health and cognitive difficulties, and teach practical skills for their self- management including; managing thoughts, low mood and anxiety, problem solving, memory and attention, and activity and fatigue levels. 
(b)	Worksheets for each lesson.
(c)	Additional written resources that can be downloaded, which include information about other important skills, such as problem solving common cognitive difficulties, assertiveness and communication skills and techniques for managing sleep difficulties.
(d)	Case stories based on previous participants, which they can follow throughout the Course.
(e)	Brief weekly contact with a psychologist via secure email or telephone.

Participants will be encouraged to complete a lesson every 10 days and complete some basic homework in the following 10 days. Participants will be contacted by a psychologist each week to monitor their mood and progress through the Course; each eCentreClinic Psychologist receives 1 hour or more of weekly supervision from another eCentreClinic Psychologist in which all of their participants are reviewed; as per best-practice guidelines and eCentreClinic Policy.

The Wellbeing Neuro Course is based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) principles and teaches evidence-based skills for managing the impacts of neurological conditions on day-to-day activities and overall mental health. Each lesson takes between 10 and 20 minutes to complete and it is suggested that participants read each lesson at least twice and spend approximately 4 hours, across the week, practicing the skills taught. Telephone calls will be limited to approximately 10 minutes per week; however, more time will be provided where clinically indicated. Adherence (e.g., logins, lesson completion, lesson views, time spent on course) will be monitored via the eCentreClinic software, which is used to provide the Wellbeing Neuro Course.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>With alpha set at .05, power set at .80 and a sample size of 100, the study is well powered to enable the detection of moderate-to-large effect size (i.e., Cohens d &gt; 0.50) differences in clinical measures from pre-treatment to post-treatment and follow-up.  
Subgroup analyses be utilised to assess change in the clinical outcomes from pre-treatment to post-treatment and 3-month follow up for certain, of interest, subgroups. For example, the efficacy and acceptability of the course will be assessed for neurological condition type sub-groups (e.g., epilepsy, MS, TBI, stroke, Parkinson's Disease). Sub-group analyses will also assess treatment effects for participants with baseline levels of anxiety, depression and disability within the clinical ranges separately from the overall sample. Clinical levels of baseline symptoms will be based on the published literature e.g., depression (PHQ-9&gt;9), anxiety (GAD-7 &gt;9) and disability levels (WHODAS 2.0 within the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles). All analyses will be carried out using conservative intention-to-treat principles and using generalised equation (GEE) models to handle missing data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the proposed project is to examine the acceptability, efficacy and feasibility of a low-intensity CBT-based self-management program, the Wellbeing Neuro Course to support the emotional and cognitive health of adults with neurological conditions. The proposed trial employs a single-group open-trial design (n = 100) and participants will be given access to a modified version of an established self-management Course for managing depression, anxiety and disability associated with chronic conditions (the Chronic Conditions Course). The Course contains a 6-lesson 10-week internet delivered program. Participants will have brief weekly contact with a clinical psychologist as they work through the Course. A single-group open-trial feasibility design will be employed; all participants are provided full and immediate access to the Wellbeing Neuro Course and are asked to complete standardised questionnaires at 3 main time points: Pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. </summary>
