  <interventions>
    <interventions>ForSight Ocular System (drug/device combination product) will be placed in eye. Product contains prostaglandin which elutes with one of two dose over six month period. Dose is higher at beginning of use of product and gradually declines as drug elutes from product, as is typical for drug-eluting products. Maximum daily dose will not exceed levels tested in prior clinical studies. One dose will start under 100 mcg/day (maximum amount tested in prior clinical use) and will decline toward 0 mcg/day by end of study period. One dose will start under 50 mcg/day and will decline toward 0 mcg/day by end of study period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two doses will be used for a comparative dosing study. One dose will start under 100 mcg/day (maximum amount tested in prior clinical use) and will decline toward 0 mcg/day by end of study period. One dose will start under 50 mcg/day and will decline toward 0 mcg/day by end of study period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean IOP using Goldman tonometry during morning, noon, and afternoon at Screening, Roll-in, Day 0, 2 week, 6 week, 12 week, 16 week (and for higher dose) Months 5 and 6.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In-office visits at Day 0, 2 week, 6 week, 12 week, 16 week (and for higher dose) Months 5 and 6.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will also be assessed in terms of ocular and systemic AEs as determined by eye exam. AEs may include erythema, corneal scratch, lid edema.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In-office visits at Week 16 (lower dose) or Month 6 (higher dose) and either at Screening (if on standard medical therapy prior to study start) or 4 weeks after study product on standard medical therapy. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy as measured by ocular tonometry at 16 weeks (lower dose) or 6 months (higher dose)and either at Screening with standard medical therapy or at 4 weeks with standard medical therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks (lower dose) and 6 months (higher dose) and standard medical therapy either at Screening or 4 weeks after use of study product.</timepoint>
