    <studytitle>A randomised trial assessing the acceptability and effectiveness of providing generic versus tailored feedback about health risks for a high need primary care sample</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Do high need primary care patients (those attending an Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service) rate tailored health risk feedback provided before their GP appointment as more acceptable (in terms of easy to understand, relevant and will help improve health) than generic feedback, and is tailored feedback more effective in terms of being shown and discussed with the patient's GP than generic health risk feedback?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants were invited by a Research Assistant (RA) to complete a health risk survey while waiting for their GP appointment. Immediately following completion of the survey (and also prior to their appointment), the RA provided participants with either tailored feedback (intervention group) or generic feedback (control group). The health risk survey was developed for the study and assessed the following risk factors: overweight (based on measured height and weight), and self reported: smoking, physical inactivity, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, excess alcohol consumption, drug use, depression and under screening for blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and cervical, breast and colorectal cancer (according to age and gender). Survey items were drawn from previously validated measures or other national health surveys where possible. The survey took an average of 11 minutes to complete with the majority of participants completing the survey in less than 20 minutes. The tailored feedback was generated using study specific software and was based on individual survey responses, showing only those risk factors for which the participant was classified as at risk according to national guidelines or other cut offs. Tailored feedback showed the participant's current behaviour compared to that recommended in national guidelines. For example, for overweight participants, the tailored feedback displayed their current weight and a healthy weight for them (based on a BMI calculation of 25kg/m2). Generation and printing of the tailored feedback took approximately 2 minutes. Generic feedback included general guidelines covering all of the risk factors included in the survey, and was pre-printed and therefore provided to the participant immediately after survey completion. Both types of feedback also included simple advice about addressing health risks. For example, for weight, advice included tips for eating a healthy diet, doing more exercise, and advised talking to their GP for further help. All participants were instructed that they could show the feedback to their GP during their routine appointment if they wanted, and to ask their GP if they had any questions about the feedback. Participants had any remaining waiting time before their appointment to review the feedback. It was the choice of the participant and/or their GP about whether to discuss or take any other actions about the health risk feedback, including whether to schedule a follow-up appointment. Outcomes of the participant's appointment were assessed using an participant exit survey immediately following the participant's appointment with their GP. The exit survey took less than five minutes to complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants (control and intervention) completed the same health risk survey (as described above). Generic feedback was also provided by the Research Assistant immediately following completion of the survey and prior to the participant attending their GP appointment. As noted above, the generic feedback included current guidelines for all health risks included in the survey and simple advice for addressing these risk factors. Control group participants were also instructed that they could show the feedback to their GP during their routine appointment if they wanted, and to ask their GP if they had any questions about the feedback. It was the choice of the participant and/or their GP about whether to discuss or take any other actions about the health risk feedback, including whether to schedule a follow-up appointment. As for the intervention group, outcomes of the participant's appointment were assessed using an participant exit survey immediately following the participant's appointment with their GP. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to assess the acceptability and effectiveness of providing real time tailored feedback, compared to generic feedback, to patients of Aboriginal Medical Services about their health behaviour risk factors. Participants could choose to show or discuss the feedback with their GP. The provision of tailored feedback to patients pre-consultation is designed to promote opportunities for both the patient and GP or health worker to consider the patients health risks and initiate actions to modify these risk factors. The study represents a novel approach to health promotion for the Indigenous population. Such an approach minimises the amount of time demanded of GPs and other clinic staff in screening for risk factors and potentially encourages the discussion of risk factors between the patient and GP, while also increasing the probability that patients are aware of their health status and are receptive to specific advice to from their GP. 

The acceptability of providing personalised feedback compared to generic feedback to patients on their self reported health risk behaviours, was assessed in terms participant assessment of the utility of the feedback and whether participants showed the feedback to their GP or otherwise used the feedback during their appointment; The effectiveness of personalised feedback compared to generic feedback was assessed in terms of increasing rates of discussion or action (such as referral or follow up appointment) on risk factors during the consultation between the GP and participant.</summary>
