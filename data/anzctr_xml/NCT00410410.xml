      <outcome>MP; Mean Change From Baseline to Month 12 in IBDQ - The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) was used to measure disease specific quality of life. The IBDQ consists of a self-administered 32-item questionnaire that evaluates quality of life across 4 dimensional scores: Bowel, Systemic, Social and Emotional. The response to each question can range from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating severe problem and 7 indicating normal health. The total IBDQ is computed as the sum of the responses to the individual IBDQ questions. The total score can range between 32 to 224 with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</outcome>

      <outcome>MP; Mean Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Short Form-36 (SF-36) - The SF-36 is a validated instrument to measure health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. Individual subscale scores and 2 summary scores are calculated: (1) physical component summary (PCS) which includes physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; (2) mental component summary (MCS) which includes vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight, with values ranging from worse health (0) to best health (100).</outcome>
