  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial uses an existing mindfulness app (Smiling Mind) which was identified as a high-quality app in a recent review*. The app is available for free on both Android and iOS platforms.

*Mani, M., Kavanagh, D. J., Hides, L., &amp; Stoyanov, S. R. (2015). Review and evaluation of mindfulness-based iPhone apps. JMIR mHealth and uHealth, 3(3), e82.

The Smiling Mind app has a 10-week mindfulness program comprising 5-10 mins of voice-guided meditation for each week. The app recommends daily mindfulness practice for 2-7 days after each weekly session before proceeding with the next session.

Eligible participants are randomly allocated to Immediate access, Immediate access with Reminders or 6-week Delayed access to the Smiling Mind app. The immediate access groups will use the app upon completing the baseline survey while the wait-list controls will get the link to the app after 6-weeks. Participants will use the app for a period of 6 weeks. They won't be advised of frequency or duration of usage of the app. The Reminders group will receive weekly phone calls (lasting around 5 minutes) by the primary researcher to share their experience with the app and will be reminded about the importance of regular mindfulness practice.

Mental wellbeing, distress, mindfulness and happiness will be measured at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 weeks. App usage frequency will be collected by self-reports.</interventions>
    <comparator>A waitlist control will be used for comparison. The app will be given to the waitlist controls 6 weeks later than the experimental groups.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is now substantial evidence that mindfulness training improves wellbeing. Smartphones have become an integral part of young peoples daily life. Smartphone applications (apps) can potentially serve as an intervention medium to improve youths mental health. While there are many mobile phone apps on mindfulness, there is little evidence on the efficacy of these apps. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a high qualtiy mindfulness app through a 6-week delayed treatment randomized controlled trial.

A sample of 150 young people who experience at least mild level of distress (scoring between 17 and 50 in Kessler 10) will be recruited for the trial. The primary outcome variable is wellbeing, measured by the Mental Health Continuum  Short Form (MHC-SF) and the secondary outcome variables are distress, measured by Kessler-10 (K10), mindfulness, measured by Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale - Revised (CAMS-R) and happiness, measured by Oxford Happiness Questionnaire - Short form (OHQ-SF). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 weeks follow up.</summary>
