  <interventions>
    <interventions>The technique used in the intervention consists in stretching the muscular fibres of the thoracic diaphragm. The patient lies on a stretcher in supine position with the legs bent and together, the soles of the feet leaning on the stretcher, the arms relaxed in parallel with the body and a little pillow under the head (it improves patient's comfort). The physiotherapist stands at the head of the stretcher in a front stance looking towards the feet of the patient. The contact is made using both hands with the pisiform bone and the cubital edge of the fingers (2nd to 5th) on the side edge comprising the common cartilage between the 7th and the 10th rib and facing the forearm towards the corresponding shoulder of the patient. Swinging both hands to penetrate the internal area of the side cartilage and the ribs. The physioterapist makes a cephalic traction using his hands and the weight of his body while the patient inhales. The traction is held while the patient exhales in order to maintain the side position and avoid the descent of the ribs. The technique is carried out in a single session, making a succession of 10 breathing cycles (each cycle consists of one inhalation phase and one exhalation phase).</interventions>
    <comparator>Same technique but without making the cephalic traction. This way, the patient's breathing cycle continues with no influence. The technique is carried out in a single session, making a succession of 10 breathing cycles (each cycle consists of one inhalation phase and one exhalation phase).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of the trial is to verify the effectiveness of the thoracic diaphragm streching technique in shoulder pain. And its hypothesis are: pain reduction in active movement (measured by VAS); increase of active mobility (measured by goniometry); increase of pain threshold by pressing the following trigger points: medial supraspinatus, upper medial infraspinatus and central levator escapula (measured by algometry).</summary>
