  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial involves the sublingual administration of 5mg Rosuvastatin and placebo on a daily nocturnal basis in the subjects home. The trial drug is administered for 6 weeks with 2 week washout and another 6 weeks of matching placebo (or visa versa depending on randomisation schedule. Demonstration using sublingual placebo administration will occur at randomisation visit and subject compliance will be assessed at each visit by way of counting the number of tablets returned : number of days since randomisation. Fasting blood tests will also be taken prior to each visit to monitor safety + progress of cholesterol levels</interventions>
    <comparator>The study is a cross over study - the subject will act as their own control 
Subjects will be asked to take sublingual  "5mg" placebo or sublingual 5mg crestor on a nightly basis at home for 6 weeks either in arm 1  or arm 2 and the repeat the process for another 6 weeks. Neither subject or investigator know which arm the patient is on active drug.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Myalgia/muscle aches symptoms
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Myalgia will be evaluated by subjects reporting adverse events at day 7 post drug administration. A myalgia score using analogue tool will occur at day 21 &amp; 42 in 1st arm post administration and day 84 &amp; 105 post administration in 2nd arm.
Elevated muscle enzymes (CK) will be measured at days 7, 21 &amp;42 post drug administration in 1st arm and day 84 &amp; 105 post drug administration in 2nd arm.
As we are blinded, 1st arm may be rosuvastatin or placebo + 2nd arm may be rosuvastatin or placebo.

    <statisticalmethods>In order to detect an effect size of 1.4mmol / L between treated and non-treated subjects for total cholesterol with a standard deviation of 1.41 at an alpha level of 0.025 and beta =0.95, we need 16 subjects. Assuming a dropout/noncompliance rate of 20% we inflate the sample size to 20. We used Stata v.14 to compute the required sample size for a simple crossover trial that is AB/BA. This method is similar to a one-sample t-test for the difference between treatment regimes, except that this calculation uses the non-central t-distribution. Data will be analysed as two-sample t-test comparing changes within and between rosuvastatin treatment and no treatment allocations after ensuring there was no carry over, sequence or period effect. Paired two-sample t-test will be used for within
allocation comparisons whereas unpaired two-sample t-test will be used for between treatment allocation comparisons. Continuous variables will be expressed as mean ± SD, categorical variables as frequency and percentage. A p-value of = 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All analyses will be performed in Stata 14.</statisticalmethods>
