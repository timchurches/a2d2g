  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eurartesim (trademark) is a fixed dose combination tablet for oral administration.
Each tablet contains 40 mg Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)/320 mg Piperaquine Phosphate (PQP)
On the study each subject recieves either three or four tablets daily for three consecutive days.  The tablets are to be administered following a light breakfast (30 g cornflakes and 250 mL fullfat milk).

The number of tablets administered is calculated using the subjects body weight - subjects weighing less than 75 kg are prescribed three tablets and subjects weighing greater than 75 kg are prescribed four tablets.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no comparator or control group- all subjects receive the same active treatment- the study is comparing the pharmacokinetics across gender, body weight and asian v caucasian.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the drug Eurartesim (trademarked). The drug is to be used for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium Falciparum (a type of malaria, a mosquito borne infectious disease). A number of safety studies have been completed for this new drug, but the company requires more information about what happens when taking this drug in certain groups of people, including the differences between men and women, and the differences between asian and caucasian (western) people and the difference in body weights ( particularly people weighing less than 65 kg and those weighing more than 65kg). The study is to be conducted in helathy people to comapre  how the drug behaves in these groups.</summary>
