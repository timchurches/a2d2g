Experimental: High-risk group (regimen H) - Patients receive up front VIT chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5, and temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment with VIT repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Responding patients then receive 6 courses of C5VD with 4 courses of VIT in between each 2-course block and non-responding patients receive 6 courses of C5VD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor resection or liver transplant after course 4 of C5VD followed by 2 courses of adjuvant C5VD.

Experimental: Intermediate-risk group (regimen F) - Patients receive C5VD chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, fluorouracil IV on day 2, vincristine sulfate IV on days 2, 9, and 16, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo surgical resection after course 2 OR surgical resection or liver transplantation after course 4 of C5VD. (closed to accrual as of 3/12/2012)

Experimental: Low-risk group (regimen T) - Patients undergo surgery and then receive adjuvant cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, fluorouracil IV on day 2, and vincristine sulfate IV on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients must be newly diagnosed with histologically-proven hepatoblastoma

          -  In emergency situations when a patient meets all other eligibility criteria and has
             had baseline required observations, but is too ill to undergo a biopsy safely, the
             patient may be enrolled on AHEP0731 without a biopsy

               -  Clinical situations in which such emergent treatment may be indicated include,
                  but are not limited to, the following circumstances:

                    -  Anatomic or mechanical compromise of critical organ function by tumor (eg,
                       respiratory distress/failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, urinary
                       obstruction, etc)

                    -  Uncorrectable coagulopathy

               -  For a patient to maintain eligibility for AHEP0731 when emergent treatment is
                  given, the following must occur:

                    -  The patient must have a clinical diagnosis of hepatoblastoma, including an
                       elevated alpha fetoprotein, and must meet all AHEP0731 eligibility criteria
                       at the time of emergent treatment

                    -  Patient must be enrolled on AHEP0731 prior to initiating protocol therapy; a
                       patient will be ineligible if any chemotherapy is administered prior to
                       AHEP0731 enrollment

                    -  If the patient receives AHEP0731 chemotherapy PRIOR to undergoing a
                       diagnostic biopsy, pathologic review of material obtained in the future
                       during either biopsy or surgical resection must either confirm the diagnosis
                       of hepatoblastoma or not reveal another pathological diagnosis to be
                       included in the analysis of the study aims

          -  Patients will be staged for risk classification and treatment at diagnosis using
             Children's Oncology Group (COG) staging guidelines

          -  At the time of study enrollment, the patient's treatment regimen must be identified;
             if the patient's primary tumor was resected prior to the day of enrollment and a blood
             specimen for the determination of serum alpha fetoprotein was not obtained prior to
             that surgery, the patient will be considered to have alpha fetoprotein of greater than
             100 ng/mL for the purpose of treatment assignment; if tumor samples obtained prior to
             the date of enrollment were not sufficient to determine whether small cell
             undifferentiated (SCU) histology was present, treatment assignment will be made
             assuming SCU is not present in the tumor

          -  For patients with stage I or II disease, specimens for rapid central review have been
             submitted and the rapid central review diagnosis and staging must be available to be
             provided on the AHEP0731 eligibility case report form (CRF)

          -  Ejection fraction &gt;= 47% by radionuclide angiogram (multi gated acquisition scan

          -  Serum cholesterol level =&lt; 300 mg/dL (7.75 mmol/L)

          -  Random or fasting blood glucose within the upper normal limits for age; if the initial
             blood glucose is a random sample that is outside of the normal limits, then a
             follow-up fasting blood glucose can be obtained and must be within the upper normal
             limits for age

          -  Normal pulmonary function tests (including diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon
             monoxide [DLCO]) if there is clinical indication for determination (e.g. dyspnea at

             respiratory symptoms or requirement for supplemental oxygen, pulmonary function tests
             (PFTs) are NOT required

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial studies the side effects and how well risk-based therapy works in
      treating younger patients with newly diagnosed liver cancer. Surgery, chemotherapy drugs
      (cancer fighting medicines), and when necessary, liver transplant, are the main current
      treatments for hepatoblastoma. The stage of the cancer is one factor used to decide the best
      treatment. Treating patients according to the risk group they are in may help get rid of the
      cancer, keep it from coming back, and decrease the side effects of chemotherapy.</summary>
