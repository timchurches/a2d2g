    <interventions>Sampling blood for estimation of lidocaine levels after topical administration of lidocaine during awake laryngopharyngeal procedures (sampled prior to, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes following administration).  Currently the reported range of administered lidocaine is from 220mg to 1200mg.  At our institution the average administered dose topically is 340mg.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lidocaine toxicity events are identified by monitoring heart rate, blood pressure and oximetry for the 90 minutes following the administration of lidocaine.  Also self report of the subjects for feelings of nausea, lightheadedness, visual disturbance or other notable adverse effects.  </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac instability. This is monitored with pulse oximetry, heart rate and blood pressure for the 90 minutes following the administration of lidocaine</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Parametric analysis of serum lidocaine concentrations in relation to administered topical dose
Linear regression analysis of factors influencing serum lidocaine levels
Power calculation was performed that assumed a difference of 4mcg/ml between the true mean and the reference mean with a standard deviation of 5mcg/ml and requiring 80% power and 0.05 p value.  This suggested that sample group of 18-24 subjects would detect the true differences in means.  We felt that to account for drop out and contaminated samples (all blood samples need to be flown to Christchurch for analysis) additional subjects would be required and give robustness to the project, hence the 50 subject recruitment.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In office laryngeal procedures are well tolerated by most patients provided adequate local anaesthesia is achieved. For most laryngologists topical lidocaine is the agent of choice and is considered safe when used in low doses.  However the effects of lidocaine toxicity are well known.  This study will evaluate and measure the exact serum levels of lidocaine achieved by topical application of lidocaine for in-office procedures in 50 consecutive patients.  Analysis will compare real measured levels to reported safe serum levels and correlate this with side effects if present.</summary>
