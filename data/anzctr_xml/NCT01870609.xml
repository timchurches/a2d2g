  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of
      defactinib (VS-6063) in subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who have not
      progressed (confirmed partial response or stable disease) following = 4 cycles of treatment
      with pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin. Prior to entry and randomization to the
      study, each subject must have tumor Merlin status(high or low) established by
      immunohistochemistry performed at a central laboratory. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive oral VS-6063 400 mg twice per day, or matched placebo. Randomization will be
      stratified by tumor Merlin status (high versus low). Progression will be assessed both
      locally and by central review using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      Version 1.1. Subjects will continue to receive treatment until disease progression or other
      discontinuation criteria are met. Following documentation of nonfatal disease progression,
      all subjects will be followed for overall survival by telephone contact every 2 months until
      end of life or the close of the study.</summary>
