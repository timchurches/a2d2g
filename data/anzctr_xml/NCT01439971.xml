    <summary>This study hypothesizes that the study drug, PF-05280602 (at the selected doses) will be safe
      to administer to subjects with severe Hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors and will
      demonstrate evidence of hemostatic activity. This is supported by the preclinical findings in
      hemophilic animal models.</summary>
