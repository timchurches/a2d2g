  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Mepolizumab
Treatment: drugs - SOC

Experimental: Mepolizumab 100 mg - All subjects will receive mepolizumab 100mg administered SC into the upper arm or thigh approximately every 4 weeks.


Other interventions: Mepolizumab
Mepolizumab is a fully humanised IgG antibody (IgG1, kappa) with human heavy and light chain frameworks. Mepolizumab will be supplied as a lyophilised cake in sterile vials for individual use.

Treatment: drugs: SOC
Standard of Care (SOC) will differ by participant, however it will generally include oral corticosteroids and an inhaled controller medicine (an inhaled corticosteroid plus a long acting beta agonist) and/or short acting beta agonists

             exacerbations during the study.

          -  Oral Corticosteroid Use: Subjects who received placebo in MEA115575 and were able to
             discontinue oral corticosteroid therapy by the end of the study.

          -  Smoking Status: Current smokers

          -  Previous Significant Protocol Deviation: Subjects who were excluded from the per
             protocol analysis due to significant protocol deviations in either study MEA115575 or

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-center, open-label, long-term study of subcutaneously (SC) administered
      mepolizumab 100mg in addition to standard of care (SOC), in subjects with severe eosinophilic
      asthma. This study will enroll a subset of subjects from Study MEA115661 who have
      demonstrated clear benefit from therapy and who without continuation of mepolizumab therapy
      are individuals at greatest risk of serious deterioration of their health status. In order to
      target individuals at greatest risk for serious deterioration of their health status, only
      subjects from the MEA115661 study with a history of life-threatening or seriously
      debilitating asthma, will be allowed to participate. Subjects meeting all of the eligibility
      criteria for the study will be offered the opportunity to consent for this study of up to 128
      weeks in length (including the Follow-Up Visit). This study will give opportunity to extend
      the collection of clinical data for long-term use and further assess the sustainability of
      efficacy in a population likely to experience significant loss of asthma control and the need
      for higher doses of systemic steroids if returned to SOC only.</summary>
