    <interventions>The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of using methylene blue  dying of the pilonidal sinus intraoperatively in the treatment of pilonidal disease to see whether this method is effective to prevent recurrence in 1 year follow-up and early post opertive surgical site infection and wound dehisence. 20-50 mL of methylene blue ( according to the volume of the pilonidal sinus) was applied through the greatest orfice of the sinus (subcutenous)</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The number of participants we decided per protocol.While we were planning this randomized study we calculated the sample size for the difference of two group postop infection ratios. We based the 80% power to detect the difference between the group proportions of 0.15. So we achieved sample size 121 for each group for the two sided T-test at significance level of 0.05 by using the software PASS 11.

 To decide statistical method, first Shapiro-Wilk normality test was applied. When normality assumption was not satisfied non-parametric test methods was preferred. To compare variables, Mann-Whitney U test was used. To examine differences or relations in terms of categorical variables chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied. To determine risk factors univariate logistical regression analysis was conducted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study to examine the effect of methylene blue (MB)dying on surgical treatment of pilonidal disease on wound infection and recurrence. We also investigated effectiveness of  this dye in the presence of  risk factors like age, body mass index, sex, number of primary and secondary orifices).Toataly, 231 patients were analyzed (129 patients MB+ and 102 patients MB-). Using intraoperative methylene blue prevents post-operative infection significantly. Its effect on preventing recurrence after in one year follow-up semms beneficial but not statisticaly significant.</summary>
