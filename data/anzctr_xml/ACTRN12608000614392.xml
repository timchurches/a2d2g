    <interventions>The objectives of study Portion 1 are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of RAD001.  Subjects will be assigned to cohorts of increasing doses until MTD is reached, starting from daily  oral dose of 5 mg for three months (cohort 1), to a daily oral dose of 7.5 mg for three months (cohort 2) to daily  oral dose of  10 mg for three months (cohort 3).When the MTD is defined, an expansion of the cohort will be made for efficacy assessment, with the aim to determine the rate of complete or major clinical-hematological response from treatment with RAD001 in this subject population as measured by the EUMNET (European Myelofibrosis Network) response criteria (Barosi G, Blood 2005; 106:2849).Patients in this portion will be treated using the MTD for a total period time of four months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>From Phase 1: To determine the  maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of single-agent therapy with RAD001 in subject with Myelofibrosis (MF) who require therapy.
In case a AE occurs, treatment with RAD001 will be immediately stopped, and the patient managed at best of cure depending on the type, characteristic and severity of Adverse Event (AE)</outcome>
      <timepoint>13 months
 For the Phase 1: MTD will be calculated based on DLT at the end of each month of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the effect of treatment with RAD001 on biological and molecular markers of the disease, and on markers of drug activity on target genes, including the following:
-histologically assessed  bone marrow fibrosis and bone marrow cellularity as standardized by the European Working Group
-bone marrow angiogenesis (as measured by microvessel density by immunostaining with anti-CD34 antibody)
- Janus Kinake 2 (JAK2 V617F) and MPL receptor for thrombopoietin (MPL W515) mutational status in peripheral blood granulocytes by quantitative Real Time PCR (RT-PCR)
-CD34+ cell count in peripheral blood measured by FACS analysis
-WT1 expression on granulocyte Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) , by  RT-PCR
-Quantification of glut1 and cyclinD1 messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) level changes, by RT-PCR.</outcome>
      <timepoint>13 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>From Phase 2: To determine the rate of complete or major clinical-hematological response from treatment with RAD001 in Myelofibrosis (MF) patients as measured by the European Myelofibrosis network (EUMNET) response criteria (Blood 2005; 106:2849) evaluated with ad hoc case report form (CRF)</outcome>
      <timepoint>13 months
For the Phase 2: patients in this portion will be treated using the MTD for a total period time of 4 months</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-Age &gt;=18 years at the time of voluntarily signing an  Institutional review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent form.
-Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.
-Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of the study.
-Patients must be diagnosed with myelofibrosis requiring therapy. Patients previously treated must have failed at least 1 previous treatment and in the opinion of the investigator require further treatment. If a subject has had a transplant, he/she must be at least 6 months post-transplant. Any subject who has not received previous therapy and in the opinion of the investigator requires treatment will also be considered for enrollment. A general rule for need of treatment is falling into intermediate or high risk class according to Lille scoring system (adverse prognostic factors are: Haemoglobin (Hb)&lt;10g/dL, White Blood Cell (WBC) &lt;4 or &gt; 30 x 109/L; risk group:0=low;1= intermediate; 2=high). Low-risk scoring system but with progressive splenomegaly is an additional reason for treatment.
-Patients must have discontinued conventional chemotherapy (hydroxyurea, anagrelide, other myelosuppressive agents, or any other experimental therapy) as well as growth factors or systemic use of corticosteroids for at least 7 days prior to starting study drug. In case of interferon alpha or thalidomide, a time interval of drug wash-out for 28 days is required. Supportive transfusional therapy is ad libitum, but must be registered.
-Ability to communicate meaningfully with the investigational staff, competence to give written informed consent, and ability to comply with the entire study procedures.</inclusivecriteria>
