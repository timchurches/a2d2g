Otherwise unexplained clinical features including all of the following:
Unexplained worsening or development of dyspnoea within 30 days
New diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, and/or new HRCT parenchymal abnormalities with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion (new ground-glass opacities) since the last visit
Exclusion of infection as per routine clinical practice and microbiological studies
Exclusion of alternative causes as per routine clinical practice including left heart failure, pulmonary embolism and identifiable cause of acute lung injury.
Failure is the proportion of patients with at least one acute IPF exacerbation over 52 weeks, based on all investigator-reported AEs .</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unknown cause that results in
      scarring of the lung and there is a high unmet medical need for effective treatment to halt
      lung function decline, delay or avoid exacerbation (flare-ups), and ultimately to reduce the
      death rate.

      In a large Phase 2 trial (1199.30) (NCT00514683), investigating the effects of 52 weeks of
      treatment with BIBF 1120 in patients with IPF, a positive effect was seen on lung function of
      patients treated with high dose of BIBF 1120 compared to placebo.

      Hence it is the purpose of this trial to investigate and confirm the efficacy and safety of
      BIBF 1120 at a high dose in treating patients with IPF, compared with placebo. The trial will
      be conducted as a prospective, randomised design with the aim to collect safety and efficacy
      data.

      Respiratory function is globally accepted for assessment of treatment effects in IPF
      patients. The chosen endpoint (Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) decline) is easy to obtain and is
      part of the usual examinations done in IPF patients.</summary>
