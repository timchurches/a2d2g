    <designfeatures>This study is partially randomized.  The first twelve subjects were randomized and the remaining subjects will not be randomzied.
The study consists of 4 participants groups. Each group consists of 2 or 3 treatment periods.
Group 1 
Treatment Period 1  TDS 7 day adhesion, randomised to TDS 360 or TDS 362
Treatment Period 2  Namenda XR 7 day dosing (non-randomised)
Treatment Period 3  TDS 3 day adhesion, TDS 362 only (non-randomised)
Group 2
Treatment Period 1-  TDS 7 day adhesion, randomised to TDS 360 or TDS 362
Treatment Period 2  Namenda XR 7 day dosing (non-randomised)
Treatment Period 3  TDS 3 day adhesion, TDS 362 only (non-randomised)
Group 3
Treatment Period 1 - Namenda XR 7 day dosing (non-randomised) 
Treatment Period 2- TDS 4 day adhesion, TDS 362 only (non-randomised)
Group 4  
Treatment Period 1- Namenda XR 7 day dosing (non-randomised)
Treatment Period 2 - TDS 3 day adhesion, TDS 362 only (non-randomised)

Treatment A: Formulation A - Memantine TDS 362, 50 cm2 22 mg/day target dose (comprising three x patches for a total application area of 150 cm2) worn for seven days, four or three days.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Pharmacokinetics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Baseline and Demographic Data 
Baseline and demographic data will be summarized. 
Safety Analysis
Adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs, ECG data and skin irritation scores will be summarized.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Plasma Memantine concentrations and resultant pharmacokinetic parameters across study subjects and treatments will be summarised.

Performance Analysis
Individual TDS adhesion scores (0-4) for each patch and for Cumulative adhesion scores (CAS) (Part B) will be summarized.

Part A: Sample size of at least twelve subjects to complete is considered adequate to estimate the Memantine PK from TDS in human subjects and to select the dose and formulation for treatment in a larger group of subjects. In addition this sample size will provide adequate PK data to establish the delivery profile of Memantine TDS in human subjects compared to Memantine PK following oral Memantine (NAMENDA XR).
Part B: Sample size of at least 12 subjects enrolled should provide sufficient data to meet the adhesion assessment objectives.
Part C: Sample size of at least six subjects recruited and enrolled will provide sufficient data to meet the tolerability and adhesion assessment objectives.
Part D: Sample size of at least six subjects recruited and enrolled will provide sufficient data to meet the tolerability and adhesion assessment objectives
As this is not a powered efficacy study, no formal sample size calculations were performed. </statisticalmethods>
