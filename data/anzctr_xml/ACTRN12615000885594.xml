  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will consist of a Screening Period (Pretreatment Day 28 to Day 1), a 10 day Treatment Period (Days 1-10), a 7 day Washout Period (Days 11-17), a second 10 day Treatment period (Days 18-27) and a 7 day Follow-up Period (Days 28-34). There will be six clinic visits during the course of the study; Visit 1 during Screening; Visit 2 will occur on the first Day of Treatment Period One (Day 1); Visit 3 on Day 10 at the end of Treatment Period One; Visit 4 at the start of Treatment Period Two (Day 18); Visit 5 on Day 27 at the conclusion of Treatment Period Two; and Visit 6 at the end of the Follow-up Period (Day 34) for study exit.

The interventional product, CMX-020, will be administered as an oral capsule.

CMX-020 and matching placebo will be provided as 25 mg capsules. Each dose will consist of 125 mg CMX-020/ placebo in the form of five 25 mg softgel capsules taken three times daily during the treatment periods one and two in cross-over randomised double-blinded manner. 

Subjects will orally self-administer the randomised dose at home, three times per day (TID): 
- in the morning (approx. 06:00 to 08:00)
- midday (approx. 12:00 to 14:00)
- evening (approx. 19:00 to 21:00)

Subjects will be instructed to take each dose with a full glass of room temperature water. Fasting will be required for one hour before until 30 minutes after the dose.

The date and time of each dose will be recorded by the patient in the Patient Daily Pain Diary.

On study Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 18  (Visit 4), the initial dose for the treatment period will be administered at the study unit under the supervision of the study staff. This will be the midday dose (12:00 to 14:00). The later evening dose (19:00-21:00) will be self-administered by the subject at home. No morning dose will be taken on these days.

To confirm self-administration at home, the participants will be contacted by phone (verbally or text) daily  to confirm medication dosing and completion of the pain diary. This will also be captured in the CRF.

On the mornings of study Day 10 and Day 27, the last dose for each of the treatments periods will be self-administered by the subject at home, before returning to the study unit for Study Visits 3 and 5, respectively. This will be the only dose administered on these study days.

During the follow-up  period following the end of treatment period two; the participants will record their pain in the diary but will receive no treatment.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To evaluate the efficacy of CMX-020 administered orally to male and female subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy (sciatica) pain.

The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference between the average of the placebo treatment and the average of the drug treatment for change in daily worst leg pain. Change in daily worst leg pain is the difference between baseline worst leg pain and worst leg pain on last full day of dosing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily pain intensity scores will be recorded  in the Patient Daily Pain  Diary by the subject each day of the study beginning on Day 1, with the final entry on Day 33. The NRS scale assessments needs to be completed each evening immediately prior to the evening dose of the study medication</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Change in average leg pain when comparing baseline average to last full day of dosing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily pain intensity scores will be recorded  in the Patient Daily Pain  Diary by the subject each day of the study beginning on Day 1, with the final entry on Day 33. The NRS scale assessments needs to be completed each evening immediately prior to the evening dose of the study medication.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Quality of life as assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change questionnaire. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This self reported assessment will be administered to the subjects at the study unit at:
Visit 3 (Day 10), Visit 4 (Day 18), Visit 5 (Day 27) and Visit 6 (Day 34).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Quality of life as assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This self reported assessment will be administered to the subjects at the study unit at:
Visit 2 (Day 1) - to establish baseline scores, Visit 3 (Day 10), 
Visit 4 (Day 18), Visit 5 (Day 27) and Visit 6 (Day 34).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. Safety endpoints including AEs, SAEs, vital signs (BP, Pulse, RR, temperature, oxygen saturation), physical examination including body weight, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) and ECG.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The safety assessments mentioned above are composite secondary outcome and will be done at Visit 1 (screening) - to assess eligibility, Visit 2 (Day 1) - predose to establish baseline values, Visit 3 (Day 10), Visit 4 (Day 18), Visit 5 (Day 27) and Visit 6 (Day 34).
The most common AEs from taking CMX-020 repeatedly were mild headache and nausea which had been assessed  clinically. There have been no known/ possible SAEs associated with this study drug.
The BP, pulse and oxygen saturation are assessed by pulse oximetry while respiratory rate, physical examination will be assessed clinically. Temperature will be assessed by using a tympanic thermometer while an ECG will be recorded by an instrument which involves the placement of electrodes on the chest wall.
Blood will be collected for hematology and clinical chemistry lab assessments while urine will be collected for urinalysis.</timepoint>

    <concealment>After informed consent has been obtained, all screening tests establishing subject eligibility will be performed within a period of 28 days before dosing. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility on Day -1.

The study population will comprise a minimum of 40, but up to 60, male and female subjects 18 to 75 years of age with current diagnosis of sciatic pain of duration more than 6 weeks.

In this study there are two treatment periods each consisting of 10 days in which subjects will be administered either CMX020 or  placebo in a randomised crossover manner. Subjects will be required to consume  125 mg CMX-020/ placebo in the form of five 25 mg softgel capsules taken three times daily during the treatment period. 

Allocation will be concealed by use of pre labelled drug boxes containing subject randomisation numbers and use of sealed opaque envelopes.

Computerised generated randomisation schedule using SAS software will be used for treatment allocation (sequence generation).</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the Per Protocol Set. The ITT population will be supportive. All safety variables will be analyzed using Safety Population. Sensitivity analyses  may be carried out comparing study results observed in the Per Protocol Set, Full Analysis Set, and ITT study populations.
The mean pain intensity score of the baseline and the final day of dosing, as well as the change in the mean pain intensity score between baseline and the final day of dosing will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, median and range. Confidence intervals when appropriate will be provided at 90% level for key  primary efficacy and safety variables.
The primary efficacy variables will be summarized at each visit in terms of descriptive statistics by treatment.

The sample size of 40 to 60 subjects is a projection of crossover results based on the results of the parallel study Freeman 2013, where a difference of 2 units of pain scale between placebo response and active treatment response had a standard deviation of approximately 3 units of pain. For a crossover study to detect a difference of 2 units with SD of 3 units, at a 2-sided 5% significance with 80% power at least 38 subjects would be required while 50 subjects would be required for achieving 90% power.
