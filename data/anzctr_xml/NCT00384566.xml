  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effect of two drugs (carvedilol and metoprolol) which are used for
      patients with CHF (chronic heart failure).

      These agents are beta-blockers and, although effective in heart failure, may cause increases
      in airways tone and thus limit air getting into the lower parts of the lungs. Carvedilol is
      more active at blocking the receptor that opens up the airways and therefore theoretically
      may be more likely to reduce airways tone than metoprolol, although this has never been
      studied in patients with heart failure, and that is the purpose of the present study.

      We are looking to enrol 45 patients with heart failure and mild obstruction to the flow of
      air in their lungs. Patients will be randomised to either carvedilol or metoprolol (standard
      doses). Following a minimum of 2 weeks of therapy of study medication the patient will
      undergo a study day involving an assessment of their lung function, an assessment of their
      heart failure, a "living with heart failure" questionnaire, blood tests and blood pressure
      and heart rate readings.

      Patients will then be crossed over to the alternate medication. Following 2 weeks on the
      target dose the patient will undergo their second study day which will be the same as the
      first.

      The results obtained from each study day will be compared.</summary>
