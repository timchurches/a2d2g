  <interventions>
    <interventions>Men with high-risk prostate cancer requiring high-dose radiotherapy will have a PSMA PET scan and a MRI as part of clinical care and prior to enrollment into the study. The urologist and the radiation oncologist will assess the results of the PSMA PET scan and MRI to determine whether the patient is eligible to participate. If the patient is eligible and consents to participate, the patient will undergo a once only high dose radiotherapy  (external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy) which will target the cancer sites that were identified in the PSMA PET scan and the MRI.  The dose of the radiotherapy treatment will be at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist and urologist.  The duration of the radiotherapy procedure is usually an hour however, the emission of the radiation occurs over several months following discharge from hospital.  The PSMA scan, MRI and the radiotherapy treatment will occur in a participating hospital.     
The men will also complete a quality of life survey prior to and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after radiotherapy treatment to determine when or whether or not they return to good health. The patient will also be reviewed by their treating doctor at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post radiotherapy treatment.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is to determine the quality of life of men with high risk prostate whose targeted high dose radiotherapy was based on sites identified on a PSMA PET scan and MRI. Quality of life assessment will be based on the self-completed EPIC quality of life survey, </outcome>
      <timepoint>The quality of life survey will be completed prior to radiotherapy and then at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post radiotherapy. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Morbidity will be assessed at follow up consultations by reviewing Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, any imaging results or patient reported signs and symptoms.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up consultations will occur at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post radiotherapy.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease manifestation (if any)  post radiotherapy treatment will be assessed at follow-up consultation reviewing Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, any imaging results or patient reported signs and symptoms. In addition, a follow-up PSMA PET scan and MRI scan will occur at three years post radiotherapy treatment to see if the cancer is still present.   </outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up consultations will occur at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post radiotherapy. PSMA PET scan and MRI scan three years post radiotherapy treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of using PSMA PET scans and MRI to target high-dose radiotherapy. This will be assessed by analyzing the clinical, imaging and quality of life data collected from the time of recruitment to three years post radiotherapy treatment.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed  when all participants have been recruited and all data have been collected. Approximately 3 years following the recruitment of the last participant.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute toxicity due to targeted radiotherapy treatment. This will be assessed by a CT scan to confirm the accuracy of the positioning of the brachytherapy seeds one or two days following the procedure. Follow-up consultations will also occur to assess the patient's well being by the treating clinicians.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>The CT scan will be performed one or two days following radiotherapy treatment. Follow-up consultations will occur directly following the procedure and than at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. An overall group assessment will occur at the end of the study based on clinical and quality of life data reporting. This is likely to occur three years after the recruitment of the last patient.  </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the feasibility of pre-treatment Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography (PSMA-PET) scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for men with high-risk prostate cancer requiring radiotherapy.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are Male, aged 18 years or above and have been assessed as having a high-risk prostate cancer requiring high-dose radiotherapy. In addition, a  PSMA PET scan and a MRI will also be used to assessed your eligibility to participate.    

Study details
The PSMA PET scan and the MRI will be used to identify cancer sites prior to the high dose radiotherapy treatment. The radiation oncologist and urologist will use the PSMA PET scan and the MRI to map and than target external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy towards these cancer sites.

Participants will be asked to complete a quality of life survey prior to and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-radiotherapy to determine quality of life following the procedure. They will also be assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 to determine clinical outcomes. A follow up PSMA PET scan and MRI will also be performed at three years post radiotherapy treatment determine if any cancer sites are still present.   </summary>
