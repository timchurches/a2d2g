  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will be administered:
Supplement name: BroccoMax Broccoli Seed Extract (Myrosinase activated) . Delayed release. Manufacturer: Jarrow Formulas
Sulforaphane glucosinolate content 30mg per tablet (capsule)
1) Single dose (2 capsules)
2) The mode of administration: oral</interventions>
    <comparator>The trial is the partner of our other ANZCTR study: ACTRN 12617000567325. The trial recruited  n=6 non pregnant, healthy participants (3 male and 3 female). These 6 non-pregnant participants were given 2 different broccoli spout supplements in order to ascertain which one elevated serum sulforaphane levels the most. The results generated from the study, recruitment &amp; data collection period: June 2017 to July 2017, have been used in the design of the study which will now be undertaken in pregnant women and will form a historical control group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of the trial is to ascertain the serum level of sulforaphane following the ingestion of a broccoli sprout supplement in healthy, pregnant women.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected from participants for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis: before ingestion of the supplement (5 minutes, or less) and then following ingestion of the supplement, at a 'desired' eight further targeted time points of: 15 (+/-5) minutes, 30 (+/-5) minutes, 60 (+/-5) minutes, 90 (+/-5) minutes, 120 (+/-15) minutes, 240 (+/-15) minutes, 480 (+/-15) minutes and 720 (+/-15) minutes.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the data with that obtained previously from a  healthy, non pregnant population who were administered the same supplement (ANZCTR, ACTRN:12617000567325).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is an exploratory study to obtain Pk data related to the ingestion of broccoli sprout supplements, the n=6 participants was chosen based on the data available from previous, similar studies.
Participant demographic data will be assessed for normality. Characteristics of the two groups will be tabulated and compared using the appropriate statistical test (e.g. Chi 2, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney test). Nonparametric data will be expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). A p-value &lt;0.05 (two-tailed) will be regarded as statistically signi cant. Data will be analysed using the SPSS statistical package (SPSS 24.0, IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA).
PK data will analysed by nonlinear mixed-effects modelling.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring compound belonging to the isothiocyanate group. It can be obtained naturally through cruciferous vegetables with broccoli sprouts being one of the richest sources. Sulforaphane obtained through ingested broccoli sprouts are activated by myrosinase, a chemical that is released by chewing of the vegetable. Myrosinase is also present in the gut flora of individuals and mediates the conversion of precursor compound to bioavailable sulforaphane. Previous studies in humans has demonstrated the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory effects of Sulforaphane and its ability to protect against endothelial dysfunction and end organ damage. Therefore, we believe sulforaphane may have a potential clinical utility in maternity care as a low risk intervention for the treatment of pre-eclampsia.

The aim of the research project is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of sulforaphane obtained through the ingestion of a natural broccoli sprout supplement in a cohort of healthy women 24-36 weeks pregnant with one baby, n=6

Participation involves the ingestion of two tablets (together) of the broccoli sprout supplement with associated PK blood sampling at nine pre-determined time points, one just prior to ingestion of the supplement and then following at: 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, 480, 720 minute intervals.
