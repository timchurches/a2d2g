  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Subjects will have a medical diagnosis of lung disease from dust inhalation including silicosis, asbestosis or asbestos related
pleural disease (ARPD).</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Supervised exercise training for the lower limb, 3 times weekly for 8 weeks. Lower limb exercise training will consist of at least 15 minutes of stationary cycling at 60% peak workrate achieved on the incremental cycle test and 15 minutes of walking training at 80% of the average walking speed achieved on the six minute walk test. Training duration will be uncreased to 20 minutes of cycling and 20 minutes of walking by the 12th training session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual medical care with no exercise training or advice on exercise training for 8 weeks. Usual care - management of medications by general practitioner (GP) and possibly respiratory physician.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects will have a medical diagnosis of lung disease from dust inhalation including silicosis, asbestosis or asbestos related
pleural disease (ARPD). Subjects on long-term oxygen therapy will be included in
the study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Subjects will be excluded if they have any
musculoskeletal, cardiovascular or neurological conditions likely to adversely
affect performance during exercise assessment or training; have an inability to
understand English; or have participated in a pulmonary rehabilitation program
within the last 12 months.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects will be randomised after initial baseline testing by a computer program. Allocation will be concealed by sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>In this study the comparisons are between exercise training and no training. Because of the type of training the subjects and therapist will not be blind to group allocation and it is not possible to make a sham treatment for these. The assessor will be blind to group allocation.</designfeatures>
