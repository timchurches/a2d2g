  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three study FMISO-CT/PET scans. Timing of scans is pre-treatment, after 10 fraction and 2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy treatment.
Each FMISO-PET/CT scan will take approximately 60 minutes. A needle (intravenous cannula) is inserted into the patients arm and used to inject the contrast for this scan. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the feasibility of measuring the changes in hypoxia as assessed by FMISO-PET within the tumour throughout a course of radical chemoradiation therapy.

The level of hypoxia is measured and assessed using image analysis software in the Nuclear medicine department. It measure levels of radioactivity that FMISO produces. The feasibility assessment is to ensure that we can adequately measure the changes and the images will be analysable with their software. Other software will need to be explored if this doesn't work.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>After completion of the three study scans.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the textural analysis method in hypoxia PET imaging.

This is performed using Matlab software and allows additional information to be obtained from the PET scans. It is hoped this will provide a semi-quantitative measuring tool.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the prognostic value of assessing hypoxia (low oxygen) in cervical and lung tumours using FMISO-CT/PET scans throughout a course of radical chemoradiation therapy. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with either cervical cancer or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for which your are scheduled to undergo a course of radical radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. You should not have received any previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy for the cancer, or have any evidence of distant metastases. Study details All participants in this study will be treated as per standard of care with the addition of 3 FMISO-PET scans which will be done prior to treatment (baseline), 2 weeks into radiation therapy and 2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Each FMISO-PET/CT scan will take approximately 60 minutes. During this time an intravenous cannula will be inserted into your arm and contrast injected. PET scans pose a small health risk as they involve exposure to radiation.  The dose from this study is comparable to that received from many diagnostic medical x-ray and nuclear medicine procedures. The aim in this proof of concept study is to demonstrate that we can non-invasively and safely use 18FMISO-PET on 2 cohorts of patients (cervix and non-small cell lung(NSCLC)) whose tumours are known to be affected by hypoxia and explore the tools to measure the PET images to objectively evaluate the hypoxic region within the tumour throughout a course of radiation therapy.</summary>
