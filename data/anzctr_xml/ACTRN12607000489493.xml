  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adherence of preventive medication will be monitored using an electronic monitoring device (Smirtinhaler, Nexus 6) in a cohort of 100 children aged 6-15 years with asthma. Data from the device may be downloaded and displayed graphically to the participants. The intervention group will receive monthly feedback regarding their us e of preventive medication along with standard asthma care. The control group will have their adherence monitored but this will remain confidential and will not be fedback to the participants.

The trial is likely to take 2 years to complete. Each child will be in the study for 4 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will not receive feedback regarding their adherence, their adherence will remain confidential and clinical decisions will be based on reported adherence.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment will be sought from asthma clinic and community referrals.

Group allocation will be by computer randomisation aided by minimisation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computer randomisation / minimisation program Minum will be used. Following consent being obtained and enrollment being confirmed, the investigator will enter the data regarding the child into the program (sex, age, lung function and level of maternal education). The computer program will allocate the subject of one of the two groups. This is done essentially randomly but does take into account the balance of othe subjects in the study and is thus not completely random. The invetsigator and parent is unaware of allocation at the time of enrollment and takes no active part in determining into which group the child will be allocated. This method has been selected as the numbers in the trial is relatively small and pure randomisation could by chance result in uneven distribution of subjects with known confounding factors.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether the act of measuring and providing feedback on adherence will result in a change in adherence with preventive medication and as a secondary outcome disease control.

Subjects who are aware that their use of medication is being monitored may change their behaviour. Providing feedback may provide them and thier physician with additional information which may improve the accuracy and quality of clinical decisions that are made.</summary>
