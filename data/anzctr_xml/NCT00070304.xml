  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - filgrastim
Treatment: drugs - gemcitabine hydrochloride
Treatment: drugs - vinorelbine tartrate

Experimental: Treatment - Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate IV over 6-10 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 9 and continuing for at least 7 days and until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease after 2 courses may proceed directly to stem cell transplantation off study OR receive 2 additional courses. Patients with stable disease after 2 courses receive at least 2 additional courses. Patients with continued stable or responding disease (with no disease progression) after 4 courses may continue to receive study treatment for up to 1 year or discontinue study for alternative therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.


Other interventions: filgrastim
Given by mouth or IV, 5 micrograms/kg/dose (up to 10 micrograms/kg/dose) daily starting on day 9 for a minimum of 7 days and until the ANC is greater to or equal to 1,500/uL.

Treatment: drugs: gemcitabine hydrochloride
Given IV over 100 minutes dose 1000 mg/m2/dose in 500 ml NS on days 1 and 8

Treatment: drugs: vinorelbine tartrate
Given IV over 6-10 minutes (central venous catheter). Dose 25 mg/m2/dose on days 1 and 8

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and vinorelbine, use different
      ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one
      drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with
      vinorelbine works in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.</summary>
