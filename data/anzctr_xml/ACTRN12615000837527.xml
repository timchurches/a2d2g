  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will receive ranitidine 150 mg as premedication a night before and on the morning of surgery with a sip of water. In the operation theatre, intravenous (IV) access will be secured with 18G cannula and all patients were pre-loaded with 10 ml/kg of Ringer lactate solution. Standard monitoring include electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ), non-invasive blood pressure, urinary output and respiratory rate (RR).

       Group I: includes patients for whom  paravertebral catheter will be inserted  on the proposed side of operation, in sitting posture, under strict aseptic precautions and after infiltration with local anesthetic, 2.5 cm lateral to the tip of spinous process of T10 vertebra, Tuohy needle was advanced perpendicular to the skin in all planes to contact the transverse process of the vertebra, typically at a depth of 2 to 4 cm. After the transverse process was identified, the needle was redirected cephalad and gradually advanced until loss of resistance was felt 1 to 1.5 cm distal to its superior edge. 
    Through the needle a 18G epidural catheter was placed 3 cm inside T10T11 paravertebral space.  Then, spinal anesthesia was performed with spinal needle 25 gauge at the level of L3-L4 with 2 ml bupivacine 0.5%. Sensory levels were checked with bilateral pin -prick method while motor blockade was assessed with modified Bromage scale (0   = no block, 1 =  inability to raise extended leg, 2  =  inability to flex the knee and 3   =  inability to flex ankle and foot).  Paravertebral block was performed with 10 ml bupivacine 0.5%. Equipments for general anesthesia will be ready in case of failure of regional technique. 

      </interventions>
    <comparator>Group II: Induction of anesthesia will be achieved with propofol 2 mg/kg, fentanyl 1microgram/kg will be given intravenously. and cis-atracurium 0.15 mg/kg as a muscle relaxant to facilitate endotracheal intubation with appropriate sized endotracheal tube. Maintenance of anesthesia will be achieved with isoflurane (1 MAC), oxygen and cis-atracurium as a muscle relaxant increments and fentanyl 0.5micro gram /kg when will be required. Isoflurane will be tapered before the anticipated end of surgery and stopped during the completion of skin closure. The patients will be extubated after adequate recovery.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>While choosing an anesthetic technique for renal surgeries, desirable characteristics include hemodynamic stability, lesser blood loss, early ambulation, better  post-operative analgesia and lower incidence of side-effects such as nausea and vomiting, shivering, cough, headache, respiratory depression.  General anesthesia  has remained the most common technique for renal surgeries because of the discomfited body position duringprocedures.

General anesthesia carries risks such as stress response and cardiac complications during induction of anesthesia, airway difficulties during intubation, awareness, analgesia in the post-operative period, difficult extubation, post-operative restlessness, over-sedation and agitation. 

Previous studies have compared combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia and general anesthesia  for renal surgeries.  These studies reported that, the only disadvantage with the combined approach is the hemodynamic instability and unpredictable sensory blockade levels. 
we plan our study to compare general anesthesia versus combined spinal and paravertebral block technique in patients undergoing renal surgeries. The study will compare the haemodynamic parameters, surgical conditions, surgeon's satisfaction intra-operatively and patient's satisfaction in the immediate post-operative period in the two groups. The secondary outcome includes  the side-effects associated with the anesthesia techniques.</summary>
