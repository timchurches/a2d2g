  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interviewing relatives face to face after a patient's expected death in hospital. Interviewing face to face nurse and doctor caring for patient during their last 24 hours.
30-60 minutes duration
medical doctor not involved in patient's care will do interviews
one or more relatives may be interviewed ie single or group depending on family's preference
describe the moment of death of XY...who was there...what did you do....who came into room....describe the room....what helped you at this time....what was not helpful.....
We anticipate based on experience of three previous studies that relatives will also talk about care while in hospital, about the staff, about the patient's personality, about their grief. That however is not specifically the focus of our interview but will add to the context.

As the doctor or nurse may not be present at the moment of death we will ask similar questions relating to the closest time that they were present to the moment death of the patient.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Traditionally for individuals and communities the moment of death had huge significance. It was an honoured time with ritual and practices associated with the care of the dying person and the grieving relatives. The principal researcher has investigated over 15 years past traditions and todays practices associated with dying. This study will collect eyewitness accounts from those most closely involved with moment of death ie relatives, nurses and doctors.

Patients referred to palliative care services will be identified. If the Palliative care team consider it appropriate and the patient is dying in hospital, relatives will be informed that this research is taking place. If they give permission, two weeks following the patients death the researcher will phone them to request the interview.

The nurse on duty and responsible for the patient at the time of his death will be asked to participate by describing his/her experience of the patients death. The nurse will be contacted as soon as possible after the death.

The doctor most involved with the patient at the time of his death will be asked to participate by describing his/her experience of the patients death. The doctor will be contacted as soon as possible after the death.</summary>
