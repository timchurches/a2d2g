  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients who attend a support center for women with breast cancer will be photographed immediately after surgery for tumor removal. The photographs will be repeated following the same standardization month after month until the end of the sixth month.In the first evaluation, patients will respond using a questionnaire semi-structured on the interventions of nursing in the periods before, during and after surgery. Receive guidance on basic nursing care and conduct weekly group exercises during six month. The exercises are carried out once a week for 1 hour under the supervision of a physiotherapist. These sessions involve exercises to improve shoulder range of motion, stretching exercises for upper and lower limbs and spine and circulatory exercises physiotherapist. The photographs will be analyzed by a computer program for analysis of postural changes and the postural changes will be quantified</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to quantitatively assess the posture of mastectomy patients. All volunteers have your posture evaluated initially by photogrammetry, after participating in a weekly attendance of a group of women with breast cancer that are oriented to care for post-surgical nurses and posture, and perform exercises supervised by physiotherapists. After six months of treatment are the same patients are photographs again with the same standardized initially and their posture reassess</summary>
