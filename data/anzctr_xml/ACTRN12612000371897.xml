  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Intervention Group (n=25) will receive the Family Intervention Clinical Protocol.  The protocol will be delivered by a Social Worker of the Victorian Paediatric Rehabilitation Service (VPRS) at The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH).  

The protocol will provide a range of specialist ABI psycho-social social work services informed by family therapy frameworks.  The interventions will be individually tailored to meet the low, medium and high support needs of families.  

The Family Intervention Clinical Protocol psychosocial interventions will include:
1.	Counselling 
2.	Family Education relating to Paediatric ABI 
3.	Family Support Group 

The Intervention Group will have a universal referral to the VPRS Social Worker administering the protocol.  The Intervention Group will attend one-hour sessions, twice a week, for each week during the childs inpatient rehabilitation stay.  The Intervention Group will also attend an inpatient group sessions that will run for 45 minutes duration, once a week.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Comparison Group (n=25) will receive usual care social work services consistent with social work practice provided to families of children who are patients at The Royal Childrens Hospital.

The Comparison Group will only be referred to social work if requested by the family or rehabilitation team regarding an identified need. The session length and frequency will be negotiated between the social worker and families.</comparator>

3.Families of children who are already patients of the VPRS and are re-admitted as inpatients for a block of therapy will not be included in the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim:
1.To develop, implement and evaluate family interventions for supporting families of children with ABI in paediatric inpatient rehabilitation.  
2.To compare outcomes of families who receive the family intervention to families who receive the usual care social work service during their childs inpatient rehabilitation.
Study Design: A sequential comparison group design.
Procedure:  Eligible participants will be invited to participate in the study at the time of their childs admission to rehabilitation.  During the childs admission families will be recruited into the Comparison Group or Intervention Group and will receive usual care social work service or family intervention respectively.
Participants will complete questionnaires at admission (T1), discharge (T2) and 6 weeks post discharge (T3). 
Data Analysis: The study will compare outcomes of the Intervention Group and Comparison Group at six weeks post discharge.</summary>
