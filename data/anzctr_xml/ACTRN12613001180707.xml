  <interventions>
    <interventions> The intervention is a tablet based intervention involving 25 sessions to be taken over a 5 week period.  Participants are required to complete 5 sessions per week, these sessions can occur on any day that the participant chooses.  However sessions can not occur twice in the same day and a 12 hour lock out from the program will prevent this from occurring.  Each session takes approximately 16 minutes, with each game lasting for 4 minutes.  
The intervention is based on Posners influential theory of attention networks (selection, maintenance and control).  The intervention comprises a series of games that target each aspect of the attention network. The games are interactive and adaptive, so that the level of difficulty is automatically increased depending on the child's progress. A reward system will be in place to motivate children and assist with compliance.  The intervention automatically logs when the games are played and parents are also asked to make a physical log of the times that the games are played, allowing adherence to be monitored.</interventions>
    <comparator>An active control group will receive a training program identical to the intervention program except that the games will not target the domain of attention.  This training program involves basic motor movements that require minimal attention skills.
Participants will be asked to follow the same training format as the intervention group.  That is, a total of 25 session over a period of 5 weeks.  Participants are allowed to select 5 days of the week to play the game, and the total session time will be approximately 16 minutes. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this trial is positive changes in attention skills and inattentive behaviour.
Attention will be assessed using the Wilding Attention Task which is specifically designed for young children and has been frequently used in individuals with intellectual disabilities.  
Additional information regarding attention will be sought from parents (Strengths and Weaknesses of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity) and teachers (Teachers Scale of Attention in Intellectual Disabilities).  Both of these measures are short questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments occur at three timepoints. 

1. Baseline assessment, prior to intervention

2. Post intervention assessment - 5 weeks after intervention commencement 

3. Follow Up - 3 months after the post intervention assessment   </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Academic skills will be assessed using the Test of Early Mathematics Ability (TEMA), sub scales of the Phonological Abilities Task (PAT; letter knowledge and rhyme detection) and a measure of cardinality (Give a number task).   </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants need to be between the ages of 4 and 10 years when they start the trial.

They must have basic fine motor skills, to allow them to interact with the program.

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible families who are willing to take part and have consented will be randomised to one of two training program (attention training or the control training program).  
The projects research assistant will provide researchers with an opaque envelope containing either the attention game or the control game, along with the appropriate manual.  Both the tablet and manual look identical and make no reference to the domain they are targeting. 
This will ensure blinding of group allocations for both parents and the researchers who will carry out the assessments. 

</concealment>
    <sequence>This randomisation will occur prior to the baseline session, and will be generated by a biostatistician who is independent of the study.  The randomisation will be created variable block sizes and will be stratified by gender, and age to ensure equal allocation of these factors across the 2 interventions.  At the time of randomisation participants will be allocated the next available sequential study number in the required strata. This corresponds to an envelope which will contain the allocation to the attention intervention or the control intervention </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Each of these outcome variables will be modelled via random effects regression as a function of occasion of measurement (pre, post, 3 and 6 month follow up), intervention (yes or no), occasion x intervention, age at baseline, gender, and degree of intellectual disability. A power analysis, conservatively assuming intervention and non-intervention groups of 45, based on a simpler (less powerful) repeated measures analysis of variance approach to randomised controlled trials and assuming within person correlations between successive outcome measures of .7 indicates that there will be power above .8 to detect a difference (change) as low as 4 points in the main outcome variable.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ability to concentrate and stay focused on a task, to switch attention between tasks, to inhibit impulsive responding, and to mentally hold and use information are critical skills for learning and academic outcomes. The development of these skills, collectively known as Executive Functions (EF), begins early in life and become progressively more robust from the preschool years onwards. Recent studies highlight that EFs serve as predictors of literacy and numeracy scores in preschool through high school, facilitate social inclusion and peer relationships, and play an important role in maintaining mental health across the lifespan. Fundamental to EF skills is the construct of attention, a set of cognitive processes that gate learning more generally. Disruption to these essential processes can lead to increased levels of distractibility, impulsivity, forgetfulness and poor focus. In the case of children who are especially vulnerable to learning impairments because of an underlying intellectual disability (e.g. autism, Down Syndrome), attention difficulties will likely exacerbate an already compromised cognitive system by significantly impacting on a developing childs ability to interact with the world and community around them.  This will in turn reduce their capacity to engage in educational programs, and increase their already heightened risk of long-term behavioural and emotional problems.  
The high prevalence of Australian children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities, estimated at 650,000 (approximately 3% of the population) warrants an extensive and inclusive program of research that will investigate how core attention skills can be captured and strengthened in young children in order to maximise learning capacity from as early as possible in development. We propose to address this unmet need by delivering a novel attention training program that is targeted at primary school children with Intellectual disabilities. Our proposed project therefore hypothesises that the attention training program will improve inattentive behaviours in the classroom and home.
As well as hypothesising that the attention training program will increase performance on other non-trained cognitive skills (working memory, math and literacy).  Finally we hypothesise that the attention training program will result in sustained improvements in inattentive behaviours and performance on cognitive tasks 3 months after completion of the intervention.
