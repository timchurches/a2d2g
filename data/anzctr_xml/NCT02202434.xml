    <inclusivecriteria>1. Subject has documented calcific, severe native aortic stenosis with an initial aortic
             valve area (AVA) of =1.0 cm2 (or AVA index of =0.6 cm2/m2) and a mean pressure
             gradient &gt;40 mm Hg or jet velocity &gt;4.0 m/s, as measured by echocardiography and/or
             invasive hemodynamics

          2. Subject has a documented aortic annulus size of =18 mm and =29 mm based on the
             center's assessment of pre-procedure diagnostic imaging (and confirmed by the Case
             Review Committee [CRC]) and, for the randomized cohort, is deemed treatable with an
             available size of both test and control device. For the U.S. Continued Access Study
             cohort the acceptable aortic annulus size is =20 mm and =27 mm.

          4. There is agreement by the heart team (which must include a site investigator
             interventionalist and a site investigator cardiac surgeon) that subject is at high or
             extreme operative risk for surgical valve replacement (see note below for definitions
             of extreme and high risk, the required level of surgical assessment, and CRC
             confirmation) and that TAVR is appropriate. Additionally, subject has at least one of

                  [DLCO] &lt;60%, or other evidence of severe pulmonary dysfunction), neuromuscular
                  disease that creates risk for mechanical ventilation or rehabilitation after

                  rehabilitation after surgical aortic valve replacement, Childs Class A or B liver

                  &gt;6 seconds, Katz Assessment of Daily Living (Katz ADL) score of 3/6 or less, body
                  mass index &lt;21, wheelchair bound, unable to live independently, age =90 years,
                  other evidence that subject is at high or extreme risk for surgical valve
                  replacement (CRC must confirm agreement with site heart team that subject meets
                  high or extreme risk definition)

          5. Heart team (which must include a cardiac interventionalist and an experienced cardiac
             surgeon) assessment that the subject is likely to benefit from valve replacement.

          6. Subject (or legal representative) understands the study requirements and the treatment
             procedures, and provides written informed consent.

          7. Subject, family member, and/or legal representative agree(s) and subject is capable of
             returning to the study hospital for all required scheduled follow up visits.

        Note: Extreme operative risk and high operative risk are defined as follows: Extreme
        Operative Risk: Predicted operative mortality or serious, irreversible morbidity risk =50%
        at 30 days; High Operative Risk: Predicted operative mortality or serious, irreversible
        morbidity risk =15% at 30 days. Risk of operative mortality and morbidity must be assessed
        via an in-person evaluation by a center cardiac surgeon and must be confirmed by the CRC
        (which must include an experienced cardiac surgeon).</inclusivecriteria>
