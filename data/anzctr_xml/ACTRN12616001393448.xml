  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be presented with one of four case scenarios. Case scenarios (which include the label) will be presented via a web-based survey using the online survey platform Qualtrics.  Following randomisation to either mild depression or acute bronchitis, participants will receive either a scenario with a diagnostic label' (e.g. "mild depression" or "acute bronchitis") or symptomatic label" (e.g "the symptoms you are experiencing").  All scenarios: (1) describe symptoms of the allocated condition; (2) offer medication as a treatment option (i.e. SSRIs for mild depression and antibiotics for acute bronchitis); and (3) contain evidence-based information on the potential harms and benefits of medications for the relevant condition. 
The time required to complete the scenario and assessment is approximately 10 minutes. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants' intention to take the proposed medication (i.e. SSRIs or antibiotics).  This will be assessed on a 4-Point Likert scale from "Definitely wouldn't take" to "Definitely would take".</outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be assessed immediately after reading the scenario information.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Why participants made the decision they did.  This will be assessed using the following open-ended questions: 1)  Why did you make this decision; and, 2) Which part(s) of the scenario most influenced your decision.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be assessed following presentation of the case scenario and related question.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study will conduct a randomised controlled trial via an online survey.  Recruitment will be conducted by Survey Sampling International (SSI) in order to obtain the desired 1600 participants.  The current study aims to identify whether individuals given a diagnostic label for either a psychological (mild depression), or physiological condition (acute bronchitis) are more likely to decide to take medication than if given a symptomatic description only.  We hypothesise that a higher proportion of those provided with a diagnostic label will decide to take medication for that condition, than those given a symptomatic description.</summary>
