  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Diagnostic accuracy, compared to the gold standard diagnosis - Gold standard diagnosis is defined as;
in operated patients; based on the surgical resection specimen
in non-operated patients; based on the conclusions of the diagnostic work-up (combined outcomes of tissue sampling and imaging studies), and confirmed by a compatible clinical disease course of at least 9 months</outcome>
      <timepoint>27 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Technical success; tissue acquisition</outcome>
      <timepoint>27 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality and quantity of the tissue sample - Quality, defined as; presence of vital target cells
Quantity, defined as; presence of remnant material after diagnosis was obtained and sufficiency for advanced diagnostic processing; immunohistochemistry, microRNA, or gene expression profiling</outcome>
      <timepoint>within 2 weeks after the EUS procedure and after 27 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety, based on adverse events</outcome>
      <timepoint>first 24 hours until - 27 months after procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Diagnostic yield of the first needle pass</outcome>
      <timepoint>within 2 weeks after the EUS procedure and after 27 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Influence of on-site pathological evaluation - Diagnostic accuracy of both devices will be stratified for on-site pathological evaluation, to be able to compare it's additional value. Depending on the local protocol, on-site pathological evaluation will be performed</outcome>
      <timepoint>27 months</timepoint>
