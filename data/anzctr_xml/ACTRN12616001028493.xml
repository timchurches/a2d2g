  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will use a placebo controlled, cross-over design to determine if beet juice can increase leg blood flow and femoral artery dilation for older adults.  
The study will be conducted in the Exercise Science Research Laboratory at the University of the Sunshine Coast.  After expressing interest in participating, all potential participants will attend an initial visit (visit 1, 60 min) to screen them against inclusion/exclusion criteria, clarify experiment details, ensure written informed consent, and to familiarise participants with the study procedures.  During this visit, participants will have the opportunity to practice and become familiar with passive leg movement, ensuring appropriate muscle relaxation.  Participants will then attend two experimental visits (visits 2 and 3) which will be approximately 6 hours each, separated by at least 3, but no more than 14 days.  During these visits, participants will have blood pressure measured and then a blood sample will be taken for measurement of circulating nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-).  Baseline arterial stiffness, femoral artery dilation capacity (flow mediated dilatation), femoral artery blood flow (reactive hyperaemia), and blood flow during passive leg movement will be measured before the participant consumes 140 ml of concentrated beet juice or the placebo (nitrate-depleted beet juice).  The beet juice and placebo taste, smell, and look the same and will be given in random order.  Participants will then have a waiting period of 2 hours, which is the duration required for NO3- supplementation to significantly elevate plasma NO2- (ie the window of peak physiological effect).  During this waiting period, participants will be asked to complete a medical history questionnaire (which includes smoking history and medication use) and a habitual physical activity questionnaire,  Participants will be given a standardised low-nitrate meal and water and they will be free to talk, read, watch television, or undertake a sedentary activity of their choice.  After the 2-hour waiting period, all baseline measurements will be repeated: blood pressure and a blood sample for NO3-/NO2- measurement, and then arterial stiffness, flow mediated dilatation, reactive hyperaemia and blood flow during passive leg movement.  </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Blood pressure, circulating NO3- and NO2-, as well as arterial stiffness, FMD and blood flow responses to the reactive hyperaemia test and to passive leg extension will be compared before and after the beetroot juice and placebo consumption and a comparison will be made between trials using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).  Post hoc testing will be used to identify the location of significant differences between trials.  Statistical significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05.  Relationships between reactive hyperaemia and passive leg extension hyperaemia will be assessed using Pearsons correlation.  

The main outcome measure is leg blood flow during reactive hyperaemia and passive leg movement with and without nitrate supplementation.  This has not been measured previously, however FMD, which we will also measure and is closely related to leg blood flow during the reactive hyperaemia test, has been reported in previous studies.  Therefore, sample size for this experiment is based on a study with older adults (63 +/- 5 years) that reported a difference in FMD of the brachial artery following ingestion of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (Rammos et al., 2014).  In this study, average FMD increased from 6.0% +/- 0.8% to 6.5 +/- 0.8%, which was significant at P = 0.004 in this experiment with 11 participants.  Setting power at 0.80 and using an alpha level of 0.05 and assuming this difference and variation, significance could be established with 10 participants (Sergeant, 2015).  To allow for the possibility of a smaller effect size in leg blood flow, to compensate for the potentially high variability in change scores, and to improve the likelihood of finding significance in other measures of interest, we have selected a sample size of 15 participants in each group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to examine the effect of nitrate-rich beet juice on leg blood flow during reactive hyperaemia and passive leg movement.  During reactive hyperaemia and passive leg movement, blood flow is known to be highly dependent on the availability of the nitrate derivative, nitric oxide.  The results of this study will determine if beet juice can enhance leg blood flow and thereby provide an effective adjunct to therapeutic exercise.  
The proposed study will use a placebo controlled, cross-over design to determine if beet juice can increase leg blood flow and femoral artery dilation for older adults.  Specifically, we will examine leg blood flow and femoral artery diameter during reactive hyperaemia and passive hyperaemia, two tests which are known to be highly dependent on NO availability, thereby demonstrating the mechanism.  

Participants will attend the laboratory on three occasions: visit 1 will include participant screening, consent, and familiarisation; visits 2 and 3 will involve nitrate-rich beet juice and placebo trials (in random order).  During each of the experimental visits, before and after ingestion of the beet juice or placebo, the following will be measured: blood pressure, blood plasma NO3-/NO2-, arterial stiffness, femoral artery dilation capacity, femoral artery blood flow capacity, and blood flow during passive leg movement.

The results of this study will determine whether or not nitrate supplementation increases leg blood flow and vessel dilation during a reactive hyperaemia test and during passive leg movement.  Ultimately, this experiment will demonstrate whether leg blood flow increases in response to improved NO availability for older adults.  These findings will help to guide treatment for individuals with chronic diseases that limit exercise capacity, such as peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary disorders and heart failure.  This study will also clarify the mechanism by which a simple dietary intervention may enhance leg blood flow, providing an effective adjunct to therapeutic exercise.
