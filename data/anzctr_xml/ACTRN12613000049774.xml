  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is the promotion to participating practices of screening of parents for practice documentation or history of MMR vaccination whilst they are in the practice to have their young children vaccinated.

For practices who consent to participate, an appointment will be arranged between practice staff and study staff to thoroughly describe the program and provide the study materials. 

The following resources will be included in the study materials;
Study protocol
Information and consent forms for participating general practices/nurses
Information and consent forms for participating parents, this will include the Priorix product and consumer information
Advertising material including a poster and leaflets, vaccine fridge prompts.
Promotional reminders for recruited practices  
Pre-vaccination screening checklist
Visual prompts (poster and leaflets) will be available in the waiting room to promote participation.
Fridge magnets will be placed on the vaccine fridge to prompt providers

The intervention will last for 6 months
The promotional reminders will be a contact presence throughout teh waiting room and on the vaccine fridge for the duration of the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>MMR vaccines distributed in the 12 months prior to the study will be the historical comparison measure.

Exclusion criteria for participants indirectly included in the research (secondary participants):
1. Adults born prior to 1966 who attend the practice with a child for routine childhood vaccinations.
2. Adults unaccompanied by a child presenting for treatment or vaccination.
3. Participants are not required to be immunised to be included in the study. Any participants who are pregnant, immunocompromised, symptomatic HIV positive, immunocompromised, allergic to any components in the vaccine will not be vaccinated, but a questionnaire will still be completed and the medical practice paid for its return. The participants information form will contain information on the contraindications for vaccination. The vaccine provider will also assess for contraindications as part of the NHMRC recommended routine pre vaccination assessment for all vaccinations (page 16, Australian Immunisation Handbook)
4. Adults declining consent. Note, adult born on or after 1966 that decline participation in the study can still receive Priorix vaccine if they are not immune, have an uncertain or no vaccination history.</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrolment procedure for general practices (“primary participants”):
Initial telephone contact will be made with a random sample of 106 practices to obtain consent. The principal researcher will contact the principal provider and other relevant practice staff to promote the campaign and obtain consent. The practices will be randomly selected from provider/practice details supplied by The NSW State Vaccine Centre. Following the provision of telephone consent, an appointment will be arranged between practice staff and study staff to thoroughly describe the program and provide the study materials. The researchers will continue to recruit practices until a minimum of 53 practices provide consent to be enrolled in the study. We took a conservative response rate of 50% based on a literature review that has previously been undertaken which suggested a mean participation rate of 54%. Because of the visual nature of this study (the use of posters and reminders), general practices will not be blinded to their allocated group.

Enrolment procedure for participants indirectly included in the research (“secondary participants”):
The secondary participants are adults aged 18-46 years who attend the medical practice with their child for childhood immunisations. The vaccine provider will recruit these adults into the study. For every child who attends a participating general practice for any vaccination, the parent will be given the participant information sheet and consent form, a brief explanation of the study will be given, the parent will be asked to read the information and sign the consent form. The GP/nurse will screen the adult/s for contraindications for vaccination and determine their vaccination history by asking if they recall previous vaccination or have evidence of vaccination in their patient files. Based on the recommendations in the Australian Immunisation Handbook, 1-2 doses of Priorix will be offered to those without evidence of 2 doses of vaccine or an uncertain history. The GP/nurse will complete a 3 question survey on the first occasion for every adult who is screened. These questions are;
1.Is the adult receiving the MMR vaccine? Yes/No
a.If yes is this a travel-specific vaccination or a general update? 
b.If no, why? (options – already received 2 doses, immune, decline)
c.If not being vaccinated today but are considering returning for vaccination please supply a contact name and phone number/email for a follow up in 1 month.</concealment>
    <sequence>The primary participants are the medical practices. The original database of practices comes from the State Vaccine Centre, who has given the researchers a list of all providers in South Eastern Sydney Local Health District with a vaccine account number. Practices must have a vaccine account number to receive state funded vaccines. From this list of 401 medical practices, the investigators will take a random sample of 106 practices. Randomisation of practices will be based on their vaccine account number using random allocation software. The researchers will attempt to recruit 53 of these 106 randomly selected practices. Changes in the number of MMR (Priorix) ordered/administered for adults by these 53 practices following the intervention will be compared to doses ordered prior to the intervention (pre-post intervention study design). 
The secondary participants are adults aged 18-46 years who attend the medical practice with their child for childhood immunisations. The vaccine provider will recruit these adults into the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have submitted an application the the University of NSW HREC who have requested we proceed with a clinical trial application.

The study is being conducted to trial simple strategies to improve the uptake of measles immunisation in adults born in or after 1966 who may not be fully vaccinated and at risk of being infected with measles. The study is a pre-post intervention design. A random sample of 53 general practices will be recruited to participate. During the intervention, the general practices will be given resources to promote vaccination of adults against measles at the same time as these parents attend the medical practice to have their children vaccinated. The campaign is called "Vaccinate the child, vaccinate the parent". </summary>
