Other interventions - Intervention Group

Active Comparator: Intervention group - Patients randomised to the intervention group will follow an intensive 52 week period using a clinical protocol aimed to manage CVD risk in HIV individuals with the use of regular visits to a nurse led CVD risk management clinic, within a multi disciplinary approach to care with the involvement of treating physicians, nurses, dieticians, smoking cessation advisors and an exercise physiologist or personal trainer with the aim to reach their individualised CVD risk target.

Active Comparator: Usual care (control) group - Within the context of an open, cohort study, GPs managing matched control patients allocated usual care will be unaware of the details of the intervention arm and asked to apply their usual pattern of patient visits and treatment strategies to achieve optimal reduction of CVD risk.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a cohort study which follows two groups of participants over a 12 months period. One
      group will access a team approach to care with the aim of reducing their cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) risks from a team of doctors, nurses and health care professionals. The other
      group will continue to access standard care from their treating doctor. Both groups will have
      CVD risk score evaluated after a 12 month period.

      The team care approach will involve specific tests to measure CVD risk as well as smoking
      cessation, exercise and dietary advice and support, including monitoring such as blood
      pressure and cholesterol levels</summary>
