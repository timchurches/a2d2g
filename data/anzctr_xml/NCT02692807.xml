    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Arthroscopic surgical procedures

Active Comparator: Hip arthroscopy surgical procedures (HIPARTI Study) - Surgery is performed under general anaesthesia. Traction and joint access is controlled by fluoroscopy. A diagnostic round in the central and peripheral compartment is performed. Labrum, cartilage, and other possible conditions are looked for and findings are documented. Any labral, chondral and bony pathology (cam or pincer) is treated. Labrum may be debrided, sutured, detached and refixed if needed to treat a pincer lesion. Labrum is secured with suture anchors. Pincer and cam resection is performed using an arthroscopic burr. Cartilage lesions maybe left untreated or treated with debridement or microfracture.

Placebo Comparator: Sham surgery (HIPARTI Study) - The same arthroscopic procedures as stated above are preformed, but no surgical interventions related to Cam, Pincer, or labral tear are performed, only diagnostic round in the central and peripheral compartment is performed. Labrum, cartilage, and other possible conditions are looked for and findings are documented.

Active Comparator: Prospective Cohort (HARP Study) - Those that are not willing to be included in the RCT (HIPARTI Study), will be asked if they are willing to be included in the prospective cohort, or ongoing in countries were ONLY the surgery is performed (Australia). They will sign an informed concent and will undergo surgical interventions as part of usual care. Outcomes collected and follow-ups will be the same as for the RCT (HIPARTI).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of hip arthroscopic surgery
      compared to a sham surgery (diagnostic arthroscopy only) for patients with symptomatic and
      radiological findings related to impingement (FAI) and/or labral tears using a randomized
      controlled design (HIPARTI Study: Primary aim and the main paper: primary end point: iHOT 1
      year follow-up)).

      Our main hypothesis is that surgical procedures of the hip will demonstrate greater efficacy
      than sham surgery (diagnostic hip arthroscopy only) for hip related quality of life (iHOT-33)
      after 1 year and at further (HIPARTI Study).

      The secondary aim of this study is to establish modifiable risk factors associated with pain,
      function, work participation and quality of life over 1 year in people aged 18-50 years with
      hip impingement and/or labral tears diagnosed at hip arthroscopy. (HARP Study: A separate
      paper will be published with this main aim for the HARP Study) Long-term follow-ups for
      HIPARTI Study as well as HARP Study will be performed at 2, 5 and 10 years (secondary aims
      and separate papers).</summary>
