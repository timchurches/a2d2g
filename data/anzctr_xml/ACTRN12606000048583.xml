  <interventions>
    <interventions>Extension to Phase Ib, multi centre, prospective image acquisition trial of [99mTc]ThromboView, at a dose of 0.5 mg labelled with 685-785 MBq 99mTc, in subjects with a diagnosis of at least one pulmonary embolus at a segmental or more proximal pulmonary artery level by CTPA. Eligible and consenting study subjects will receive a single dose of [99mTc]ThromboView prepared using a two-vial formulation and administered by intravenous injection within 72 hours of having undergone a CTPA scan to determine eligibility.  Nuclear Medicine imaging scans (both SPECT and Planar) will be performed at 15 minutes, 2 &amp; 4 hours post injection.  24 hour blood and urine sampling performed to assess Radiopharmacokinetc profile.  Subjects return for safety assessments at Days 7, 30 and 90 post-injection.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Confirm the safety and tolerability of [99mTc]ThromboView prepared using a two-vial formulation in patients with PE.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety will be measured from the time of consent to completion of the safety followup period (Day 90).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Further explore optimum parameters for acquisition and processing of [99mTc] ThromboView thoracic SPECT and planar images for detection of PE.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Image analysis and independent review will be performed at the completion of recruitment phase of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Explore the pharmacokinetic profile of [99mTc] ThromboView two-vial formulation in subjects with PE.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed at the completion of monitoring of the Day 7 followup visit of the last subject enrolled and confirmed evaluable. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Continue to develop preliminary guidelines for the interpretation of thoracic Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and planar images acquired following injection of [99mTc] ThromboView. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be measured at the final Study Steering Committee meeting where results of all Image interpretation is performed.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
