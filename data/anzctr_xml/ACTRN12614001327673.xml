  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in this study have peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in medical, surgical, anaesthetic and intensive care departments, and only paediatric patients. Consenting parents or legal guardians, and patients (if appropriate) will have their PICCs secured with one of the following randomly assigned dressings and securements:

Arm 1: Tissue Adhesive (TA) is a medical grade 'superglue'
(cyanoacrylate) used mainly to close skin lacerations/wounds as an alternative to sutures and staples. A bordered polyurethane dressingwill also be applied.

Arm 2: Combined securement and dressing product: extra-reinforced borders, with an absorbent layer around the polyurethane claimed to wickÂ moisture away from the wound

Arm 3 (Control): Sutureless Stabilisation Device (SSD) have a large adhesive padded footplate with locking clasp made of hard plastic. SSD are used in addition to bordered polyurethane. Bordered polyurethane (BPU) dressings involve a clear
polyurethane with an added external adhesive border of foam or cloth fabric. 

The randomly allocated dressing will be applied until completion of therapy, hospital discharge or at 4 weeks. The dressing will be applied at PICC insertion and then changed every 7 days, or on disruption of the dressing integrity.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PICC failure or complication: Composite measure of any reason for unplanned PICC removal or complication, prior to the completion of therapy. This includes (i) Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI); (ii) local infection of skin or sutures: (iii) dislodgement: (iv) occlusion; (v) CVAD breakage or (vi) venous thrombosis. The primary outcome of device failure is an objective measure, assigned by clinical staff (not research staff or investigators). This is routine clinical practice. Research staff will collect the primary endpoint from the medical records with additional information obtained from the clinical staff/patients if required</outcome>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All randomised patients will be analysed by intention to treat, regardless of treatment received. The patient is the unit of measurement with one PICC per patient.
Feasibility outcomes will be described using descriptive statistics
including mean, median, range, IQR, counts and percentages.
Comparability of groups at baseline will be assessed using clinical parameters. Relative incidence rates of PICC and dressing failure per 100 devices and per 1,000 device days with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will summarise the impact of each dressing, and to test difference between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (with log rank Mantel-Cox test) will compare PICC failure over time. Secondary endpoints including  dwell-time, costs, dislodgement, occlusion, breakage, patient/staff satisfaction scores and adverse events will be compared between groups using  parametric/nonparametric
techniques as appropriate. Data will be exported into PASW 21.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Prior to analysis, data
cleaning of outlying figures, missing, and implausible data will be undertaken, and a random 5% sample of source data rechecked. All attempts will be made to collect the primary endpoint. Missing data will be modelled for best- and worst-case outcomes to assess for effect on overall results. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations. P values of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

Sample size and study power: This is a pilot study to gain information to prepare for an efficacy trial. Thirty participants per study arm will be recruited - totaling 90 participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children admitted to an acute care facility frequently require the insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) for the administration of medication and fluids. These PICCs are associated with a high rate of failure, including PICC-related bloodstream infection (BSI). In order to prevent failure, dressings, such as bordered polyurethane (BPU) and sutureless securement devices (SSD), are used to protect the PICC insertion site from contamination. Additional securement devices, such as sutures, are used to reduce movement of the
catheter.
New products, including tissue adhesive (TA), and combined securement and dressing products (CSD), are available to clinicians to provide securement and dressings for PICC. It is
not known whether these new products are effective at reducing PICC failure and complication, in comparison to standard care (BPU and SSD). The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the feasibility of launching a full-scale efficacy trial, using pre-defined feasibility criteria for recruitment,
retention and protocol fidelity. The secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of dressings and securement products on PICC failure and complication due to infection, occlusion, dislodgement, thrombosis, or breakage, for children with PICC in acute care.
