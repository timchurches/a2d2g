    <interventions>Perceval S Sutureless Valve device implantation. 

The Perceval S Sutureless Valve (PSSV) is a prosthetic heart valve that can be implanted without sutures using a conventional surgical technique that allows removal of the diseased native valve. It is produced with the same material as a standard tissue valve and is mounted on an expandable frame that seals into the heart with similar technology used in Trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), but is specifically designed for surgical implantation.

The functional component of the PSSV is comprised of bovine pericardium fixed in a nitinol cage. The cage is characterised by two ring segments on the proximal and distal end, with a number of supportive elements to allow the valve to anchor to the aortic root.  The cage is collapsible for implantation. 

Implantation time for a PSSV is significantly shorter than standard AVR surgical implantation time as complete removal of calcified tissue is not required, which also reduces the chance of creating defects in the aorta.  Myocardial ischemic time is reduced due to shortened aortic cross clamp time. 

Individual surgery times may vary depending on the attending surgeon and additional procedures required (eg CABG)

    <comparator>International Stardard ISO 5840: Cardiovascular implants - cardiac valve prosthesis. (4th edition 2005)

This International Standard is applicable to both newly developed and modified heart valve substitutes.  It outlines an approach for qualifying the design and manufacture of a heart valve substitute.  

Clinical investigations on new heart valve designs must be carried out in accordance with this Standard, including:
number of patients, duration of study, clinical data requirements, clinical investigation report. 

Safety and efficacy can be assessed by comparing all complications to objective performance criteria (OPC) published in the ISO guidelines. The OPC are the acceptable rates of valve-related complications and may be used without further justification.

Evaluating post-operative complications 

Examples of expected complication:

Structural Valve Deterioration;
Dysfunction or deterioration involving the operated valve as determined by reoperation, autopsy, or clinical investigation (exclusive of infection or thrombosis).
Changes intrinsic to the valve, such as wear, fracture, poppet escape, calcification, leaflet tear, stent creep, suture line disruption of components of a prosthetic valve, new chordal rupture, leaflet disruption, or leaflet retraction of a repaired valve.

Nonstructural Dysfunction;
Any abnormality not intrinsic to the valve itself that results in stenosis or regurgitation of the operated valve or hemolysis.
Problems that do not directly involve valve components yet result  in dysfunction of an operated valve, such as: entrapment by pannus, tissue, or suture; paravalvular leak; inappropriate sizing or positioning; residual leak or obstruction after valve implantation or repair; and clinically important intravascular haemolytic anaemia.
Also includes development of aortic or pulmonic regurgitation as a result of technical errors, dilatation of the valve annulus; new onset of coronary ischaemia form coronary ostial obstruction or paravalular aortic regurgitation.

      <outcome>Improved SF-36 scores post-operatively

The SF-36v2 "Registered Trademark" Health Survey (SF-36v2) is a multipurpose,
short-form health survey with 36 questions
that yields an eight-scale profi le of functional health
and well-being, as well as two psychometrically based
physical and mental health summary measures and a
preference-based health utility index.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved NYHA classification post-operatively

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a simple way of classifying the extent of heart failure. It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regards to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and or angina pain. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recorded during preoperative medical assessment.
6 weeks, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduced operation times

Implantation time for a PSSV is significantly shorter than standard AVR surgical implantation time as complete removal of calcified tissue is not required.  Myocardial ischemic time is reduced due to shortened aortic cross clamp time. 

It is therefore expected that an overall reduction in surgery times will be observed. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Total surgical time will be extracted from Theatre Database and recorded in research participant data file. </timepoint>
