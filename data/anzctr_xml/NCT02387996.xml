    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate Per BIRC Assessment - Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the number of participants with a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (per RECIST 1.1 criteria) divided by the number of all treated participants. RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. CR= Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. BIRC= blinded independent review committee</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of first dose to the date of objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (assessed up to 14 months)</timepoint>

RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. CR= Disappearance of all target lesions.

PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. BIRC= blinded independent review committee PD-L1 expression level= membranous staining in greater than or equal to 5% and greater than or equal to 1% tumor cells. n = Number of participants in each category</outcome>

      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per BIRC Assessment - PFS was defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented tumor progression, based on BIRC assessments (per RECIST 1.1), or death due to any cause. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors</outcome>

RECIST is the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors PD-L1 expression level is defined as membranous staining in greater than or equal to 5% and greater than or equal to 1% tumor cells. n = Number of participants in each category</outcome>

      <outcome>OS by PD-L1 Expression Level - Overall Survival was defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of death. A subject who had not died was censored at last known date alive.
