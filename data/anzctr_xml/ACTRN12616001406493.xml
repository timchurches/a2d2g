  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention 1
Participants will be of non-probability, convenience sampling based on eligibility on application.  There will be eight weeks of thrice-weekly, group Bikram Yoga (90 minutes per session), carried out by a qualified Bikram Yoga teacher in a suitably designed hot Yoga studio, at 40 degrees C. (104 F).  Classes involve standardised 26 sequential postures and 2 breathing exercises and will be taught by the same teacher. Attendance will be recorded in attendance register.

Intervention 2
Participants will be of non-probability, convenience sampling based on eligibility on application.  There will be eight weeks of twice or thrice-weekly, group Hatha Yoga (90 minutes per session), carried out by a qualified Hatha Yoga teacher in a suitably designed Yoga studio.  Normal room temperature will apply.  Classes will insofar as possible include the same postures as in Bikram Yoga, but will not follow the same sequence.  Classes will be taught by the same teacher. Attendance will be recorded in attendance register.
</interventions>
    <comparator>A control group of sedentary, but otherwise healthy adults between 18-65 will be utilised.  The control group will be offered participation in Bikram Yoga Classes, Hatha Yoga classes or fitness screening and exercise programs at an introductory rate similar to the other non-control participants.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to validate or invalidate the claims made by the creator of Bikram Yoga regarding the efficacy of this type of yoga compared to other types.  The efficacy is considered to be due to the application of heat. As the purpose is to determine the effects, no pre=determined assumptions have been made.  

Three groups will take part- a Bikram group, a standard Hatha group and a sedentary group.  The trial will run for eight weeks with tests before and after.

All three groups will undergo medical, psychological and physical pre-tests and post-tests.

Results will be compared across the three groups and a conclusion reached as to differences if any.</summary>
