  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1: Waitlist Control (who will begin the program 9 weeks after the other Groups). This group will receive the same intervention as Group 3. Group 2: Self-Guided Group. This group will receive access to all the program materials including access to the 5 online lessons and homework assignments, to stories written by previous participants with symptoms of anxiety and depression, and access to additional written resources. Group 3: Self-Guided + Automatic Email Group. This group will receive access to all the materials provided to Group 2, but will also receive regular automatic emails to inform participants about new materials, upcoming lessons, and reminders to complete lessons. 

All participants will receive online access to 5 lessons of Internet based education about management of symptoms of depression and anxiety. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to homework assignments/summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with anxiety and depression, taking a further 10 minutes per week. The duration of the program is 8 weeks. Participants in Groups 2 and 3 will be contacted 3 months and 12 months post program and asked to complete follow-up questionnaires. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-education, post-education, 3-months post-education and 12 months post-education. These will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. The education materials are based on evidence-based cognitive behavioural techniques for managing symptoms of anxiety and depression.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is part of a research program funded by the NHMRC (No. 630560) to develop and evaluate Internet based transdiagnostic education and treatment programs for people with anxiety and depression. This project examines the efficacy of a 5-lesson education course for people with depression, social phobia and/or panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) and/or generalized anxiety disorder. It also explores the relative effect of different types of reminders (none vs. automatic email reminders) on outcomes and acceptability to consumers. We expect that differences will be observed between groups in symptoms of anxiety and depression (Groups 3&gt;2&gt;1) and in acceptability to consumers (Groups 3&gt;2&gt;1) and in completion rates (Groups 3&gt;2&gt;1).</summary>
