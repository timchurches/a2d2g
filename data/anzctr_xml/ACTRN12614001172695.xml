    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through advertisement in local papers, posters, via the Internet, and through referrals from general practitioners (GPs) or dermatologists. Trial information flyers will be placed in offices of GPs or dermatologists who agree to refer patients to the trial. 
 The randomisation codes will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes. Participants will select an envelope, and hand it to the trial coordinator, who will write the participant details on the outside of the envelope. A number code inside the envelope will correspond with a package number that will contain either the intervention or placebo in identical packaging.  Neither the trial participants nor investigators will know if the participant is receiving real treatment or placebo.  
</concealment>
    <sequence>Treatment allocation will be to either the intervention group (PTQX) or control group (placebo) in equal ratio (1:1). Block randomisation method will be employed with a balanced variable blocks. Equal number of participants will receive the real treatment and the inert vehicle (the placebo).  Randomisation codes will be generated by a computer program by an independent statistician who is not directly involved with the trial.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed project involves conduction of a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of oral ingestion of Chinese herbal medicine granules, PTQX for children with moderate to severe atopic eczema. 
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate whether the oral ingestion of PTQX can reduce severity of the condition and improve the quality of life in children with moderate to severe AE. It will also assess the safety of PTQX for AE. The 16-week trial includes 12 weeks of treatment and a 4-week follow-up period.
