  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned by a computer into one of 3 groups

Group 1: Will be initially vaccinated intramuscularly against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis in July followed by pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines a month later.


Group 2 : Will be vaccinated intramuscularly in July against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis, pneumococcal and meningococcal disease at the same time

Group 3: Will be initially vaccinated intramuscularly in July against pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases followed, by diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine a month later.

The dose of the vaccines will be the same standard dose in all the groups : dTp =0.5mL, MCV4= 0.5 mL and PCV13= 0.5 mL

Knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP survey). This survey will be in the form of self administered questionnaire that will be distributed before vaccination. The questions will explore the pilgrims attitude and knowledge regarding vaccines and Hajj diseases.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control group here as there is no standard practice for this. The three groups will compared against each other to find out which group will gain a better immune response</comparator>

The investigator will determine who is eligible by checking the eligibility checklist. Eligible participants will be consented after reading the (Information Statement). After they sign the consent form, the will be randomly assigned by an onsite computer into one of 3 groups. Neither the study investigator nor the study participant can decide in which group the participant will be.

    <statisticalmethods>Studies with various meningococcal conjugate vaccines have shown that a minimum 4 fold response to serogroup (Y) to be as low as 74%. With power of 80% and a two sided a=0.025, a sample size of 72 participants per group will give the power to detect a 25% relative increase from 74% to 92.5% (with the same power, this will also detect an increase from 80% up to 96%). (We will be also able to detect a reduction in response from 74% to 49.5% [and from 80% to 56%]). To account for 5% loss to follow-up, approximately 76 per group are required i.e. a total of 227 participants in the three groups. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research suggests that carrier proteins may unpredictably enhance or reduce immune response to the polysaccharide antigens; therefore administering dTpa before, with, or after MCV4 is an important matter with regard to immune response to vaccines. 
There are no data Adults on whether the receipt of dTpa before, after or concomitantly with MCV4 and PCV13 would enhance or suppress immune response. Therefore, we would like to explore further means in order to optimise immunity and maximise immunogenicity of these vaccines in Hajj or Umrah pilgrims.
In addition to optimising the immunogenicity of the recommended vaccines, this study will also explore the pilgrims pre-travel health seeking behaviour and assess their Knowledge Perception and Attitude (KAP) towards the recommended vaccines.
