  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Participants asked questions about recent experiences of anal intercourse in the last six months.
Treatment: surgery - High Resolution Anoscopy

Other: HIV positive homosexual men - Therefore, it is proposed we conduct a longitudinal study of the epidemiology of low risk and high risk HPV infection and related low grade and high grade anal cancers in HIV negative and HIV positive homosexual men who are 35 years or older. Participants are asked questions about recent experiences of anal intercourse in the last six months.
At baseline, all men (both HIV positive and HIV negative)will undergo a behavioural questionnaire, and anal swabs which will be tested for HPV and cytology. An HRA will also be performed on all men. Blood will be collected for HIV testing for HIV negative participants, syphilis and storage. Participants will be followed up for three years with one six-monthly visit in the first year then annually. A 6th study visit to discuss all study results will take place 2-3 months after the 5th study visit. A behavioural questionnaire, an anal swab, and HRA will be administered at all follow up interviews.

Treatment: surgery: High Resolution Anoscopy
The HRA is performed on HIV positive and HIV negative participants by study doctor after an examination of the perianal region and perineum. The plastic anoscope is inserted into the anal canal and visualised under high resolution magnification. Biopsy samples will be taken by the clinician for histological assessment if there are any detected abnormalities.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>SPANC stands for Study of the Prevention of Anal Cancer. There are more than 100 types of
      human papillomavirus (HPV). Some HPV types cause genital warts and other types cause more
      than 90% of anal cancer.

      Gay men are over 20 times more likely than others to develop anal cancer.

      SPANC is a study of anal (HPV) infection and related anal disease in gay men. The study will
      provide important information to guide the possible future introduction of anal cancer
      screening programs for gay men.</summary>
