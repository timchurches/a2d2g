  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 'Your Heart Forecast' tool, an electronic tool that was developed to help doctors explain cardiovascular risk to their patients and encourage them to make important lifestyle changes.  Administered by the patient's doctor or practice nurse, the Heart Forecast Tool provides a graphical story, starting with a patient's current cardiovascular risk, and showing them how they compare to a peer with ideal risk factor control and the same cardiovascular risk.  The tool then shows patients what happens to their risk as they get older and make no changes to their current risk factors (their Heart Forecast), and then what would happen to their risk in the future if they were able to make changes (eg. stop smoking).  The Heart Forecast takes 5-10 minutes to administer and can be downloaded free via this website address: http://www.yourheartforecast.org.nz/index.asp?pageID=2145872462 
Participants allocated to this intervention group also undergo the 'usual risk assessment' in addition to the Heart Forecast tool.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator intervention is 'usual risk assessment', which involves estimating the participant's 5 year cardiovascular disease risk using flip charts.  Like the group receiving the Heart Forecast tool intervention, this group would receive the assessment face-to-face with the study coordinator (either a study nurse or General Practice [GP] registrar).  The approximate duration of the assessment (which includes completing pre- and post-assessment questionnaires) will be no more than 60 minutes</comparator>

      <outcome>Improvement in participants' understanding of:
(1) their short- and longer-term cardiovascular risk
(2) how lifestyle change can reduce risk in the short- and long-term
(3) their own individual cardiovascular risk factors

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients with clinically high risk, as defined by New Zealand Guidelines Group criteria - ie. if they have any of the following:
- previous cardiovascular disease
- stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
- diabetes complicated by renal disease
- a genetic lipid disorder
- blood pressure 170/100 or over
- total cholesterol or total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ratio (TC/HDL) 8 or over
- pregnant

Also, non-English speakers would be excluded as the Forecast tool is available in English language version only</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified from practice databases.  The study nurse will contact people meeting eligibility criteria and invite them to join the study.  

Allocation concealment will be achieved via sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation of intervention (to either 'usual risk assessment' or 'usual risk assessment plus Heart Forecast') will be via generation of random numbers (this will be via simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software).  Numbers will be considered as random digits from 0 to 9, with odd numbers representing randomisation to 'usual risk assessment' and even numbers indicating allocation to 'usual risk assessment plus Heart Forecast'.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Your Heart Forecast is an electronic tool that was developed to help doctors explain cardiovascular risk to their patients and encourage them to make important lifestyle changes.  The Heart Forecast was piloted in over 40 practices in Auckland and Northland in early 2009.  Feedback was positive, indicating that the tool supported cardiovascular risk communication and shared decision making. The current study aims to more formally test the efficacy of the Heart Forecast, examining whether it improves patients understanding of the determinants of their risk and helps motivate them to make necessary lifestyle changes.  One hundred patients aged 30-65 who are current smokers will be recruited on to this study.  They will be randomised to receive one of two interventions: either usual risk assessment or usual risk assessment plus the Heart Forecast.  Changes in understanding and motivation will be assessed via questionnaires immediately pre- and post, and 1-month post, their intervention sessions.</summary>
