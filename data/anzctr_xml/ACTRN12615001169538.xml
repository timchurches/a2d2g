  <interventions>
    <interventions>Screening:
Patient will be asked about medical history, including medications, and will undergo a physical examination, including measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate and temperature.  About 33 mL of blood will be collected to assess the levels of BCR-ABL, imatinib, different types of blood cells, blood minerals, and to assess liver and kidney function. Female patients of child bearing potential will also require a pregnancy test (5mL of blood). If 'entry criteria' are met the patient will be able to participate in the study.

Combination Phase: 
Patient will take a daily oral dose of lenalidomide in addition to continuing imatinib at the previous stable dose for 6 months. The starting dose of lenalidomide oral capsule will be 5 mg daily for the first 28 day cycle, escalating up to 10 mg daily according to tolerability.
Patient will return to the Study Doctors clinic every week for the first month, and every month for the next 5 months for physical examination and measurement of blood pressure, heart rate and temperature.  12 mL (2 and a half teaspoons) of blood will be taken weekly for the first month and monthly thereafter to assess the levels of different types of blood cells, blood minerals, and to assess liver and kidney function.  27 mL (2 tablespoons) of blood will be collected every 2 months for BCR-ABL PCR. After the first 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment an additional 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of blood will be collected to measure the amount of imatinib.  For female patients of child bearing potential, a further 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of blood will be collected every month for a pregnancy test.  A bone marrow is required at the end of the combination phase. Patients will be required to return empty lenalidomide containers to pharmacy. Patients will be asked at each visit whether they have missed any scheduled imatinib doses.   

Monotherapy Phase:
The patient will stop taking imatinib, and continue on lenalidomide monotherapy at a dose of up to 10 mg per day orally for up to 6 months, or until molecular recurrence, should this occur sooner..
Patient will return to the Study Doctors clinic every month for blood tests.    About 40 mL (2 tablespoons) of blood will be taken to assess the levels of BCR-ABL, different types of blood cells, blood minerals, and to assess liver and kidney function.  For female patients of child bearing potential, a further 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of blood will be collected every month for a pregnancy test.  A bone marrow is additionally required at the end of the Monotherapy Phase. Patients will be required to return empty lenalidomide containers to pharmacy. 

Monitoring Phase:
Patient will stop lenalidomide and remain off imatinib. The Monitoring Phase will last for up to 30 months (2 and a half years) unless relapse occurs as decided by clinical discretion of the treating physician..
Patient will continue to have monthly BCR-ABL levels in which 27 mL (2 tablespoons) of blood will be collected for the first 6 months and then every 2 months for the subsequent 18 months, and every 3 months for one year.  4-12 mL (1-2 and a half teaspoons) of blood will be taken 3 monthly for the first 2 years and then yearly for the subsequent year to assess the levels of different types of blood cells, important blood minerals, and to assess liver and kidney function.  A bone marrow is additionally required at month 3 of the Monitoring Phase.

Re-Treatment Phase:
Patients who relapse at any time after stopping imatinib will stop taking lenalidomide (if applicable) and resume imatinib at the previous effective and tolerated dose for as long as is needed. During the Re-Treatment Phase the response to treatment will be monitored every month for at least 6 months.  If any patient shows a poor response to re-treatment with imatinib, then alternative treatment will be offered.

Follow-Up Phase:
The Follow-Up Phase will last for 3 years after the completion of the Monitoring or Re-Treatment Phase (if this is needed).
Patient will have blood tests every 6 months for BCR-ABL PCR (27 mL or 2 tablespoons) and yearly to assess the levels of different types of blood cells (4 mL or 1 teaspoon).  This will continue for the next 3 years.  The total duration for the study will be up to 6 and a half years.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of imatinib and lenalidomide therapy in CML patients previously on imatinib therapy for at least 12 months. Safety assessments in the Combination Phase will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events and their relationship to the combination of imatinib and lenalidomide. Plasma imatinib drug levels will be measured before and after the addition of lenalidomide to determine whether lenalidomide alters imatinib levels. During the Monotherapy Phase and until 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide all adverse events will be reported, with an assessment of their relationship to lenalidomide treatment. Significant past medical history and current medical conditions will be recorded at the screening visit prior to the start of the study, and significant findings made during the study which meet the definition of an adverse event will be reported. Safety assessments will include the regular monitoring of haematology and blood chemistry, physical examination, and information about other medication and therapies.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of combining imatinib (Glivec) with lenalidomide (Revlimid) and to determine whether the combination may improve the likelihood of maintaining a treatment-free remission in the future. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 or over, have been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia for which imatinib has been prescribed. Patients must have previously had a trial cessation of imatinib and needed to go back on treatment. Patients who may be eligible for this study must have been able to re-achieve and maintain at least 12 months of undetectable or very low levels of leukaemia cells after restarting their treatment with imatinib. 
Study details? All participants enrolled in this study will receive six months combination therapy of a daily oral dose of 10mg lenalidomide in addition to their existing imatinib medication. After six months, patients will then stop taking imatinib and continue to take the lenalidomide alone for another six months. Patients will then stop taking lenalidomide and enter a monitoring period on no medication which lasts up to two and a half years. If at any point a relapse occurs then imatinib will be re-started, or an alternative therapy if required. Patients will then be followed up for a further three years, giving a total study duration of up to six and a half years. Throughout this period, blood samples will be taken at weekly to six monthly intervals. Patient outcomes will be assessed by evaluating blood samples, bone marrow samples and physical examinations to monitor safety of the drug combination and to monitor disease progression. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide information regarding the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with imatinib for improving the chance of chronic myeloid leukaemia patients achieving a treatment-free remission.
