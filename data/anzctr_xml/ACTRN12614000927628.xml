  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention participants will partake in a 12-week physical activity program during which they will wear a pedometer and use an online resource.  The main focus of the online resource is a step log where participants enter their daily step counts, perception of exertion (RPE) and feeling (affect) daily.  Based on this information they will be emailed weekly step count goals.  The website will also include an interactive forum that links participants to other participants undertaking the study in the intervention group.  There will be a virtual notice board where community service organisers can advertise events and activities relating to physical activity and general health and wellbeing.  Information on healthy eating will be provided based on the recommendations in The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (developed by the Australian Government, Department of Health and Aging).  Participants are free to use (or not use) the program at their discretion.  Adherence will be monitored by the number of logins to the website and progress phone calls which will occur weekly, but taper off as the intervention progresses and to foster independence.

Health measures such as height, weight, blood pressure, waist and hip girths and blood chemistry will be collected.  Participants will also be asked to fill out questionnaires relating to their physical and psychological wellbeing and complete a food frequency questionnaire.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will also be asked to wear a pedometer over the 12-week program.  However, they will receive a paper logbook to record their daily step counts instead of access to the website. They will receive only one progress phone call (week 2) to ensure they understand their requirements for the study.  They will receive weekly step goal emails, however these will be standardized across all control participants, with the aim of reaching the recommended 10,000 steps in week 12 of the program</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of an online resource to increase physical activity (primarily walking) among rural South Australian adults.  Registration is open for any adult (aged 18 - 74) whose primary residence is in either the Riverland or Yorke Peninsula regions of South Australia and who are currently insufficiently active (i.e. participated in less than 20 bouts of physical activity lasting at least 30 minutes in the previous month).  Registered participants will also require ongoing access to the internet.  Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in the intervention group will take part in a 12-week lifestyle program during which they will wear a pedometer and use an online resource. The main focus of the online resource is a step log where participants enter their daily step counts, perception of exertion and feeling daily. Based on this information they will be emailed weekly step count goals. The website will also include an interactive forum that links participants to other participants in the intervention group.  There will be a virtual notice board where community service organisers can advertise events and activities relating to physical activity and healthy eating. Information on healthy eating will be provided based on The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Intervention group participants will receive weekly progress phone calls which will be tapered off towards the end of the study period to foster independence.  Participants are free to use (or not use) the program at their discretion. Participants in the other group will receive a pedometer, standard step log diary (paper form) and one progress phone call (week 2).  They will receive step goal emails, however these will be generic (versus individualized) with the intention of reaching the recommended 10,000 steps by week 12.  Health, physical activity and psychological wellbeing measures will be taken at baseline and intervention-end, as well as 6-month and 12-month follow-up.</summary>
