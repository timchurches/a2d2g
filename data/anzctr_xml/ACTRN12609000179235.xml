  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised, open-label, cross-over 8 week study in virologically controlled HIV-infected adults currently receiving atazanavircontaining combination antiretroviral therapy. Participants will be randomised to receive either raltegravir 400 mg twice daily plus atazanavir 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by raltegravir 800 mg daily plus atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg daily for 4 weeks or. raltegravir 800 mg daily plus atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by raltegravir 400 mg twice daily plus atazanavir 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. The study has efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic endpoints. All drugs will be administered orally. There will be no washout period between the crossover treatments.</interventions>
    <comparator>A regimen comprising raltegravir 400 mg twice daily plus atazanavir 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks will be compared to a regimen comprising raltegravir 800 mg daily plus atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg daily for 4 weeks. All drugs will be administered orally. Participants will commence one of the two regimens then change to the alternate regimen following 4 weeks of therapy.</comparator>
