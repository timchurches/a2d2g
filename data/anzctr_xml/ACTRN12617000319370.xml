  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a double-blind, placebo controlled parallel design intervention study that will allow us to test the effect of the consumption of blackcurrant juice on the modulation of dopaminergic/noradrenergic nerve pathways and motivation to maintain a moderate intensity exercise.  All prospective participants will be asked to attend a familiarisation session which will take approximately 1 hour.  During the familiarisation session, participants will be introduced to the subjective scales and questionnaire that they will be asked to respond to during the main trial day.  Participants will also be asked to perform a moderate intensity treadmill exercise that will allow us to estimate the intensity of the exercise they will be required to perform on the main trial day that is customised to their fitness level.

On the main trial day, participants will be randomised into one of two treatment groups: (1) Blackcurrant group and (2) Placebo group.  On the main trial day, participants will be asked to consume 200 mL of blackcurrant (adjusted to a dose of 500 mg polyphenol per 60 kg body weight) or placebo drink within 2 minutes.  After consuming the their treatment drink, participants will be asked to sit in the waiting room provided in the facility and refrain from any exercise for 1 hr.  Following this, participants will be asked to perform a moderate intensity exercise with their motivation and exertion subjectively measured at regular intervals.  We estimate that participants will be required to be on-site for approximately 4-5 hours during the main trial day.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo drink will contain the equivalent amount of sugar (glucose and fructose) that would be in be present in 500 mg polyphenol per 60 kg body weight of blackcurrant juice made up to 200 mL volume.  Because our treatment intervention is normalised to each individuals body weight, the quantities of sugar will vary for each individual.  All treatment drinks (Blackcurrant and Placebo) will contain equivalent amounts of artificial blackcurrant flavouring, colouring and artificial sweetener so that both treatments will look and taste as identical as possible.</comparator>

      <outcome>The primary subjective motivation measure will be measured by scores on the Feeling Scale (FS) given by participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be familiarised to the FS measures during the familiarisation session.  On the main trial day, participants will be asked to give subjective ratings of their motivation using the FS at the start and every 3-5 minutes after the commencement of the treadmill exercise until the end of the exercise trial.  After a two minute warm down from the treadmill exercise, participants will be asked to give a final FS score.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Heart rate during exercise will measured as a secondary measure of exercise/physical activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participant's resting, exercising and recovery heart rate will be measured continuously the during the familiarisation and main trial day using chest-worn heart rate monitor.</timepoint>

      <outcome>The Rate of Percieved Exertion (RPE) as a secondary subjective measure of motivation and effort by scores given by participants will be measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Similar to the FS measures, participants will be asked to provide a RPE score using an RPE scale at the start and every 3-5 minutes after the commencement of the treadmill exercise until the end of the exercise trial.  After a two-minute warm down period, participants will be asked to provide a final RPE score.</timepoint>

Blood glucose will be measured using a "point of care" biosensor from finger prick blood samples at these same timepoints.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma anthocyanin and polyphenol levels will be measured in blood samples collected from participants as composite measurements of bioavailabilty.</outcome>

Participant treatment allocation is held and concealed until completion of the trial and analysis of the data is finished.  Furthermore, the placebo treatment drink will be matched to have a similar colour and sweetness as the blackcurrant drink and participants will be asked to consume the treatment juice as quickly as they can.</concealment>

Interaction between consumption of blackcurrant juice and parameters of exercise/physical performance and subjective measures of motivation and interactions between these will be determined.  Likewise, interaction between consumption of blackcurrant juice and modulation of biomarkers detailed in this study and how these relate to physiological and subjective measures will be determined.  Statistical significance for the comparison between Blackcurrant and Placebo groups will be assessed using Student's two-sample t-test.  Multiple comparisons will be assessed by two-way ANOVA.  Where appropriate, the original data will be transformed to achieve normality and constant variance in the residuals.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Regular and appropriate exercise is a necessary part of a healthy lifestyle.  It is associated with increased physical and mental acuity and the prevention of age-related chronic health problems like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.  An individual's motivation or desire to maintain a regular exercise regime is crucial to gaining these health benefits.  Moreover, several human and animal studies have shown that motivation to maintain regular physical activity involves dopaminergic and noradrenergic nerve pathways in the brain that regulate the generation and metabolism of the neurotransmitters dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline and serotonin.

There is very limited information available on how a nutritional intervention may improve motivation to exercise.  Over recent years, only one publication has reported the effects of a dietary intervention on exercise motivation, with caffeine consumption linked to increase enjoyment from exercise.  In a recent clinical trial, we have demonstrated that the consumption of a single dose of blackcurrant juice had an acute, reversible modulatory effect of neurotransmitter oxidation in healthy individuals in vivo.  Given the known interaction between brain neurotransmitters and physical exercise and motivation, it is feasible that the consumption of blackcurrants may improve physical activity in humans through their modulatory effects on exercise-related brain neurotransmitters.

In this study, we aim to subjectively measure our participants' motivation to maintain a prescribed moderate intensity exercise following the consumption of blackcurrant juice and how this relates to the regulation of brain neurotransmitters related to motivation.  We hypothesise that blackcurrant juice modulates brain neurotransmitter levels leading to higher concentrations of neurotransmitters related to motivation which results in a greater desire and willingness to exercise.  This study will generate knowledge supporting the implementation of timed nutritional strategies to maintain motivation during exercise, thus assisting in attaining the health benefits associated with regular and appropriate exercise.</summary>
