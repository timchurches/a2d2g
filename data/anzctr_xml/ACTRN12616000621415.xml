  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of an online, mobile-compatible parenting program ('Parenting Resilient Kids') which is part of a larger research translation program (Parenting Strategies; www.parentingstrategies.net). Parents will first complete an online Parent Survey (developed specifically for use in this study) that assesses their current parenting practices against the recommendations in the Guidelines 'How to reduce your child's risk of depression and clinical anxiety: strategies for parents of primary-school aged children' (Parenting Strategies Program, 2014; henceforth the Guidelines). Based on their responses to this survey, parents in the intervention group will then (1) receive an individually-tailored feedback report that highlights areas where they are doing well (i.e., concordant with the Guidelines) and areas where they can improve (i.e., not concordant with the Guidelines), and (2) be given access to the web- and app-based parenting intervention (up to 12 modules) to support them in making changes to the identified areas of weakness in their parenting. Specific modules are recommended to parents based on their responses to the baseline Parent Survey.

Feedback messages are brief, with practical strategies provided in dot point form, and are designed to motivate behaviour change. Parents in the intervention group will view their feedback report online immediately after submitting their online baseline assessment and being randomly allocated to the intervention group. They will also be emailed a copy of their feedback report and the Guidelines (in pdf). Five days later, parents will be emailed instructions for accessing the interactive parenting program with their recommended modules. Upon logging in to their parenting program, parents will see their recommended modules as well as other available modules. They can further tailor their parenting program at this stage by deselecting recommended modules and/or selecting additional modules. They then confirm their selection and can commence their personalised program. The 12 modules comprising the intervention are derived from topics covered in the Guidelines. Modules include illustrations, vignettes, interactive activities, goal-setting exercises, and an end-of-module quiz with immediate feedback to consolidate learning. The module topics include: 
1) Show affection and acceptance
2) Be involved
3) Encourage autonomy
4) Make time to talk
5) Encourage healthy habits
6) Establish family rules and consequences
7) Help set goals and solve problems
8) Help your child manage emotions
9) Encourage supportive relationships
10) Manage conflict in the home
11) Help your child manage anxiety
12) Seek help. 
After completing the last module in their original program, parents can elect to complete other modules if desired. Each module takes 15-25 minutes to complete. Parents are encouraged to complete one module per week. The website is programmed to unlock one module per week from each parent's program, until all modules in their personalised program have been unlocked. Once parents have completed all the modules in their personalised program, they have ongoing access to all 12 modules in the program. Their access to their parenting program will remain open indefinitely. 

All parent participants, regardless of group, will receive a 5-minute weekly phone call from a researcher, starting 7 days after completing their baseline survey, and every week thereafter for at least 8 weeks. Parents in the intervention group will receive a minimum of 8 weekly calls in total, or more if they have more than 7 modules (the total number of calls will match the total number of modules selected plus one). Research staff will be trained to make these calls following a standard script (i.e. a standard list of questions and prompts), and will not provide individual advice or therapy. The aims of these calls are to address any study-related questions that arise, ascertain that parents progress through their allocated intervention each week till completion, and enhance retention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Parents in the control group are provided with a standardized package of educational materials about child development and mental health via the trial website. Parent participants receive an email a week which provides a link to the corresponding webpage with their information factsheet for that week, for 8 weeks (to match the expected mean number of modules received by the intervention group). This package provides general information to parents as opposed to tailored, actionable strategies, and is designed to represent a selection of resources that are available to parents as part of the current health
promotion approach for child wellbeing. The materials are adapted from credible existing resources provided on the Raising Children Network website http://raisingchildren.net.au. The control intervention is also fully online and mobile compatible.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>When parents submit their baseline assessment on the trial website, the website will generate an automated random allocation sequence to allocate parent-child dyads to either the control or intervention group. Parents find out their assignment immediately thereafter: the intervention group receives their tailored feedback, the Parenting Guidelines, and the online parenting program comprising up to 12 modules which are recommended based on their survey responses; whereas the control group receive the first of their 8 weekly factsheets. As such, allocation is concealed from both participants and researchers prior to assignment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Immediately after parents submit their baseline assessment online, the trial website is programmed to run a stratified random allocation sequence (based on parent gender) to allocate parent-child dyads to either the control or intervention group. </sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>"The people administering the treatment/s" are "masked" because the intervention is delivered online by a fully automated trial website. 

Child informants ("people assessing the outcomes") are assumed to be blinded because they are not direct recipients of the online parenting intervention.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Required sample size:
Based on a power analysis, for a repeated-measures design with a power of 0.80, small effect size (Cohen's d=0.2), and alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 294 parent-child dyads (147 dyads per group) is required. Based on an expected attrition rate of approximately 10-15%, we aim to recruit 340 parent-child dyads (170 dyads per group).

Data analysis:
The primary analyses will be intent-to-treat analyses. To assess group differences in changes in parental concordance with the Guidelines (primary outcome 1) and child depression and anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes 2 and 3) across timepoints (baseline, and 3-month [primary outcome 1], 12-month follow-up [primary outcomes 2 and 3]) or 24-month follow-up [primary outcomes 2 and 3]), a series of mixed effects analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) will be conducted. Child age and gender will be used as covariates. Little's MCAR (missing completely at random) test will be used to analyse the extent and pattern of missing data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effects of an individually-tailored online parenting program on parenting behaviours associated with childhood depression and anxiety disorders, and in turn child anxiety and depressive symptoms. The program is designed to provide parents with (1) personalised feedback about their current parenting, including what they are doing well and areas that they can improve in order to reduce their child' risk of depression and anxiety, and (2) specific modules of the mobile-compatible online parenting intervention, recommended based on their survey responses, to support them in making changes to identified areas for improvement in their parenting. </summary>
