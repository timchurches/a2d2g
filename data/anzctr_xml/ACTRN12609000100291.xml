  <interventions>
    <interventions>An 18 month randomised controlled trial (12 month intervention with 6 month follow-up) consisting of a multi-component exercise program involving resistance (strength) and power training, balance and mobility activities (60 minutes, 3 times per week for 12 months) combined with osteoporosis education sessions. These interactive education sessions (~60 minutes) will be held every 3 months (4 sessions over 12 months) at a local community/recreation centre and will include information (presentation and handout material) related to: risk factors for osteoporosis; best practice exercise and nutrition guidelines; understanding bone density results; strategies to reduce the risk of falling; communicating clearly with your doctor, and medications for the treatment of osteoporosis. All participants will receive daily calcium (700 mg) and vitamin D (1200 IU) supplements.  Follow-up testing will be conducted 6 months after the intervention to assess any residual benefits.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care self-management control group that will receive osteoporosis information (handouts) in the mail every 4 months for 12 months. Participants assigned to this group will receive general information relevant to osteoporosis (eg. Osteoporosis Australia fact sheets related to osteoporosis and risk factors, healthful nutrition recommendations, exercise for osteoporosis and falls prevention, medications and treatments for osteoporosis). The aim is to encourage participants to actively take charge of their health in seeking out appropriate medical information and services to prevent osteoporosis, falls and fractures. All participants will receive the same daily calcium (700 mg) and vitamin D (1200 IU) supplements as the intervention group</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoporosis and low trauma fractures currently affect 2.2 million Australians, which is projected to rise to three million people by 2021, with a fracture occurring every 3Â½ minutes. Currently the medical paradigm of cure for osteoporosis is less than ideal because the limited pharmacological agents available are directed to those who already have the disease or are at increased risk. A more effective approach to reduce the burden of this disease is prevention at the population level. That is, defining models that are efficacious, safe, and can be implemented to a large cross-section of the community. Exercise fulfils most of these criteria, with the added advantage of having beneficial effects on multiple health outcomes. The aim of this 18 month RCT is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a community-based exercise (high velocity resistance and weight-bearing exercise) and osteoporosis education/awareness program for optimising musculoskeletal health and function and general well-being in older Australians at increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.</summary>
