  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at 1mA and  2mA intensity. This will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20 minutes using a neuroConn GBH/Eldith DC Stimulator. tDCS will be delivered during three sessions (1mA tDCS, 2mA tDCS, and sham tDCS) that will be at least 48 hours apart</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This will involve placing the electrodes in the same position as for active tDCS, however stimulation will be ceased after 30 seconds (so as to generate the same initial sensation and ensure blinding is maintained).</comparator>

Participants with schizophrenia will be included if they: 
- are voluntary and competent to consent
- have a diagnosis of Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder as confirmed by the Structure Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) -IV (SCID-IV)

Healthy individuals will be included if they:
- have capacity to consent

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients with schizophrenia will be excluded if they:
- have a a DSM-IV history of substance abuse or dependence in the last 6 months
- have a concomitant major and/or unstable medical or neurologic illness
- are currently taking carbamazepine
- are currently pregnant or lactating
- have metal anywhere in the head, except the mouth (this includes metallic objects such as screws and clips from surgical procedures)

Healthy participants will be excluded if they:
- have an unstable medical condition, neurological disorder or are currently pregnant or lactating 
- have metal in the cranium, a pacemaker, cochlear implant medication pump or other electronic device</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>This is a double-blind study. Neither the participant nor the researcher conducting the sessions will know what type of stimulation the participant is receiving during each session. . The stimulation condition will be counterbalanced across participants.  A spreadsheet containing the six digit stimulation codes for each session randomised across conditions and participants is prepared by the chief investigator prior to recruitment commencing.  Following the screening process and once the participant is enrolled in the study randomization takes place. At this time the Chief Investigator, who will be unblinded, will from this spreadsheet provide a unique six digit code to be entered into the tDCS stimulator, which will determine the stimulation condition and settings, thus allowing the second researcher to remain blinded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Working memory is essential for key cognitive processes including reasoning, language comprehension and learning. Many neurological and psychiatric disorders result in working memory impairments and any technique that may enhance working memory would be very useful. For example cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia. The main areas affected include attention, memory and executive functioning; with working memory in particular frequently affected. These difficulties have been shown to negatively influence patients psychosocial functioning. Traditional treatment approaches have resulted in small gains at best. It is therefore essential that novel treatment approaches are explored.  Recent research has suggested that brain stimulation, and in particular transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), may have a role to play in improving cognition.  While tDCS has been shown to improve working memory in a number of conditions, to date there have been no tDCS studies looking at the enhancement of working memory in schizophrenia.
tDCS has been shown to be safe, with very few side effects. It involves the application of a very weak electrical current (1-2mA) using two surface electrodes (anode and cathode) to the head. The use of tDCS on the cortex has been shown to alter the how likely nerve cells are to fire and the effect generally has been shown to last up to 1 hour after stimulation.   To date, a number of studies have examined the effect of tDCS on working memory, with some mixed results. While some studies have shown improvements in working memory during a session of tDCS (Boggio et al., 2006), other recent research has found no significant improvement (Marshall et al., 2005). A recent study has shown significantly better performance in a working memory task completed during an application of tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a part of the brain associated with this type of thinking activity (Fregni et al., 2005).  However, despite the breadth of tDCS research being undertaken, many questions remain regarding the most effective stimulation parameters, particularly with respect to optimal current strength (i.e. 1 or 2 mA).
The current study aims investigate this in healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia.</summary>
