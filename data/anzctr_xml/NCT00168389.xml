  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Improvement of =15 Letters From Baseline in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly indicates improvement and a decrease in the number of letters read correctly indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 39/Final Visit</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average Change From Baseline in BCVA in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The average BCVA is calculated across study visits for each patient. A positive number change from baseline indicates an improvement and a negative number change from baseline indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 39 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in BCVA in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a BCVA Improvement of =10 Letters From Baseline in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly indicates improvement and a decrease in the number of letters read correctly indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 39/Final Visit</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average Change From Baseline in Retinal Thickness as Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) - OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system that provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina from which retinal thickness can be measured. The average OCT retinal thickness is calculated across study visits for each patient. A negative number change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive number change from baseline indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 39 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>10th Percentile for Time to BCVA Improvement of =15 Letters From Baseline in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). Shorter durations of time to improvement are best. The 10th percentile represents the first 10% of patients to reach a BCVA improvement of =15 letters from baseline in the study eye.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 39 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With BCVA Improvement of =15 Letters From Baseline in the Study Eye at 3-month Intervals - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly indicates improvement and a decrease in the number of letters read correctly indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15, Month 18, Month 21, Month 24, Month 27, Month 30, Month 33, Month 36, Month 39/Final Visit</timepoint>
