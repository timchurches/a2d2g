    <inclusivecriteria>Patients of either sex will be included, if they:

          1. Present (prospective cohort) or presented (retrospective cohort) for primary shoulder
             surface replacement or arthroplasty with any of the following diagnoses:

               1. Osteoarthritis

             visit.

          3. Subject is able to or capable of providing consent to participate in the clinical
             investigation.

          4. Subject agrees to comply with this protocol, including participating in required
             follow-up visits at the investigations site and completing study questionnaires.

          5. Subject is at least 21 years of age and skeletally mature at the time of surgery.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients will be excluded from participation if they:

             component.

          2. Has/had insufficient bone quality as determined by intra- operative evaluation.

          3. Has/had arthritis with defective rotator cuff.

          4. Has/had had a failed rotator cuff surgery.

          5. Has/had loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the
             affected limb rendering the procedure unjustified.

          6. Has/had evidence of active infection.

          7. Present/presented with a condition of neuromuscular compromise of the shoulder (e.g.,
             neuropathic joints or brachioplexus injury with a flail shoulder joint).

         11. Has/had other conditions such as central nervous system disturbances, alcohol or drug
             addiction, etc. that may make effective evaluation of the joint replacement difficult
             or impossible.

         12. Has/had known, active metastatic or neoplastic disease.

         13. Are/were taking &gt; 10mg/day corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) excluding inhalers,
