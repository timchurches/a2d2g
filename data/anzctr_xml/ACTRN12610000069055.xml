    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Parents with infants attending clinic for routine 2 month immunisation are invited to participate-information given-eligibility checked - consent obtained for eligible infants. 
Allocation: cpmputer based randomisation sequence developed prior to commencement of study by statistician. This produced a random sequence of intervention allocations linked with study idenficiation numbers running from 1-120. The study pharmacist prepared either 2mls of 25% glucose or sterile water in needle-less syringes according to the allocation sequence. As the solutions are both colourless and odourless and differences in viscosity are not apparent, the allocation sequence was blinded. Solution syringes were labelled with the study number only and were placed in a sequentially numbered envelope in the clinic. Infants received either solution according to the next sequentially numbered envelope with the number recorded in the study data file and the infant medical record. Treatment allocation remained unknown until all phases of data collection were completed, and data was entered into an SPSS file for analysis and analysis was completed. The final step in the analysis process required the statistician to reveal the allocation sequence</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence was prepared by Professor Madeleine King (study statistician) then emailed by her directly to Mohammad Graibeth (study Pharmacist in Alshif Irbid City Jordan).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study focuses on the pain  experienced by 2 month old infants when receiving their routine immunisations. We are testing whether a small amount of glucose solution administered onto the infant's tongue just prior to receiving the immunisation injection is able to decrease the amount of pain the infant experiences. We will compare the pain responses of infants receiving the glucose solution with those receiving water just prior to their immunisation injection.</summary>
