  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this trial Australian young adults (18-24) with symptoms of anxiety and depression will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. 

The two groups are:
Group 1: Self-guided - treatment. Participants in this group will complete the treatment in a self-guided format, that is, without support from a therapist.
Group 2: Guided - treatment. Participants in this group will complete the treatment in a guided format, that is, with weekly telephone or email support from a therapist.

Over the 5 weeks, all participants will be directed to read 4 online lessons about management of symptoms. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to read. Participants will also have access to summaries and homework assignments for each lesson, and will read stories about people with similar symptoms, taking a further 20 minutes per week.

Participants in all groups will also receive automatic emails providing reminders about the course and encouragement to continue.

Study questionnaires will be administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3 and 12 post-treatment. These will take about 10-15 minutes to complete. Participants will also complete brief measures of mood, anxiety and adaptive coping techniques before each lesson. The treatment materials include cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) skills.</interventions>
    <comparator>This 2 group (self-guided vs. guided) RCT does not have a formal control group, as it compares active treatments. However, data from historical controls will be obtained and compared from similar studies conducted by this research team over the period 2007-2012. These studies include:

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is part of a research program funded by beyondblue to develop and evaluate Internet based  treatment programs for young adults (18-24) with anxiety and depression. This project examines the relative efficacy of guided and self-guided internet delivered treatment.

We expect that the guided interventions will result in superior outcomes to the unguided interventions.</summary>
