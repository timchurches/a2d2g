  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of 0.5 mg dofetilide capsule on one occasion and the innovator formulation of 0.5 mg dofetilide capsule on one occasion with each dose separated by a one week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test tablet formulation.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for water consumed with the dose). 
Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours prior to receiving breakfast. Subjects will be provided with a standardised high fat breakfast which they must start eating 30 minutes prior to dosing. Subjects are required to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance and will be monitored for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing.

Each dose ( 1 x. 0.5 mg) will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Single dose, crossover study whereby each participant receives the test formulation (1 x 0.5 mg) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of dofetilide (1 x 0.5 mg) on one occasion with each dose separated by a one week washout period. The comparator/control for this trial is the innovator capsule formulation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of dofetilide (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the formulation. All plasma samples will be assayed for dofetilide using a fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines.</outcome>

</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) will be determined by plasma sample analysis. Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points.

    <concealment>All formulations will be labelled as Formulation A and B. The identification of each treatment will only be known to the Managing Director and the Section Head - Trails and Regulatory Affairs.

    <sequence>Each participant will be given a 3 digit screening number and a 2 digit subject number. The screening number will be issued once the participant has given written consent to participate in the study and the two digit subject number (randomisation number) after acceptance into the study. Sequence generation will be by using a simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation)
