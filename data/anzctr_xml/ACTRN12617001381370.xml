    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for this study was estimated to meet each of the following criteria:
1. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval of the geometric ratios for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax of DHE between INP104 and the reference product, DHE for Intravenous Injection is less than or equal to 125%, and
2. The lower bound of the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratios for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax of DHE between INP104 and the reference product, Migranal Nasal Spray is greater than or equal to 80%.
Assuming a highest possible intra-subject variability of 60 % (CV), a geometric mean ratio of INP104 to DHE for Injection IV of 80% and a geometric mean ratio of INP104 to Migranal Nasal Spray of 120%, a sample size of 30  subjects is deemed sufficient to achieve a power greater than 80% for the aforementioned criteria. Final study sample size was set at 36 subjects to ensure at least 30 subjects complete all three treatments.

All randomized subjects who receive any amount of any investigational product (Safety Population) will be included in the safety analyses. 

All randomized subjects who receive all scheduled doses of IP and who provide a sufficient number of blood samples for non-compartmental analysis will be included in the PK analysis for each dosing (PK Analysis Population). Data will be summarized by administration method.

Safety and Tolerability:
Continuous safety data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum) by administration method. Categorical safety data will be summarized with frequency counts and percentages by administration method.
The number of subjects experiencing treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) and number of individual TEAEs will be summarized by administration method, system organ class and preferred term. TEAEs will also be summarized by worst severity and by relationship to investigational product. 

Laboratory evaluations, vital signs assessments and ECG parameters will be summarized by administration method and protocol-specified collection time point. A summary of change-from-baseline at each protocol-specified time point by administration method will also be presented.

Changes in physical examinations will be listed for each subject and described in the text of the final report.

Prior and concomitant medications will be listed by subject and coded using the most current World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary.

Medical history will be listed by subject.

Scores from the subject product acceptability questionnaire will be summarized as appropriate.

Pharmacokinetics:
Descriptive Statistics
Individual DHE and 8-OH-DHE concentration data will be listed and summarized by administration method with descriptive statistics (sample size [N], arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, maximum and geometric mean). Individual and mean DHE and 8-OH-DHE concentration-time profiles for each administration method will also be presented graphically.
Plasma DHE and 8-OH-DHE non-compartmental analysis (NCA) PK parameters for time of the maximum plasma drug concentration (Tmax), maximum observed drug plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC) from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration 
(AUC0-t), terminal elimination rate constant (kel), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf), elimination half-life (t1/2), total apparent body clearance (CL/F; CL for IV administration) and apparent volume of distribution at the terminal phase (Vz/F; Vz for IV administration) (where data are sufficient for parameter determination) will be estimated.  All subjects who have completed at least one treatment and have sufficient PK samples collected to generate PK parameters will be included in the descriptive statistics analyses.
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be listed for each individual and summarized by administration method using descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of variation [CV%], median, minimum, maximum and geometric mean).  Geometric mean will be calculated for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax.

Statistical Analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with effects for sequence, subject nested within sequence, period, and treatment will be performed on the ln-transformed DHE and 8-OH-DHE AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.  Each ANOVA will include calculation of least squares mean (LSM), the difference between treatment LSM, and the standard error associated with the difference.  Only subjects who have sufficient PK sample collection to generate the key PK parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax) for each administration method will be included in the ANOVA analysis.
Ratios of geometric means will be calculated using the exponentiation of the difference between treatment LSM from the analyses on the ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax. These ratios will be expressed as a percentage relative to the reference treatment (INP104 [test]/ DHE for IV injection (either D.H.E. 45 [reference] or Perrigo Pharmaceuticals  [reference]) and INP104 [test]/ Migranal Nasal Spray [reference]).  Consistent with the two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, 90% confidence intervals will be obtained for the ratio of geometric means for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Phase I clinical trial will compare the bioavailability of dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE) following  a single dose administration of INP104 (DHE administered by I123 Precision Olfactory Delivery (POD TM) Device nasal spray to that of D.H.E. 45 for Injection (intravenous [IV]) and Migranal nasal spray in healthy adult subjects. 
It is hypothesized that INP104 will address the current variability in nasal administration and give more reproducible dose delivery compared to Migranal nasal spray.
Blood concentrations of all three investigational products will be compared for 48 hours following dosing. The safety and tolerability of INP104 will be monitored throughout the study. 
INP104 has been developed for the treatment of acute migraine headache. The device in which the drug will be delivered has been designed to deliver the medication to the upper nasal cavity with minimal variation in dose absorption, eg loss via dripping out of the nose or the dose being swallowed.
Approximately 36 participants in general good health (equal ratio of males and females desired) will be enrolled and will be allocated to receive 3 treatments in a randomised sequence.   They will receive a single dose of INP104 via the POD device, a single dose of DHE via intravenous injection, and a single dose of Migranal Nasal Spray. There will be a wash out period where no treatment will be administered for at least 7 days in between each treatment. Participants are required to attend 3 inpatient periods and 1 final outpatient visit. Each participant will be in the study for up to 43 days.</summary>
