  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 grams of n-3 PUFA rich fish oil taken in capsules on each day of pregnancy and for 3 months during the breastfeeding period. Note that if the mother chooses to stop breastfeeding then supplementation will stop early, this will be at birth if the mother decides not to breastfeed at all. Compliance will be assessed by return of unused capsules, and secondarily by measurement of n-3 PUFA levels in maternal red blood cells. Note that the expected concentration of n-3 PUFAs in this oil is 33% EPA/22% DHA, but this will be independently verified.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In New Zealand the majority of men (71%) and women (60%) are now overweight or obese. Obesity leads to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers, which are among the worlds greatest health problems. Within NZ, Maori, Pasifika and those who are poorer are more greatly affected.

Most women of reproductive age are also overweight or obese (60%). This is important as the offspring of women who are obese have alterations in the way their metabolism works that increase the chance that they will be a large baby, become overweight and eventually develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease. When these babies are born, they are already at a health disadvantage. The underlying problem is that insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar works less well in their bodies. 

I have shown in rats, that supplementing obese mothers with fish oil can prevent the offspring from developing problems with insulin action as they age. If this treatment had the same effect in humans, pregnant women could use it to reduce their unborn childs lifetime risk of disease. This is a treatment that is already easily available in stores, so that it would be easy for women to take up.

We will enrol women into a clinical trial where they are randomised to take either fish oil, or a placebo (capsules with ordinary olive oil) on every day of pregnancy and the first 3 months of breastfeeding. When the baby is born we will measure its body fat using a special scan (at two weeks of age). We will reassess the baby again at 3 months and 12 months of age. We will keep in contact over time, and when the child is 4-7 years old we will perform a detailed assessment of the childs metabolism, including assessing insulin action.
