  <interventions>
    <interventions>ACIST Medical Systems Monorail Pressure Sensor (MPS) Catheter.  Using standard inverventional catheter placement techniques, MPS catheter's pressure sensor is placed just distal to a vessel stenosis and measures the distal blood pressure. In combination with the aortic pressure measured from the hospital's hemodynamic monitor, the MPS system's console displays the aortic and distal blood pressures and calculates fractional flow reserve (FFR).

In a single procedure expected to last under an hour, both the MPS and the Radi PressureWire are introduced into the vessel and measurements are made from both systems, using a nonrandomized crossover trial design, as close together in time as possible.

The MPS system differs from the Radi PressureWire in that it is mounted on a Monorail catheter.</interventions>
    <comparator>Radi PressureWire.  Using standard inverventional catheter placement techniques, Radi pressure wire is placed just distal to a vessel stenosis and measures the distal blood pressure.
