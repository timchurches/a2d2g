    <interventions>Design: The patients with CTO by computed tomography angiography (CCTA ) are randomly divided into 2 groups. The group 1 consists of patients who are examined by CCTA and our dedicated mobile work station. The station has the capability of reconstruction of acquired CT image and manipulate the images so as to allow the interventional cardiologist better interpret findings. The following indices are calculated: the length of the occlusion, the degree of the calcification and the characteristics of the occlusion. The most important step is to puncture the occluded artery with various guide wire. Always keep the wire at the center of the occlude artery. The procedure usually takes 2 hours. The patients can be discharged within 7 days. The follow-up is routine but not mandatory.</interventions>
    <comparator>The group 2 consists of patients who are examined by CCTA only. The operators know the basic knowledge of CCTA but have no idea how to operate the mobile work station. They use conventional method to recanalize the occluded artery. The group 3 consists of patients who are diagnosed by CAG as CTO. They usThe procedure usually takes 2 hours.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an interventional study. The study is investigating the possibility of using a mobile CT work station technique to increase the CTO recanalization rate. Conventional CAG is used as a control. Visual estimate by CCTA is used as a second control. We hypothesize that the mobile CT work station might improve the recanalization rate.</summary>
