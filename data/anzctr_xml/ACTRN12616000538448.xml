    <interventions>Goal-directed Therapy/Experimental Group 

Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy in the Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) group (experimental group) will have a Flotrac/Vigileo device TradeMark connected after insertion of the arterial line. The arterial catheters will be connected to the cardiac output device transducer system and haemodynamic data from the Flotrac device will be collected throughout surgery. All transducers will be zeroed to atmospheric pressure at the level of the right atrium.

Patients in the GDT group will be managed by a Stroke Ventricular Volume (SVV) guided protocol to maintain SVV &lt; 20%. This percentage of SVV is frequently used in our institution as a target for patients undergoing this procedure. For the GDT group, if SVV remains above 20% for at least 2 min, then a 250mL bolus of balanced crystalloid (Hartmanns solution or Plasmalyte) or colloid fluid (Albumen) will be given. The SVV will be assessed every 20 seconds via the FloTrac/Vigileo proprietary algorithm. Similar to other GDT studies, the preferred colloid will be albumin secondary to the known effects of improved intravascular repletion and intravascular half life and the theoretical benefit of prolonged stroke volume optimization. In both groups, the administration of blood products will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, as clinically indicated. There will be no standard protocol for fluid maintenance infusion for either group.

The GDT group will receive standard perioperative Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care and additional haemodynamic monitoring using the FloTrac/Vigileo TradeMark (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). 

The anaesthetist will have no influence over any aspect of postoperative care management. All clinicians and nursing staff in charge of postoperative care will be blinded to the allocation of patients. The Flotrac system will be connected to the patient prior to surgical incision and discontinued as soon as the surgery is complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group

Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy in the control group will have a Flotrac/Vigileo device TradeMark connected after insertion of the arterial line. The arterial catheters will be connected to the cardiac output device transducer system and haemodynamic data from the Flotrac device will be collected throughout surgery. All transducers will be zeroed to atmospheric pressure at the level of the right atrium.

Control patients will have fluid management and inotropic use guided by the routine cardiovascular monitoring in place i.e. arterial line, and central venous catheter, which will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, who will be blinded to Flotrac data. The Control group
anaesthetist will be allowed to have the Flotrac haemodynamic data unblinded if needed for
clinical decision making but patients will be removed from analysis if this occurs.

In both groups, the administration of blood products will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, as clinically indicated. There will be no standard protocol for fluid maintenance infusion for either group.

The control group will receive standard perioperative Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care alone. 

The anaesthetist will have no influence over any aspect of postoperative care management. All clinicians and nursing staff in charge of postoperative care will be blinded to the allocation of patients. The Flotrac system will be connected to the patient prior to surgical incision and discontinued as soon as the surgery is complete.</comparator>

    <concealment>All adult patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy will be evaluated preoperatively at the anaesthesia pre-admsissions clinic at least 1-2 weeks prior to surgery. Patients will be identified for study entry by the investigators or an anaesthetist or research co-ordinator acting on behalf of the principal investigators by surveillance of patients in the pre-admissions clinic.

Patients will be identified from their preoperative medical records and surgical notes.

A thorough assessment of the participant’s competence and capacity to make a valid informed decision will be made by the study investigators prior to the patient being recruited. All patients were deemed competent if they:
1. are able to comprehend and retain information relevant to making the decision 
2. understand the information and implications of the decision
3. able to weigh the information in the balance and arrive at a decision 

For each patient, an opaque envelope containing a participant number was prepared, sealed and sequentially numbered. On the morning of surgery the anaesthetist opened the envelope and randomised the participant.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>We powered this Trial to observe a large treatment effect (Cohens d = 0.8). In order to observe such effect 52 patients in total (26 per group) would provide a power of 0.8, assuming the type 1 error threshold of 0.05.  This is a larger sample size compared to realistic power calculations used in other studies evaluating the use of GDT in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Canessons group in the US detected a 3-day mean length of stay difference between the two groups, with a standard deviation of 3 days in each group, a two tailed alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80, and calculated that a minimum of 17 subjects were required in each group. They assumed that a similar sample size would be needed to detect a similar difference in time to return of GI function. Based on pilot data from our institution, the expected LOS in the control group was 16 days (SD=4 days). Effects size d =0.8 would correspond to the difference of 3.2 days (similar to Canesson et al), thus the expected LOS in intervention group would be 12.8 days. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate if patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipples procedure) managed by intraoperative goal directed therapy with the Flotrac/Vigileo deviceTM will have a shorter length of hospital stay with fewer post-operative complications compared to patients managed by standard care. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and are scheduled to undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). 

Study details: Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will have their haemodynamic variables (fluid dynamic and blood flow) managed by intraoperative goal directed therapy (GDT) using the Flotrac/Vigileo deviceTM (FloTrac/Vigileo Version 3.02, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). This minimally invasive device automatically calculates key flow parameters every 20 seconds and recognizes and allows for adjustments in haemodynamic variables in patients undergoing major surgery. Importantly, it enables the anaesthetist to make a differential diagnosis leading to either a volume or cardiovascular intervention (preload, afterload and contractility), by providing continuous information on the patients cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance. Participants allocated to the control group will have fluid management and inotropic use guided by the routine cardiovascular monitoring in place i.e. arterial line, and central venous catheter, which will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, who will be blinded to Flotrac data. The Control group anaesthetist will be allowed to have the Flotrac haemodynamic data unblinded if needed for clinical decision making but patients will be removed from analysis if this occurs. There is now compelling evidence that fluid optimization and GDT in patients undergoing colorectal surgery leads to better outcomes, particularly in high risk patients.

This study will contribute to understanding if similar benefit of GDT is also observed in patients undergoing major pancreatic surgery - pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipples Procedure).
