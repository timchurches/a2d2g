    <interventions>CARTO-SOUND 3D map development and guidance

An atrial fibrillation ablation procedure requires virtual 3D catheter guidance to increase procedure efficacy and decrease X-ray time compared to using fluoroscopic (ie. X-ray) guidance alone.

CARTOSOUND is a new mapping technology which allows a virtual navigational geometry to be created with an intra-cardiac ultra-sound catheter (ie SOUNDSTAR catheter) integrated into the standard 3D CARTOSOUND mapping platform. 

The SOUNDSTAR catheter can be used to create the 3D map, which is used to guide and record ablation throughout the remaining procedure. Intra-cardiac ultrasound images from the SOUNDSTAR catheter can also be utilized to confirm catheter location in the heart, without X-ray verification.

This trial is relevant to a single AF ablation procedure with an approximate duration of 3.5 hours.</interventions>

An atrial fibrillation ablation procedure requires virtual 3D catheter guidance to increase procedure efficacy and decrease X-ray time compared to using fluoroscopic (ie. X-ray) guidance alone.


Electro-anatomical mapping (EAM) is the current technology used to develop 3D navigational maps of the heart. EAM requires a catheter to be navigated to various locations in the heart, with assistance of fluoroscopy, to detail a point-by-point 3D shell of the heart chamber of interest. 

Once created, this shell is used to guide and record ablation throughout the remaining case.

This trial is relevant to a single AF ablation procedure with an approximate duration of 3.5 hours.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the last decade, catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF) have increased dramatically and this therapy is now a well entrenched treatment option for drug-refractory AF. The technology associated with mapping the atrial anatomy and localization of catheters within the heart has concurrently evolved to meet the demands of pulmonary vein isolation procedures for paroxysmal AF and a variety of adjunctive substrate ablation approaches for non-paroxysmal AF. 

Navigation technologies aim to improve clinical outcome, increase safety, reduce procedure times and reduce X-ray exposure for AF ablation procedures. Compared to fluoroscopy led ablation, early randomized trials reported shorter procedure times and reduced X-ray for adjunctive virtual 3D mapping. Non-randomized trials/registries have suggested that adding CT/MRI merge capabilities to 3D mapping provides incremental benefit over 3D mapping alone; however, randomized trials have proven that the addition of CT/MRI merge capabilities to 3D mapping systems may be associated with negligible impact on clinical results and/or X-ray use. Furthermore, randomized evidence for new radiographic mapping technologies (3D rotational angiography) and early data on robotic sheath navigation also result in equivalence compared to standard 3D guided procedures. 

Prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) for guiding ablation at the pulmonary vein ostia, within the cavotricuspid isthmus and for detection of left atrial thrombus and assessment of left atrial appendage mechanical function.  In addition, one recent case series has reported flouro-less AF ablation procedures with ICE as an adjunct to 3D mapping.   
CARTOSOUND integrates ICE into a 3D mapping system, such that the CARTO system can visualize the location and orientation of a specialized ICE catheter to enable the construction of a 3D geometry from a series of 2D ultrasound slices. CARTOSOUND has been validated in an animal model, tested in several clinical patient series and its unique utility is described in case reports. However, there have been no studies that have assessed the impact of CARTOSOUND mapping/navigation on AF ablation outcomes as compared to conventional EAM. 

We sought to compare clinical parameters and mapping accuracy between CARTOSOUND and EAM mapping/navigation for AF ablation procedures via a randomized controlled trial.</summary>
