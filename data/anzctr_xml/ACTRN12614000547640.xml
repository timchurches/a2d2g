    <interventions>The PAXonline Program for Panic Disorder is an internet-based treatment of twelve weeks, which consists of cognitive-behavioral therapy modules, delivered with or without assistance from a therapist .

The Panic Disorder Program contains 16 modules which address important cognitive behavioral psychotherapy elements such as: psychoeducation on the disorder and means of intervention (Module 1. Understand whats happening to you and Module 2. Understand what you have to do), techniques for decreasing neurophysiologic hyper-activation (module for breathing regulation, autogenic training relaxation, physical exercise), techniques for cognitive restructuring (attention modification and conscious and unconscious dysfunctional beliefs modification), exposure techniques (interoceptive and exteroceptive), skills training (problem solving) and positive emotions training (positive psychology), behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring of possible comorbid depression symptoms and relapse prevention.

Each module can be completed in 30-40 minutes and the participants are provided with a recommended timetable (one or two modules per week, depending on the complexity of the content and the homework assignments).

In this trial Romanian adults with Panic disorder will be randomly allocated to one of three groups:
Group 1: Guided panic disorder program. Participants in this group will complete the panic disorder treatment program with support from a therapist (weekly emails and regular 15 minutes Skype sessions; in total, there will be 9 Skype sessions).
Group 2: Self-guided panic disorder program. Participants in this group will complete the treatment program in a self-guided format, that is, without support from a therapist.
Group 3: Wait-list control group.


The modules and the entire therapeutic environment is carefully designed in order to catalyze the psychotherapeutic process in the mind of the patients. 

The program contains also certain techniques to improve adherence and compliance with the treatment e.g. rewards after module completion (short movies that induce positive emotions), The daily thought, which is sent through e-mail every other 5 days etc. 

The participants adherence is carefully monitored through several applications that register: overall usage time, the modules completed and the time spent on each module and each module component. There is also an application, the participants use to report the completion of homework assignments for each module.

    <concealment>The first step consists in completing 3 online questionnaires. The first addresses the exclusion criteria, the second identify the panic disorder diagnostic and severity, and the third evaluates other possible comorbidities.

The second step consists in a semi-structured clinical interview conducted through Skype or telephone by a specialist.

If the subject meets all the eligibility criteria, he signs the informed consent document and he is randomly allocated to one of the three groups.

The allocation concealment is performed through the central randomization by a computer. The person in charge with the allocation of subjects to treatment groups is unaware to which group a new subject will be allocated. This person has access only to the data needed to fill out in the computer program the stratification factors used in the process of randomization. The program then automatically allocates the subject to a treatment group by use of an adaptive randomization algorithm. The result or the algorithm can not be influenced by this person.</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation to intervention is randomized control trial. The method employed is minimization, based on the dynamic algorithm put forward by Pocock &amp; Simon (1975), using two stratification factors: SEVERITY (3 levels) and CHRONICITY (2 levels) of Panic disorder. The severity factor is based on the score obtained at the pre-treatment PDSS-SR measurement. The chronicity factor is measured in the pre-treatment structured clinical interview as the number of months passed since the Panic Disorder has started.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size needed to achieve study objectives has been computed using GPower targeting Manova: Repeated measures, within-between interactions and t-tests for independent and dependent means, expecting a large effect size, a power size of .90 and setting alpha at .05. The recommended sample size has been increased to accommodate an attrition rate of 20%. Thus, the study aims to achieve a sample of 120 participants.

We will measure and test if symptoms significantly improve, both statistically and clinically.

The primary analyses to be made will be intention to treat, but there will be also additional analysis just for the treatment completers.

Missing data for ITT approaches can be managed in a number of ways, but we intend to use the more advanced methods which include the use of multiple imputation and maximum-likelihood based methods.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main objective of this study is to test the efficacy of PAXonline, an internet based cognitive-behavioral therapy program, in the treatment of Panic Disorder. Other important aims are identifying the mechanisms of change and patient characteristics for whom this type of therapy is most suited and has the best results.

Two treatment groups will be used, one with therapist guidance and one without, as well as a wait-list control group. 

We expect that the guided intervention program will result in superior outcomes to the unguided intervention program. Both treatment groups are presumed to be superior to the wait-list control.</summary>
