  <interventions>
    <interventions>Identify specific dermoscopic features of biopsy proven Actinic Keratosis and Bowen's Disease before and after treatment with Imiquimod cream or Photodynamic therapy or cryotherapy in order to specify the presence or not of residual disease. Actinic keratosis will be treated either with 1 freeze thaw cycle of cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen OR2 sessions of methylaminolevulinate PDT (MAL-PDT, Metvix PDT), one week apart,or imiquimod cream applied 3 days/week for 12 weeks.Bowens disease will be treated with 2 freeze-thaw cycles of cryotherapy or 2 sessions of MAL-PDT, one week apart or imiquimod 5% cream applied 5 days/week for 12 week. Dermoscopic evaluation will be performed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks after last treatment intervention. Participants will be observed in total for their treatment period and for 12 weeks after their last treatment intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Not applicable, because the primary outcome of this trial is the evaluation of dermoscopy as diagnosting tool for the identfication of residual disease after application of non-surgical treatments (i.e cryotherapy, PDT, or imiquimod cream) for in-situ squamous cell carcinomas. The effectiveness of these treatments is not evaluated in this trial. In that sense we do not need a control group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome is to identify whether certain dermoscopic criteria can predict the presence or absense of residual disease after non surgical treatment  (imiquimod cream , phodynamic treatment or cryotherapy) of in situ squamous cell carcinomas (actinic keratosis and Bowen's disease) with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.
At baseline each lesion (actinic keratosis or Bowen's disease) will be examined with a Dermlite (3 GEN) handheld dermatoscope and clinical and dermoscopic pictures will be taken with an attached photo camera. All dermoscopic findings will be recorded. A biopsy of the lesion will be performed at the time to confirm diagnosis.
A month after the initiation of treatment for each lesion clinical and dermoscopic evaluations will be performed and clinical and dermoscopic poctures will be taken.
Three months after the initiation of treatment all lesions will be clinically and demoscopically assessed and pictures will be taken.  The dermoscopic findings of each timepoint will be compared and evaluated by 2 indipendent dermoscopists. A final biopsy at this timepoint will confirm the presenseor not of residual disease and the histopathological findings will be compared with the dermoscopic ones.</outcome>
      <timepoint>DERMOSCOPIC EVLUATION at baseline and 1and 3 months after the last treatment session of each treatment modality all lesions will be clinically and dermoscopically reevaluated and changes will be photographically documented. </timepoint>
