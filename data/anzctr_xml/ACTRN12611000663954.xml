  <interventions>
    <interventions>100 eyes of 80 consecutive cataract patients were included in this study. All participants were diagnosed with cataract which required extraction which was performed by one of two surgeons. Routine surgical protocols for cataract extraction were observed. Participants were examined prior to surgery and both best corrected visual acuity and 'Optical Coherence Tomography' (OCT) was performed pre-operatively, 1 week post-operatively and 4 weeks post operatively. OCT is a non-invasive, in vivo cross-sectional imaging of the retina.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>OCT was performed within 1 month pre-operatively in addition to 1 week, 4 weeks and 6 months post-operatively. OCT was acquired using the fast macular thickness scan protocol of the Time-Domain Stratus OCT (Carl Zeiss Pty Ltd) to obtain six consecutive macular scans centred on the fovea. The Retinal Thickness Tabular Output Report was used to generate mean CFT in the circle at 1mm diameter (central fovea), 3mm (inner macular) and 6mm (outer macula)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Post-operative cystoid macular oedema (CMO) is a complication of uneventful cataract surgery. While improved surgical techniques have decreased the incidence of CMO, it remains a cause of unfavourable visual outcome following surgery. Fundus fluorescein angiography has been the gold standard for diagnosing sub-clinical CMO, however non-invasive cross-sectional imaging of the retina with optical coherence tomography (OCT) may be equally effective at detecting the condition and offers the ability to quantify and repeat results over time.
Design: Prospective pre-post case series of patients undergoing routine phacoemulsification surgery.
Participants: Eighty consecutive patients (100 eyes) with cataracts and an age range of 40 to 90 years (M 76.18).
Methods: Macular thickness of participants was determined using time-domain OCT pre-operatively and after surgery at 1 day, 1 week, 4 weeks and 6 months. OCT was used to diagnose post-operative CMO. 
Main outcome measures: Presence of cysts at the macula, identified by OCT, in addition to foveal and macular thickness (Âµm).
Results: CMO was present in 5% of eyes. Macular thickness increased after surgery and central foveal thickness (CFT) increased by almost 7% but returned to pre-operative levels after 6 months. Findings also indicate that patients who developed post-operative CMO had significantly thicker CFT of approximately 5% compared with those that did not.
Conclusions: OCT is a useful, non-invasive diagnostic tool in determining sub-clinical
CMO in uncomplicated cataract surgery patients and detects the presence of retinal thickening and intra-retinal cysts very soon after surgery, thereby facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment of post-operative CMO.</summary>
