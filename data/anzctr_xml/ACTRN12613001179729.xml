    <interventions>EXERCISE INTERVENTION
The physical exercise intervention program will include 6 months of resistance (i.e. lifting weights) and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) undertaken 3 times per week in an exercise clinic. Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be conducted in small groups under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist.

EXERCISE + PSYCHOSEXUAL INTERVENTION
This intervention program will involve the same exercise intervention as described above as well as a brief psychosexual self-management intervention that addresses psychological and sexual well-being. Participants will attend a single, 60 minute, one-on-one psycho-educational session with their exercise physiologist and receive a self-management kit. Specifically, the education session addresses: stress management; problem solving coping for treatment challenges; and goal setting for sexual rehabilitation. This session will occur during the week prior to initiating the exercise program. The self-management kit includes: a published self-help book for men with prostate cancer and their partners; study specific tip sheets about treatments for erectile dysfunction and goal setting for sexual rehabilitation; a progress journal-diary; and audio resources for stress management.</interventions>
    <comparator>USUAL CARE, DELAYED INTERVENTION GROUP:
The control group will maintain usual care for 6 months and then will receive the interventions (half to receive the Exercise Intervention and half the Exercise + Psychosexual Intervention). Usual care may involve no intervention/medication for sexual dysfunction but standard medical care of erectile dysfunction may include the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor drugs (e.g. viagra), vacuum constriction devices, penile injections with intracavernosal vasodialators, and/or penile implant surgery at the discretion of the patient.</comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Data from our previous study in prostate cancer patients indicates that the standard deviation for change in our primary outcome of sexual health equates to ~22 points. We observed the mean change after the intervention to differ between exercise and usual care groups by ~11 points. There is no available evidence comparing changes in sexual health between exercise and psychosexual interventions. However, data from previous psychosexual interventions in prostate cancer patients indicates changes of a moderate standardised effect (d = 0.5) in sexual health following the psycho-educational interventions. We have based sample size calculations on the assumption that there will be an additive effect of exercise and psychosexual therapies. A priori, 64 participants per group will be required to achieve 80% power at an alpha level of 0.05 (two tailed), and to demonstrate a difference between the three groups in sexual health at the end of the intervention. Previous experience in exercise and psychosexual therapy trials indicates an attrition rate of up to 20% over the intervention period. Therefore, to adequately ensure that we have sufficient participant numbers at the end of the intervention, 240 participants will be randomised to the study arms. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating whether exercise aids in the management of sexual dysfunction and explores if an integrated treatment model incorporating pharmacological, exercise and psychosexual therapies maximises improvement in sexual health in men with prostate cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join if you are a male aged 18 years and over; have had prior and/or current treatment for prostate cancer including prostatectomy, radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy; and concerned about sexual health (as assessed by International Index of Erectile Functioning overall satisfaction score and/or Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite sexual bother score). Trial details. Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of three groups. Participants in one group (i.e. Exercise intervention group) will attend a 6 month physical exercise intervention program that involves resistance (i.e. lifting weights) and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) undertaken 3 times per week in an exercise clinic. Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be conducted in small groups under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist. Participants in the second group (i.e. Exercise and psychosexual intervention group) will also undergo the exercise intervention described above as well as attend a single, 60 minute, one-on-one psycho-educational session with their exercise physiologist and receive a self-management kit that addresses psychological and sexual well-being. Participants in the third group (i.e. Usual care  delayed intervention group) will maintain usual care for 6 months before receiving the intervention  half will receive the intervention provided to the Exercise Group, and half will receive the intervention provided to the Exercise and Psychosexual Intervention Group.</summary>
