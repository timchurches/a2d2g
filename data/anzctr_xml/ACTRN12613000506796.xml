  <interventions>
    <interventions>"What Were We Thinking" (WWWT)  is a single day, 6 hour, psycho-educational program for mothers, fathers and their first newborn infants offered in primary care maternal and child health services prior to 8 weeks postpartum. Programs are delivered to groups of 5 - 7 couples and their infant. WWWT addresses two known risk factors for postpartum mental health problems: infant sleep and settling and intimate partner relationship. Content is presented in a variety of formats, including didactic presentations, discussion, completion of worksheets individually or as a couple, practical demonstration and individual practice. </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Maternal and Child Health care. 
All Victorian Maternal and Child Health (MCH) centres offer care to parents and infants according to the Key Ages and Stages Framework. A detailed description of the platform of care is available at http://www.education.vic.gov.au/childhood/parents/mch/Pages/visits.aspx. 
Most MCH centres also offer parents of a first infant the opportunity to participate in a First Time Parent group, which consists of one session per week for 6 - 8 weeks. These groups are facilitated by MCH nurses and include topics related to feeding, teething, child safety, settling and toys, but do not address the two key modifyable risk factors addressed by What Were We Thinking. </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Primiparous women with adequate English fluency residing in participating local government areas who have given birth in the previous two weeks and are receiving care in a trial maternal and child health centre. Both the mother and father will be invited and encouraged to attend, however in situations where the father is unable or unwilling to attend, mothers will be encouraged to attend with a nominated support person, for example, their mother, friend or grandmother, but if this is not possible, women will be welcome to attend alone. Parents in same sex relationships are invited and welcome to attend.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial, using the maternal and child health centre as the unit of randomisation. 
Women who have recently given birth in Victoria are assigned to a MCH centre based on their residential address. Women allocated to care in an intervention MCH centre will receive the intervention as part of their care and those allocated to care in a control centre will receive usual best practice care. 
All women meeting inclusion criteria and receiving care in a participating maternal and child health (MCH) centre will be invited to participate.
</concealment>
    <sequence>The 31 local government areas (LGAs) in the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne, Victoria will be ranked by the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) (ABS) and divided into high, middle and low tertiles. LGAs from each tertile will be invited to participate until 6 (2 from each tertile) have signed agreements. 
48 MCH centres, which provide care for at least 16 primiparous women per annum, will be selected from participating LGAs and randomly allocated by an independent statistician, using the Stata v12 random allocation program, to intervention or control group, stratifying by local government area (LGA).</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Individuals will  not be randomly allocated to groups. Group allocation of participants will depend on participants' residential location, which defines their MCH centre allocation and therefore their trial arm allocation.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be compared between the intervention and control groups to establish the validity of the randomization process. Binary outcomes (Primary, Secondary 3 and Secondary 5 outcomes) will be analyzed using logistic regression models to compare the proportions at 6 months between the intervention and control groups. Continuously valued outcomes (Secondary 1, Secondary 2, Secondary 4 and Secondary 6 outcomes) will be analysed using linear regression. All regression analyses will be adjusted for clustering, baseline differences and relevant covariates. All analyses will be by intention to treat and conducted using Stata. Secondary outcome 6 will estimate the total costs and QALYs; average costs and QALYs will be compared between the two study arms.  Regression analysis will estimate the ICER, that is the cost per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis will use non-parametric bootstrapping, and uncertainty will be presented in cost effectiveness acceptability curves.
Power and sample size
Based on our controlled before-and-after study we will power the trial to detect a reduction of 12.5% (25% in the control arm, 12.5% in the intervention arm) in the primary outcome. A randomised trial of individuals would require 168 participants in each arm, with a type 1 error of 5% and 80% power. Adjusting for clustering (intra-class correlation = 0.01), the required sample is n=184, a total sample of n=368. Allowing for attrition of 10% after enrolment, we will continue recruiting until 400 (200 in each arm) participants have entered the trial. A conservatively estimated 50% recruitment of eligible participants will require 48 MCHCs (clusters) each meeting the criterion of caring for an average of 16 primiparous women per annum.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postnatal depression and anxiety in women are associated with disability and diminished caregiving capacity and are of national concern. The 2009 National Perinatal Depression Initiative addresses identification of and treatment for currently symptomatic women. However, a comprehensive health service response also requires strategies to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. To date, interventions to prevent postnatal mental health problems have had limited success, perhaps because they focused only on women and did not include fathers or the baby; addressed needs for support by providing increased professional care rather than attempting to enhance a womans intimate relationships, and did not take history of mental disorders into account. The common agenda of the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development; the Mental Health Division of the Victorian Department of Health, the Parenting Research Centre and the Jean Hailes Research Unit, Monash University is to optimize maternal mental health and wellbeing through evidence-based universal approaches. This inclusive Partnership is essential to the implementation and testing of a novel intervention to meet these needs. What Were We Thinking (WWWT) is a well-theorized, salient, structured, gender-informed, couples-based early postpartum psycho-educational intervention provided in maternal and child health services. It addresses the intimate partner relationship, infant behaviour management, and the mediating effects of occupational fatigue. We have promising early evidence from a controlled before and after study that WWWT prevents postpartum mental health problems in women. This cluster randomized controlled trial will establish whether WWWT is effective in reducing the 30 day prevalence of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders in primiparous women and improving infant behaviour, mother-infant relationship and partner relationship at six months postpartum.</summary>
