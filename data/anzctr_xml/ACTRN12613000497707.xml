  <interventions>
    <interventions>We aim to investigate the feasibility and outcomes of a preoperative supervised very low calorie diet (VLCD) program in elective cardiac surgery patients with obesity and the metabolic syndrome.

All elective cardiac surgery patients who are obese (WHO BMI criteria / waist circumference) and have the metabolic syndrome (modified NCEP-ATP III criteria of hypertension, high cholesterol and treated diabetes mellitus) will be invited to participate in a supervised very low calorie diet program for six weeks preoperatively.  The initial two weeks will utilise a VLCD only (3 liquid meal replacements / day, approx 800 calories / day).  Whole foods will then be added over the subsequent four weeks using the Healthy Eating Plan devised by the Nutrition and Dietetics Department.  The participants will be reviewed by a Dietician and Endocrinologist (diabetic patients only) upon recruitment to provide information regarding the VLCD program.  They will be reviewed again by the Dietician at two weeks for reintroduction of whole foods.  Diabetic patients will be monitored by the Endocrinologist weekly if their blood sugars are erratic or if they require changes to medications.  Blood tests will be performed both on recruitment and preoperatively (approximately six weeks after VLCD use).  

No specific strategies will be employed to improve compliance.  Encouragement will be provided during follow-up phone calls.  Perioperative management will be conducted in a routine manner. 

We will analyse short and mid-term outcomes including weight loss, postoperative mortality, morbidity and length of stay.  Patients will be contacted either by phone or mail, at 6 and 12 months post-operatively to complete a follow-up questionnaire.  These results will be compared with retrospective data for: elective cardiac surgery patients (all-comers), elective obese cardiac surgery patients without metabolic syndrome, and elective obese cardiac surgery patients with metabolic syndrome who did not undergo the VLCD intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Data will be compared with existing retrospective data for elective cardiac surgery patients (all-comers), elective obese cardiac surgery patients without metabolic syndrome and elective obese cardiac surgery patients with metabolic syndrome.  

This data is de-identified and contained within the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery (Princess Alexandra Hospital) audit database. Comparison data from the previous 12-18 months will be used to analyse the VLCD results.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients will be recruited by specially instructed nursing or medical staff after they present to the outpatient clinic or undergo inpatient review, and are found to require non-urgent cardiac surgery.  All patients will have their BMI calculated and waist circumference measured to identify those who meet the obesity criteria.  Patients with metabolic syndrome will then be identified through history and/or examination, according to the modified NCEP-ATP III criteria (hypertension, elevated cholesterol, diabetes).  They will be given the Participant Information Sheet and other supplemental information to enable informed consent.  They will be given the opportunity to discuss their participation with carers or family members.  Upon recruitment, they will be reviewed by the Dietician and Endocrinologist (diabetic patients only), given supporting documentation and commenced on the VLCD program.</concealment>

    <assignment>Single group</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Patients will complete six weeks of preoperative VLCD program.  

They will commence VLCD only for two weeks, then be reviewed again by Dietician and Endocrinologist (diabetic patients only).  They will then have whole foods reintroduced (Healthy Eating Plan with suitable foods list provided) for the remaining four weeks.  

They will be contacted weekly via phone to assess their progress and resolve any issues they may have encountered.  The Endocrinology team will also monitor their blood glucose levels weekly, if their BSLs have been erratic or they are requiring significant modification of their diabetic medications.

On presentation for their elective cardiac surgery, patient progress will be monitored through physical measurements and blood results (lipid profile, cholesterol level).  Routine perioperative management will be performed.  Patients will be followed up at six and twelve months for mid-term outcomes.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The number of participants needed to achieve study objectives was based on clinical assumptions; the researchers believe that 200 patients should allow for extrapolation of results.  Based on the existing patient database (maintained locally by the Department), we found approx 40-50 patients met the recruitment criteria (obesity and metabolic syndrome) annually.  Therefore, we assume that a similar number of patients will be recruited yearly during the trial.  Ideally, larger numbers will be recruited per year, or the study period may be lengthened to allow for greater sample size.

Results will be compared with existing retrospective data (local audit database maintained by the Department) for the past 12-18 months on:
- elective cardiac surgery patients (all-comers)
- elective cardiac surgery patients with obesity but not metabolic syndrome
- elective cardiac surgery patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome (predating the intervention)</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients will be recruited in the outpatient setting after they have been found to require cardiac surgery.  They will have their body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference measured and will have blood tests.  They will be reviewed by the Dietician, who will explain the very low calorie diet (VLCD) program.  They will undergo the VLCD program, comprising liquid meal replacements for two weeks.  They will then return for review by the Dietician and will be commenced on a Healthy Eating Plan, allowing for reintroduction of whole foods over the following four weeks.  Diabetic patients will be monitored by the Endocrinology team throughout the period.  On completing the program, they will be admitted for elective cardiac surgery and undergo routine preoperative assessment including repeat blood tests and calculation of their weight loss.  They will be reviewed as an outpatient six weeks postoperatively.  They will be contacted via phone or mail at 6 and 12 months postoperatively to assess mid-term outcomes.</summary>
