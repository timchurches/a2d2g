  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ninety  patients 18-40 yr old American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA) physical status I or II, scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, were studied in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized way. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups.The Clonidine group (group C) received bupivacaine 10 mg combined with 75 microgramg Clonidine preservative free solution ,The Epinephrin-Clonidin group (group E-C) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with 35 microgramg   Clonidin and 200 microgram Epinephrin. The placebo group (group P) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with 0.5ml distilled water(intrathecally) for each three groups 5 minutes prior to surgery.</interventions>

    <concealment>Enrollment is decided and permission of the patient is obtained by the anesthesiologists during preoperative rounding.This is a double blinded clinical trial, with blinding of both the patient and the administrating practitioner to the anaesthetic type. Allocation will be managed by a Resident external to the project. The blinding will occur through use of equal amounts of pretreatment drugs (3mlâ€™s) Each syringe will be labeled A ,B,C according to its contents. . The drug syringes are handed over to anesthesiologists blinded to the patient allocation to carry out the spinal of anesthesia</concealment>

    <summary>Objective :To compare the hemodynamic effects of  combined intrathecal Clonidine and Epinephrin as an additive to bupivacaine in patients undergoing cesarean section . 
Methods:Following Ethics Committee approval and informed patients consent, Ninety  patients 18-40 yr old ASA physical status I or II, scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, were studied in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized way. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups. The Clonidine group (groupC) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with 75 microgram clonidine preservative free ,the Epinephrin-Clonidin group (group E-C) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with 35 microgram Clonidin and 200 microgram Epinephrin, and the placebo group (group P) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with 0.5ml distilled water intrathecally .Intraoperative changes in hemodynamics variables [Mean Blood pressuer(MBP)  and Heart Rate( HR)], Sensory block onset time, maximum sensory level , onset of motor block, duration of blockade,  the incidence of hypotension, ephedrine requirements, bradycardia , neonate's APGAR 1 &amp; 5 minute  were recorded. MBP was measured and monitored by automated non-invasive blood pressure in arm and HR was recorded by Electrocardiogram(ECG).
