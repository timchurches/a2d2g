  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a multifactorial strategy that addresses falls risk at an individual resident and systems level.  The main engine for the intervention is the falls project officer who will liase with intervention facilities to determine their current approaches to falls prevention and to facilitate the adoption of falls prevention strategies that have been found to be effective in other settings.  These strategies include falls risk assessment, reduction of environmental hazards, physical activity, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, general nutrition, medication review, review of restraint policy.Evaluation of the intervention will involve a number of low and high care lodges from residential aged care facilities across the Hunter and enable comparison of outcomes for residents in lodges that are allocated to receive the intervention and control lodges. Because the intervention is holistic and is aimed at the environment and culture surrounding the residents, whole facilities (lodges) will be selected for random allocation to intervention or control conditions.  Randomisation will occur using a technique of minimisation to ensure intervention and control lodges are balanced for: number of residents, level of care, and dementia specific units.  A total eighty lodges will be randomly allocated in this way, with a minimum of 20 residents per lodge.Baseline measures will be collected over four months.  This will be followed by a one month washout period when staff in the intervention facilities are trained in the intervention.  The intervention will then be implemented for a 12 month period  to allow for monitoring of the impact of the intervention on falls risk and other outcomes.Following randomisation and prior to administration of the intervention, a census of non respite residents will be undertaken and these will form the intervention and control cohorts that will be followed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is a fall resulting in fractured neck of femur.Evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention will occur at two levels.1.  Group Level: Time-series evaluation.  The evaluation will assess whether the intervention has resulted in an overall reduction in the number of fall-related fractured neck of femur in the intervention lodges when compared to control lodges.  A two-group time series design will be used to assess this effect.  Time series data on the monthly number of falls.  All residents in the facilities will be included in these analyses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All outcomes will be measured monthly over a twelve month period and will be analysed at the end of this period.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Process outcomes are: adoption of falls reduction strategies.
Factors surrounding fall-related events will also be described.  Objectives within the project will include: to develop an appropriate, evidence-based multi-factorial program to reduce hip fractures in aged care facilities; to test and document the feasibility of implementing the program; to engage relevant stakeholders and project partners, including general practitioners; to document the resources required to successfully implement the program; to explore the sustainability of the intervention, notably with respect to identification of the resources required for ongoing maintenance of the intervention; to develop a model of intervention to be implemented across other Area Health Services in NSW and beyond.
In addition, the study should add to our knowledge of the nature and causes of hip fractures in aged care facilities, particularly in the areas of: the important risk factors for falls resulting in hip fractures; the morbidity and mortality resulting from falls in aged care facilities; the most appropriate assessment tools for aged care facilities; which groups of residents are most likely to respond to a preventative program.</outcome>
