  <interventions>
    <interventions>InterventionMidwifery continuity of care: Women allocated to the intervention group will receive midwifery continuity of care from a small group of midwives. The midwives will provide care during the antenatal, labour and birth, and postnatal periods (to two weeks postnatally). Midwives will adhere to The National Midwifery Guidelines for Consultation &amp; Referral. All women will have an appointment with an obstetric consultant at 36 weeks gestation (to re-assess VBAC suitability and discuss the birth plan). If a woman develops complications during pregnancy and requires additional care, she will continue with the midwifery continuity of care model while also attending obstetric or other consultations (this is the same for both groups). Labour and birth care will be provided at Gosford Hospital Birth Unit and postnatal care will be provided in the womans own home for a period of two weeks postpartum, following discharge from hospital.</interventions>
    <comparator>ControlStandard Care: Women allocated to the control group will receive the current model of public maternity care at Gosford Hospital. Antenatal care is provided by antenatal staff (midwives and obstetricians). Staff in the Birth Unit provide labour and birth care and postnatal care is provided by midwives in the postnatal ward. Women are also offered midwifery visits at home for up to two weeks following discharge from hospital (448 hours after a vaginal birth). All these care providers are different people.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomisation will be 1:1 and stratified for spontaneous labour in the primary CS, that is whether the woman had a labour or not prior to her primary CS. 

Allocation concealment will be assured by using a central remote telephone allocation service which will ensure that the person determining eligibility will not be aware as to the group that the participant will be allocated. The RA will telephone the allocation service to provide the womanâ€™s initials and date of birth. The allocation service will check her eligibility. The midwife will be informed of the group to which the woman has been allocated and will receive her study number, which will be recorded in the Trial Register and Log Book. If allocated to standard care, the woman will be advised of her next clinic appointment. If allocated to midwifery continuity of care, she will be advised of the time and place of her first visit with the midwifery continuity of care practice.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pregnancy and birth directly affect almost 300,000 families in Australia each year. A key concern is that the caesarean section rate in Australia is higher than similar countries with a lack of support for women to have a vaginal birth after caesarean section. 

We plan to undertake a trial to determine whether midwifery continuity of care increases the rate of vaginal birth in women who have had a previous caesarean section. This trial could significantly alter the way maternity care is provided.</summary>
