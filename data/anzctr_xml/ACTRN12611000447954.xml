  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventions included postural re-education (arm 1), progressive resisted back extension exercise (arm 2), both (arm 3) and control (arm 4).
The intervention period lasted for 12 weeks
Arm 1 - Postural assessment and treatment by a physiotherapist including a home exercise programme. Three 20 - 30 minute sessions over the 12 week period.
Arm 2 - Gym based strengthening programme with one initial instruction and two review sessions by the researcher lasting 20 - 30 minutes. The participants were asked to do their exercise programme of 4 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Each session took approximately 15 minutes.
Arm 3 - Attended the gym and received postural re-education from a physiotherapist as above.
Arm 4 - Received no treatment intervention and were instructed to continue their normal daily routine.
Both normal and stroke groups were randomised to the four intervention groups.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study is a 2X2 factorial design with two interventions (above) and a control. The control has no intervention and no placebo. It is active in that people are generally not given any intervention for the condition.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether thoracic kyphosis (stooped posture)can be reduced using two commonly used treatment modalities. The first, postural re-education, was found in a recent survey to be the most commonly used treatment modality amongst Australian Physiotherapists. The second, progressive resisted strengthening is supported by level 1 evidence in terms of strengthening but not reduction of kyphosis. The study involves the assessment of these strategies seperately, together and not at all in both a stroke and a non stroke poulation.</summary>
