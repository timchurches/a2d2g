    <summary>This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, single arm, 2-stage study of tazemetostat 800 mg
      BID administered orally in continuous 28 day cycles. Screening of subjects to determine
      eligibility for the study will be performed within 21 days of the first planned dose of
      tazemetostat. Eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of fivecohorts based on tumor type:

        -  Cohort 1: MRT, RTK, ATRT, or selected tumors with rhabdoid features, including small
           cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type [SCCOHT], also known as malignant rhaboid
           tumor of the ovary [MRTO]

        -  Cohort 2: Relapsed or refractory synovial sarcoma with SS18-SSX rearrangement

        -  Cohort 3: Other INI1 negative tumors or any solid tumor with an EZH2 gain of function
           (GOF) mutation, including: epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (EMPNST),
           extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC), myoepithelial carcinoma, other INI1-negative
           malignant tumors with Sponsor approval (e.g., dedifferentiated chordoma) any solid tumor
           with an EZH2 GOF mutation including but not limited to Ewing's sarcoma and melanoma

        -  Cohort 4: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC)

        -  Cohort 5: Epithelioid sarcoma (ES)

        -  Cohort 6: Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) undergoing mandatory tumor biopsy

        -  Cohort 7: Poorly differentiated chordoma (or other chordoma with Sponsor approval)

      Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study. Response assessment will be evaluated
      after 8 weeks of treatment and then every 8 weeks thereafter while on study.</summary>
