  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention being studied in this trial is Continuous Positive Airway 
Pressure (CPAP), which is the current gold-standard treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). CPAP involves wearing a mask around the nose, mouth or face, which is connected via a tube to a device that creates an internal air pressure. This air pressure is then transmitted through the tube at a continuous pressure and into the mask worn by  the participant every night during sleep. 
CPAP dose is set by the air pressure emitted from the mask, and this will be determined by a pressure determination sleep test performed at the 
Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, in accordance with clinical practices. The duration of CPAP treatment will be for three months. 

Compliance with treatment will be measured using the built-in CPAP smartcard that will measure how long (in hours) the CPAP pump was used by the patient each time it was switched on. This information will be assessed during compliance appointments with an experienced CPAP therapist at regular intervals throughout the treatment period. 
Additionally, self-reported compliance will be assessed by a Study 
Researcher during structured telephone interviews conducted at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 24 during the active CPAP treatment period.
</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment.

This trial is a two-way cross-over design. Each treatment period will be three months duration, with a one-week wash-out period between the two treatment periods.

    <concealment>Men and women aged 50-80 years will be referred from the Healthy Brain Ageing Clinic, Brain &amp; Mind Research Institute and the Sleep Clinic, Woolcock Institute for Medical Research. Once informed consent is obtained, all baseline assessments are complete, and the Trial Coordinator along with a Trial Clinician has assessed eligibility and made the decision to enrol a participant, the Research Officer responsible for randomly allocating participants to treatment will be notified. Treatment allocation will be undertaken in accordance with the randomisation schedule which will be generated prior to trial commencement. The Research Officer, who will not have any involvement in the booking or conduct of assessments, will advise the participant of their allocated treatment group and next steps. The electronic randomisation schedule will be password protected and accessible only to the Research Officer responsible for treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be allocated to treatment using a randomly generated number sequence calculated used Research Randomizer (http://www.randomizer.org/) prior to trial commencement. The fully replicable procedure will incorporate permuted blocks of varying lengths and will include stratification by OSA severity, with strata defined by a apnoea-hypopnoea index of &lt; 30 or &gt;= 30. Participants will be allocated to either CPAP Intervention-Control or Control-CPAP Intervention.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a sleep disorder that results in hypersomnia and sleep fragmentation, is identified as a possible risk factor for cognitive decline in the elderly. Although the occurrence of OSA in certain neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimers disease (AD), has been examined, its role and impact in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - a group 'at risk' of dementia progression - is yet to be established. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment has been shown to decrease sleep disturbance in patients with AD and OSA over periods of up to three weeks, and positive effects on global cognition, executive functioning and psychomotor speed have been observed. However, there are no known studies examining the efficacy of CPAP on cognition in MCI. Thus, if it is possible that OSA is identified and treated early, cognitive decline could be slowed or ameliorated. 
We hypothesise that CPAP will be associated with superior cognitive functioning in the domains of processing speed, memory and executive function, than compared to no treatment with CPAP.</summary>
