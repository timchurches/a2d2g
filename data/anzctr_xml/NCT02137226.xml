    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria:

          -  All patients must sign and date an Informed Consent Form consistent with International
             Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and local
             legislation prior to participation in the trial (i.e. prior to any trial procedures,
             which include medication washout and restrictions) and be willing to follow the
             protocol.

          -  Male or female participants, between 18 and 80 years of age, who have a diagnosis of
             moderately to severely active RA for at least 6 months as defined by at least six
             swollen joints (66 joint count) and at least six tender joints (68 joint count) at
             Screening and Baseline (Day 1), and either an ESR of &gt;28 mm/hour OR a C-reactive
             protein (CRP) level &gt;1.0 mg/dL (normal: &lt;0.4 mg/dL) at Screening. Patients must
             currently be receiving methotrexate (MTX) therapy.

          -  Current treatment for RA on an outpatient basis:

               1. Must be receiving and tolerating oral or parenteral MTX therapy at a dose of 15
                  to 25 mg per week (dose may be as low as 10 mg per week if the patient is unable
                  to tolerate a higher dose) for at least 12 weeks immediately prior to Day 1. The
                  dose and administration route should remain stable for at least 4 weeks prior to
                  Day 1 until Week 24. After Week 24 the administration route can be changed at the
                  investigator's discretion. Patients receiving a lower dose of MTX (10 to 14
                  mg/week) should be doing so as a result of a documented history of intolerance to
                  higher doses of MTX.

               2. Patients must be willing to receive oral folic acid (at least 5 mg/week or as per
                  local practice) or folinic acid (at least 1 mg/week or as per local practice) or
                  equivalent during the entire trial (mandatory comedication for MTX treatment).

               3. Disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use will be restricted according to
                  guidelines listed in the trial protocol.

               4. If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids (other than
                  intra-articular or parenteral), the dose must not exceed 10 mg/day prednisolone
                  or equivalent. During the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Day 1) the dose must remain
                  stable.

               5. Any concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable for
                  at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.

               6. Patients may be taking oral hydroxychloroquine provided that the dose is not
                  greater than 400 mg/day or chloroquine provided that the dose is not greater than
                  250 mg/day. These doses must have been stable for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to
                  Day 1. The hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment will need to be continued
                  at a stable dose with the same formulation until the end of the trial.

          -  For participants of reproductive potential (males and females), a reliable means of
             contraception has to be used throughout trial participation(acceptable methods of
             birth control include for example birth control pills, intrauterine devices [IUDs],

             (males and females of child-bearing potential) must also agree to use an acceptable
             method of contraception for 6 months following completion or discontinuation from the
             trial medication.</inclusivecriteria>

    <summary>Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this trial is to establish an equivalence in efficacy between BI
      695501 and US-licensed Humira® in patients with active RA based on a statistical comparison
      of the proportion of patients meeting American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response
      rate at Week 12 and ACR20 response rate at Week 24 between BI 695501 and US-licensed Humira®.

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity
      of BI 695501 and US-lisensed Humira® in patients with active RA including those undergoing
      the transition from US-licensed Humira® to BI 695501 after 24 weeks.</summary>
