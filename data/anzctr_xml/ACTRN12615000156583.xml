  <interventions>
    <interventions>The program to be evaluated is a group education and skills training intervention, called Responding to Cognitive Concerns (ReCog), which has previously successfully improved subjective and objective cognitive function in survivors of breast cancer and other types of cancer. The program is based on self -regulatory cognitive rehabilitation and cognitive behavioural principles, and employs manuals for clinicians and participants. The program is run in small groups of approximately 4-9 participants. There will be four sessions run at weekly intervals by an occupational therapist, with assistance from an occupational therapy assistant and occupational therapy student, and each session will last for 2 hours. Patients will be asked to practise the learnt strategies and skills in and between sessions, with the ultimate goal of generalising these strategies to their everyday life. Home tasks are expected to take approximately 15 minutes per day. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored via attendance at sessions and completion of home tasks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The main comparison for this study is pre-treatment performance. Effect sizes for pre-treatment/post-treatment differences (if any) will also be compared to other studies of ReCog that have been conducted in research settings. Historical data for one comparison study were collected at Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia in 2009-2010 (published as Schuurs, A., &amp; Green, H. J. (2012). A feasibility study of group cognitive rehabilitation for cancer survivors: Enhancing cognitive function and quality of life. Psycho-Oncology. doi 10.1002/pon.3102). Data for a second comparison study were collected at Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia in 2012-2013 (trial ACTRN12615000009516).

To detect an effect at the lower end of this range (d = 0.5), 27 participants tested in a pre-post design would give power of 80% to detect the effect (one-tailed testing, alpha = 0.05). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine whether a cognitive rehabilitation intervention, ReCog, has an effect on cognitive function in cancer survivors. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have had a previous diagnosis of breast cancer, had chemotherapy treatment at Mater Cancer Care Centre, Brisbane, and completed all major cancer treatments.

Study details
All participants in this study will receive a group education and skills training intervention called Responding to Cognitive Concerns (ReCog). The program is based on self-regulatory cognitive rehabilitation and cognitive behavioural principles, and employs manuals for clinicians and participants. The program is run in small groups of approximately 4-9 participants. There will be four sessions run at weekly intervals by an occupational therapist and each session will last for 2 hours. Patients will be asked to practise the learnt strategies and skills in and between sessions, with the ultimate goal of generalising these strategies to their everyday life. Home tasks are expected to take approximately 15 minutes per day. 

Participants' performance on cognitive tasks (such as tests of memory and attention) will occur before and after the group program. Questionnaires on psychological distress, quality of life, psychological needs and satisfaction will be administered after the group program. It is hypothesised that both their cognitive performance on standard tests and reported everyday cognitive performance on questionnaires will improve.</summary>
