    <interventions>Exercise
The 8- week exercise program will be performed three times per week and has both aerobic and strengthening components and is based on American Diabetes Association and American College of Sports Medicine recommendations and informed by guidelines for the Medicare funded Type 2 Diabetes Allied Health Group Program. 

The program will be individually prescribed and undertaken in a group environment of no more than eight participants. All exercise sessions will be preceded by warm-up and stretching. The aerobic component will progress from 10 min at 50% heart rate reserve to 50 min at 70% heart rate reserve. The strengthening component will begin at 2 sets of 10 repetitions for each exercise gradually progressing to 3 sets of 15 repetitions to maintain rating of perceived exertion in a moderate range (78 out of 10). The exercise intervention will be supervised by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist and the program of exercise will be approved by the participants General Practitioner.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Education
The primary aim of the study is to determine the effect of exercise on peripheral neuropathy. To do this a comparative group that does not undertake the exercise is required. As it is expected that exercise will be beneficial for the participants undertaking exercise in exercise-related aspects such as physical capacity, it is ethically important to ensure that participants allocated to the comparative group are not significantly disadvantaged. 

It has been demonstrated that group education that incorporates various key aspects of living with type 2 diabetes has a positive effective for diabetes-related health outcomes. Therefore the comparative group will be offered a group education program underpinned by the Diabetes Conversations program, which was developed by the International Diabetes Federation based on international guidelines. The interactive group-based program will focus on key areas of living with diabetes and includes:
i.	Introduction and goal setting (week 1)
ii.	Living with diabetes (week 2)
iii.	How diabetes works (week 3)
iv.	Healthy eating and staying active (week 4)
v.	Dietitian session (week 5)
vi.	Exercise physiology session (weeks 6)
vii.	Medications (week 7)
viii.	Summary and over view (week 8)

The duration of the weekly sessions will be 1 hour and will be administered by a diabetes educator (weeks 1-4, 7-8), dietitian (week 5) and exercise physiologist (week 6).</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be randomised to receive an exercise intervention or an education program. Allocation to either the exercise or education groups will be achieved using a centrally-based computer generated random number sequence. The allocation sequence will be generated and held by an external person off-site not directly involved in the trial. The allocation sequence will be concealed from the researchers assessors of the primary outcome measure of the study. The researcher measuring the secondary outcomes and delivering the exercise intervention will not be blinded to allocation. Due to the nature of the activity of the groups (group exercise or group education) it is not possible to blind the participants to group allocation.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary statistical analysis for this study is based upon the following parameters:
i.	One continuous dependent variable
a.	MNSI symptom score
i.	Mean total score /15
ii.	Two categorical independent variables
a.	Intervention
i.	Exercise/education
b.	Time
i.	Baseline/post program

A mixed ANOVA analysis will be undertaken to test whether there are main effects for each of the independent variables and whether the interaction between the two variables are significant. This analysis will inform on whether there is a change in MNSI scores over the two time periods and will compare the two intervention groups in terms of their effectiveness in reducing MNSI scores (improving the symptoms of neuropathy). Finally, this analysis will inform on whether any change in MNSI scores over time is different for the two groups.

There has been only one previous study that has investigated the effect of exercise on peripheral neuropathy. This uncontrolled within-group study demonstrated a large effect for the analysis undertaken (paired t-test, Cohens d = 0.7, p = 0.01). In this pilot randomised controlled trial, we seek to determine the effect of exercise on peripheral neuropathy in a controlled, between-groups analysis to inform future research on the clinical significance of exercise on peripheral neuropathy. As such, for the mixed model ANOVA to be undertaken, we have estimated a sample size of 44 to detect a medium of f  = 0.20 (power = 80%, p = 0.05). Taking into consideration a 10% drop out rate the sample size required is 48.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetic neuropathy is a common co-morbidity of diabetes that is a risk factor for foot ulceration and lower limb amputation. Exercise interventions may have the potential to reduce the burden of diabetic foot problems as a recent study demonstrated improvement in peripheral neuropathy symptoms after a structured exercise program in laboratory conditions. Exploration of these promising results in a  pragmatic environment is required to understand the true effect of exercise in the management of peripheral neuropathy. 

Therefore, we will attempt to answer the following research question: Does structured exercise training improve neuropathic signs and symptoms in people with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy?

To answer this question, a pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted. People with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy will be recruited. Following preliminary testing and randomisation, participants will attend three supervised exercise sessions per week or a diabetes lifestyle coaching program for 8-weeks. Repeat testing will be completed after the completion of the exercise or education program. The primary outcome will be the validated Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument score and secondary outcomes will include three separate physical function tests that explore aerobic fitness, lower limb endurance and balance. Based on neuropathy-related effect found in the previous study, approximately 24 participants in each group are required to identify a medium effect (power = 80%, p = 0.05).
