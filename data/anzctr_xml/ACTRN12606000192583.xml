  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Phase IIa trial will assess the safety and tolerability of a topical gel containing 1% R-flurbiprofen, when applied to the skin of subjects with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer. This will be a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. All subjects and study personnel will be blinded, except for the person allocating the active or placebo tubes to each subject, based on the randomisation schedule. Thirty subjects will receive the R-flurbiprofen gel, and 10 will receive a placebo gel. The gel will be applied topically once daily, for 28 consecutive days, to the face, ears, neck, forearms and hands. 
The primary outcome measure will be skin irritation at the site of gel application. 
Lay statement: This trial will test the safety of a gel when applied to the skin of people who have had at least one non-melanoma skin cancer. A future trial will test if this gel can prevent, or reduce the occurrence of, non-melanoma skin cancer.</summary>
