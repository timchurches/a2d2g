      <outcome>Progression-free Survival, as Assessed by the Investigator - Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was determined by the investigator according to the definitions of response in the International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) updated National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines. According to the guidelines, PD is characterized by at least one of the following: lymphadenopathy (appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (&gt;1.5 centimeter [cm]), spleen or liver or other infiltrates or an increase by 50% or more in the greatest diameter of any previous site); an increase by 50% or more in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen; an increase by 50% or more in the numbers of blood lymphocytes with at least 5000 lymphocytes per microliter; transformation to a more aggressive histology, or occurrence of cytopenia attributable to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline (BL) in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 16 Item Module (EORTC QLQ-CLL 16) - The EORTC QLQ-CLL16 is comprised of 16 questions that address 5 domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) important in CLL. There are 4 multi-item scales - fatigue (2 items), treatment side effects ([TSE], 4 items), disease symptoms (disease effects scale [DES], 4 items), and infection (4 items) - and single-item scales (social activities [Social Problems (SP) Scale] and future health worries [Future Health (FH) Scale]). These are measured on a four-point Likert scale, where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much. These scores are transformed to give a rating from 0 - 100, where 0 = no symptoms or problems and 100 = severe symptoms or problems. Changes from Baseline were analyzed by a mixed model-repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score - The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a self-reported, 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses 15 domains: physical functioning (5 items), role functioning (2 items), emotional functioning (4 items), cognitive functioning (2 items), social functioning (2 items), pain (2 items), fatigue (3 items), nausea and vomiting (2 items), five single-item symptom scores (insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, and dyspnea), a single item asking about financial difficulties, and global health status/quality of life (QOF) consisting of 2 items. Functional and symptoms scales were measured on a four-point Likert scale, where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much, whereas global health status or QOF was assessed using a 7-item Likert scale, ranging from "poor" (worse quality of life) to "excellent" (better quality of life).

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Quality of Life Status as Assessed by the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) Scale - EQ-5D is comprised of a 5-item health status measure and a visual analogue scale (VAS) and is used to generate two scores: the utility score and the thermometer score. The utility score measures mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Responses to each of the 5 health states are measured on a 3-point scale (level 1 = no problem; level 2 = some or moderate problem[s] and level 3 = unable, or extreme problems). Responses are typically converted into health utilities or valuations on a scale ranging from 0 (worst health) to 1 (perfect health). The thermometer score ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Changes from Baseline were analyzed by mixed model-repeated measures ANCOVA. A negative adjusted mean change from Baseline represents a worsening of quality of life.</outcome>

             following last ofatumumab dose. Adequate contraception is defined as abstinence, oral
             hormonal birth control, implants of levonorgestrel, estrogenic vaginal ring,
             percutaneous contraceptive patches, intrauterine device, and male partner

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if maintenance therapy with ofatumumab will prolong
      remission in patients with CLL who have responded to second or third line treatment. This
      study will also evaluate the safety of ofatumumab maintenance compared to observation (the
      current standard of care). This study was co-developed with the HOVON and NORDIC CLL group
      and will be conducted as a collaborative effort with GSK.</summary>
