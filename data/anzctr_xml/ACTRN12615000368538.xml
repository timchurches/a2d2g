  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two intervention arms and one placebo arm in this 3 way cross over study. Each subject will be randomly allocated  to take each treatment/placebo arm in random order for 7 days each, with a 2 week wash out period in between each phase of the study.
1. Prebiotic (Frutafit (registered trademark) Inulin powder) (6 gram sachet twice daily) / Placebo capsule (once daily)
2. Prebiotic (Frutafit (registered trademark) Inulin powder) (6 gram sachet twice daily) / Probiotic capsule (Caruso's Alive Probiotic containing:  Lactobacillus acidophilus 7.5 billion CFU, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 8.75 billion CFU, Bifidobacterium lactic 8.75 billion CFU) (once daily)
Subjects will be provided with 6 grams of Inulin in an individual sachet for each dose, to be mixed with water before meals twice daily (morning/evening).  The probiotic provided is in capsule form and is to be taken once daily before breakfast. The placebo capsule is also to be taken once daily before breakfast.
Pill count back method and study diaries  will be used to monitor adherence.
For 2 weeks prior to the first visit and for the duration of the study, participants will consume a fibre-controlled background diet. This will be achieved by avoidance of fibre-rich foods, limiting fruit and vegetable intake to 2 serves/ day and consuming 1/2 cup of All-Bran /day.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo (Maltodextrin powder) (6 gram sachet twice daily)  / Placebo capsule (once daily) for 7 days.
The placebo powder (maltodextrin) will also be provided in 6 gram individual sachets for each dose, to be mixed with water before meals twice daily (morning/evening). The placebo capsule is also to be taken once daily before breakfast.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Mean levels of difference in outcomes will be tested using repeated-measurements ANOVA of period differences by treatment sequence, which provides an estimate of treatment effect independent of period effect (Senn, 2002). An independent ANOVA of period totals by treatment sequence will test the assumption of no carry over effects.
Based on previous studies (Tarini and Wolever, 2010), we hypothesise that we will observe a change in plasma acetate of ~1SD. To achieve 90% power to detect a difference between groups, using alpha=0.025 (to avoid type 1 error when comparing 3 groups), we need n=15 subjects. Allowing for 30% dropouts, we will recruit n=20 subjects.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate whether a soluble fibre supplement alone or in combination with a probiotic is able to reduce inflammation in adults with asthma. Once ingested orally, soluble fibre- a normal component of the diet- acts as a prebiotic and is digested by healthy gut bacteria to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs).  These SCFAs may be beneficial in reducing airway inflammation in asthma. Supplementing with healthy bacteria using a probiotic may also increase the production of SCFAs.  The project involves a nine week intervention where 20 subjects with stable asthma will be allocated to take the prebiotic alone, prebiotic with probiotic and placebo supplements for 7 days each, in random order, with a two week washout period between each supplement phase. Subjects will not know which supplement they are receiving throughout the study.</summary>
