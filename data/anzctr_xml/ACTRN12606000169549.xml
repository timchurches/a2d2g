  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week study in subjects with PAH currently receiving oral therapy for the treatment of PAH.
Stratification of the population will occur in three groups:
 Subjects currently receiving approved endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and approved phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5)
inhibitor therapy willing to maintain current therapy for the duration of the study
 Subjects currently receiving approved ERA therapy alone willing to maintain current therapy for the duration of the study
 Subjects currently receiving approved PDE-5 inhibitor therapy alone willing to maintain current therapy for the duration of the study.
All subjects must be taking a PDE-5 inhibitor, ERA, or the combination for a minimum duration of 90 days and at the current dose(s) for at least 30 days prior to Baseline. All subjects should remain on the same pulmonary hypertension medications (i.e. PDE-5 inhibitor, ERA etc.) and doses as were used at Baseline throughout the study.  
Active treatment is UT-15C SR tablets provided in 1 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg strengths for the 16-week Treatment Phase. 
Treatment will be initiated at 1 mg twice daily (every 12 hours +/- 1 hour) with dose escalation of an additional 1 mg twice daily every 5 days if clinically indicated based upon adverse events and symptoms of PAH according to protocol-defined guidelines. Doses should be maximized throughout the Treatment Phase up to a maximum dose of 16 mg twice daily at the end of 16-weeks. All study drug should be administered with the morning and evening doses of background therapy immediately 
 following (~10 minutes) breakfast and dinner.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a medical disorder in which pressure in the blood vessels going from the right side of the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary arteries) is elevated. The symptoms associated with PAH are tiredness, dizziness, and shortness of breath.  These symptoms increase over time due to deterioration of the right ventricle of the heart.  Prostacyclin is a naturally occurring hormone like fatty acid which has been found diminished in patients with PAH. Treatment for PAH in Australia include drugs to dilate the blood vessels in the pulmonary artery i.e. Bosentan, Revatio, prostacyclin analogues (a manufactured drug similar in action to naturally occurring prostacyclin), Warfarin is used to thin the blood, oxygen and lung transplantation are all treatment options.
UT-15C is a prostacyclin analogue that has been developed in an oral form. Prostacyclin analogues are currently only available in intravenous and subcutaneous (injected under the skin) forms and have been shown to be a potent vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. These proven forms of treatment for PAH come with additional risks and administration complications. An oral form of the drug would be far more suitable and safer for the patient.
The aim of this study is to assess the effect of UT-15C sustained release (SR) on exercise capacity compared to placebo (as measured by the change in 6 minute walk distance after 16 weeks of treatment in patients with PAH currently receiving approved treatment. Approximately 300 patients will be recruited for this study, world wide. They will be randomized in a one to one placebo/active drug for 16 weeks of treatment. They will then be offered a place in the open label study planned for 36 months. The protocol for this has been submitted in a separate application.
It is hoped that using a combination treatment of PAH with therapies targeting different mechanisms of action has great promise in addressing the multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms that are implicated in PAH. These combinations may produce an additive effect or enhance and prolong the effect of other therapeutic agents.</summary>
