6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), a marker of the circadian clock, will be assayed in urine samples over 24 hours prior to surgery, on the first post operative day and after seven days at home.  The alterations in the phase and amplitude of the melatonin profile will be investigated.

Actigraphic monitoring of sleep wake cycles and light levels will be conducted seven days prior to surgery, throughout the hospital stay and for four weeks post operatively.

Patients will be asked to complete sleep diaries and mood questionnaires throughout the study period to measure changes in sleep parameters (total sleep, sleep fragmentation and sleep timing) and changes in mood.</interventions>
    <comparator>Baseline data will be collected from patients, hence they are essentially their own controls.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the effects of hospitalisation, anaesthesia and surgery resulting in significant post-operative sleep and circadian disruption in otherwise healthy fit kidney donor patients. These effects will be investigated via actigraphic monitoring of sleep wake cycles and light levels and 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), a marker of the circadian clock, will be assayed in urine samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline (pre-operatively at home), on first post-operative day (in hospital) and 4 and 12 week follow ups (post-operatively at home).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the extent of mood reduction and fatigue in these patients correlates with the extent of post-operative sleep and circadian disruption. Patients will be asked to keep sleep diaries, pain assessment visual analogue scales and questionnaires on sleeping habits (Munich Chronotype Questionnaire and Horne-Ostberg Questionnaire) and a mood questionnaire (Beck Depression Scales).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline (pre-operatively at home), on first post-operative day (in hospital) and 4 and 12 week follow ups (post-operatively at home).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently a shortage of kidneys for donation in New Zealand. Any measures that can improve the process of patients giving live donation of kidneys will help meet this shortage. Kidney donor patients pre-operatively are fit and well. Studies have shown that a laparoscopic (keyhole) approach to nephrectomy aids in a quick recovery.  Despite this, in the follow up of these patients it appears that a fatigue factor may persist post surgery. This may be due to sleep disturbance from the operation, anaesthetic and hospital stay.  Surgery and anaesthesia are known to cause sleep disturbances and fatigue, in part due to a disturbance in the circadian clock which controls sleep.  In this study we will recruit 20 healthy patients scheduled to undergo laproscopic donor nephrectomy surgery and monitor sleep and activity (using actiwatches), circadian rhythms (using urine samples)and fatigue and mood (using questionnaires) at four separate time points both before and after surgery. Data from these patients will provide a clear understanding of the extent of sleep disruption and mood reduction which is attributable to hospitalisation and surgery.  Subsequent follow up studies will include interventions to try and address any significant disruptions identified here in order to reduce the impact of kidney donation on the donors.</summary>
