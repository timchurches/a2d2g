  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 1 clinical trial examining the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      of escalating doses of the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 in patients with advanced
      malignancies including solid tumors, lymphomas, leukemias and multiple myeloma. By inhibiting
      proteasomes NPI-0052 prevents the breakdown of proteins involved in signal transduction,
      which blocks growth and survival in cancer cells.</summary>
