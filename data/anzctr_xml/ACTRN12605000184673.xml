  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project aims to help people who would like to have more control over how much alcohol they drink by improving how they manage feelings of craving for alcohol. An 8-week delay wait group will act as a control for the single treatment condition. The treatment program is based on Elaborated Intrusion Theory, recently published by the project's Chief Investigator. Its primary focus is on craving reduction and management utilising techniques designed to interrupt, prevent and manage the intrusive thoughts/images associated with cravings. The program also utilises other empirically validated techniques such as motivational interviewing, mindfulness meditation, thought distraction, competing tasks/imagery and cogntive behavioural strategies. The treatment program involves 9 hours of individual therapy contact delivered over 6 sessions.</interventions>
