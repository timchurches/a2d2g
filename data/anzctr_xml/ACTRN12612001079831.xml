  <interventions>
    <interventions>Community jury (CJ) members interact, question experts and reflect on information. CJ members will convene on Day 1 for expert interaction about the pros and cons of prostate cancer testing. Experts from Urology and Evidence-based Medicine will hold a seminar session (approximately 1 hour each) after which participants will have an opportunity to ask questions before the next expert seminar. Both seminars will occur over a three hour period to allow for questions and answers and a short break. After both presentations a facilitator will assist the participants to reflect on the evidence and consider further questions that will be put to the experts in a panel forum in the afternoon. Overnight, participants will return to their homes to reflect on the information provided. Clarification of any further questions will occur on Day 2. Participants will be asked to form a consensus (majority decision) about whether to undertake prostate cancer screening; however each participants decision will be recorded for data collection. Participants will be requested to complete the post-assessment questionnaire after deliberations on Day 2.</interventions>
    <comparator>After completion of the pre-assessment questionnaire, participants in this group will be distributed information packs about prostate cancer screening. Brochures will be sourced from organisations such as the Cancer Council Australia and Australian Prostate Cancer Collaboration. Participants will be recontacted on Day 2 and asked to complete the post-assessment questionnaire over the phone.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Knowledge and attitudes towards testing for prostate cancer
A short survey comprising both quantitative and qualitative questions was developed for the study. It will be administered at 3 time points to identify changes or maintenance to participants knowledge and attitudes towards testing for prostate cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Pre-assessment, post-assessment and 3-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Salient information necessary for men to have informed consent
Community jury members will be asked to reflect on the information provided by the experts and discuss the information within the group. Participants will be asked for both their individual opinions and for a jury consensus regarding the most relevant information for men to know before deciding about whether they wished to be tested for prostate cancer. This data will be qualitative.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2. Post-assessment community jury members only</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Hypothetical recommendations for prostate cancer testing.
This data will be collected using a consensus jury process and is qualitative. The jury will be asked to deliberate about hypothetical recommendations to be made to a Health Minister about prostate cancer testing (i.e., whether it should be government funded, promoted to community members, age recommendations, etc).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-assessment of community jury members only</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited via print and radio media. A brief inclusion questionnaire will be administered over the telephone (age and cancer status) and the first 30 eligible participants will be invited to attend a 2 hour information session where further explanation of the study will be provided and consent requested. After consent, the pre-assessment questionnaire will be distributed to participants and completed immediately. Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups using opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using opaque envelopes containing the randomised group name will be distributed to the participants after pre-assessment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Healthy men who are tested for prostate cancer are usually not informed of the potential harms of the screening process, such as overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The balance of benefits and harms in screening depends on individual risks and values, and prior research suggested men currently appear inadequately informed. This pilot study will use a randomised controlled trial to investigate the use of Community Jury (a jury who undergo 2 days of expert information, discussion and reflection) compared with a standard information group to investigate men's knowledge and attitudes towards prostate cancer testing. In additiion the Community Jury will be asked to recommend hypothethical policy issues regarding testing for prostate cancer in healthy men.</summary>
