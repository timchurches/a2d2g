  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eleven septic patients critical illness patients were enrolled in this prospective study.  Peripheral blood was drawn every four hours from 2 p.m. on their first ICU day up to 24 hrs. Plasma levels of melatonin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured by radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Message RNA levels of circadian genes, Cry-1 and Per-2, were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.</interventions>
