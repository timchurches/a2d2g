  <interventions>
    <interventions>The single session of high-intensity endurance interval training protocol will consist of 4 bouts of 4 minutes (4X4) at 90-95% HRmax with 3 min of active recovery at 50-60% HRmax.  The training intervention will start with a standardized 10-min warm-up and will end with a 3-min cool-down period at a self-selected intensity. The acute training sessions will be conducted outdoor by an exercise physiologist, on an athletic track in dry, windless weather conditions with a temperature about 15-20 degrees. Subjects will be trained in groups. After a baseline assessment subjects will be randomly assigned morning training   that started performing the high intensity interval training protocol at 8.00 am or evening training  that started performing the high intensity interval training protocol at 8.00 pm. Both groups will be blinded about the aim of the study. Adherence will be monitored registering the attendance of players during each training session</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Autonomic control, assessed by heart rate variability (via beat-to-beat heart rate monitor).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Heart rate variability measurements will be performed at rest, before, after 12 and 24 hours the high-intensity endurance interval training protocol.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep quality, assessed using actigraphy (worn for one full night's sleep at each timepoint).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The sleep data will be recorded the night before and the two nights after the high-intensity endurance interval training protocol.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Salivary Cortisol Concentration</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurement of salivary cortisol secretion will be performed before, at the end of the training session and after 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min the completion of the high-intensity endurance interval training protocol.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The profile of mood states will be assessed using a 32 items questionnaire which reflects an individuals mood on five primary dimensions (depression, fatigue, vigour, tension and anger). Subjects will complete the POMS data will be analysed for each specific dimension and an energy index will be calculated as vigour-fatigue and used to monitor changes in energy balance.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects have to complete the questionnaire before and after 12 and 24 hours  the completion of the high-intensity endurance interval training protocol.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The high frequency of training imposed ensures that adaptive effects are cumulative and incomplete recovery from frequent training can make the stress-related side effects cumulative as well. For this reason, the day-to-day distribution of training intensity may be a crucial variable to effectively balance positively and negative stress effects so that performance development is achieved without stagnation or overtraining. High Intenisty Interval Training is a type of protocol that is physically demanding and it does not allow a complete recovery after training. Despite his long-term effects are well established, no studies were conducted for evaluating the influence of the time of the day of this training on I) autonomic control; II) sleep quality;  III) mood states IV) cortisol concentration.</summary>
