  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention to be evaluated is 'culturally adapted physiotherapy assessment and treatment'. This intervention arm will be delivered by the physiotherapist who developed the culturally adapted pain management physiotherapy protocols from extensive qualitative enquiry, clinical expertise and review of the literature. This treating physiotherapist has a Bachelor of Physiotherapy, a Masters of Manual Therapy and ten years of clinical practice. Participants randomised to this intervention arm will attend a combination of group therapy sessions (approximately two hours duration, once a week, for 6 weeks) and up to 4 individualised physiotherapy sessions of 30 minute duration, until treatment conclusion at 3 months. The group sessions will be facilitated by a bilingual health educator and conducted at a local community venue that is accessible by patients from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The individual physiotherapy sessions will be delivered by the same physiotherapist and with the assistance of an interpreter as required.  

The program content is based on current evidence based guidelines for the management of chronic pain that aim to improve patients physical and socio-occupational functioning using CBT principles. In our trial, evidence based pain management content has been adapted to reflect the beliefs, values and behaviours of the three communities of interest. This has included the following components:
- Locating educational material within the unique explanatory model of disease held by each community 
- Modifying the educational materials to suit the language and reflect the health literacy of each community
- Using culturally appropriate examples and metaphors for problem solving and activity pacing
- Delivering exercise interventions using culturally specific examples such as traditional dance components
- Locating interventions in familiar and accessible settings
- Emphasising traditional and ethnoculturally relevant coping strategies such as the use of prayer, natural remedies and spiritual relaxation strategies
- Involving family or community members in goal setting and skill implementation
Patients will be given a log book to complete to evaluate compliance with the program content. 

The individual sessions will be tailored by the physiotherapist to suit the specific needs of the patient, following a culturally informed assessment protocol. The assessment will explore cultural beliefs and values, degree of alignment with ethnocultural community, spiritual domains and extracting the patient's explanatory model of illness. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group in this trial is 'evidence informed usual care'.  Patients allocated to this treatment arm will receive treatment delivered by a physiotherapist who has not been trained in the culturally adapted assessment or treatment protocols used in this trial. Importantly, all treating physiotherapists will have over two years of clinical experience and will attend a training session familiarising them with evidence based guidelines for the management of chronic pain, including CBT approaches, prior to commencing the trial. This session will incorporate concepts including explaining mechanisms of pain, goal setting, ergonomics, pacing, flare-up management, active coping strategies and exercise prescription for chronic pain. 

The mode of delivery of the treatment (individual or group) is at the discretion of the therapist and what is usual practice for the specific community at each site. All participants will have access to professional health interpreting services to facilitate therapy sessions if required and will be delivered in a hospital outpatient setting. Physiotherapists will be able to use their clinical judgement to determine the specific dose and type of treatment for each patient according to their assessment. A maximum of 10 sessions of physiotherapy, of up to 1 hour duration (as needed), over the 3-month intervention period will be set to ensure comparability. The key distinguishing feature between the two interventions is the addition of cultural adaptation assessment and treatment. Treating physiotherapists will be asked to complete a treatment diary to allow adherence to the evidence based care to be established

    <concealment>The randomisation schedule will be prepared by an independent investigator not involved in participant recruitment or the delivery of interventions. Labelled pieces of paper with the intervention arm will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes according to the random sequence. The envelopes will be labelled with a participant number according to their entry sequence in the study. The envelopes will be managed by a central administrative officer at one site and kept in a secure location. This officer will be contacted once a participant is consented and will be responsible for allocating to the treatment arm and arranging an initial appointment with the appropriate physiotherapist.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple random allocation will be used to allocate participants into each group. A computer generated sequence with a 1:1 allocation ratio will be used for each ethnocultural community to ensure equal numbers of Assyrian, Mandaean and Vietnamese participants are included in each treatment arm. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). A baseline table (descriptive statistics and frequencies) will compare the demographic and clinical characteristics between the two arms. An independent samples t-test will be used to determine the significance of any differences between the two groups at baseline. Data for feasibility will be analysed using descriptive statistics. The percentage of participants who (1) meet the inclusion criteria, (2) agree to be randomised, (3) complete the intervention and (4) attend the follow-up assessment will be calculated. Feasibility will be measured as (1) the number of sessions attended by each participant, (2) number of drop-outs in each group, (3) proportion of participants recruited from the total number screened, and (4) the number of home exercise sessions completed. Acceptability of the novel protocol will be measured using the CSQ-8 and satisfaction between groups assessed using an independent samples t-test. 

To determine trends of effectiveness a between groups comparison for the change in each secondary outcome measure over time will be analysed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Repeated measures ANOVA will be used with factors of intervention (usual care/culturally adapted intervention) and time (pre-intervention/post-intervention). Intention to treat analysis will be used and a will be set at 0.05. The data will be used to generate between group means and variances to inform a future RCT.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary aim: 
The aim of this project is to pilot a culturally adapted physiotherapy assessment and treatment approach for use with three CALD communities living in Australia and contrast it with usual evidence based physiotherapy care. This project will seek to identify aspects of trial design that may need to be modified in a larger RCT. This includes establishing community acceptance and satisfaction with the novel treatment approaches and determining community willingness to participate in randomised research. It will also generate outcome data that will be used for sample size estimates and predicting the magnitude of treatment effects for a future clinical trial. 

Hypothesis 
It is hypothesised that the culturally adapted approaches will be well accepted by participants and significantly more effective at improving function, burden of suffering and patient adherence, when compared to usual care. 

Proposed research design
Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial. Two group pre-test, post-test design. 

Methods:
Potential participants will be identified from physiotherapy wait-lists and assessed to ascertain eligibility for trial inclusion. Those who meet the inclusion criteria and consent to participate will be randomly assigned to either the culturally adapted physiotherapy treatment or evidence based usual physiotherapy care. 
The culturally adapted physiotherapy treatment approach will be a combination of group physiotherapy education and exercise, and individual treatment. Participants allocated to this treatment arm will attend a group session for two hours a week, for six weeks and up to four individual sessions over three months with a qualified physiotherapist. 
The control group is evidence based usual care and will include treatment by a qualified physiotherapist who has not been trained in cultural adaptation methods. Participants randomised to this treatment arm will attend up to ten physiotherapy sessions that incorporate evidenced based physiotherapy management, over three months. 
Data that will help determine the feasibility of future trials will be collected including recruitment rates, drop-out rates, adherence and patient satisfaction will be collected at three months. Physical performance outcomes (six minute walk distance and the number of sit to stands performed in 1 minute) and pain related questionnaires (Brief Pain Inventory, Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self-Measure, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale) will collected at pre and post treatment to inform treatment efficacy. </summary>
