  <interventions>
    <interventions>AKP-11 is a small molecule entity with anti-inflammatory activity. The test item will be administered via topical as a 3% formulation to the healthy volunteers (single dose) and the subjects with the mild to moderate psoriasis (multiple dose, once a day for up to 28 days). The drug will be administered at clinical unit's site. The 16 subjects will receive the active.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part A: The determination of the safety and tolerability of AKP-11 administration to healthy volunteers. The evaluation will include brief physical examination, vital signs, triplicate 12-lead ECGs, blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory testing, blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments, review of concomitant medications and adverse events (AE) before and after drug administration.
</outcome>
