  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Deoxycholic acid, or deoxycholate, is a naturally occurring bile acid produced by the liver as one of several end products of sterol metabolism.  In the human body, deoxycholate serves to solubilise dietary fats and facilitate their absorption.
ATX-101 (sodium deoxycholate) is being developed by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals as a promising non-surgical treatment modality for several conditions characterised by unwanted or excessive fat deposition including, but not limited to, lipomas, lipodystrophy in patients with HIV infection, submental fat deposits (double chin) and other conditions for which liposuction or surgery are the current treatments. These surgeries are associated with the known risks of anaesthesia, infection, bleeding, bruising and scarring; the possibility of poor outcome, and the expected discomfort and down-time for the patient.  Given the risks, which are well-established and documented, the growing popularity of these procedures is testament to the psychological importance of self image and to the benefit realised by subjects who seek them. The need for an approved, legitimate and minimally invasive medicinal product for reduction of localised fat deposits is substantiated by the significant and growing popularity of Lipostabil® and other unapproved extemporaneous mixtures of phosphatidylcholine/deoxycholate (PC/DC).
The objectives of this study are (1) to determine the safety and tolerability of ATX-101 injections at three concentrations relative to placebo; and (2) to evaluate the potential efficacy of ATX-101, relative to placebo, in reducing submental fat and thereby achieve improvement as judged by the Investigator and participant.</summary>
