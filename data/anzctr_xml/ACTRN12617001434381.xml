  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will observe recovery of walking ability after stroke. Participants' walking ability will be classified using the Functional Ambulation Category at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20 and 26 weeks post-stroke. The TWIST algorithm combines clinical assessments of trunk control and lower limb muscle strength in order to predict when a patient will recover independent walking. The algorithm was previously developed in a sample of 40 patients. This study will validate the algorithm by seeing whether it correctly predicts the recovery of independent walking in an independent and larger sample of patients.</interventions>
    <comparator>The accuracy of TWIST algorithm predictions will be compared to the accuracy of therapists' predictions.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The planned sample size is 240 patients. Allowing for attrition, the sample size available for analysis is estimated to be 200 patients. With this sample size, we estimate that there will be at least 20 patients in each outcome group (based on the week that independent walking was regained after stroke). This is sufficient for analysis with a Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT). First, a hypothesis-free cluster analysis will be used to categorise patients based on their primary outcome (week they achieved independent walking after stroke). All baseline clinical and demographic variables, lower limb motor-evoked potential (MEP) status, therapy dose, and falls, will be entered into the CaRT analysis, to determine which factors best predict the primary outcome categories. The results of the CaRT analysis will be used to validate the TWIST algorithm, which is a clinical decision tree for predicting the week at which a patient will recover independent walking after stroke. Baseline clinical and demographic variables, lower limb MEP status, therapy dose, and falls, will be also entered into separate analyses, to determine which factors best predict the secondary outcomes of FAC value at six months post-stroke and discharge destination.

Therapists will be asked 1 week post-stroke to predict whether each participant will recover independent walking by 6 months post-stroke, and if so, at what time point. The accuracy of therapists' predictions will be compared to the TWIST algorithm's predictions to determine whether the algorithm performs as well as, or better than, therapists' clinical judgement. Secondary analyses will explore whether the accuracy of therapist predictions varies depending on the therapists' confidence and experience levels, and depending on patient factors such as age and stroke severity.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a leading cause of long-term adult disability. The most common rehabilitation goal after stroke is to be able to walk again. However, of those initially unable to walk, only 60-70% recover the ability to walk independently by 6 months. Predicting the recovery of walking after stroke may assist clinicians, patients and their families to set realistic and attainable goals during rehabilitation and to make more informed decisions around discharge planning.  Decisions around whether a patient is able to return to their own home after the stroke or whether they need to move into a residential care facility are often based on the ability to walk independently. 

Our research group has recently developed the TWIST (Time to Walk Independently after Stroke Trial) algorithm that enables a clinician, at 1 week after stroke, to predict not only whether an individual patient will walk independently, but when they will achieve this.  The algorithm correctly predicted time to walk independently for 92% of patients. The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate and validate the TWIST algorithm in a larger patient sample.</summary>
