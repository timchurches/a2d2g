  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pictures were taken in 3 situations on the same session: 1. with the attention deviated by a memory test without the volunteers knowing what was going on; 2. without the attention deviated and 3. with the attention deviated by the same memory test but now with the volunteers knowing the procedure. The pictures were then analysed by the Software of Postural Evaluation (SAPO). The memory test consisted of 10 cards in which there were a a line of different colored circles and they had to memorize the sequency of the colored circles for 15 seconds and them say the order of the colors without looking at the cards, one at a time. Three minutes after the memory test began the pictures were taken.</interventions>
    <comparator>A person with the attention deviated unconsciously, conciously and without the attention deviated, using the Software of Postural Evaluation (SAPO) to evaluate postural changes. All patients underwent the same process</comparator>
