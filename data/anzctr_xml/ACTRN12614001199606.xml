  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part A:	This part of the study is a single dose escalating design to examine the safety and tolerability of respirable doses of approximately 10 microgram, 50 microgram and 250 microgram of inhaled LTB4 and select a safe and biologically active dose for Part B.
Three treatment groups (six subjects per group) will be administered a single dose of LTB4 (IP in liquid form, inhaled via nebulizer) in a dose escalation design. 
Part B:	The second part of the study is a multiple dose design to examine the safety and tolerability of the dose selected in Part A in bronchiectasis patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). In addition, this part of the study will evaluate the effect of inhaled LTB4 on neutrophil recruitment,  C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and bacterial load in chronically infected patients. 
The dose selected will be administered to 12 chronically infected bronchiectasis patients, twice-daily, for 15 days (Day 15 morning dose only).
Subjects in Part A of the study were monitored during their single IP inhalation, Patients in Part B were trained on the correct use of the PARI nebulizer and then continued to inhale the IP at home. A diary as well as the number of returned IP vials was used to confirm correct inhalation at home.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1)To assess the safety and tolerability of inhaled LTB4 in healthy subjects administered as a single respirable dose which has an estimated lung exposure of 10 microgram, 50 microgram and 250 microgram.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability and Pharmacodynamics (what the study drug does to thebody) of LTB4. This study is conducted in healthy men and women to find out what is a safe, tolerable dose of the study drug and to determine its effect on blood cells.  The results of this part of the study will lead to a second part in which we will test the safe, tolerable dose determined in this study in patients with the lung disease bronchiectasis (a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred) who are chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a bacterial infection).</summary>
