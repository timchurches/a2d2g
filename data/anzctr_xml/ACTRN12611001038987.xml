  <interventions>
    <interventions>PART A: Eight healthy subjects will be assigned to each of 6 sequential dose treatment groups; each receiving a single oral dose of either 5, 25, 100, 200, 400, a 'potential panel of less than or equal to 800mg' of BMS-929075 or placebo. The exact dose for the 'potential dose panel' will be based upon the safety and pharmacokinetic analysis from the previous dose panels.  
Based on exposures from these subjects, the subjects given the 200mg dose (treatment group 4) and 400mg dose (treatment group 5) will remain in the clinic for further dosing.
Treatment Group 1: subjects receive a single oral dose of 5mg BMS-929075 or placebo.
Treatment Group 2: subjects receive a single oral dose of 25mg BMS-929075 or placebo.
Treatment Group 3: subjects receive a single oral dose of 100mg BMS-929075 or placebo.
Treatment Group 4: subjects receive a single oral dose of 200mg BMS-929075 or placebo, then a second 200mg oral dose of BMS-929075 or placebo with a high fat meal.
Treatment Group 5: subjects receive a single oral dose of 400mg BMS-929075 or placebo, then 100mg Ritonavir orally the night of Day 4 and a second 25mg oral dose of BMS-929075 or placebo with 100mg Ritonavir orally on Day 5.   
Treatment Group 6: subjects receive a single oral dose of less than or equal to 800mg BMS-929075 or placebo.

PART B: Eight healthy subjects will be assigned to each of 6 sequential dose treatment groups; each receiving multiple oral doses of either 5, 25, 100, 200, 400, a 'potential panel of less than or equal to 800mg' of BMS-929075 or placebo. The exact dose for the 'potential dose panel' will be based upon the safety and pharmacokinetic analysis from the previous dose panels.
Treatment Group 1: subjects assigned to receive oral dose of 5mg BMS-929075 or placebo daily for 14 days.
Treatment Group 2: subjects assigned to receive oral dose of 25mg BMS-929075 or placebo daily for 14 days.
Treatment Group 3: subjects assigned to receive oral dose of 100mg BMS-929075 or placebo daily for 14 days.
Treatment Group 4: subjects assigned to receive oral dose of 200mg BMS-929075 or placebo daily for 14 days.
Treatment Group 5: subjects assigned to receive oral dose of 400mg BMS-929075 or placebo daily for 14 days.
Treatment Group 6: subjects assigned to receive oral dose of less than or equal to 800mg BMS-929075 or placebo daily for 14 days.</interventions>
