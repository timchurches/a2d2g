    <interventions>This is a single-centre, study using blood stage malaria infected red blood cells inoculum challenge in order to characterize the infectivity of the in vitro expanded Plasmodium falciparum QIMR3D7Pf in healthy volunteers. The study will be conducted in 2 individuals. Each participant in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~1,800 viable Plasmodium falciparum-in vitro infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously. On an outpatient basis, participants will be monitored daily prior to detection of parasites or morning (AM) and evening (PM) (once PCR positive for presence of malaria parasites) from day 3 to day 7 for adverse events and the unexpected early onset of symptoms, signs or parasitological evidence of malaria. On the day designated for commencement of treatment, as determined by qPCR results (expected to be Day 7), participants will be admitted to the study unit and confined for safety monitoring and antimalarial treatment. The threshold for commencement of treatment will be when PCR quantification is confirmed to be approximately =1,000 parasites/mL when the participants will be administered antimalarial treatment. If clinical evidence of malaria (the onset of clinical features of malaria) occurs or PCR quantification of =1,000 parasites/mL is detected before day 7 morning, allocated treatment will begin at this time. Following treatment, participants will be followed up as inpatients for at least 36 hours, to ensure tolerance of the therapy and clinical response, then if clinically well on an outpatient basis for monitoring of, safety and clearance of malaria parasites via PCR.
