    <interventions>Behaviour - Early activity and mobilisation

Experimental: Early activity and Mobilisation intervention - Patients will be assessed daily by an ICU physiotherapist using the ICU Mobility Scale (IMS) to determine the dosage and type of active exercises the patient will receive, using the early activity and mobilisation protocol. This protocol is hierarchical, with the objective of each intervention session beginning with the highest level of activity possible for the longest time possible, which then steps down to lower levels of activity if the patient fatigues. The intervention will be administered on all days in which the patient is admitted to ICU during the index hospitalisation, censored at 28days after.

No Intervention: Standard of care - The control group will receive standard care from physiotherapy staff not involved in delivering the intervention. We have previously established that standard care in Australia for a patient receiving prolonged IMV (control group intervention) frequently involves no active exercise out of bed.


Behaviour: Early activity and mobilisation
The early activity and mobilisation intervention is comprised of exercises based on a reproducible, physiological approach using both strength and functional activities

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of early activity and mobilisation during
      prolonged IMV on the composite outcome "days alive and at home to day 180". The effect of the
      intervention on mortality, physical, cognitive and Psychological function at 180 days, as
      well as cost-effectiveness of the intervention, will also be evaluated. The study will also
      explore process of care measures and baseline physiology and ICU mobility outcomes.

      The hypothesis is that, in ICU patients expected to require prolonged IMV, early activity and
      mobilisation increases the number of days alive and at home to day 180 when compared with
      standard care.</summary>
