Treatment: devices: Humidification
Fisher and Paykel Healthcare MR880 humidifier + HC211 flow source. 37/44 Humidification (37oC at 100% relative humidity, 44 mg of water per litre of air, 25 litres per min initial flow rate). The patients will be instructed to use humidification from day 1 of the radiotherapy course as much as is practical; the preference is for continuous overnight humidification plus maximal use throughout the day.Humidification will continue throughout treatment until at least week 8 after the commencement of radiotherapy and will cease when the CTCAE mucositis (clinical exam) score becomes less than grade 2, or at the week 16 assessment, whichever is earliest.

Other interventions: Standard of Care
SOC: institutional standard of care for the management of mucositis. SOC will be defined by each participating institution and be kept consistent at that institution for the duration of the study. In general, SOC will consist of rinsing with 50:50 salt bicarbonate of soda mouthwash; benzydamine mouthwash; appropriate analgesic, antimicrobial and antifungal protocols etc.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a two arm randomised phase III trial which will evaluate prospectively the benefits
      of humidification in patients receiving radiotherapy / chemoradiation for head and neck
      cancer. The intent of humidification is to moisturise the mucosa. The rationale for the use
      of humidification with radiotherapy can be considered an extension of the general principle
      of moist wound care in wound management.</summary>
