  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), blood is passed through a multi-lumen extracorporeal circuit that includes access, filter, return, effluent and replacement/dialysate components.  Although anticoagulants, such as heparin and citrate, are commonly used, clotting of extracorporeal circuit and filter commonly occurs leading to shortened therapy duration or a failure to delivery therapy.  In addition, inadequate treatment leads to circuit loss (including increased blood loss), increased costs (of circuits) and a loss of nursing time.  The relationship between circuit pressures and artificial kidney failure in CRRT remains unclear.

In response, we wish to perform an analysis of CRRT filter and circuit pressures in order to determine the patterns of change associated with artificial kidney failure.  Specifically, we wish to evaluate the relative contribution of access circuit, filter, effluent, return circuit and trans-membrane (across the filter) pressures on the lifespan of the artificial kidney.  In this pilot investigation we feel that 100 CRRT circuits will provide sufficient quantity of data to aid in the description of patterns of circuit pressure changes occurring during CRRT.  Significantly, the findings of this study would provide insight into the dynamic changes of circuit pressures during CRRT, and defined the patterns of artificial kidney failure in CRRT.  Such information will inform future prospective investigations aimed at improving the care of critically ill patients requiring CRRT.  We plan to publish the audit findings in peer-reviewed critical care or artificial kidney injury journals.  Participant anonymity and confidentiality will be preserved as only aggregated findings will be presented or reported.
