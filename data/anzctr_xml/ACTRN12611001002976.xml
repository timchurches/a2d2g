These will be determined from the results of the survey, clinical assessment and pathology testing.
These criteria are based on previous studies and are used to minimise confounding and drug interactions that may interfere with the intervention.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Having fulfilled all inclusion criteria, written consent will be obtained from each participant before recruiting into the study. Each participant will then attend the BIHS clinic to be randomized. Prior to attending the clinic, participants will be mailed a food frequency questionnaire to obtain information on usual dietary intake 
Given the small sample size, block randomisation will be done to ensure equal number of participants in treatment and placebo arms of the trials. Allocation will be concealed by phoning to the central co-ordinating office. Participants will be randomly allocated to active (30mg/day zinc gluconate) or control tablets/capsules, the latter being a tablet/capsule identical in appearance to the intervention. Following randomisation participants will receive the intervention or placebo along with a BIHS pathology form to have the following measured: FBC, GTT, Serum Zinc, Serum insulin, HbA1C, Lipid Profile, Blood urea and serum creatinine, and CRP. All participants will also receive the Australian Diabetic Association guide to health eating and lifestyle.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Zinc has been shown to improve blood glucose levels and insulin resistance in diabetic subjects in a small number of animal and human observation and interventional studies. (2-9)To extend the results of these studies, we propose to perform a pilot, double blinded randomised controlled trial in an at risk pre-diabetic adult population in  Bangladesh aged 30-65 years to determine if zinc supplementation can reduce blood glucose and insulin resistance compared to placebo over a six months period. 

Aims
To perform a pilot double blinded randomized controlled trial in an at-risk pre-diabetic population aged 30-65 years to determine if zinc supplementation will:
1.	reduce impaired glucose tolerance levels 
2.	reduce insulin resistance
3.	increase insulin sensitivity
4.	increase pancreatic beta cell function

Hypotheses
1.	In a pilot double blinded randomised controlled trial of an at-risk pre-diabetic population of those 30-65 years, zinc supplementation (30mg/day) will decrease fasting serum glucose by 5% over six months compared to a placebo treatment.

2.	In a pilot double blinded randomised controlled trial of an at-risk pre-diabetic population of those 30-65 years, zinc supplementation (30mg/day) will decrease insulin resistance by 5% over six months compared to a placebo treatment.

3.	In a pilot double blinded randomised controlled trial of an at-risk pre-diabetic population of those 30-65 years, zinc supplementation (30mg/day) will increase insulin sensitivity by 5% over six months compared to a placebo treatment.

4.	In a pilot double blinded randomised controlled trial of an at-risk pre-diabetic population of those 30-65 years, zinc supplementation (30mg/day) will increase pancreatic beta cell function by 5% over six months compared to a placebo treatment.</summary>
