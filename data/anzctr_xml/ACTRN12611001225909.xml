  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: The pre-operative eye will receive a drop of sterile glucose (10microlitres),  every 5 minutes for one hour prior to planned elective vitrectomy. 
6 patients will receive saline eye drops and serve as controls.
The next 2 patients will receive 10% glucose drops.
If no adverse effects are observed then the next 6 patients will receive 25%
glucose.
If &gt; 2 patient develop more than mild toxicity then we will revert back to 10 %
glucose.
If = 2 patient develop toxicity at this dose the next 6 patients will receive 50%
glucose.
If &gt; 2 patients develop more than mild toxicity we will revert back to 25%
glucose.
If patients develop toxicity at 10% glucose, the study will be ceased.
Outcome: Intraoperatively, as part of the routine vitrectomy, a 100 micolitre sample of vitreous will be collected within 30 minutes of the last drop instilled. This has no effect on the outcome of the procedure. The sample will be sent for glucose concentration analysis.</interventions>

      <outcome>Statistical Analysis
The mean vitreous glucose concentration in non-diabetics has been reported as 3.5 mmol
(SD 1.8mmol)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The statistical analysis has an ANOVA model with 3 groups: control; 25% glucose; 50%
glucose. (Note that the 10% glucose concentration is included for dose escalation safety
purposes but cannot be included in the analysis)
Topical Glucose &amp; Vitrectomy, Casson R Protocol Version 2 7th Sept 2010 4
We estimate a vitreous glucose concentration of 3.5 in the control group, 5 mmol in the
25% group and 6.5mmo in the 50% group.
Using Stata fpower function to calculate the sample size based on an estimated pooled
standard deviation of 1.8 and the difference between the largest and smallest mean of
3mmol, we require 6 patients in each group for 78.5% power at alpha value of 0.1.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine whether a brief period of topical glucose application to the eye can transiently elevate the vitreous glucose concentration.   

This is a pilot study designed to provide motivation (or not) to proceed to further research. It would be inappropriate to proceed without a pilot study of this nature

We aim to proceed to a human trial using topical glucose as a neurorecovery agent in glaucoma patients. However, before proceeding to this trial we need to establish that topical glucose can elevate the vitreous glucose concentration.  
This is a Phase I type study in the sense that glucose eye drops have not been previously used therapeutically and we are not assessing efficacy. But  it differs from a classic Phase I study in the sense that we are not seeking to assess the dose at which the glucose becomes unacceptably toxic; however, we believe that a modified dose escalation strategy would provide the optimal safety and still provide the necessary vitreous concentration data for statistical analysis.</summary>
