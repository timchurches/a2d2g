    <interventions>A randomised double-blind clinical trial comparing ultraviolet B radiation (treatment) with ultraviolet A radiation (control), given twice weekly for 12 weeks.                                                               UVB will start at 400mJ/cm2 (with 20% increments) in the Pacific participants, and start at 200 mJ/cm2 (with 5% increments) in the European participants. UVA treatments will start with 1 J/cm2 the first week (with 1 J/cm2 weekly increases to 6 J/cm2 and maintained) in Pacific participants, and start at 0.5 J/cm2 (with 0.5 J/cm2 weekly increases up to 3 J/cm2 and maintained) in European participants. UVB increases vitamin D (in contrast with UVA which is the control).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study hypothesis is that UVB, which increases body levels of vitamin D, when given to vitamin D deficient people in winter when the sun is weak, will lower blood pressure and insulin resistance, and improve cardiac function, compared with UVA which has no effect on vitamin D synthesis.
All participants, both interviewers and myself will be blind to intervention. The UV is given by a nurse at a private dermatology clinic. She, the dermatologist at the clinic and the 3 members of an independent data monitoring committee, are the only people who know the allocation of the UV; plus a data entry person working for the data entry committee who keeps the baseline and follow-up bood results  and who has no contact with participants.</summary>
