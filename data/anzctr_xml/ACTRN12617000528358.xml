  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention = therapeutic singing groups (these groups include 30 mins vocal/speech exercises and warmup, 60 mins singing songs, 30 minutes socialisation over tea/coffee)

Arm 1 - weekly 120 minute singing groups for 12 months - delivered by allied health professional (music therapist, speech pathologist, allied health assistant)  

Arm 2 - monthly 120 minute singing groups for 12 months - delivered by community musician volunteers

As this is not a randomised trial, participants who agree to participate can elect to join a weekly or monthly singing group or be a control participant.

Mode of delivery - face to face group sessions 

Location where the intervention occurs - community venues

Intervention adherence will be measured using attendance records.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control groups:
These groups are the same length as the intervention groups (120 mins) and are run by volunteers through Parkinson's Victoria. Attendance is recorded for all groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Parkinsons disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, incurable, and disabling neurological condition. In addition to the many physical symptoms at least 75% of people with PD experience impaired speech production and various mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. This mixed-methods study aims to explore the experience of group singing for people with PD and examine the effects of long-term participation on communication and health outcomes. We will assess speech and voice function, speech-related quality of life, and communication participation, as well as wellbeing outcomes such as depression, anxiety and fatigue for both participants with PD and their caregivers.</summary>
