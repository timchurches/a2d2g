  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Victorian Comprehensive Parkinsons Program (VCPP) is an alternative care model that involves an inter-professional team approach to the management of the complex array of motor and non motor symptoms that occur with PD.Treatment aims to limit the rate and level of progression and to provide strategies to enable people to compensate for their impairments so that people with PD and others in their lives can enjoy the highest possible quality of life.
The overall duration of the data collection for the project will be over four years/48 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional care where a typical model of care currently involves a person diagnosed with Parkinson's disease being seen by a general medical practitioner and then referred to a specialist, usually to a neurologist, with short visits on a three or six monthly basis. Specialist care mainly concerns medication.

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment># Participants will be recruited from referrals by general practitioners to the Monash Medical Centre Neurology Department and referrals made to the VCPP. 
# Recruitment will occur after referral to one or other of the services. Thus the study employs a deterministic method of allocation without true randomization (quasi-experimental).
# Patients referred by their community doctor to one service are compared with patients who are referred to the other service. 
#  All patients referred to either service during the study recruitment period will be screened for enrollment
# Those meeting the inclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study.</concealment>
    <sequence># Baseline patient characteristics will be recorded and analyzed to identify any sources of bias or potential confounding factors between the two samples. Recruitment will continue until the required number of participants have commenced into each arm of the study. Referral rate for both services is approximately 5-10/week, and thus, based on our experiences from our previous NPF funded project, it is expected to take approximately 18 months to recruit the required number of patients</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to compare a complex care model, the Victorian Comprehensive Parkinsons Disease Program (VCPP) with usual care (conventional care), to determine which caters best for the complexity and cumulative morbidity over time of people with Parkinsons disease (PD) and at what cost. 

A quasi-experimental trial will be conducted in the Melbourne metropolitan region incorporating an economic analysis alongside the clinical trial. 180 people with PD will be recruited from referrals to the VCPP (intervention group), or to the Monash Medical Centre Neurology Department (control group). 

Participants will be seen at four times (baseline, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years) following recruitment into the study. The long term follow-up is required to encompass the effects of natural deterioration with PD and ageing. In addition, participants will be contacted by telephone at 6 months, 18 months and 30 months to encourage completion of the health service utilization and falls questionnaire.
The primary outcome is quality of life, which will be measured using the PDQ39 form. We will also measure other aspects of impairment, functioning and participation.  The cost analysis will include information on participants  primary health care visits, medication type and usage, hospitalizations and length of stay, episodes of inpatient rehabilitation care and aged care institutional care. This data will be collected using the health service utilization questionnaire and Medicare Australia data.

Optimal management of the complexity of the condition is important to the person with PD and their family, and the detainment of costs is important for health systems (private and public), governing authorities and support organizations. The findings of this report have the potential to determine if the comprehensive care model is more cost effective for management of PD from a health system perspective. The implications would then have the capacity to revolutionize care for people with PD.</summary>
