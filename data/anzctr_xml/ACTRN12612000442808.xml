  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the clinical outcomes and effectiveness of two randomly allocated treatments used to manage acute anterior shoulder dislocations: six weeks of external rotation bracing versus early arthroscopic shoulder stabilisation intervention.  

It is hypothesised that the arthroscopic shoulder stabilisation surgery may lead to better patient outcomes compared with the external rotation bracing on the basis that evidence for external rotation bracing is still emerging and (although promising) has not yet been established with as much rigor as arthroscopic shoulder stabilisation surgery. However, in the absence of substantial differences in patient outcomes, external rotation bracing may be demonstrated to be more cost-effective than surgery.

Outcomes from this study will inform clinical decision making about management for young people with shoulder dislocation.  This study will not only impact clinical practice for this high demand patient group in Queensland, but nationally and internationally due to widespread uncertainty to the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of the (cheaper and more conservative) external rotation bracing in comparison to arthroscopic shoulder stabilisation surgery amongst young patients (16-30 years) who have dislocated their shoulder for the first time.</summary>
