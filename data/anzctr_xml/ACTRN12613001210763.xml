  <interventions>
    <interventions>We aim to conduct the first randomised, controlled trial (RCT) of a dietary intervention for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EOE) in children.

Group 1: Active treatment ,Oral Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) plus elimination diet)
8-12 week treatment with omeprazole (Losec [registered trademark]) for 8-12 weeks plus, four-food elimination diet (strictly avoiding all foods containing cows milk, soy, wheat or egg) during this 8-12 week period (as supervised by paediatric dietitian).  
Participant will undergo gastroscopy and biopsies at the start and end of the treatment period to assess for histological response to the intervention.

Omeprazole dosage amount is as follows: 7.5  9.9 kg: 5mg mane and 10mg nocte, 10.0  14.9 kg:10 mg twice daily, 15.0  19.9 kg:15 mg twice daily, &gt;20 kg: 20 mg twice daily.  Medication will be dispensed at commencement  of the study, after 4 weeks and if participant is currently active on the study at 10 week point also.  Medication will be collected at 4 weeks, and at the follow-up endoscopy to measure compliance.

The treatment period of between 8-12 weeks is determined by the demand on endoscopy hospital bookings.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2: Control treatment (PPI plus alone)
8-12 week treatment with oral omeprazole (Losec [registered trademark] ) for 8-12 weeks. During this 8-12 week period, participants will maintain an unrestricted diet (as supervised by paediatric dietitian).  Participants will undergo gastroscopy and biopsies at the start and end of the treatment period to assess for histological response to the intervention.

Omeprazole dosage amount is as follows: 7.5  9.9 kg: 5mg mane and 10mg nocte, 10.0  14.9 kg:10 mg twice daily, 15.0  19.9 kg:15 mg twice daily, &gt;20 kg: 20 mg twice daily. </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Stage 1: All patients with possible EOE (age 1-18 yrs) undergoing a diagnostic gastroscopy  at any of the four participating hospitals (at Royal Childrens Hospital Melbourne, Monash Medical Centre Melbourne, Childrens Hospital at Westmead Sydney, and Womens and Childrens Hospital Adelaide) will be assessed for inclusion in the study.
Patients undergoing a diagnostic gastroscopy will be assessed for upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including:
* Nausea and vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhoea
* FFT/weight loss
* Dysphagia
* Regurgitation
* Food bolus obstruction
*  Food refusal
Stage 2: Patients will be inclucded in the randomised trial if a diagnosis of EOE was confirmed based on biopsies from the first gastroscopy. Biospies will be analysed by the hospitals anatomical pathologist to assess whether the diagnostic criteria for EOE is confirmed. The diagnosis of EOE is based on the presence of at least 20 mucosal eosinophils/HPF in any of the upper or lower oesophageal biopsies.
NB: Patients who are already avoiding a food prior to the study as part of a known food allergy (e.g. egg or peanut allergy) can still be considered for the study if EOE was diagnosed while avoiding the food (which suggests that the food is not causing the EOE).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants meeting the following criteria will be excluded from the study.
*The patient does not fulfil the histological criteria for EOE (less than 20 mucosal eosinophils/HPF on histology).
* Recent treatment with systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone) or topical or inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone aerosol or viscous budesonide) within 3 months of the gastroscopy.
* Recent or current treatment with omeprazole.
* Patient already on multiple food elimination diet
* Previous failure of elimination diets (as it may skew the data towards non-response)
* Inability to obtain informed consent
* Inability to comply with the prescribed four-food elimination diet or PPI treatment
* Contraindications to gastroscopy or general anaesthesia</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Stage 1 recruitment: All patients with possible EOE undergoing gastroscopy will be recruited through the paediatric gastroenterology units at one of the four hospitals participating in the research study.  
Prior to the patientâ€™s gastroscopy patients/parents will be approached by the research team and invited to participate in the study. Informed written consent will be obtained from all participants/parents.  

Stage 2: If EOE is confirmed on histology, participants/ parents will be approached to be recruited into the second stage of the study.  These participants will be randomised using a web-based central randomisation by computer  randomisation system provided by the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit (CEBU) at RCH. 
Participants will be randomised to either drug plus diet, or drug alone.  The intervention will be open label, and no placebo medication is used.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be performed using a randomisation list generated by a statistician as per the following requirements:
- Randomization ratio is 1:1 active group to control group.
- Block sizes distributed randomly.
- Blocks pre-assigned to stratification factors, i.e. the 4 participating centres. 
- Total anticipated number of patients to be randomized = 98 (based on sample size calculation).
- Randomisation codes sufficient to allow for recruitment of 100 patients in Melbourne and 50 patients in each other centre.

Factors predicting treatment response will be assessed by multivariate analysis (multiple logistic regression). A total of 98 participants required in stage 2 of the study.

The sample size calculation is based on an expected response rate of 60% to the elimination diet plus PPI, compared to 30% to PPI treatment (power 80%, significance level p&lt;0.05). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EOE) is a recently discovered condition which involves allergic inflammation in the oesophagus. This research project aims to conduct the first study of a dietary intervention for the treatment of EOE in children.  As part of the research we also aim to  mechanistic studies into the pathophysiology of this condition. 

This study is being completed in two stages. In Stage 1, children with suspected EOE undergoing gastroscopy will be invited to take part into the study. Only patients with confirmed EOE will progress to stage 2 of the study.

In Stage 2, children with confirmed EOE will be randomly allocated to one of two interventions: four-food elimination diet (avoiding cow's milk, egg, soy and wheat) plus omeprazole, versus omeprazole alone as the control intervention (for 8 -12 weeks in each arm of the study).
