    <interventions>Cohorts 1 and 2: Nivolumab 3mg/kg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, repeated until either of: disease progression, withdrawn consent, unacceptable toxicity or death. Treatment beyond disease progression may occur if clinical benefit agreed upon by treating clinician and study PI and patients performance status is stable.

Cohort 3: Nivolumab 1mg/kg intravenous infusion every 3 weeks x four doses combined with ipilimumab 3mg/kg intravenous infusion every 3 weeks x four doses. After 12 weeks, nivolumab 3mg/kg alone every 2 weeks until disease progression or toxicity, with the possibility of treating beyond progression if clinical benefit decided by treating clinician and patients performance status is stable.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Initially, this study will recruit patients with melanoma brain metastases who have received no prior local treatment for their intracranial metastatic disease and who are asymptomatic (Cohort 1) and in parallel, patients who have been previously treated for their brain metastases, have symptoms, or have concurrent leptomeningeal disease (Cohort 2) will be enrolled to receive nivolumab monotherapy (3mg/kg).

A third group of patients with brain metastases who have received no prior treatment for their metastatic disease and who are asymptomatic to receive combined nivolumab 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3mg/kg (Cohort 3) every 3 weeks for 4 doses, then continuing on nivolumab monotherapy per cohorts 1 and 2. 

Recruitment to cohort 3 will commence once the first 6 patients from cohort 1 have received at least 6 doses of study treatment (equivalent to 12 weeks) and have a satisfactory adverse event record. After this safety assessment, patients will continue to be recruited to this cohort. To minimise bias, treatment allocation to cohort 3 and the remainder of cohort 1 will be assigned by unequal randomisation ratio to achieve an overall balance of 30 patients receiving nivolumab 3 mg/kg (including the 6 patients from cohort 1) and 30 patients receiving the combination treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research project is to test the effectiveness of a drug, called nivolumab, and the combination of nivolumab together with ipilimumab for the treatment of melanoma that has spread to the brain (known as brain metastases.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with melanoma with brain metastases.

Study details
Both drugs are approved treatments for advanced melanoma in Australia and overseas, but there is limited information on the effectiveness of the combination of these drugs in treating melanoma that has spread to the brain. This is a Phase 2 study and will look to evaluate the effectiveness of nivolumab and nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in three patient groups: groups 1 and 3 are melanoma patients with brain metastases that have had no prior localised treatments and no neurological symptoms related to brain metastases, while group 2 are melanoma patients with brain metastases who have had a prior failed local therapy or have current neurological symptoms or have leptomeningeal disease. Groups 1 and 2 will receive intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death. Group 3 will receive nivolumab 1mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 3mg/kg every 3 weeks for 12 weeks then nivolumab monotherapy (3mg/kg every 2 weeks) thereafter. 

Responses to treatment and progression will be regularly monitored until the last patient has been in survival follow-up for 5 years. Tumour and blood samples will also be taken to determine possible predictive markers.</summary>
