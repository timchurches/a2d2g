  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive a single oral dose of OTS167 or placebo on the morning of Day 1.  Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive a single oral dose following an overnight fast from food of at least 10 hours.   Participants in Cohort 3 will receive two doses of OTS167 or placebo under both fed and fasting conditions, separated by a washout period of at least 4 days.  For this study, fasting conditions means following an overnight fast from food of at least 10 hours.  Fed conditions means study drug will be administered within 30 minutes of commencing a high fat, high calorie standard breakfast.
The doses evaluated in this study are listed below.
Cohort 1:0.5 mg or placebo
Cohort 2: 1 mg or placebo
Cohort 3: 2 mg or placebo

Study drug will be administered in cherry syrup to improve palatability.</interventions>

Cohort 3 will use a crossover design, with participants randomised to receive study drug under fed or fasting conditions in one of two sequences.  Participants randomised to placebo will receive placebo in both periods.  A washout period of at least 4 days will separate each period in Cohort 3.  Study drug dose will be escalated with each subsequent cohort.</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Continuous variables, including baseline characteristics, will be summarised by reporting the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Categorical/discrete variables will be summarised using frequency tables showing the number and percentage of participants within a particular category. Unless indicated otherwise, summary statistics will be reported for observed data only. Missing data will not be imputed. If a baseline value is missing, no change from baseline will be calculated. Baseline is defined as the last available observation prior to the first administration of study drug on Day 1 and Day 4.


The number of participants required to achieve the study objectives is not based on statistical considerations.  The number of enrolled participants was agreed by the investigator and sponsor based on safety considerations.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the absorption of the oral form of drug OTS167 in healthy volunteers, and to establish its safety. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are a healthy male or female volunteer aged 45 years or over. 
Study details: All participants will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either the active drug, given in cherry syrup, or cherry syrup alone. This study will recruit participants in three stages. Those recruited to the first two stages will receive one dose on the morning of day 1 of either the active or inactive cherry syrup mixture after fasting for 10 hours (liquid will be permitted). Those recruited to the third stage will receive two separate doses of either the active or inactive cherry syrup mixture at least 4 days apart; once after fasting for 10 hours, and once in a fed state following a high fat, high calorie breakfast. All participants across all stages will have a number of blood samples taken over the 24 hours following each dose, and will be monitored for 4 days for side effects of the drug. It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide further information on the absorption and distribution within the body of this oral formulation of OTS167, which may provide a more tolerable and convenient method of dosing for cancer patients.
