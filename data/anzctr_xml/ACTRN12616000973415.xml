  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants who intend to have a water birth on admission to birth suite will be allocated to a room with water birth facilities and have one-to-one care in labour by a midwife who is credentialed to conduct water births in accordance with evidence-informed guidelines. Women may access water immersion in labour and in the absence of an indication to exit the pool; the woman will proceed to give birth under water.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants who intend to have a land birth on admission to birth suite will be allocated to a room with access to a bath for water immersion but no facilities for water birth. Women will have one-to-one care in labour by a midwife credentialed in water immersion and may use water immersion in the first stage of labour if they wish. Women who use the bath will be asked to exit the bath at the onset of second stage labour and give birth to their babies 'on land' in a position of their choice.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Feasibility outcomes 
Simple descriptive statistics will be used to analyse the feasibility outcomes. Interim reporting of recruitment data will occur monthly. It will be considered feasible to conduct the main study if at least 25% of eligible women are recruited, and at least 50% of women who intend to water birth proceed to give birth under water.

Clinical outcomes
Clinical outcome data will be analysed using StataSE (Version 12) software. Basic descriptive statistics with confidence intervals with be calculated and reported as this feasibility study is not powered for any clinical outcomes.

Survey data 
Survey data will be analysed using univariate statistics in StataSE (Version 12) software. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables, including mean, median, standard deviation, range, and percentages as appropriate. Categorical data will be analysed using Chi square. Thematic analysis of free text responses will also be conducted. The response rate will also be calculated and reported.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Water birth occurs when a baby is born fully submerged in water. There is a lack of strong (Level 1) evidence to conclusively agree on the safety or risk of water birth. We aim to determine if it is possible to run a large study that examines the safety of water birth compared to land birth in women with low-risk pregnancies. In this study, we will test recruitment parameters, research processes, and outcome measures (for mother and baby) to assess the feasibility of a main study. If this study proves feasible and funding is obtained, then we will consider an international study across multiple sites (subject to ethical approval) with the primary purpose of testing safety for babies who are born under water.</summary>
