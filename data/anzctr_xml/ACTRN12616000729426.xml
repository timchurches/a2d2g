  <interventions>
    <interventions>This research project will analyse the response of glucose levels after a predominantly carbohydrate based meal. Forty participants between 12 -30 years of age, with type one diabetes on intensive insulin therapy will be recruited. Participants will be fitted with the Animas G4 continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Insulin dose will be calculated using the standard linear insulin to carb ratio for meals of 20, 50, 100 and 150g of carbohydrate, standardised for % of energy from carbohydrates, fat, protein. The planned meal will be a standard pancake recipe with a sucrose based topping for all four carbohydrate quantities with the carbohydrates coming mostly from flour, sugar and milk. 

Prior to commencement of the study participants will complete a 1 - 2 week run-in period where their control and insulin to carb ratio will be optimised through telephone contact with the diabetes team. They will then attend a short approx half an hour visit to the research department at the hospital to be fitted and explained the CGMS.

The next day following the fitting of the CGMS the participant will then either attend the hospital or researchers will attend the participants home 4 mornings in a row to prepare the study meal, supervise insulin administration and meal consumption. The total required length of including the run in period will be 2 -3 weeks and approximately 1 -2 hours per day. 

Insulin will be administered in their usual way (injection or pump) and sedentary activities and fasting will be undertaken unless food is required for hypoglycaemia in the 5 hours following meal consumption. The CGMS data from this post postprandial period will subsequently be analysed by researchers to determine whether the currently standard practice of using an insulin to carbohydrate ratio is effective across  a range of sized carbohydrate meals.

    <comparator>The study design is a with-in subject, randomised, repeated measure trial. The study involves the provision of test meals given on four consecutive days at breakfast in the same subjects. Each participant will serve as his/her own control.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome of time in range will be analysed using repeated measurements on participants a linear mixed model to take account of the repeated measurements on subjects. The outcome in the model will be the percentage of blood glucose readings for an individual on a given day that are between 4 and 10 mmol/L in the five hour period after the meal. The predictor variable of interest will be the meal type (A  D), which will be included as a factor variable in the model. The model will be fitted using restricted maximum likelihood and a likelihood ratio statistic will be used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the outcome of interested between meal types. If the p-value from the likelihood ratio statistic is less than 0.05 we will examine the Wald statistics to identify where the difference lies. A logistic regression model fitted within a generalised estimating equation framework will be used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the occurance of hypoglycaemic events between the meal types.

Based on data from our previous studies we expect the standard deviation of the difference between two meal types in the percentage of time a subject is within range to be about 40 percent. Therefore 34 subjects will provide the study with approximately 80% power to find a difference of 20 percent between any two meals at the 5% significance level. To allow for missing data due to monitor failure etc. we will recruit 40 participants.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with type one diabetes typically carbohydrate count and use an insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR) to dose their insulin. This ratio assumes a linear relationship between carbohydrate quantities to be consumed and the insulin required to maintain blood sugar levels after a meal. Recent research and reports from families with type 1 diabetes raise the question of the validity of this linear model. This study aims to define the relationship between carbohydrate quantity and the dose of subcutaneous insulin. More specifically, to demonstrate that the current linear ICR approach is too steep resulting in increased events of low blood sugar levels as the carbohydrate content increases.

This research project will analyse the response of blood glucose levels after a predominantly carbohydrate based meal. Forty participants between 12 -30 years of age, with type one diabetes on intensive insulin therapy will be recruited. Participants will be fitted with a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Insulin dose will be calculated using the standard linear ICR using study liquid-meals of 20, 50, 100 and 150g of carbohydrate controlled with similar proportions of fats and protein on four consecutive days (one per day). CGMS data will be analysed to determine whether the relationship between carbohydrate intake and insulin requirements is indeed linear.

It is hoped this study will provide important information in the management of type 1 diabetes in both adults and children. Results will assist in building on planned future studies of trialing a non-linear ICR if the hypothesis is supported. This research will be used in our day to day management of patients and guide the development of clinical guidelines to help minimise the occurrence of hypoglycaemia and blood glucose fluctuations after eating.</summary>
