  <interventions>
    <interventions>Once the participants sign the consent form, a questionnaire that investigate their demographic data: gender, date of birth, height, weight, past medical history, taking medication daily or not to all children. Their caregiver will also be given a questionnaire to retrieve their relationship status, age, education level, annual income, and pressure scale. Children with ADHD will be diagnosed within DSM-V or previous version by experienced paediatric psychiatrists in Australia (western) and Taiwan (eastern) countries. On-line survey link will be given to all children and their caregivers to reported lifestyle pattern investigations together that will consist children diet quality with diet quality index-International; levels of physical activity in weekly with Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children; sleep quality that will complete by their caregivers with Childrens Sleep Habits Questionnaire, CSHQ; children self-reported weekly screening time (smart phone, tablets, laptop, television, e-Reader) and how much they will spend of these devices before one-hour bedtime. And children with ADHD will use Conner 3 Parent Rating Scale Short-Form to assess the disease severity.

    <statisticalmethods>The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare the differences between children with ADHD and children without ADHD on nonparametric variables (gender, levels of physical activity, and number of comorbidities, education level of caregivers, annual income of caregivers). ANOVA will be used to examine lifestyle patterns (dietary, physical activity, sleep quality, screening time), demographic (height, weight, age) differences in children with ADHD and typically developing children. ANOVA will also be used to compare intercultural differences in parametric outcome variables as lifestyle patterns (dietary, physical activity, sleep quality, screening time), demographic (height, weight, age). Structural equation modelling (SEM) or pathway analysis (PA) will be performed to determine the most significant factors among the lifestyle pattern investigations (dietary, levels of physical activity, screening time, sleep quality, education level of caregivers, annual income of caregivers, and pressure of caregivers) that could influence the disease severity and discover interactions between lifestyle pattern in children with ADHD. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background and purpose: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental disorder, which has relatively high prevalence and incidence of comorbidity among children. Medication is usually the first-line treatment for ADHD; however, the adverse effects of medication may cause other medical issues. Healthy lifestyle pattern (diet, physical activities, reducing screening time) may ameliorate disease severity. To discover suitable interventions, comprehensive investigations of lifestyle patterns will be conducted in both western and eastern countries among primary school children with or without ADHD. The aims of present studies are: to compare the lifestyle patterns in children with ADHD and typically developing children, to determine cultural differences of children with ADHD in western and eastern countries, and to develop a suitable lifestyle modification program for children with ADHD.
Methods: The first phase of this study will investigate the lifestyle patterns in Australian and Taiwanese children with or without ADHD. All participants and their parents will be given a series of questionnaires to examine: dietary pattern, physical activity, sleep quality, screening time, demographic data, disease severity, and pressure of their caregiver. These data will be using multiple regression methods to determine the best predictors of the symptoms of ADHD. </summary>
