  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Prospective, single blinded, randomised control trial
2. The population to be studied is men undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy under general anaesthesia. 
3. This will be a multi-centre national study. 
4. Men will be randomised into 2 groups, a treatment group and a control group. 
5. All patients undergoing the procedure are put under general anaesthesia. 
6. Men in the treatment group will receive infiltration of local anaesthetic (20mls of 0.5% bupivacaine, once only) into the perineal skin by the treating surgeon at the end of the procedure but prior to the patient being woken from general anaesthesia. 
7. Men in the control group will receive no intervention
8. The design of this study (RCT) will enable data collection and analysis to determine whether or not infiltration of local anaesthetic at the time of transperineal prostate biopsy is effective. That is, does it reliably reduce pain scores (VAS and short McGill pain questionnaire) and are the results statistically significant. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether the infiltration of local anaesthetic following transperineal prostate biopsy significantly reduces pain scores as determined by VAS and short McGill pain questionnaire. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 50 years or above and are undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy.

Study details
Men will be allocated into 2 groups by chance, a treatment group and a control group. Men in the treatment group will receive infiltration of local anaesthetic (20mls of 0.5% bupivacaine) into the perineal skin after prostate biopsy. Men in the control group will receive no intervention. Data to be collected will be VAS and short McGill pain questionnaire forms 30 minutes following the procedure (to be filled out by the patient).
The design of this study (RCT) will enable data collection and analysis to determine whether or not infiltration of local anaesthetic at the time of transperineal prostate biopsy is effective. That is, does it reliably reduce pain scores (VAS and short McGill pain questionnaire) and are the results statistically significant.</summary>
