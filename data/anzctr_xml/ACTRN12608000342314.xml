  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three management strategies are to be used:
Latent Heat Goggles, Warm Compresses with a flaxseed pouch, and a Liposomal Spray.  The latent heat goggles will be worn for 10 minutes at the 50Â°C setting.  The treatment will be carried out two times within the overall intervention period of 4 hours.  The warm compresses (flaxseed pouch) will be heated in a  900W microwave for 30 seconds as per the manufacturers instructions, and then applied to the closed eyes for 5 minutes.  The treatment will be performed two times within the overall intervention period of 4 hours.  A single application the liposomal spray (TearsAgain) which contains soy lecithin 1.0% will be applied to the closed eye, as per normal patient instructions.  The treatment will be applied two times within the overall intervention period of 4 hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a common, chronic eyelid disease, which can cause the affected individual to suffer from debilitating dry eye symptoms. Due to the multifaceted aetiology of dry eye, and often poor correlation between signs and symptoms, dry eye conditions are regularly misdiagnosed and mismanaged in clinical practice. This project plans to evaluate subjects with a range of meibomian gland dysfunction severity using a battery of sensitive, non-invasive tests. The results of the tests will be used to develop superior diagnostic criteria for this condition. We then plan to evaluate three contemporary methods for treating MGD, namely, latent heat goggles, warm compresses with a flaxseed pouch, and a liposomal spray, to establish the optimal treatment conditions, across the range of MGD severities, in order that clinicians may provide more sound, evidence-based recommendations to their patients in the management of the condition.</summary>
