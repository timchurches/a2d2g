  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This prospective observational study aims to (i) asses intensive care doctors trigger for and
      the expected physiological response to a fluid bolus and (ii) evaluate the patient's actual
      physiological response to a single fluid bolus at one hour post-bolus for 100 adult patients
      admitted to the intensive care unit will be included in the study.</summary>
