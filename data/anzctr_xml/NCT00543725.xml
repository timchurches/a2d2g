  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Time to Loss of Virologic Response [TLOVR], &lt;50 Copies Per mL) at Week 48 - Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load less than (&lt;) 50 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (ribonucleic acid [RNA]) copies/milliliter (ml) at Week 48. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 50 copies/ml after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;50 copies/ml).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Snapshot, &lt;50 Copies Per mL) at Week 48 - The analysis is based on the last observed viral load (VL) data within the Week 48 window. Virologic response is defined as a VL&lt;50 copies/mL (observed case). Missing VL was considered as non-response. Virologic Failure includes subjects who had VL&gt;=50 copies/mL in the Wk 48 window, subjects who discontinued early due to lack or loss of efficacy, subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event, death or lack or loss of efficacy and at the time of discontinuation had a VL&gt;=50 copies/mL and subjects who had a switch in background regimen that was not permitted by the protocol.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Observed, &lt;50 Copies/mL) at Last On-Treatment Visit (Post-Week 96). - Virological response is defined as (observed) plasma viral load less than 50 human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies per mL at the last on-treatment post-Week 96 visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Variable, ranging from 3 months up to maximum 18 months for TMC278 and 12 months for Efavirenz</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Time to Loss of Virologic Response [TLOVR], &lt;400 Copies Per mL) at Week 48 - Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load &lt; 400 HIV-1 (RNA) copies/mL at Week 48. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 400 copies/mL after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;400 copies/mL).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Time to Loss of Virologic Response [TLOVR], &lt;400 Copies Per mL) at Week 96 - Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load &lt; 400 HIV-1 (RNA) copies/mL at Week 96. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 400 copies/mL after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;400 copies/mL).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 48 and Week 96 in Absolute and Relative CD4+ Cell Counts (Using Imputed Data) - Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count was imputed in case of missing values: in case of premature discontinuation, data were imputed with the baseline value after discontinuation (i.e. change=0, Non-Completer [NC] = Failure); otherwise last observation carried forward was applied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 48, and Week 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virologic Failure for the Resistance Determinations by Developing Mutations: First Available On-Treatment Genotypic Data After Failure - Virologic failure for the resistance determinations was defined as lack of virologic response (never having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL) and plasma viral load increase of &gt;=0.5 log 10 copies/mL above nadir (i.e., never suppressed), or confirmed loss of virologic response (2 consecutive plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL; i.e., rebounder), or discontinued with a last observed on-treatment plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL. For this study, treatment-emergent reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance associated mutations (RAMs) occurring in at least 2 virologic failures (for at least one treatment group) for the following lists are presented: i) Extended list of Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI RAMs) ii) IAS-USA list of Nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI RAMs).</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of TMC278
      given at a dose of 25 mg once daily versus efavirenz (EFV) at a dose of 600 mg once daily,
      when combined with a background regimen containing 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors ( investigator choice of ABC/3TC, TDF/FTC or AZT/3TC) in HIV-1
      infected patients who have not yet taken any anti-HIV drugs. The following evaluations will
      be done: antiviral activity, immunologic changes, and viral geno-/phenotype evolution,
      relationship of Pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/Pharmacodynamics and Medical resource
      utilization and treatment adherence.</summary>
