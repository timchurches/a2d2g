  <interventions>
    <interventions>Testing report containing information of chlamydia screening coverage and positivity rates, associated demographic breakdowns, comparison to clinic-wide and trial-wide averages in the April 2014 to March 2015 12 month period. Report also shows testing rates change for the two years prior, as well as relevant information about screening guidelines and appropriate management. The report is sent once, by regular mail. The data for these reports are sourced from all consultations by a non-locum doctor at an ACCESS PHC (The Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and Blood Borne Viruses (BBVs) Primary Health Clinic network) site ,excluding Gay and Bisexual Men subnetwork practices, and Family Planning practices. This report is prepared by a member of the ACCESS PHC research team.</interventions>

    <concealment>Allocation was completed at a central site by computer. Limited disclosure was used to conceal allocation, that is, at the time of report sending participants are unaware that only half of eligible practitioners are receiving reports during the trial period (as part of the broader ACCESS PHC network all practitioners have agreed for their testing practice to be monitored and reports of their testing practice to be sent to them), but at the conclusion of the trial period all practitioners will be informed of the project and given the opportunity to exclude their results from analysis.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Of the total 227 eligible practitioners, assuming a control coverage of 8.9% and an ICC of 0.02, and an average patient cluster size of 309, the minimum detectable RR was calculated to be 1.19, which would detect most statistically significant increases reported for comparable interventions. Data will be analysed initially using chi-squared tests and then a multivariate logistic regression using a multi-level mixed effects analysis to adjust for confounders and clustering will be conducted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>General practitioners enrolled in the trial will be randomised to either the "intervention" or the "control" group. The intervention group general practitioners will then be sent reports of their chlamydia screening and test positivity data, that compare their performance to the relevant guidelines and to their peers. The sub-project will then monitor and compare testing rates and patterns between the intervention and control groups over the next six months</summary>
