  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, to compare 900mg twice a day of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or placebo for smoking cessation, with treatment taken daily over a period of 16 weeks. The NAC will be administered as a drink, where a 900mg effervescent tablet is dissolved in a glass of cold water and consumed.  A 6-month post treatment discontinuation (week 42) follow-up will assess ongoing abstinence. Both treatment arms will receive online support using the QuitCoach (http://www.quitcoach.org.au/). QuitCoach is an online personalised quitting plan. Participants will receive login details for QuitCoach at the baseline visit and will be asked to use the website. They will be assisted if they have difficulties accessing the website, but will not be provided with additional material off-line. </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo + online support
The placebo is an effervescent tablet, matched to look and dissolve in water identical to the 900mg NAC effervescent tablet, but not containing any NAC or other active ingredient.

    <designfeatures>The primary outcome of this aid-to-cessation trial will be between group differences in continuous abstinence for the 26-week period between weeks 16 and 42. The primary outcome is measured at 6 months post-treatment discontinuation (week 42) rather than at treatment discontinuation (week 16).</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We will adhere to 'intention-to-treat' principles following CONSORT Statement guidelines. Baseline data will be secured prior to treatment allocation, missing values will be scrutinized to check for non-random distribution and analyses that utilize baseline data will be executed twice: once using observed data, and once using multiple. The proportions of relapse between the treatment groups (control vs intervention) will compared and odds ratio and 95% confidence interval will be reported. 

For secondary outcomes 2 and 9 (time to first lapse; and  time to first relapse) log-rank test will be used to compare  survival distributions between intervention and placebo groups, and hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval using proportional Cox regression will be reported as the effect size. 
Secondary outcome 10 will be analysed using the same techniques as the main outcome.

Subgroup analyses will be performed for groups categorised by demographic and diagnostic variables including gender, age, SCID diagnosis and Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale. These variables are not outcomes, they are descriptors of the cohort.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to investigate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (1.8g/day) for smoking cessation in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of current smokers who wish to quit smoking. The primary outcome measure will be 6 months of continuous abstinence from end of treatment (EoT) in tobacco smoking, confirmed by biological measures. Secondary outcome measures include point prevalence abstinence, time to relapse and cigarette consumption. Safety, tolerability and subgroup analyses will also be conducted.

Hypotheses:
Primary: Treatment with NAC will be superior to placebo for smoking cessation at follow-up (week 42), confirmed by assaying exhaled carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine.
Secondary: Treatment with NAC will be superior to placebo for smoking cessation at treatment endpoint (week 16), confirmed by assaying exhaled carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine. 

NAC is an agent that replenishes the antioxidant glutathione, and also has intrinsic antioxidant actions, as well as modulating glutamatergic, neurotropic and inflammatory pathways.There is evidence that glutamate and in particular the cystine-glutamate exchange system, mediate drug intake, craving and behavioural sensitisation in preclinical models of addiction. Glutamate, which is increased by NAC via cysteine-glutamate exchange, is core to relapse in addiction. NAC can also improve some of the physical harms caused by tobacco smoke exposure, improving mucociliary transport  and preventing oxidative damage to lung and other tissues.
NAC has several advantages over other pharmacotherapies: a different mechanism of action for smoking cessation, an excellent tolerability profile, low cost and is readily available.
