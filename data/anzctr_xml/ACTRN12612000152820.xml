  <interventions>
    <interventions>1mg of alteplase per lumen as a locking solution for permanent tunneled dialysis catheter once a week during the whole interdialysis interval (between dialysis procedure No. 2 and 3). Alteplase (1mg/1ml) will be administred into each lumen initially and then follow by saline at a volume adequate to fill the entire luminal volume (declared by manufacturer on each lumen of catheter).</interventions>
    <comparator>Trisodium citrate (Citra-LockTM 4%) as a locking solution at a volume to fill each lumen of catheter during interdialysis interval among all three dialysis procedures (including the interval between dialysis No. 2 and 3).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of definitive catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI). 
The definition of definite CRBSI = 
1. positive blood culture from catheter and peripheral blood and positive culture from discharge or aspirate from exit site or tunnel with identical organism
or
2. positive blood culture and positive culture of catheter segment with identical organism
or 
3. positive blood culture and septic thromboflebitis
or 
4. positive blood culture from peripheral blood and catheter  (with the identical organism) that meet the criteria for differential time to positivity (DTP) = the positivity of catheter blood culture comes at least 2 hours earlier compared to peripheral blood.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of probable CRBSI. 
The definition of probable CRBSI = 
1. two or more positive blood cultures (peripheral blood and catheter) with no evidence for source other than catheter 
or
2. single positive blood culture (peripheral blood or catheter) for G+ coccus with no evidence for source other than catheter
or
3. strong clinical suspicion of bacterial infection with the source in catheter (symptoms manifesting during dialysis procedure) with the necessary exclusion of other sources (urogenitaly and respiratory tracts)
or
4. positive blood culture from peripheral blood and catheter  (with the identical organism) that don?t meet the criteria of DTP for definite CRBSI</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of catheter malfunction/obstruction that are defined as:
1. max blood flow (BF) 250 ml/min and less for 30 mins and more during one dialysis procedure (max arterial and venous pressure limits of - 250 mmHg and + 250 mmHg respectively)
or
2. mean BF 250 ml/min and less during two consecutive dialysis procedures (max arterial and venous pressure limits of - 250 mmHg and + 250 mmHg respectively)
or
3. reversal of catheter lines as a solution to start the dialysis with BF at least 200 ml/min (max arterial and venous pressure limits of - 250 mmHg and + 250 mmHg respectively)
or
4. inability to initiate dialysis because of obstruction of catheter for at least 200 ml/min even after the reversal of catheter lines (max arterial and venous pressure limits of - 250 mmHg and + 250 mmHg respectively).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients with newly inserted permanent tunneled dialysis catheter will be considered for inclusion to the study. If the patient meet the inclusion criteria and sign informed consent, randomization will occur. Patients will be stratified by the centre. They will be assigned a randomization identification number and the study arm will be known only to pharmacy stuff, who will prepare and dispense the locking solution.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that the application of alteplasis as a locking solution for tunneled dialysis permanent catheter once a week will decrease the incidence of catheter related blood stream infection and will influence the incidence of catheter obstruction/malfunction.</summary>
