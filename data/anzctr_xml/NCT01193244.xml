  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS) - rPFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease progression assessed by independent central radiology review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radionuclide bone scans at regularly scheduled visits. Radiographic disease progression in bone required a confirmatory scan. Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue did not require a confirmatory scan for purposes of analysis. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by independent central radiology review using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for soft tissue disease and Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines for bone disease. Participants who did not reach the endpoint were censored at their last assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline until radiographic disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (approximately up to 4.7 years)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival was calculated from the date of participant randomization to the date of participant death due to any cause.

BPI-SF was an 11-item questionnaire, designed to assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Total score ranged from 0 to 100 with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</outcome>
