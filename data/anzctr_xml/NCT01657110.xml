  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mild to moderate facial acne is an extremely common disease of teenagers and young adults.
      This pilot study will investigate whether treatment with a gel containing tea tree oil
      reduces numbers of acne lesions and improves acne in twenty otherwise healthy consenting
      participants. The hypothesis is that treatment with tea tree oil gel will result in a
      significant improvement in acne after 12 weeks of treatment.</summary>
