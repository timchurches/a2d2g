  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in this study have peripheral venous catheters (PVC) used in adult medical and surgical departments. Consenting patients will have their PVC secured with either the intervention or control dressing and securements. This dressing and securement will be applied by either the Research Nurse or the treating clinician (dependent upon who inserts the PVC). 

Arm 1 (Control): Bordered Polyurethane Dressing. Bordered polyurethane dressings (BPUs) retain the central polyurethane component of standard polyurethane dressings with an added external adhesive border of foam or cloth fabric. 

Arm 2 (Intervention): Integrated Securement Device. An Integrated Securement Device is a polyurethane dressing which combines both SP (simple polyurethane) and SD (securement device) into one product. 

The randomly allocated dressing will be applied at the time of PVC insertion until device removal. There will be daily checks of the PVC site and dressings/securements to monitor protocol adherence and assess for any complications. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control group patients will have their peripheral venous catheters secured with a bordered polyurethane dressing (as per standard care) at the time of PVC insertion until device removal. </comparator>

      <outcome>Thombosis (either suspected on confirmed): 
Suspected - This will be assessed by the treating clinician, recorded on a 1 page data collection sheet at the patient's bedside or in the patient's medical record.
Confirmed - Ultrasound/venographic confirmed thrombosed vessel at the PVC site. This will be assessed by a review of the patient's medical records (including ultrasound findings). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily from PVC insertion until the time of PVC removal.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PVC dwell time: Research staff will calculate time (in hours) from device insertion until removal using relevant information as recorded by clinical staff on a 1 page data collection sheet at the patients bedside and in the patients medical record.</outcome>

    <concealment>Research nurses (RNs) will screen patients daily and liaise heavily with the staff responsible for inserting the majority of PVCs (emergency departments, ward-based nurses, medical registrars and anaesthetists). All eligible patients (or their representative) will be approached for written informed consent by the RN or inserter. If this is given, the staff member will log in to a centralised web-based randomisation service customised for the trial and be advised of group allocation. Computer generated allocation is provided by an independent randomisation service. Allocation is fully concealed until the patient is randomised.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All randomised patients will be analysed on an Intention to Treat (ITT) basis. The patient is the unit of measurement with one PVC per patient being analysed. We will test the feasibility of the statistical analysis that will be used in the definitive trial. Comparability of groups at baseline will be assessed using clinical parameters. Relative incidence rates of device failure per 100 devices and per 1,000 device days with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will summarise the impact of each dressing regimen, and to test difference between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (with log rank test) will compare device failure over time. Secondary endpoints including dwell-time, dislodgment, infection and safety will be compared between groups using parametric or nonparametric techniques as appropriate. In addition to group, multivariate regression (Cox) models will test the effect of patient and device variables associated with device failure e.g. insertion site, dwell time, length of stay, diagnostic group, age, sex, mobility, co-morbidities and IV medications. Data will be exported into PASW 22.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Prior to analysis, data cleaning of outlying figures, missing, and implausible data will be undertaken, and a random 5% sample of source data re-entered and checked. All attempts will be made to collect the primary endpoint. Missing data will be modelled for best- and worst-case outcomes to assess for effect on overall results. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations. P values of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to pilot test the feasibility of a randomised trial that compares the effectiveness of new generation securement and dressing products for peripheral intravenous catheters. The RCT aims to (i) identify clinical, cost-effective methods to prevent catheter failure due to infection, phlebitis, occlusion, and dislodgement; (ii) compare usual care dressings with a novel method; (iii) evaluate the acceptability of these devices to patients and health professionals; and (iv) study adverse effect profiles.

You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are a medical or surgical patient over the age of 16 and are having a peripheral venous catheter inserted as part of your therapy (which is expected to remain in place for at least 24 hours). 

All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive one of two PVC dressing/securement options. This will be either the standard bordered polyurethane dressing;  or an integrated securement device. The allocated dressing will be applied from device insertion until the time of device removal. Participants will be asked to rate the acceptability of the device and dressing, and the device will be observed closely to examine side effects, device failures and infections. It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide information on which PVC securements and dressings are most effective in preventing PVC failure.</summary>
