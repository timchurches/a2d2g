  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if rimonabant 20 mg once daily (od) administered
      during 18-20 months will reduce progression of coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) when administered on top of standard behavioral and
      pharmacological therapy given as needed, in patients with abdominal obesity associated with
      current smoking and/or metabolic syndrome.</summary>
