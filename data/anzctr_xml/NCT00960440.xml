The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-FS for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</outcome>

All the scales ranged from 0 (limited none of the time) to 100 (limited all of the time). Work Loss Index (WLI), which represented percentage of lost work over time period relative to a normative population, was derived (total score: 0 [no loss] to 100 [complete loss of work]).</outcome>
