  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multicenter, open-label study will assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of DEDN6526A
      in patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Cohorts of patients will receive
      escalating doses of DEDN6526A by intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. In the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue to receive
      DEDN6552A for up to 17 cycles (1 year).</summary>
