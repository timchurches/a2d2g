  <interventions>
    <interventions>We wish to examine whether administration of intravenous propofol 3mg/kg over 3 minutes at the end of a sevoflurane anaesthetic can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium in children.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment where no propofol is administered.  The patient would breathe spontaneously until they have breathed off sufficient sevoflurane for them to wake.  The patient will then either wake up in the induction room next to the MRI scanner or be transfered to theatre recovery prior to waking.  This will be at the discretion of the individual anaesthetist.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of emergence delirium.  This is to be assessed by using the Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) Scale and Watcha behaviour score.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients listed for MRI under General Anaesthesia (GA) are to be invited to participate providing they meet the inclusion criteria.  Once enrolled a sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope is to be placed in the notes and the anaesthetist informed of the patients inclusion.  The pack envelope contains the treatment group information.  The pack is to be opened only once the patient has entered the MR scanner and neither the recovery nurse or the assessor will be aware of the randomisation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer generated random number sequence will allocate treatment or control group information to sequentially numbered opaque packs.  The packs will be filled by an individual with no other involvement in the trial process.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After anaesthesia children frquently become irritable and distressed.  This is termed Emergence Delirium (ED).  Sometimes this can lead to intravenous lines and surgical drains becoming dislodged.  The child rarely remember this period and it rarely has any longterm consequences.  A number of studies have suggested that a commonly used anaesthetic drug called propofol can be used to reduce the chance of this happening.  We plan to administer a dose of propofol at the end of an anaesthetic to see whether it will reduce the rate of ED.</summary>
