  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two commonly used non-invasive ventilation strategies in the respiratory management of patients with stable Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome will be compared. 
i)	Bilevel PAP (positive airway pressure): use of bilevel ventilation set in a spontaneous-timed mode versus
ii)	CPAPplus: Initial treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), with progressive escalation of ventilatory support in case of treatment failure to spontaneous bilevel PAP and then bilevel in the spontaneous-timed mode if needed.
Note
i)      Bilevel PAP involves the delivery of positive pressure through a nasal mask. The pressure delivered during inspiration is higher than that during expiration. These pressures act to "splint" the upper airway open and to increase the size of each assisted breath. The pressures used are estimated during a daytime familiarisation trial and confirmed during an overnight sleep study. The mask and device are to be used every night during sleep throughout the study period, ie 12 months. The delivered pressures will be in the range of 4-30cm H2O as observed in usual clinical practice. 

ii)      CPAP involves the delivery of a constant positive pressure through a nasal mask. The pressure delivered is constant across both inspiration and expiration. This pressure act to "splint" the upper airway open during sleep. The pressures used are estimated during a daytime familiarisation trial and confirmed during an overnight sleep study. The mask and device are to be used every night throughout the study period, ie 12 months. The delivered pressures will be in the range of 4-30cm H2O as observed in usual clinical practice. 

Primary endpoint will be made at 3 months, with secondary endpoint at 12 months</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment failure defined as any one or more of the following;
a)	Failure of awake PaCO2 to fall below 60mmHg within 3 months of commencing treatment or a rise of &gt;10mmHg in daytime, awake PaCO2 at any time compare to that at randomization
b)	Admission to hospital for respiratory deterioration (worsening respiratory failure, dyspnoea, right heart failure or severe sleepiness)
c)	The patient abandons or is non-adherent with PAP therapy, defined as average nightly use &lt;2hrs/night since last review, on 2 consecutive reviews (ie persisting after efforts to trouble shoot reasons for poor adherence).</outcome>

      <timepoint>one, three and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment compliance. This will be assessed by reading the "time at pressure" data from the positive pressure device. These data are automatically logged by the devices.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one, three and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Healthcare utilization and need for hospital admissions. Detailed questionnaire data will be collected monthly regarding participants use of health services. The economic evaluation proposed here is a within-trial analysis and will rely primarily on direct observation of treatment compliance, hospitalisations, healthcare utilization and quality of life in the trial population. All of these data will be gathered within the trial (monthly telephone calls, local hospital records, compliance data recorded by the bilevel device and quality of life questionnaires completed by participants). Results from the economic evaluation will be expressed as additional costs (savings) per SRI responder and costs(savings) per QALY gained.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one, three and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in quality of life and sleepiness
Quality of life (QoL) - This will be measured with two questionnaires. The first is the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) questionnaire; a disease specific QoL measure, specifically for use in people with chronic respiratory failure. The SF-36 is a generic health-related quality of life measure. The SF-36 data will also be transformed into the SF6D to calculate health utility values (and quality-adjusted life years) for the economic evaluation.
Daytime sleepiness - The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is an 8 point questionnaire routinely used in patients with sleep and breathing disorders, and will be administered to measure the subject?s propensity to fall asleep during various routine daytime activities</outcome>
      <timepoint>one, three and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Differences between groups in physical activity following therapy.
a)	Subjects will be asked to wear the SenseWear Pro3 Armband (SWA, Bodymedia, Pittsburgh, USA) for a seven day period (including weekend days) to document physical activity levels. This monitor is approved by the TGA (175835 Emergo Asia Pacific Pty Ltd - Patient data recorder, long-term, physical activity).
The monitor is worn over the upper part of the right arm and provides estimates of energy and step count. These estimates are made non-invasively using thin inbuilt bi-axial accelerometer, galvanic skin resistance plus sensors for heat flux, galvanic skin response and near-body ambient temperature. The number of non-sedentary minutes per day (energy expenditure &gt;1.5METS) will be calculated.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Not being able to breath enough overnight is a major problem for an increasing number of Australians with obesity.
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome, as this problem is known, is now the major reason for complex, overnight
breathing support in Australia. This potentially fatal disease can be managed using two different strategies; a
cheaper, simpler option available to more people or a more expensive approach that requires specialised services.
The more complex approach may not be better if fewer people are able to take advantage of it.
In this twelve month study, people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome will be randomised (like flipping a coin) to receive either the simple or the complex way of managing the disease. The primary question we are looking to answer is whether the more complex approach is really better than the simpler one. Specifically, the study will determine which treatment is better for patients in terms of quality of life, blood test results and and how easily they can get out and about. The study will also help establish which of these approaches is more cost-effective for the community.</summary>
