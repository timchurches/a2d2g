  <conditions>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised placebo controlled trial of the effects of Clonidine (200mcg) on cognitive control and error processing measures in healthy adults.

Clonidine trade name: Catapress

Participants will receive each of Clonidine and placebo in capsule form (1 week apart, order of administration randomised). 

The Experimenter will observe ingestion of the capsule (time 0), participants will commence tasks after 90 minutes has elapsed (onset of drug peak), task will be completed at 180 minutes, observation will then occur for half an hour before completion at 210 minutes.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A repeated measures ANOVA design (drug vs. placebo) will be used to compare the effects of Clonidine (vs placebo) on each of the EEG and behavioural measures

Our previous investigations with similar pharmacological agents
(Methyphenidate, Atomoxetine, Citalopram) revealed effect sizes in the medium to large range with such a design (Cohens D = .5 to .8). see e.g. Nandam et al Biological psychiatry (2011), 69, 902-904.

Given a repeated measures design, effect sizes that fall in the medium/large range, a critical alpha of .05, allowance for multiple comparison correction (and the satisfaction of standard clinical and statistical assumptions for such designs - see below), 26 people will afford us sufficient statistical power (&gt;80%).

clinical assumption:
The subjects (each of whom is an independent sample - eg not related) were correctly assigned to the treatments
Statistical assumption:
the distribution of the difference scores for any given dependent variable should be normal. 
We note that if this distribution is non-normal (ie if this assumption is not met) we can run a permutation (distribution free) analysis without any loss of power.

    <summary>This study assesses the impact of Clonidine a commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of Attention Deficit hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) on behavioural and brain imaging measures of cognition. Specifically, it measures the impact of Clonidine on key behaviours that are altered in ADHD including, response inhibition, attention and error processing. </summary>
