  <interventions>
    <interventions>ForSight Ocular System (drug/device combination product) will be placed in eye. Product contains prostaglandin which elutes with varying dose over six month period. Dose is higher at beginning of use of product and gradually declines as drug elutes from product, as is typical for drug-eluting products. Maximum daily dose will not exceed levels tested in prior clinical studies. Dose will start under 100 mcg/day (maximum amount tested in prior clinical use) and will decline toward 0 mcg/day by end of study period.</interventions>
