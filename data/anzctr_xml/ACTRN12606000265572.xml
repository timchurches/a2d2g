    <interventions>Patients that underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery will be randomized to use topical latanoprost 0.005% eye-drop q.d. (n=10) for 1 month.
They will be submitted to optical coherence tomography (OCT) evaluation at baseline and after 15 days and 1 month of treatment.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients were eligible for participation if they met the following inclusion criteria: pseudophakia, uneventful cataract surgery, and visual acuity better than 20/40.</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>40</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>Not stated</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Patients were excluded from the study if they had a prior history of uveitis or CME, substantial ocular irritation at baseline, or history of intraocular surgery or laser procedure within 4 months before baseline. We also excluded patients who had been treated with PG analogues in the past, and patients who had undergone other ocular surgery except for cataract. Finally, the presence of systemic disorders that could be associated with either uveitis or CME (i.e. diabetes, rheumatologic diseases), pregnancy, lactation or inadequate contraception (in females) were also exclusion criteria.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the protocol is to study prospectively using optical coherence tomography (OCT) whether topical latanoprost induces retinal disorders, such as cystoid macular edema, in patients that underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery.
The use of topical latanoprost eye-drop may be associated or not with changes in macular thickness.</summary>
