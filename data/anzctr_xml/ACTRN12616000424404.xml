  <interventions>
    <interventions>RCT involving grade 5 classrooms, divided into those recieving the intervention and those on a waitlist (control). Intervention is a social skill and emotion regulation program called the 'Secret Agent Society'. It was originally created for children with ASD, but will also be offered to children with unspecified social and emotional issues as well as typically developing children with the intention to investigate whether it is of benefit for these populations as well.

The SAS:WC intervention will comprise of a one hour class run for the duration of a school term (12 weeks in total). Teachers will provide the content to students, with lessons comprising of group work, computer game components, and students working through a "cadet handbook" (a personal workbook for each student). Classes focus on recognising emotion in others and in the self before moving on the strategies aimed that aid in emotion regulation (e.g. what to do when feeling anxious). The waitlist control will provide class as normal. 

Teachers recieve two full days of training prior to intervention. Training is run by program creator Dr Renae Beaumont with the aid of Associate Professor Dr Kate Sofronoff (both are clinical psychologists) and Ruby Clarke (a provisional psychologist). Training is intensive and interactive, it is a requirement that those teachers implementing the program in each school attend. It is also the time when resources for the program are provided for the teachers to collect. The program will be taught weekly as a subject for the duration of one school term (12 weeks), with each lesson lasting an hour.  

Intervention is measured across three time points: pre, post, and at three month follow up intervention. The teachers have access to support via phone, skype and email with the aforementioned people. The program will be run as a subject in a school semester, participating schools have already made a time in their school week and have signed contracts detailing their committment to the program. 

After initial study with grade 5 classrooms in QLD, 2017 will see the expansion of the study to grade 5 schools in other states within Australia while also following the original QLD cohort as they enter grade 6 and finally grade 7 (high school) to ascertain generalizability and duration of skills learned during intervention. </interventions>

The students identified in the current grade 5 classes to possess a verified ASD diagnosis will be followed through into grade 6 and finally into grade 7 to assess whether the the effects of the program (if any) have been maintained. At this stage, an assessment battery for this has yet to be devised - expected to be completed beginning of 2017. However, it should closely resemble the assessment battery used for the current QLD grade 5 cohort. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Looking into the potential utility and generalizability of the Secret Agent Society (SAS) computer game in schools that have pupils with ASD. The SAS will be implemented in grade 5 classrooms and we will follow students and the program effect as they progress to highschool. The aim is to investigate whether the SAS program in a whole classroom setting improves social and emotional skills for pupils with ASD, as well as decrease bullying behaviour experienced in the classroom as the education system works to support an inclusive classroom. 

Data will be collected from parents and teachers at several time points in the form of questionnaire batteries. For example, a questionnaire battery will be administered to the grade 5 teachers of each class. The teachers are to assess and report back on each student within their class on a variety of measures. The assessment battery contains questionnaires designed to assess social and emotional functioning of the child. In the following Primary and Secondary outcome boxes, any measure labelled (teacher form) is referring to this assessment battery.  A second battery will also be given to the children within each class comprising of four measures designed to ascertain their current level of social and emotional function. They will be given at the same time points as the teacher questionnaires. In the following Primary and Secondary outcome boxes, any measure labelled (child form) is referring to this assessment battery.</summary>
