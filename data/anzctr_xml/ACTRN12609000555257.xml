    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible primiparous women received written information about the trial from 36 weeks onwards. Women provided informed written consent prior to birth but were randomized only following birth and assessment of the perineum. Randomisation was to one of four groups. Medications were packaged by the clinical trial pharmacist and allocated a study number based on the randomisation schedule.  Each treatment pack contained forty-eight hours of the designated analgesia that was not concealed. The randomised medication was commenced immediately following perineal repair.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of both the most commonly used analgesics (Diclofenac and Panadol), and the mode of administration (oral or rectal), in relieving perineal pain after childbirth.  We hypothesised that:
1. Regular oral analgesia is equally as effective as rectal analgesia in relieving perineal pain after childbirth. 2. Diclofenac is more effective an analgesia than Panadol. 3. Women prefer oral analgesia to rectal analgesia.</summary>
