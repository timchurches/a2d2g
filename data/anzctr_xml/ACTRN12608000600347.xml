    <studytitle>A randomised controlled blinded trial to investigate the effect of hyoscine butylbromide during colonoscopy on rates of polyp detection.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients undergoing standard fibreoptic colonoscopy at a single centre, randomly allocated to receive hyoscine butylbromide or saline; a comparison of polyp detection rates between the two groups is to be undertaken to improve detection of colonic polyps.</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>During the isolated procedure of a single colonoscopy using the standard equipment, monitoring and sedation; the intervention (a single dose of hyoscine butylbromide 20 mg intravenously over approximately 10 seconds, also commercially known as buscopan) will be administered upon intubation of the caecum.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment for colonoscopy (no treatment in additinoal to standard equipment, monitoring and sedation).  Upon intubation of the caecum the control group will receive a single intravenous dose of normal saline solution administered as a placebo.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Some colonic polyps are not seen during colonoscopy, and new therapies are frequently tested to decrease the 'miss-rate' of around 15-20 %.  The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that using an antispasmodic drug (hyoscine butylbromide - also known as buscopan), given as a single intravenous dose during colonoscopy, that polyp detection rates may be improved.  The study population will be all patients (who agree to participate)booked in for routine colonoscopy for any indication at a university hospital centre.</summary>
