  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children with allergy to raw egg but able to tolerate baked egg will be recruited.  Participants will remain on an egg free diet, and be randomised into one of two groups.  The intervention group will be provided with egg containing baked products (muffin or fruit loaf).  Each participant will be asked to consume around 3 serves of the study product each week (around 30g baked egg per week).  After 6 months participants will cease the product and be re challenged to raw egg at 7 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be provided with egg free baked products (muffins or fruit loaf) that look and taste identical to the intervention products, but are egg free.  Each participant will be asked to consume around 3 serves of the study product each week.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Egg allergy is the most common food allergy in Australian children.  Many children with egg allergy can tolerate baked products, but will fail an oral challenge to raw egg. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether allergy to raw egg is better resolved by regular consumption of baked egg (intervention group, baked egg exposure) compared with the standard practice of an egg free diet (control group, egg avoidance).</summary>
