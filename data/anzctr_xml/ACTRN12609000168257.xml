  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: Treadmill exercise, speed and incline set to achieve an exercise intensity of 60% of each subject's peak oxygen uptake (VO2) for 20 minutes on one occasion. Peak VO2 measured on the day prior to randomisation.
Group 2: Chest physiotherapy. Subjects breath out through a Flutter device which provides an oscillating expiratory pressure at the mouth of 10-20cmH2O. Subjects breath out through this device for two minutes, followed by the Forced Expiratory Techinique. This cycle is repeated six times in a 20 minute period on one occasion.
Group 3: Control (resting breathing). Sitting quietly, relaxed breathing for 20 minutes on one occasion.
There is a minimum of 24 hours "wash out" between interventions. All three interventions to be completed within two weeks</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to examine the effect of exercise, compared to chest physiotherapy and control, on mechanisms of airway clearance in cystic fibrosis. We hypothesise that exercise and chest physiotherapy will improve respiratory flow rates and properties of mucus.</summary>
