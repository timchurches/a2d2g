    <healthcondition>Evaluation of frequency of kicking, frequency of feet contact with a board, uni and bipodal movements, podal preference, and intralimb coordination pattern in 1- and- 2-month-old infants with and without extra weight in their legs.</healthcondition>

      <conditioncode2>Research that is not of generic health relevance and not applicable to specific health categories listed above</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eight infants aged 1 and 2 months old were placed in supine, and their kicking movements were recorded for 6 minutes and 20 seconds. In the first condition, infants were trained to kick a board. The second condition was the baseline. In third condition, there were added 1/10 of leg's weight on their ankles. In the fourth condition, there were added 1/3 of leg's weight on their ankles. The fifth condition was post-weight and it was similar to the baseline. Each condition was 1 minute and there was a 20 seconds interval between each condition.</interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The frequency of kicking increased in the conditions of 1/10-weight and post-weight. Feet-contact with the board decreased in the condition of 1/3-weight.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In 1 and 2 months old.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The frequency of kicking and feet-contact with the board increased at 2 months</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between 1 and 2 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Unilateral kicking was predominant in all the conditions and ages, and infants showed no preference for either leg. The intralimb coordination pattern was shown to be in-phase in both ages.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 1 and 2 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
