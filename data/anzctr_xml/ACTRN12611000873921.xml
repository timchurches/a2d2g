  <interventions>
    <interventions>Delivery of a program that combines self-monitoring delivered in a low-intensity delivery format (email and/or postal), paired with evidence-based postnatal nutrition and healthy lifestyle information - initiated in the late antenatal period through to 6 months postpartum. The intervention starts with a 1 hour nutrition assessment, goal setting and counselling session (delivered antenatally at approximately 36 weeks) delivered in line with the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (+/- kilojoule restriction of 2000kJ/day, depending on lactation status), followed by fortnightly information and goal setting sheets posted from 6 weeks until 3 months postpartum, then monthly until 6 months. The sheets contain information on: nutrition post-pregnancy (+/-breastfeeding) + self monitoring (food groups; weight), practical ideas for cooking, shopping, larder, fridge, freezer; physical activity; balanced life.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Retention of weight gained during pregnancy contributes to overweight and obesity and subsequent chronic disease risk, with the associated personal, financial and public health burdens. Women who are overweight or obese at beginning of pregnancy are more likely to gain excess weight and retain this weight after pregnancy. Women who do not lose weight by 6 months postpartum are more likely to be overweight or obese over the long term. 

Approximately one third of women who deliver at the MMH are overweight or obese at the beginning of pregnancy. A 2008 MMH Nutrition and Dietetic audit demonstrated that, of the 102 women surveyed, 50% of the women who were overweight, 75% of women who were obese and 100% of women who were morbidly obese gained in excess of their recommended weight gain range for pregnancy. Our MMH patients are at very high risk of retaining weight after pregnancy and developing associated chronic diseases, thus implementation of weight management interventions is urgently required. 

Limited data exist regarding the most effective methods of supporting weight loss after pregnancy. However, diet and exercise, with behavioural change and support are known to be important elements to be included in any program. Usual models of weight loss care (e.g. multiple group/clinic attendances) are not as appropriate in this population group due to childrearing demands. 

Our research aim is to develop, implement and evaluate an innovative postpartum weight management program that includes evidence-based behaviour change strategies to support postpartum weight management that is delivered in a format suitable for MMH postnatal (PN) patients.</summary>
