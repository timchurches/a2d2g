  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase I-Ib/II, open-label, multicenter study of AUY922 administered intravenously
      in patients with multiple myeloma to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The Phase II part
      will investigate the efficacy of AUY922 in patients with multiple myeloma. Additionally, the
      study includes a Phase Ib combination part of AUY922 administered in combination with
      bortezomib, to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination drugs in patients with
      multiple myeloma.</summary>
