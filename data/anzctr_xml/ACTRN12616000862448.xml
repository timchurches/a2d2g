    <interventions>Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with either a single dose of APL-9 or a single dose of placebo by subcutaneous injection. Doses will be administered by healthcare professionals at the study site. This study will be conducted in 4 sequential cohorts. 
The first cohort will receive 90 mg of APL-9 (4 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects).
The second cohort will receive 225 mg of APL-9 (4 subjects) or placebo (1 subject).
The exact doses for the third and fourth cohort will be determined after the second cohort has been dosed.
The third cohort will receive up to 450 mg of APL-9 (4 subjects) or placebo (1 subject).

    <concealment>A statistician will prepare a Randomization Schedule and send a copy to the manufacturer of the dosing syringes. The manufacturer will fill dosing syringes with either APL-9 or placebo, and will label the syringes in a blinded fashion in accordance with the Randomization Schedule (i.e. the label for each syringe will include the Randomization  Number but will not include the identity of the treatment). The Randomization Schedule will not be made available to the clinical trial team. 
Subjects who complete the screening assessments and meet all of the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study and will be assigned a unique Randomisation Number. 
Randomisation Numbers will be comprised of the letter R followed by a four-digit number of the format ‘Rprnn’, where p denotes the cohort number (i.e. for Cohort 1, p=1), r is a replacement indicator and nn is a sequential randomisation number, i.e. R1001, R1002, etc. If a subject is replaced, the digit represented by r will be sequentially increased by one, e.g. R2003 would be replaced by R2103. The replacement subject will be administered the same treatment allocated to the original participant, as indicated by the last two digits of the randomisation number (i.e. 03 for participant R2003 and R2103). 
Dosing syringes will be dispensed to the subject with the corresponding Randomisation Number and the injections will be administered by blinded study personnel or by personnel who will not be involved in the study assessments.

    <statisticalmethods>Given the exploratory nature of the study no formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. As no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted, the study sample sizes were not based on statistical power calculations.
Data will be presented by cohort/dose (including placebo where applicable), study day and nominal time post-dose (if appropriate). Subjects receiving placebo will be pooled across dosing cohorts for summaries.  All data will be listed by cohort and dose (including placebo where applicable).
For continuous variables, the number of available observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum will be provided. For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage in each category will be displayed.  Unless otherwise specified percentages of subjects will be based on the number of subjects randomized (Safety Analysis Set).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>APL-9 is a PEGylated peptide wherein a small pharmacologically moiety binds to primate complement C3 and exerts a broad inhibition of the complement cascade. The PEG portion of the drug molecule imparts longer residence time in the body after administration of the drug.  
APL-9 for SC injection is currently in development as a potential treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria (PNH), which is an acquired hematological disease characterized by complement-mediated red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis, with or without hemoglobinuria, and increased susceptibility to thrombotic episodes, and/or some degree of bone marrow dysfunction. 
This single ascending dose study is the first study in a planned series of studies for the clinical development of APL-9. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single subcutaneous (SC) doses of APL 9 in healthy volunteers. The secondary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single SC doses of APL 9 in healthy volunteers. An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of single SC doses of APL 9 when administered to healthy volunteers. 
The study will recruit 21 subjects in four dose cohorts. Subjects will participate in only one cohort and will receive a single dose of APL 9 or placebo administered subcutaneously. 
Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial blood samples and urine samples will be collected for these assessments. Blood samples will also be collected for the PK, PD, and immunogenicity assessment of APL 9. 
Dose escalation to the next dose level (i.e. next cohort) will not take place until a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) comprised of the Principal Investigator (PI), the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor have determined that adequate safety and tolerability from the previous cohort has been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort.
Subjects will be resident in the clinical facility (Nucleus Network Ltd) from the day before dosing until 168 hours (Day 8) after dosing. Subjects will return for follow-up visits and the exit visit for subsequent study procedures.</summary>
