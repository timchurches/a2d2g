      <outcome>To examine the effect of tamoxifen vs anastrozole on breast cancer mortality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>It is recognised that breast cancer mortality is an important secondary endpoint and this will also be analysed.  The death of a IBIS II participant whilst on trial will be recorded on a death form. This data will be submitted to and compiled by the central coordinating centre in London UK (CRUK). The significance of this data will be determined at some time after 10 years worth of data has been collected and will need to involve an overview of similar trials to get clear results on this question. No definite time line for this analysis has been set.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the effect of tamoxifen and anastrozole on other cancers, cardiovascular disease, fracture rates, and non-breast cancer deaths.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the period of active follow-up (5 years) other serious medical conditions will be recorded including myocardial infarction, thromboembolic events (superficial and deep), other cardiovascular events, osteoporosis, fractures, other cancers and eye problems. Data will be collected using CRFs completed by Principal investigators/data management staff at baseline, 6 months and then yearly until 5 years post randomisation. If the participant ceases treatment before 5 years they will be followed up using an annual questionnaire. An annual questionnaire will also be used to follow up women for another 5 years after they cease their 5 years of treatment. Mammograms will be required annually. Blood tests are required at baseline, 1 and 5 years. A DXA and spinal x-ray are required to have been taken within 2 years of entry to the study and if the participant has osteoporosis they must have DXA scans every 2 years while on the trial. Samples of the participant's DCIS tumour (parafin blocks) are required for analysis at baseline. Tumour samples (parafin blocks) will also be required for any subsequent tumours which develop while on trial in the breast, endometrium or ovaries.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine tolerability and acceptability of side effects experienced by women on the trial.</outcome>

    <summary>Phase 3

This study is comparing the effectiveness of the drugs tamoxifen versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with hormone sensitive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
This is an ANZ 02P2/ International Breast Cancer Intervention Study: IBIS-II DCIS.

Who is it for?
You can join this trial if:
You are a postmenopausal woman aged between 40 and 70 years. You must have had DCIS diagnosed in one breast within the last 6 months. The DCIS must have been hormone sensitive and have been locally removed (i.e.not by mastectomy). 
Trial details
Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group receives tamoxifen plus a non-active compound in place of anastrozole. The other group receives anastrozole plus a non-active compound in place of tamoxifen.  These are taken orally, every day for 5 years. The study aims to compare how effective the two drugs are in preventing and controlling locally any subsequent disease, in the same or the other breast.

DCIS has the potential to develop into breast cancer which can spread to other places in the body. Both tamoxifen and anastrozole lower levels of the hormone oestrogen in the body and are used in women already diagnosed with breast cancer. Tamoxifen is used in some women with DCIS for the prevention of breast cancer. This trial is looking at whether anastrozole is as effective as tamoxifen in preventing further DCIS and breast cancer.</summary>
