  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The International study on NoSocomial Pneumonia in Intensive CaRE (PneumoINSPIRE) is a
      prospective, international, multicentre, observational, cohort study. The study aims to
      provide up-to-date and generalisable information on current worldwide epidemiology and
      clinical practice associated with diagnosis and management of nosocomial pneumonia in
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.

      PneumoINSPIRE study is endorsed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM).</summary>
