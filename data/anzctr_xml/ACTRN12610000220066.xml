  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will have miniscrews placed into their upper and lower jaws. These will then be loaded with class III elastic bands. The miniscrews will be placed under local anaesthetic.This procedure will take approximately 30 minutes. The treatment affects of this will be compared after 10 months of treatment to assess how much protraction of the maxilla has occured.</interventions>
    <comparator>This include standard care of the patient where the upper jaw is protracted to a position where it is in front of the lower jaw. This is ususally done with an extraoral protraction facemask, which takes 30 minutes to place, or sugery when their growth has ceased</comparator>

    <interventioncode>Treatment: Devices</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A more pronounced skeletal change will be evident in less treatment time. This will be assessed via clinical measurements of overbite and overjet and also using radiology in the form of 3D Newtom scans used routinely as part of orthodontic treatment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Treatment time is 10 months. The baseline will be when the protraction is started. The endpoint will be when an overjet of 3mm is achieved which should be at 10 months of treatment</timepoint>

    <concealment>The subjects will be enrolled from the University of Sydney, Orthodontic department waiting list. The subjects wiill be selected based on the clinical examination performed by 3 clinicians who independantly assess the patient and confirm their eligibility for the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to develop an alternative to the conventional facemask protraction therapy in the treatment of skeletal class III malocclusion. The hypothesis is that the treatment of skeletal class III malocclusions with miniscrews and intraoral elastics will produce a more profound skeletal change in less time than the conventional therapy.</summary>
