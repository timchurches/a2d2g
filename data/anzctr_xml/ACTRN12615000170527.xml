  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children with bilateral hearing loss, between ages 4 to 12 months in NSW and VIC, will be recruited through the national hearing service provider, Australian Hearing. Children will undergo objective (cortical auditory evoked potentials in response to sound changes) and behavioural (head/eye movements in response to sound changes) assessments of speech discrimination at 3 months post hearing-aid fitting. They will return at chronological age of 3 years for repeat assessments of speech discrimination and additionally tests of their speech and language ability. In addition, data will be collected on the child's auditory behaviour in everyday life and family demographics from parent questionnaires. The findings will lead to novel clinical tools for assessing auditory discrimination in infants, early referral for cochlear implantation if necessary, and new evidence-based clinical guidelines for best practice management of children with hearing loss. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Factor analysis will be used to combine the outcomes scores at 3 years into one or more factors. Standard multiple linear regression analysis will be used to examine the relationship between language outcome scores and potential predictor variables (including objective speech-discrimination, behavioural speech-discrimination, degree of hearing loss, age of fitting, communication mode, maternal education, socio-economic advantage, gender, other disabilities, and presence of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder). Their relation to each other will be assessed with correlation analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Now that newborn hearing checks are available, hearing loss is often picked up soon after birth and hearing aids are fitted shortly after. There are standard procedures for checking that the hearing aids make sounds audible to a child, but no one knows how effective the hearing aids are for supporting discrimination between sounds because there are no clinical tools to do so. Further, no one knows whether this early discrimination ability may relate to later language development of children with hearing loss.  

The IDEAL study aims to 1) develop new clinical tools for assessing whether an infant with hearing loss can hear the differences between sounds after they are fitted with hearing aids; and 2) determine the relationship between early auditory discrimination and spoken language skills at 3 years of age for children with hearing loss. The findings will provide the much-needed evidence to guide best-practice management of children with hearing loss. </summary>
