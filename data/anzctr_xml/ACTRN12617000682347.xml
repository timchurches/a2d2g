  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is the BeUpstanding program. This 3-month program is designed to support workplaces to sit less through raising awareness, building culture, and creating a supportive environment. The intervention is designed to be run by a workplace champion (a workplace champion can be any staff member but it is recommended that they have the ability to talk to general staff and management).  Via the boarding page of the BeUpstanding website, a staff member who has decided to be a workplace champion can sign up to the free online  BeUpstanding Champion Toolkit. (There is no selection criteria to become a workplace champion). 

Once signed  up, workplace champions are guided step-by-step through program delivery and evaluation via the  online BeUpstanding Champion Toolkit. There are five steps (Step 1: Gaining support from management; Step 2: Needs assessment; Step 3: Preparing for the program; Step 4: Putting the program into practice and 5: Evaluation) that are self-paced. Although it is recommended that the workplace champion complete the five steps over a 3 month period. Each of the steps have accompanying multi-media resources including tips sheets, information videos, email guides and templates and posters. 

 The intervention is designed to be  tailored to each work team, with work teams deciding on the strategies that they will implement as a team to stand up, sit less, and move more. Example strategies include moving bins/printers to a central location and holding regular walking and standing meetings.

      <outcome>Uptake: number of work teams registered. 

Data for the uptake outcomes will be collected at the Registration point via the registration survey (no. of work teams), and the champion survey (characteristics) via the online website. These  surveys have been developed for this study. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Costs - an  economic analysis will be undertaken from a societal perspective, but with the major focus on a workplace perspective (covering both costs and benefits to employers and employees).  The primary economic analysis will comprise analysis of costs, outcomes, and the relationship between costs and outcomes. Included costs will relate to workplace recruitment (promotion events, social media, newsletters, etc.) and intervention delivery (such as the staff information and brainstorming workshop, posters, conduct of toolkit components, champion time, meetings of staff wellbeing committees, maintenance of website, etc.). Data on the strategies adopted by individual work teams (including estimated costs) will be collected via the workplace audit at three and 12 months. All resources will be valued in Australian dollars for the 2018 reference year. The economic outcomes for the implementation study will be presented as total costs, average costs per work team, and per work team of different size. Analysis of who incurs the associated costs (government, employers, individual employees) will be undertaken to assess intervention affordability and sustainability. </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Based on data reported by the champion as part of the online registration process, eligible work teams will be those with: a minimum of five staff; job roles or tasks that predominantly involve desk-based work; and, a staff member willing to perform the duties of a workplace champion. For large organisations, including those located across numerous sites, multiple work teams from the one organisation will be eligible to participate. Once eligibility is confirmed, a unique password will be allocated to allow the champion access to the BeUpstanding Champion Toolkit and associated resources, and enable data to be identified by work team. All employees within a participating work team will be invited by the champion to participate in the program and its evaluation.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this three-year project is to evaluate, in the context of a national implementation trial, an evidence-informed intervention to reduce workplace sitting  the BeUpstanding Champion Toolkit. 

Primary outcomes are: 
1)	Uptake of the Toolkit overall and within the partner-determined priority sectors 
2)	Implementation of the Toolkit by workplace teams
3)	Effectiveness of the Toolkit in reducing employee workplace sitting time 
Hypothesis (two-tailed): the Toolkit will elicit significant changes in workplace sitting time following exposure to the program (at 3 months) and in the long term (at 12 months)
Target is 20 minute reduction per 8-h workday
