  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention  the intervention group will participate in 10 weekly 90 minute workshops relating to general nutrition, physical activity and behaviours, typically held at community and maternal child health centres, where parents and their children attend together. Each program group will consist of 6-10 child-parent dyads and a Mind, Exercise, Nutrition, Do It! (MEND) 2-4 trained program leader. Each session involves 30 minutes of guided active play, where parents can learn how to play with their children; 15 minutes of healthy snack time based on an evidence-based exposure-based technique to promote acceptance and increased intake of fruit and vegetables, and 45 minutes where the children participate in supervised cr√®che style activities and concurrently the parents attend an interactive education and skill development session, based on evidence-based group-based parent-training principles. Baseline assessment of study variables will occur at recruitment. Follow-up assessment will occur at the completion of the 10 week program and at 6 and 12 months post-intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control participants will continue their normal habits until 15 months after recruitment, when they will receive the 10 week program. Baseline assessment of variables will occur at recruitment and follow-up assessment will occur in line with the intervention group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child eating habits and daily dietary intake

The Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) will be used to assess child eating styles/habits, specifically, fussiness and responsiveness to satiety. Typical food intake for children and their parents will be assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire developed by Chief Investigator  Professor Boyd Swinburn for Australian preschool children. The Eating and Physical Activity Questionnaire (EPAQ) is a two page document which asks specifically about foods which have been associated with obesity in the literature - particularly beverages, fruits and vegetables, processed snack foods and takeaway foods. Quantities are in general household measures and refer to either the previous day or typical intake. Standard serving sizes are based on the Australian Guide to Eating. The EPAQ has been assessed against a 24-hour dietary recall in 90 parents of preschoolers and found to be valid. Reliability has been found to be adequate. This method of food recall has low participant burden and hence is both time and cost-efficient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline assessment of study variables will occur at recruitment. Follow-up assessment will occur at the completion of the 10 week program and at 6 and 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of daily child physical and sedentary activities

The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Preschool-aged Children (Pre-PAQ) is a parent self-report measure that provides a list of 24 different types of physical and sedentary activities and requires parents to report on the time spent in the activities their child did ?yesterday? and ?last weekend?. Parental proxy-reporting of their children?s time-use has been used widely in developmental research, including research by CI Skouteris, and has been shown to be a valid method of assessing individual differences in young children?s time-use habits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline assessment of study variables will occur at recruitment. Follow-up assessment will occur at the completion of the 10 week program and at 6 and 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental knowledge of nutrition

Knowledge of child nutrition will be assessed with subscales of the Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline assessment of study variables will occur at recruitment. Follow-up assessment will occur at the completion of the 10 week program and at 6 and 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child Body Mass Index (BMI)

Height and weight will be measured with a stadiometer and standardised digital scales, respectively, at all assessments for children and at baseline, and at the 6 and 12 months follow up assessment time points for parents. Children and parents will be weighed each time wearing light clothing and no shoes. Height and weight measures will then be converted to a BMI (kg/m2) for each participant. BMI will be standardized for age and gender using BMI-for-age z-scores and change will be assessed using BMI z score slope following WHO recommendations for children this age.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline assessment of study variables will occur at recruitment. Follow-up assessment will occur at the completion of the 10 week program and at 6 and 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maternal Child Feeding Patterns

 The Preschool Child Feeding Questionnaire (PCFQ) will measure mother's anxiety about feeding, responsibility for feeding, pressure to eat, and controlling feeding, and her concerns for her child's weight. The Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ) will assess maternal restriction of access to food and monitoring of food.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline assessment of study variables will occur at recruitment. Follow-up assessment will occur at the completion of the 10 week program and at 6 and 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental modelling of physical and sedentary activities

The Active Australia Survey (a validated questionnaire that measures physical activity behaviour in adults) will be used to measure parental engagement in physical and sedentary activities (duration and nature); this is retrospectively reported by parents for last 7 days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline assessment of study variables will occur at recruitment. Follow-up assessment will occur at the completion of the 10 week program and at 6 and 12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall goal of the current project is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to measure the effectiveness of the MEND 2-4 program. The intervention will provide information to parents and support them to establish and/or maintain healthy behaviours and attitudes around diet and physical activity for themselves and their preschool child(ren). 
In comparison to the wait-list control group, at the completion of the 10-week intervention program, and at 6 and 12 months post intervention, the intervention group preschoolers will: (1) demonstrate greater consumption of fruit and vegetables, and a decrease in consumption of high fat, high sugar cordials, soft-drinks and juices and non-essential, energy dense snack foods; (2) exhibit less problematic eating habits, specifically higher responsiveness to satiety, less fussiness, and less neophobia; (3) demonstrate greater increases in physical activity and greater decreases in time spent in sedentary behaviours, specifically TV viewing; (4) exhibit lower BMI-for-age z scores. 
In comparison to the wait-list control group, at the completion of the intervention program, and at 6 and 12 months post intervention, the intervention group parents will: (1) increase the frequency with which they limit the offering of high fat, high sugar cordials, soft-drinks and juices and non-essential, energy dense snack foods to their child; (2) increase the frequency with which they offer vegetables and fruit, water and milk (rather than cordials, soft-drinks and juices) to their child; (3) demonstrate improved knowledge regarding key aspects of child eating, physical activity and sedentary behaviours relevant to the prevention of obesity and improving child health generally; (4) reduce the frequency with which they use restrictive feeding practices and increase the frequency with which they use covert methods of controlling access to unhealthy foods; (5) increase the frequency with which they model healthy behaviours around diet and physical activity; (6) provide greater opportunities for children to engage in physical activity and reduce their opportunities for engagement in sedentary behaviours.</summary>
