  <interventions>
    <interventions>Recombinant "LH" Luteinising Hormone (Luveris), after 6 days of "FSH" follicle stimulating hormoneadministration during IVF treatment.
The group randomised into LH (Luteinising Hormone) treatment will receive recombinant LH at a dose of 75IU daily from day 7 of FSH (the day after randomisation) to the trigger injection, which on average will be 5 to 6 days. The treatement group will also receive the standard FSH daily dose. The non-treatment group receives the standrd FSH (which will differ on a case by case basis, based on age and ovarian reserve) injections only (again this will be for an average of 5-6 days). The is a third group in which the serum LH levels are normal. They are not randomised and act as a comparator and will receive standard FSH treatment. Hence no one will have any standard treatment withdrwn.</interventions>

    <concealment>Subjects are enrolled prior to IVF. If they experience a 50% or greater reduction in LH levels they are randomized into treatment or control. The randomisation is computer generated and web based. The subjects were unaware of which group they would be enrolled in. Allocation was determined by central computer randomisation. Allocation was thus concealled.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary Aim: To assess the effect of recombinant LH (rLH) use in patients undergoing IVF/ICSI who experience a 50% or more reduction in serum LH concentrations from the early to mid follicular phase.
IVFAustralia has performed a retrospective pilot cohort study, which in 701 cycles of IVF/ICSI revealed that a reduction 50% or greater from early to mid-follicular LH concentrations resulted in significant reduction in live-birth rate (Lahoud et. al., 2006).
Research Design:Prospective Randomised Controlled Trial 
Study population: Patients undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment at IVFAusralia.
Intervention: The treatment group will receive 75 IU of rLH (Luveris) from day 7 of FSH administration until and including the day of HCG administration.
 Primary outcome: Clinical Pregnancy Rate</summary>
