  <interventions>
    <interventions>The proposed RCT of modular Teacher Training (TT) with/without Parent Training (PT) for early onset CP follows the development of Hitkashruts PT for preschoolers with CP and the completion of a 3-year RCT. Currently, Hitkashruts PT is being disseminated, while a recently developed TT intervention has been implemented in 2013-4 by trained educational psychologists who are working in 6 cities that are already providing PT. Hitkashruts TT is a classwide program with an optional Individualized Positive Behavior Support component (IPBS). The modular design of TT and the option of a conjoining TTCI and PT enable the testing of interventions with increasing level of intensity. TT is our general term for teacher training. At minimum it is Teacher Training Classwide (TTC) and at maximum it is Teacher Training Classwide bolstered by the IPBS component (TTCI). The 4-group design includes the following conditions: 1. A no intervention Control group (CONT); 2. Teacher Training Classwide (TTC); 3. TTC bolstered by an IPBS component (TTCI); 4. TTCI with the addition of PT (TTCI+PT).
Interventions: 
PT:  PT groups of 5-7 couples (mother and father) meet for 14 two-hour weekly semi-structured sessions co-facilitated by two group leaders. The overall strategy focuses on reducing negative, coercive and inconsistent interactions while increasing security,regulation, and cooperation in parent-child, parent-teacher, and teacher-child relationships.
TT: Hitkashruts model has been adapted to the kindergarten context. The 30-hour 10-session program incorporates established TT practices such as classroom management (e.g., the Good Behavior Game) that were culturally adapted, Teacher self-regulation, Discipline skills, etc. Altogether, the program reflects Hitkashruts strategic emphasis on strengthening secure, regulated, and cooperative relationships. For the TTC interventions, the teachers need to attend ten 3-hour training sessions. They begin to administer the intervention to students during the course of training. The additional component of TTCI intervention (IPBS) is administered when the teachers attend additional ten 3-hour training sessions. Again, they administer the intervention to students during the course of training.The IPBS is administered when the teachers create a contingency management intervention with an individual student. It is administered over a period of 2-3 month during which the teachers learn how to implement the intervention and are participating in the training.

Hitkashruts TT and PT incorporates at home/school behavioral management procedures that we term Individualized Positive Behavior Support (IPBS). IPBS targets both negative/inconsistent and positive parent/teacher practices. 
(e.g., praise, tangible rewards, and differential reinforcement).

For groups that receive more than one intervention, the interventions are administered simultaneously. 

Regarding strategies used to monitor adherence to the intervention, the facilitators monitor adherence during the training sessions by regularly opening each session with a report on the implementation of the interventions, followed by a discussion of specific problems or issues faced by the teachers. We also use program a program adherence questionnaire that is filled by teachers and facilitators at the end of training.

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We will use a random numbers generator to first assign teachers who intend to enroll in Hitkashrut‘s TT to either TT or another course provided in their local Pisgah, and then assign the parents to intervention and control groups. Allocation will be concealed by numbered containers. The candidate parents and teachers will be informed about the interventions and randomization procedure. Parents and teachers who consent and commit to PT and TT respectively, either in the current year if allocated or to next year’s training, will join the study. They will be informed that delivery of next year’s PT and TT is conditional since the programs are publically funded, but past experience indicates that training groups have been regularly opened once they were established in a particular location. There would be 6 intervention and 6 control kindergartens in each city. Using this randomization procedure, 3 children from each intervention kindergarten will be assigned to each of the 3 intervention groups, while one of 3 selected children in each control kindergarten will be assigned to CONT. This procedure fulfills ethical standards while ensuring similar level of parental motivation in different groups, thus controlling for selection bias. The groups will be compared on relevant characteristics to ensure that they do not differ significantly.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Advancement in developing best practices for preschool conduct problems and in the dissemination of these practices into service delivery systems is essential given the prevalence, continuity, and long-term effects of early onset conduct problems (CP). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in real world settings enable the testing of effectiveness, mechanisms of change, and outcome mediators and moderators, all of which contribute to scientific understanding, practice, and policy. Comparative RCTs of modular programs can be particularly informative and advance the development of effective and disseminable interventions. 
The proposed RCT of modular Teacher Training (TT) with/without Parent Training (PT) for early onset CP follows the development of Hitkashruts PT for preschoolers with CP and the completion of a 3-year RCT. Hitkashruts TT is a classwide program with an optional Individualized Positive Behavior Support component (IPBS). The modular design of TT and the option of a conjoining TTCI and PT enable the testing of interventions with increasing level of intensity.
Our objectives are: 1. Testing the effectiveness of each intervention vs. CONT; 2. Testing the comparative effectiveness TTCI+PT vs. TTC, TTCI vs. TTC, and TTCI+PT vs. TTCI; 3. Testing outcome mediators at the relationship and child level; 4. Testing IPBS as a mechanism of change in both parent and teacher groups during the course of TTCI+PT and TTCI; 5. Testing moderators to determine for whom or under what conditions treatment is effective; 6. Analyzing antisocial developmental trajectories with respect to both childrens and relationship variables.
