  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Time2bHealthy intervention is a 12-week online behaviour change program, consisting of six modules on topics including nutrition, physical activity, screen-time and sleep.  Each module takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and modules are completed over a two-week period.  Each module can be completed in one session or a number of sessions over the two-week period. The modules requires some reading, watching videos, completing activities and setting goals.  Feedback will be provided by health consultants via the website regarding the goals set, with advice provided to enhance the goals in line with the SMART goal framework.  Feedback and support will be provided in regard to the participants progress with the goal. Feedback on goals and progress will be provided on a fortnightly basis.   Additionally, participants will receive weekly emails to remind them to log onto the website.  A closed (secret) Facebook group will be accessible to participants.  The group will be regularly monitored and moderated to ensure that the information discussed is consistent with evidence-based guidelines.  Participants will be asked to provide regular input to the group by sharing recipes/photos of meals, healthy snacks, suitable physical activities and personal ideas and experiences in regard to reducing screen time and improving sleep. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants assigned to the control group will receive fortnightly emails directing them to various topics on the evidence-based, government-funded parenting website: Raising Children Network.  The topics provided will be of a similar nature to the intervention group (nutrition, physical activity, screen-time and sleep).  The control group will not have access to any interactive components such as practical activities, goal setting and individualised feedback.  Additionally, the control group will be offered access to the Time2bHealthy program at the completion of the follow-up data collection (approximately 12 months after the intervention group); however, due to budget and time constraints, participants will not receive feedback on the goals set or access to the Facebook group.</comparator>

      <outcome>Child BMI / BMI zscore / BMI percentile
BMI will be assessed using a stadiometer and digital scales using standard procedures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months and 12 months post commencement of intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child dietary intake will be assessed using a 24-hour recall (using the Easy Diet Diary app) and dietary questions from the Eating and Physical Activity Questionnaire (EPAQ) (Bennett et al 2009)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months, 6 months and 12 months post commencement of intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child physical activity.  All child participants will wear an Actigraph accelerometer around the waist on an elasticised belt continuously for a period of seven days. Actigraphs will be fitted to participants at the time of the initial and subsequent appointment and participants will return them in a reply paid envelope. Parents will be provided with instructions on how to remove and re-fit the device.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months, 6 months and 12 months post commencement of intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child screen-time.  Parents will complete a questionnaire to estimate the usual amount of screen time for their child on a typical weekday and weekend day to determine average screen time per week, the availability of screens and rules about screen entertainment. The questions are based on a questionnaire previously assessed for reliability (Downing et al., 2015, Hinkley et al., 2012).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months, 6 months and 12 months post commencement of intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child sleep behaviours.  Eight sleep questions will be completed by parent participants. The questionnaire has been modified from a tool which has been previously validated in the preschool age group (Childrens Sleep Habits Questionnaire)(Sneddon et al., 2013) and includes questions about typical bedtime and wake up time, typical time and duration of daytime nap and other sleep habits.  The information from this questionnaire will be utilised in conjunction with accelerometer data to determine sleep duration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months, 6 months and 12 months post commencement of intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parent self-efficacy.  Parents will complete a questionnaire asking about their self-efficacy relating to their childs nutrition, physical activity, screen time and sleep.  This questionnaire consists of 13 questions and has been modified from a previously validated questionnaire -The Parental Self-efficacy for Promoting Healthy Physical Activity and Dietary Behaviors in Children Scale (Bohman et al., 2013).  </outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be enrolled in four cohorts of 40 parent and preschool-aged child dyads each.  Participants will be recruited from a number of community settings.    After eligibility is confirmed and baseline measures are collected, participants in each cohort will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control arm of the study.  Randomisation will be conducted using a computer generated random number by a staff member who is not involved in the recruitment or intervention phases of the study.  </concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>At the completion of the intervention, data will be analysed to determine the following:
1.	 Change in child BMI / BMI z-score of intervention group participants compared to control group participants
2.	Change in dietary intake in the intervention group compared to the control group 
3.	Change in light, moderate and vigorous physical activity (LMVPA) duration of the intervention group compared to the control group (assessed via accelerometer)
4.	Change in sedentary time in the intervention group compared to the control group (assessed via accelerometer)
5.	Change in screen-time in the intervention group compared to the control group
6.	Change in sleep duration in the intervention group compared to the control group
7.	Change in parental self-efficacy in the intervention group compared to the control group
8.	Influence of potential mediator variables
The research hypotheses will be tested by comparing the Time2bHealthy (intervention) and control groups.  ANCOVA or repeated measures tests will be used to analyse the data to determine differences by group (Time2bHealthy  vs control) in changes between baseline and 12 weeks in all outcome measures.  Because of the multiple follow-up time points at 6 and 12 months, linear mixed models will be used to analyse the data to determine differences by group (Time2bHealthy vs control) over time (baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months) adjusting for potential covariates

Based on a pilot study conducted, an effect size of 0.4 is estimated.  Based on this effect size,  a statistical consultant has confirmed that 136 participants would be required (68 each group) and considering an estimated attrition rate of 15%, 160 participants would need to be recruited (80 per group).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous reviews have investigated the impact of technology-based overweight and obesity interventions in childhood with some studies reporting changes in adiposity, dietary and/or physical activity outcomes.  Parent-focussed eHealth studies have not been well investigated to date and there is an absence of studies targeting children under the age of five years, an age group where parental influence is probably the most profound.  

This study is a two-arm randomised controlled trial, underpinned by Social Cognitive Theory.  To be eligible to participate, children must be pre-school-aged (2-5 years) and overweight or obese or be at risk of becoming overweight or obese.  The Time2bHealthy intervention is a 12-week online behaviour change program, consisting of modules on nutrition, physical activity, screen-time and sleep.  The key component of the program is the setting and revision of goals following completion of each of the modules.  The control group will receive emails directing them to various topics on an evidence-based parenting website.  

The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of a parent-focussed lifestyle behaviour change program in facilitating behaviour change among families with a preschool aged child who is overweight or at risk of becoming overweight.  The study aims to bring about change via an online program where parents are the agents of change.  Outcomes such as child body mass index, diet, physical activity, screen-time, sleep and parent self-efficacy will be assessed.  The study will make an important contribution to the literature by addressing an acknowledged gap in regard to internet interventions for the prevention and/or treatment of childhood obesity where parents are the agent of change as there is currently an absence of randomised controlled trails in the preschool age group.
