    <interventions>Patient participants recruited in practices in the active arm will have an individual management plan developed by the research team in consultation with their general practitioner. Community and practice nurses, trained in a model of behaviour change based on motivational interviewing to improve self-efficacy, will work in partnership with participants to achieve behavioural change through a cycle of goal setting and action planning during regular telephone contacts over 12 months.  Goals will focus on health behaviours identified in the management plan to support patients to develop capacity to self-manage their chronic illness.</interventions>

The study design is cluster randomised by general practice, with 10 patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease recruited per practice and outcome data analysed at individual patient level using mixed models to compare mean change in the outcome factors between each arm of the study, with the practice declared a random factor to account for clustering of patients within practices.</concealment>
    <sequence>The unit of randomisation is the general practice to avoid contamination between groups. They will be randomised to active or control intervention using computer generated random numbers with stratification for rurality and socio-economic demographics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major contributor to the burden of disease in Australia. Increasing prevalence of chronic diseases has seen a shift in patient care paradigms towards disease specific programmes that focus on self-management. This new model for COPD care involving mentoring by trained nurses to increase self-efficacy aims to improve the health-related quality of life of people with COPD, while reducing associated healthcare costs through the early identification and treatment of acute exacerbations. 
Research Plan: A randomised study of participants with COPD recruited from general practices compares the model with usual care. Participants recruited to the active arm will have an individual management plan developed by the research team in consultation with their general practitioner. Nurses, trained in methods to improve self-efficacy, will work in partnership with participants to achieve behavioural change through a cycle of goal setting and action planning, focussing on health behaviours identified in the management plan. Outcomes will include health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, healthcare utilisation, lung function and physical activity.</summary>
