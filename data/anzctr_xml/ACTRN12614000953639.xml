  <interventions>
    <interventions>Use of the Kanmed WarmCloud as an underbody intraoperative warming device. This differs from the comparator (Bair Hugger) which is also an underbody warming blanket in a couple of important ways. Firstly the Bair Hugger has holes in the blanket allowing convection currents to flow around the patient. The WarmCloud has no holes and lifts the patient up (Like a LiLo) relying more on conduction. In lifting the patient up it also provides a greater contact area (as the patient's weight on the BairHugger occludes some of the holes) and provides some pressure relief.
The device is to be used for the entire duration of the surgery and will be set at 42 degrees. If core temperature hits 37.0 it will be reduced to 32 and if core temperature hits 37.5 it will be reduced to 22. The pressure settings will be start at 30 cm H2o and adjusted to weight.</interventions>
    <comparator>Bair Hugger underbody warming blanket
The description is above.
It will be used for the entirety of the surgical procedure.
It will be set to 43 degrees initially. If temp hits 37 it will be reduced to 32 degrees and if temp hits 37.5 or above to ambient temperature.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation
From a previous study we have estimated that the standard distribution of temperatures prior to reperfusion is 0.41. A significant difference between groups would be 0.5. With an alpha level (p value) of 0.05, a beta value of 0.8, an estimated standard deviation of 0.41, and an estimated change in temperature of 0.5 degrees we would need a sample size of 26 patients.
To allow for data loss we aim to recruit 30 patients.
This sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome only 

Statistical Analysis
We will use descriptive statistical terms to describe the demographics of our study group. 
The Ryan-Joiner test will be used to check that the distribution of temperatures are normally distributed. If normally distributed, unpaired t tests will be used to compare the two groups. In the event that these variables are not normally distributed then a Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used. As well as the p value, the mean change and 95% confidence intervals will be reported for normally distributed variables, median and inter-quartile range for non-parametric variables.
