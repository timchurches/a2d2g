  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cognitive dysfunction is defined as an abnormal impairment in memory and concentration. It is associated with a number of medical conditions such as aging, mental illness, dementia and cancer patients.  It also occurs  in patients following surgery. The objective of this observational study is to identify if a correlation exists between reconstructive surgery and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Our hypothesis is that this correlation does exist. Patients undergoing reconstructive surgery will participate in a series of tests examining memory and concentration at differing points along their reconstructive treatment. Identifying reconstructive surgery as a risk factor of POCD and improving the knowledge transfer to patients contemplating breast reconstruction is our goal of this study.</summary>
