    <interventions>Prospective evaluation of clinical decision making in critically ill patients.
Prospectively evaluate all the factors that influence clinical decision making of when to commence early rehabilitation in intensive care units. These factors will be identified through an extensive literature review and consultation with international experts who have published in the area of early rehabilitation in critically ill patients. Doctors, Nurses and Physiotherapists will be asked if the patient in front of them is ready to complete early mobilisation. If the therapist responds "No" they will then be asked to rank the factors that have influenced their decision. The duration of clinician involvement will be the time it takes to come to their decision each day. The participant who the decision is being made about will remain in the study for duration of their ICU stay or until 3 consecutive days of rehab occur. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Following discussion with the team statistician, Leonid Churilov and a senior ICU clinicians, the use of three different decision makers and twelve  outcome variables, 1420 observations were required to allow sufficient splitting of nodes in a classification and regression analysis as the splitting of nodes ceases when the node arrived at is relatively homogeneous in relation to the outcome variable, or contains too few observations. One thousand four hundred and twenty observations will mean cessation at a node is dependent on node homogeneity relating to the variable rather than a consequence of too few observations. No formal power calculation was performed. 

Descriptive statistics using frequencies and percentages will be used for categorical data. For continuous data mean and standard deviation or median and inter-quartile range for non-parametric data will be recorded. Weighted Kappas, Student t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests will be used to determine differences between groups for continuous variables. Pearson chi square test of independence will be used to analyse the difference between categorical data. Alpha will be set at p&lt;0.05

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Survivors of the intensive care unit (ICU) can suffer long standing impairments in physical function. Rehabilitation provided in the ICU has been shown to improve physical function outcomes at both hospital discharge and 12-months. Early rehabilitation has been shown to be safe and feasible and may help prevent the long term sequelae. However, early rehabilitation is not routinely implemented in ICU due to cultural barriers and a lack of well-defined safety parameters, it currently relies on the discretion of the clinicians caring for the patient. Clinician's decisions can be influenced by conventional wisdom, personal experience, intuition and knowledge. The factors that clinicians consider to be important in the decision to provide rehabilitation, particularly out of bed functional activities in the ICU, are currently unknown. Therefore we aim to identify the factors that influence the initiation of early rehabilitation and develop a decision making support tree that includes safety parameters to assist clinicians in the provision of early rehabilitation for patients in ICU. </summary>
