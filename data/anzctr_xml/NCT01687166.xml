  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedure-related complication free rate - The safety of the Blazer OI catheter will be evaluated by demonstrating that the investigational group serious adverse event rate is non-inferior to that of the control group</outcome>
      <timepoint>7-days post-index procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedure-related complication free rate (continued) - The safety of the Blazer OI catheter will be evaluated by demonstrating that the investigational group rate of significant pulmonary vein stenosis (=70% reduction in diameter from baseline) and atrio-esophageal fistulas is non-inferior to that of the control group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 12 months of the index procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Chronic success rate - The primary effectiveness of the Blazer OI catheter will be evaluated by demonstrating that the proportion of subjects free from failure* in the investigational group is non-inferior to those in the control group.
*failure is defined as a randomized subject being an acute procedural failure, having more than one repeat procedure during the 90 day blanking period or having a documented symptomatic atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation between 91 days and 12 months post-procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 12 months of the index procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute Success - Demonstration that the investigational group acute procedural success rate is non-inferior to that of the control group. Acute procedural success is defined as a subject that successfully had all clinically relevant veins electrically isolated, by demonstration of entrance block at a minimum and no evidence of exit conduction with the randomized investigational or control catheter only.</outcome>
      <timepoint>20 minutes after the last radiofrequency application to isolate the pulmonary vein</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
