  <interventions>
    <interventions>DUR-928 powder for constitution of intramuscular injection.
Each dose of DUR-928 is given as a single intramuscular injection into the gluteal muscle (buttock). 
Each subject will receive a single dose of DUR-928 according to the cohort they are participating in.
The study will look at the effect of DUR-928 when given as a single dose at 3 different dose levels. All doses will be administered and supervised by study staff. The doses of the intervention are described below per cohort:
Cohort 1: 30mg DUR-928 (as an injection of 1mL)
Cohort 2: 120mg DUR-928 (as an injection of 4mL)
The solution used for constitution consists of 250 mg/mL hydroxypropyl betadex, NF (hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin), 0.276 mg/mL of sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, USP, and 1.136 mg/mL sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, USP, in sterile water for injection, USP. The final concentration of DUR-928 is 30 mg/mL.
All doses will be administered and supervised by study staff. For each cohort, participants will be confined to the study unit for a total of 3 nights and 3 days, and have to attend the unit for additional 3 out-patient visits (including the screening visit). Study participants may take part in more than one cohort, as long as a washout period of at least 4 weeks is observed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two ascending active doses will be tested as a single dose; comparison will be done between the two dose levels as well as between patients with kidney disease and healthy controls receiving the same intervention.
Healthy volunteers are allocated to the same dose cohorts as the kidney failure patients, and serve as the control group at each dose level.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety of DUR-928 in subjects with impaired kidney function and matched control subjects with normal kidney function</outcome>
      <timepoint>Routine vital sign measurements (temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate will be measured at screening, at check-in (day -1), pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose and at trial completion (between day 7 and day 10 post-dose).

    <designfeatures>2 cohorts (6 kidney disease patients and 3 healthy control subjects per cohort) will be given a single intramuscular dose of DUR-928.

    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Safety:
For laboratory test, vital signs and ECGS, baseline data will be assessed at Day-1.  Summary statistics will be prepared for measured values and changes from baseline values by dose cohort.  Summaries of treatment-emergent clinically significant abnormalities in ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory values will be provided.  Individual data for 12-lead ECGs, vital signs measurements, and physical examination findings will be listed by subject.
Pharmacokinetics:
Plasma concentrations of DUR-928 and 25-HC from each subject will be used to calculate relevant pharmacokinetic parameters using standard non-compartmental methods with linear/log-trapezoidal rule.  Calculations will be performed using an appropriate pharmacokinetic data analysis program. Pharmacokinetic parameters for DUR-928 will be summarized by subject using descriptive statistics.
Biomarkers:
The biomarker data at baseline (pre-dose) and at each post-dose time point will be plotted and listed for each subject for evaluation of any change from baseline over time. The summary of absolute change in each biomarker will be presented by dose level and kidney function status.
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no inferential analysis will be performed. Therefore, power or sample size calculations have not been performed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is being conducted to look at how safe and well tolerated a new drug called DUR-928 is when given as an intramuscular injection to subjects with chronic kidney disease when compared with healthy control subjects. The study will look at the study drugs effect when given as a single-dose injection at 2 different dose levels. The pharmacokinetics of DUR-928 will also be studied; this is done by measuring the amount of DUR-928 in the blood at different times throughout the dosing periods, allowing us to evaluate how DUR-928 is handled by the body (for example how quickly it gets into the blood stream). The pharmacodynamics will also be studied; this is done by measuring the amount of selected biomarkers in the blood and/or urine at different times throughout the dosing periods, allowing us to evaluate the effect of DUR-928 on the body.</summary>
