  <interventions>
    <interventions>This 12 month qualitative action research study uses a cyclic process to implement change in clinical practice. There are no control groups.

Intervention strategies have included a 2 day communication skills workshop, the use of a Supportive Care Needs Screening Tool in routine clinical practice, the documentation of resources in a guide, and participating in supervision of clinical practice for three months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is proposed to test the refinement and dissemination of the C-CARE model of psychosocial assessment more broadly across the tumour streams at Peter Mac in the first instance and then to further refine the model in the Western and Central ICS (W&amp;CICS) and in two Regional Integrated Cancer Services. The impetus for this project is two fold: the publication of the NHMRC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Psychosocial Care of Adults with Cancer (NBCC &amp; NCCI 2003) and the prioritization of psychosocial assessment within the Victorian Cancer Services Improvement Program. Funding for this project has been provided by the Department of Human Services.</summary>
