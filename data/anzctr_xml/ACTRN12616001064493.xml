  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective phase I dose-escalation study. Patients will receive a single fraction of SABR to a single site at an increasing dose and at different times while on Immunotherapy. A minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled at each increasing dose level, if safe and no grade 3 toxicities occur as assessed by the PI, the next 3 patients will be enrolled at the increased dose level until MTD is established. If these are tolerated, patients will receive SABR before each cycle, delivered to a different site at the highest possible dose tolerated by that site. 
For SABR:
All SABR treatments will be delivered in the week before up to the same day as  immunotherapy
Level 1: 10Gy to a single site before cycle 1
Level 2: 15Gy to a single site before cycle 1
Level 3a: 20Gy to a single site before cycle 1
Level 3b: 20Gy to a single site before cycle 2
Level 3c: 20Gy to a single site before cycle 3
Level 3d: 20Gy to a single site before cycle 4
Level 4: 24Gy to a single site before cycle 1 (peripheral lung and liver only)
Level 5: 27Gy to a single site before cycle 1 (peripheral lung and liver only)
Level 6: 30Gy to a single site before cycle 1 (peripheral lung and liver only)
Level 7: Highest SABR dose before as many cycles as possible

The PI or treatung Radiation Oncologist will decide the site to receive SABR

For Immunotherapy:
Patients will be treated according to Medical Oncology standard of care. Each patients treating doctor will decide which drug is most appropriate for each individual case.

*Ipilimumab will consist of four cycles of 3mg/kg, delivered IV every 3 weeks until progression.
*Nivoloumab will be delivered as per expanded access program, with a dose of 3mg/kg IV every two weeks for up to 96 weeks or until progression
*Pembrolizumab will be delivered as per expanded access program, with a dose of 2mg/kg IV every three weeks for up to 2 years or until progression
A standard 3+3 design will be used, whereby at least 3 patients are enrolled into each dose level. If no patients experience grade 3 or higher toxicity, escalation to the next level is permitted. If 1 out of 3 patients experience toxicity a further 3 patients are enrolled at that dose level and if none of these experience toxicity, escalation is permitted. If 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience toxicity, then escalation ceases and the prior dose level is defined as maximum tolerated dose.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Using a standard 3+3 design, if 2 of 3 patients develop DLT at a particular dose, we can conclude with 90% confidence that the true probability of DLT at that dose is greater than 20%. Similarly, if 0 of 3 patients develop DLT at a particular dose, we can conclude with 90% confidence that the true probability of DLT at that dose is less than 55%. Expanding to 6 patients, when 1 of 3 patients develop DLT this ensures that there is a 91% probability escalation will be halted when the true probability of DLT is less than 10% and 92% probability escalation will not proceed when the true probability of DLT is greater than 60%.
Biologic endpoints will be correlated with clinical and survival endpoints using the Students t-test or Fishers Exact Test.
Survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences compared using the log-rank test. A Cox multivariable regression analysis will be used to determine baseline and treatment factors predictive of survival.
A power calculation was not performed as this is a phase 1 study assessing safety</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in combination with immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and to determine whether the treatment has any clinical efficacy.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with non-oligometastatic stage IV melanoma.

Study details
You will be participating in a phase I study. Although SABR is generally safe on its own, it is not clear how safe it is in combination with immune activating drugs. To find out we will start by giving a very low dose of SABR, which we think will be safe for almost all patients and slowly increase the dose to a level, which we think will be effective.
Patients participating in this study will all receive a drug that activates their immune system and you will discuss this further with your doctor. These drugs will be delivered in a standard fashion, with at least 4 doses delivered every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or until you no longer are gaining benefit.. By participating in this study, a few days before you receive the drug you will receive SABR to one of your disease sites.
You will be followed up for up to 5 years on this study

It is hoped that findings from this trial will provide information on the maximum tolerated dose, and the level of efficacy of each dose level of SABR with immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.</summary>
