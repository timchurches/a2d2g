  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1:
Anthocyanin capsules from Bilberrie and Black Currants containing 80 mg anthocyanin citrates per capsule ( daily consumption 4 capsules = 320 mg anthocyanin per day for 4 weeks).
Arm 2:
Aspirin 81 mg per tablet (1 tablet daily for 4 weeks)
There will be 4 weeks of washout period between 2 crossover arms. Each participants will receive both arms of the treatment with random allocation to (generated by computer) either arm 1 as first treatment or arm 2 as first treatment with a cross over after 4 weeks washout period. 
Compliance will be monitored by followup phone calls a week after starting the intervention and again a week before returning back for post treatment blood collection. Each participant will be provided with a few extra tablets (different numbers) and they will be asked to return left over tablets. The count of returned tablet will check for compliance.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes results in an increase in the stickiness of platelets, which may result in blockage of arteries and other cardiovascular diseases. This is usually prevented with conventional cardiovascular medication (most commonly used Aspirin).
Aspirin is a commonly used antiplatelet therapy (blood thinner) for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, it has greatly reduced efficacy in diabetes.
This project is being conducted to evaluate an alternative to aspirin such as anthocyanin which is an antioxidant that has been shown to reduce narrowing of arteries.
This study will compare the protective effects of aspirin with anthocyanin supplement, which is a rich natural antioxidant, on platelet (blood cells involved in clotting of blood and when not functioning normally can lead to risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, heart attack or other heart diseases) function and activity as well as lipid (cholesterol and other fats) profile and inflammation. Any decrease in platelet activity and improvement in lipid profile and inflammation following the treatment will be suggestive of decreased thrombotic (narrowing and blocking of arteries responsible for heart attack and strokes) tendency and risk of heart disease in patients with diabetes.
One hundred participants from 4 groups (normal healthy, diabetes with history of cardiovascular diasese, diabetes without cardiovascular disease and pre-diabetes populations) will consume either aspirin tablets 81 mg/day (1 tablet daily) or 320mg (4 tablets daily) anthocyanins (antioxidants from billberries and blackcurrant) for four weeks each as first treatment. they will then take second treatment after 4 weeks washout period. The fasting blood and urine sample will be collected at the baseline and post first treatment and again pre and post second treatment. 
Each blood sample will be tested for full blood examination, 3 different types of platelet function tests, coagulation profile, inflammation marker, HbA1c, lipid profile, uric acid and full blood + urine antioxidant levels and microalbumin.
The data from this study will be used to guide management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy more effectively in this population.
