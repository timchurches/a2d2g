  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The specific aims of the study are to test the following hypotheses:

        -  That there is a difference in change in visual acuity resulting from treatment with
           intravitreal bevacizumab compared with dexamethasone implant in eyes with advanced
           macular oedema

        -  That there is a difference in degree of resolution of macular oedema resulting from
           treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab compared with dexamethasone implant in eyes with
           advanced macular oedema

        -  That both intravitreal bevacizumab and dexamethasone implants have a manageable and
           acceptable safety profile in eyes with diabetic macular oedema</summary>
