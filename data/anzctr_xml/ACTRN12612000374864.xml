Adaptive randomisation stratified for maturation will be used to assign participants to the active or placebo group. Allocation concealment will be achieved using opaque envelopes. Participants and researchers will be blinded to group allocation and to supplement type. Active and placebo supplements will be identical in colour, taste, and appearance. All participants will take the supplement daily with a meal of their choice for 6 months and will receive identical monthly reminders via their preferred method of communication (text message, email, or letter).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We propose to conduct a 6-month, randomised, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation in improving bone material properties at the distal tibia and radius in young male jockeys. The three-dimensional capacity of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) to assess bone strength and estimates of fracture risk will be superior to previous reports using Dual X-ray Absorptiometry and will contribute new knowledge to the literature. Bone scans at baseline and 6-months will provide a better understanding of the relationship between supplementation and bone properties, including fracture risk. 

Project Aims
We will test the hypothesis that 800 mg calcium (citrate and carbonate) and 400 IU vitamin D per day is effective in improving bone material properties and reducing fracture risk in young male jockeys by; 
(i)	comparing changes to strength stain index (bone strength) at the tibia and radius in participants assigned to receive a 6-month calcium and vitamin D supplementation or a placebo
Secondary aims are to:
(i)	monitor the proportion of young male jockeys who meet the recommended daily intake of calcium (1300 mg/day)
(ii)	compare the effects of supplementation on weight-bearing (tibia) and non weight-bearing (radius and ulna) bones</summary>
