  <interventions>
    <interventions>We  changed the intervention from a management. to a prophylactic trial. The film is now  applied from day one of radiation therapy until the end of the trial or until moist desquamation occurs. If moist desquamation occurs then these patches will be covered by the standard dressing that is used in each department.
The skin area of interest will be identified from the treatment plans and comprise of a skin area of at least 5 cm2 with a uniform high dose (&gt;40Gy). Thi sarea will be divided into two similar halves, one half will be randomized to film and the other to cream.

    <concealment>Protocol has changed from a management to a preventative trial. Based on the RT plan, an area of high dose (&gt;30Gy) of at least 5 by 10 cm will be selected and divided into 2 equal halves. One half will be randomized to Mepitel Film, the other to sorbolene cream.

Randomization of which half will be covered in film and which half in cream is done centrally based on computer-generated random numbers, provided by a biostatistician at the University of Otago, Wellington. The research radiation therapist sends a randomization request to the PI, Dr Herst who will allocate the superior/lateral or the inferior/medial to either film of cream based on the computer-generated numbers.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Participants will act as their own controls. The treatment plan will be used to identify a skin area of &gt;5cm2 that has the highest skin dose. This area will be divided into two equal parts. One part will be randomly assigned to the Mepitel Film arm and the other half will be treated with sorbolene cream. Randomization will be based on computer generated random numbers. The trial cannot be blinded because of the obvious differences between film and cream.  </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study to determine the percentage of moist desquamation in the skin treated with sorbolene cream and that treated with Mepitel Film. Based on the results of this study we will be able to determine the number of participants needed to power a larger international study to 80% with an alpha of 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Background

External beam irradiation is a common treatment option for most solid cancers.  Although the skin of all patients receives a certain amount of radiation, the skin dose in patients with tumours close to the skin is high enough to cause severe reactions (moist desquamation). This is the case for 40-60% of breast and head and neck cancer patients.  Severe skin reactions can be very painful and affect patient quality of life as well as increasing the chance of developing infections.

Our previous three skin trials showed that soft silicone dressings decreased skin reaction severity in breast cancer patients in New Zealand (13).  The dressings adhere closely to the folds and creases of the skin and prevent friction damage (due to items of clothing or other skin parts) to the radiation damaged skin (4). 

Damage protection by the dressings is best when they are used from the start of radiation treatment, resulting in a 90% reduction of skin reaction severity and a complete lack of moist desquamation (3). However, using dressings from the start of radiation treatment is not always practical. If started when the skin shows faint erythema (redness), the dressings decrease skin reaction severity up to 40% but do not affect moist desquamation rates (1,2). Mepitel Film has so far only been used in the preventative setting in breast cancer patients who received a skin dose of less than 40Gy.

In addition to investigating the effect of Mepitel Film, we also want to measure the effect of patient stress levels on skin reaction severity. Our previous trial showed that breast cancer patients who are highly stressed during their course of radiation therapy have a much higher chance of developing moist desquamation.  We wish to confirm these findings in a cohort of head and neck cancer patients.
