  <interventions>
    <interventions>Melatonin (0.5mg) will be adminstered via oral tablet day 1 hour prior to bedtime for a minimum of 5 nights per week for a duration of 4 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>participants will receive melatonin placebo capsules (same in appearance as treatment) and be instructed to take them 1 hour prior to their desired bedtime, for the 4 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compared to placebo, melatonin treatment will result in objectively recorded earlier sleep times. Sleep related impairments will be assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Also Actiwatches will be worn by participants to record sleep-wake behaviour.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sleeps times will be recorded prior and during melatonin treatment. This will be for a period of approximately 4-6 weeks and will be compared.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compared to placebo, melatonin treatment will result in reduced subjective sleep-related daytime impairments assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Also Actiwatches will be worn by participants to record sleep-wake behaviour.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day time impairments will be recorded prior and during melatonin treatment. This will be for a period of approximately 4-6 weeks and will be compared.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Some people will be genetically pre-disposed to have a
larger melatonin treatment response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>DNA will be extracted from saliva samples and tested for PER3 4 and 5 repeat allelle gene, a gene linked with delayed sleep phase disorder. This will be tested prior to randomisation and correlated to melatonin treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compared to placebo, melatonin treatment will result in subjectively reduced sleep disturbances and daytime sleepiness. Validated questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) will be completed at baseline and post- treatment and be compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and 4 weeks from intervention start date (end of melatonin treatment period).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compared to placebo, melatonin treatment will result in a greater proportion of change in the Clinical Global Impression Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Baseline and 4 weeks from intervention start date (end of melatonin treatment period), a Sleep physician will complete a Clinical Global Impression Scale. The Sleep physician will remain consistent between these visits.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compared to placebo, melatonin treatment will induce an advance in circadian phase. This will be assessed in a subset of participants who collected saliva  baseline and 4 weeks from intervention start date (end of melatonin treatment period). Endogenous melatonin will be assessed in saliva samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 4 weeks from intervention start date (end of melatonin treatment period).</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Following written informed consent, screening procedures (including confirmation of the DSPD diagnosis),
and provision of an oral swab for genetic analysis (visit 1), participants will complete one week of sleep-wake
monitoring (at home). At visit 2, the timing of the nightly rise in melatonin production will be assessed in
saliva collected hourly in the 5 hours prior to and 2 hours after bedtime. Those identified as having an onset
of melatonin production (dim light melatonin onset; DLMO) at or after the subjectsâ€™ desired bedtimes will be
randomised into the trial. At visit 3, participants will receive melatonin (0.5mg) or placebo capsules and be
instructed to take them 1h prior to their desired bedtime, for the following 4 weeks. A clinical assessment of
the outcome will be conducted at visit 4. For the duration of the protocol, sleep-wake patterns and
sleep-related impairments will be recorded using an electronic wrist monitor and diary/questionnaire</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly assigned to permuted block randomization to either melatonin or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  An externally appointed biostatistical consultant will be responsible for randomization procedures.</sequence>
