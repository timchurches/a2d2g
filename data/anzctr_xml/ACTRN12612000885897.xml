  <interventions>
    <interventions>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) devices will be from VAC therapy and systems range manufactured by the Kinetics Concepts Inc. (KCI)(San Antonio, TX,USA). 
The duration of treatment will be determined by nurse treating patient in accordance with current practice and based on clinical assessment of healing. The foot wound will be filled with foam dressing and VAC cycle will set for continuous cycle with a  target pressure of 125mmHg. Dressings will be changed every 48-72 hours but no less than 3 times per week as per manufacturers instructions for up to 8 weeks unless healing occurs sooner.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Care (SC)
Participants in the SC arm will receive a moist wound dressing as chosen by treatment nurse based on wound assessment. The dressing choices will be hydrocolloid dresing, a foam dressing or an alginate dressing. The frequency of dressing change will  be determined by the nurses (standard practice). The type of dressing, reason for use, type of secondary dressing applied (if applicable) and any other treatment details will be recorded at each treatment visit ( at least once a week)</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Settings and locations: Patients will be recruited from Austin Health inpatient and outpatient departments from Austin and Repatriation campus and will be treated in Austin HITH.
Screening: for eligibility: The attending vascular surgeon will assess participant eligibility as outlined in inclusion /exclusion criteria. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be provided with plain language statement and invited to participate in trial. 
Randomisation: Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either NPWT or standard care (SC).
Allocation Concealment and Blinding: Randomised code will remain concealed from participants, clinic staff and investigators until after preliminary analyses of trial results have been completed. Blinding of clinicians and participants will not be possible. Assessment of outcomes will be performed by a bio-statistician who will not be aware of the participantâ€™s treatment allocation.  
Interventions: The NPWT group will receive V.A.C. (registered trademark) inclusive of device and dressing and canisters. 
The SC group will receive dressing/s as deemed appropriate by clinicians. Dressing type will be documented in CRF.</concealment>
