    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of (i)artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (standard dose of artesunate 4 mg/kg bw for three days plus a single dose of 25/1.25 mg/kg bw of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in the first day ) and (ii) artemether/lumefantrine (20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine in a tablet with dose regimen of: one tablet to those weighing 5-14kg; two tablets for 15-24 kg; three tablets for 25-34 kg and four tablets for greater or equal to 35 kg) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. The treatment will be taken orally under health worker's supervision. Eligibile subjects will be treated for three days (daily dose for artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and twice daily dose for artemether lumefantrine) and followed up for 28 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>It is not a comparative study. Patients will be enrolled first in the artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine study and when the required sample size is reached, the subsequent patients will be enrolled in the artemether/lumefantrine arm.

      <outcome>Percent of treatment failures (early treatment failure + late clinical failure + late parasitological failure). This is composite primary outcome.

Enrolled patients will be assessed for parasitological (using microscopy), clinical responses during the 28 days follow-up and treatment outcomes will be classified according to the latest WHO protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At day 28 following initiation of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of adverse event will be documented. 

Patients or parents/guardians of enrolled patients will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients will be evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form.

The known adverse reactions are abdominal discomfort, nausea, headache and dizziness</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine molecular markers (dhfr and dhps).

Dhfr and dhps genotypes will be determined using nested mutation-specific PCR and/or PCR-RFLP. Dhfr mutations at codons 51, 59 and 108 and dhps mutations at codons 437 and 540 will be analysed. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>As the treatment failure rate to artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and artemether+lumefantrine in the study area is 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients will be included for each drug. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients will be included in the study per treatment. 

The WHO excel software programs will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artesunate+sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine and artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Bosaso, Puntland, Somalia.

Purpose: To assess the efficacy of the current first and second line treatment policy.

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.

Study Sites: Bosaso site in North East Zone (Puntland).

Study Period: From December 2014 March 2015  .

Study Design: One arm prospective study. 

Patient population: Febrile patients aged between 6 months and 60 years, inclusive, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Female minors aged 12-17 years and unmarried females aged above 18 years and above will be excluded as subjecting them to pregnancy testing is unacceptable according to the local customs and cultures.

Sample Size: A total of 88 patients will be enrolled in the study per each antimalarial drug.

Treatment(s) and follow-up: artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and artemether+lumefantrine will be evaluated. For the artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, a daily dose of artesunate 4 mg/kg bw for three days plus a single dose of 25/1.25 mg/kg bw of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in the first day will be administered under direct observation. For the artemether+lumefantrine, a fixed combination of 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine in a tablet will be administered according to the recommended weight as follows: One tablet to those weighing 5-14kg; two tablets for 15-24 kg; three tablets for 25-34 kg and four tablets for greater than or equal to 35 kg. The full course of artemether+lumefantrine for all study patients consists of 6-doses given twice daily over 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy.
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.

Secondary endpoints: The frequency and nature of adverse events

Exploratory endpoints: 
1. to determine the polymorphism of molecular markers for sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and artemisinin (K13) resistance.
