  <interventions>
    <interventions>Deep tissue massage: the massage therapist gave a series of 10 back massages intended to identify and alleviate musculoskeletal contributors to the participants' lower back pain. It was performed by using trigger point therapy and oblique pressure for a combination of lengthening strokes (extending a particular joint while at the same time working the muscle in the direction of the lengthening), Cross-fibre strokes (rolling the fingers over the tendon or muscle, back and forth, perpendicular to the fibre direction for two or three minutes), anchor and stretch (anchoring at a tight area and stretching away from the spot), freeing muscle from entrapment (mobilizing the erector spinae muscle in the lateral/medial direction by using both fingers of both hands to apply force along the border of the muscle and slowly push the muscle towards the opposite side).

Patients from both groups: DTM (deep tissue massage) and TM (therapeutic massage) underwent 30-minute session of deep tissue massage or therapeutic massage daily for 2 weeks (total of 10 sessions). Massage was provided by 2 licensed therapists with at least 5 years of experience who were comfortable following the study protocol and had experience in the permitted techniques.</interventions>
    <comparator>Therapeutic massage: the massage therapist gave a series of 10 back massages (from sacrum to occipital bone) intended to ease lower back pain and improve function by inducing a generalized sense of relaxation. Five distinct techniques were permitted: effleurage (gliding), petrissage (kneading, rolling), friction, holding, vibration.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory rheumatic disease that predominantly affects the sacroiliac joints and spine and it may also involve the peripheral joints, and specific organ like the eyes and bowels. AS leads to structural damage and functional impairments and a decrease in the quality of life. The majority of AS patients suffer from back pain. Lower back pain and stiffness is a clinical criteria for the diagnosis of AS.
The treatment of AS patients requires pharmacotherapy together with non-pharmacological intervention, including physiotherapy modalities 
Only a few studies, mostly case studies, have discussed the effect of massage therapy on LBP in AS patients.
This study aims to assess the effectiveness of deep tissue massage and therapeutic massage in the management of AS patients.
