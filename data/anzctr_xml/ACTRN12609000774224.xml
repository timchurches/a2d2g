    <summary>This study aims to determine the optimal bladder filling instructions for prostate cancer patients undergoing radical radiation therapy using Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you are undergoing radical radiation therapy using Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) as treatment for prostate cancer. 

Trial details 
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will be asked to empty their bladder 1 hour prior to their treatment appointment time, and then consume 300mL of water at least 30 minutes prior to their treatment appointment time. The second group will be asked to empty their bladder 1 hour prior to their treatment appointment time, and then consume 750mL of water at least 30 minutes prior to their treatment appointment time. The amount of daily bladder volume variation over the course of treatment will be measured daily in week 1 of treatment, and then every 2nd day until treatment is completed. Participants will also be asked to complete some questions measuring quality of life and distress, in weeks 1, 4 an 7 of treatment. Further monitoring will occur 6months and 12 months after treatment has completed.</summary>
