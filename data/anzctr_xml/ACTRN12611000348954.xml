  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this study is to determine the effects of dietary education to reduce sodium intake compared with usual care on sodium excretion of people with type 2 diabetes.  This is a parallel study of 2 groups and the intervention will be for 12 months, with weight, height and blood pressure measured at the beginning, at 3 months and the end of the study. Urine samples will also be measured and 24-hour food recalls will be conducted.  The target salt intake will be 5g/day for women and 6g/day for men.  Patients will meet with a dietitian one-on-one for approximately 15 minutes at the beginning of the study and again at three months.  The dietary education will be focused on using the FSANZ low sodium guideline of 120mg/100g food.  A simple pictorial education tool containing pictures of appropriate foods will be used and participants will be provided with a booklet containing a 2 week cycle of menus, recipes to guide food preparation, tips for adapting usual recipes, tips for eating out and social occasions.  Participants will also be provided with a sodium content of favourite foods and how to include these while maintaining a reduced salt intake.</interventions>
    <comparator>One group will receive usual care, defined as usual dietary education with no specific advice on sodium reduction.  The other will receive additional dietary advice regarding sodium intake.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a long established link between dietary salt intake and blood pressure, and hypertension is common in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Breads and cereals are high in salt, so the recommendation that people with diabetes should consume a high carbohydrate diet may lead to high salt intakes and make blood pressure more difficult to manage.  This study will determine the effect of giving people with type 2 diabetes additional dietary education to reduce their salt intake.</summary>
