    <studytitle>The effects of an exercise program on total daily energy expenditure</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>For insufficiently active adults aged between 18 and 60 years, does participating in the 40-day physical activity program extensive exercise group compared to the 40-day physical activity program moderate exercise group or no intervention have an effect on energy expenditure, physical activity patterns or resting metabolic rate?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group A: 40-day physical activity program extensive exercise group (method: 3x60min monitored group sessions and 4x30min self directed sessions per week, duration: 40 days, mode of administration: half monitored group sessions, half self-directed).

Group B: 40-day physical activity program moderate exercise group (method: 3x60min monitored group sessions per fortnight, 2x30min self directed sessions per week, duration: 40 days, mode of administration: half monitored group sessions, half self-directed)

The type of exercises completed in group A and B will involve a range of activities, which may include walking, aerobic circuits, core stability and flexibility sessions, sports, beach activities, swimming, dancing and kite-surfing. The difference between group A and B is how often these activities are completed.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The University of South Australia is conducting a research project looking at the effects of a physical activity program on adults aged between 18 and 60 years who exercise for less than two and a half hours each week. This study is interested in finding out how people change their daily activity patterns and energy expenditure when they are involved in a structured exercise program.</summary>
