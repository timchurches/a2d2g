Recruitment due to finish end June 2007.  Patients will be followed until death or 2 months after the last subject has received the last dose of study drug or after 520 deaths.</interventions>

    <concealment>This is an open study where the patients and the treatment team are aware of the treatment.  The patient is randomised using a central IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System) randomisation system (a central telephone system) used to allocate the patient to a treatment.  The study nurse calls the telephone system and enters the patient's details.  Patients are randomised in a 1:1 fashion.</concealment>
    <sequence>The permuted-block randomisation method will be used stratified according to platinum sensitivity (sensitive or resistant) and baseline ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group - used to assess how a patient's disease is progressing) status (0/1 vs 2)</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study tests the safety and effectiveness of YONDELIS (the treatment being tested) used with CAELYX (a drug already used to treat cancer) compared to  CAELYX alone.  The purpose of this research study is to determine if the combination of YONDELIS and CAELYX is better at increasing the amount of time it takes for your cancer to progress compared to Caelyx alone. The study will also look at: response rate (how much your tumor shrinks in response to the drug) safety,  and quality of life.  In some consented patients, optional pharmacogenomic testing (DNA, RNA, and Protein testing) will occur which looks at the DNA in the tumour cells and how it responds to the study drug.  The study, will examine the  relationship between  your response to treatment,  disease progression and overall survival from your type of cancer.</summary>
