    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of the drugs lapatinib and vinorelbine in treating breast cancer (HER2/neu positive type) which has spread to distant sites and has been previously treated. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you are a woman with Her2-positive breast cancer which has spread to distant sites and has progressed after initial treatment with trastuzumab-based treatment followed by lapatinib-capecitabine. 

Trial details 
Participants will receive lapatinib (1250 mg orally once daily) continuously and vinorelbine (20 mg/m2 (intra venous) on Day 1 and Day 8, of a 21-day cycle. Treatment will continue until any major toxic symptoms occur, or the disease or symptoms progress. If the cancer fails to respond, the patient will stop the study treatment and enter into the Survival Follow Up, where the cancer will be managed at the investigators discretion. Regular tumour scans will be used to monitor the disease. Scans will be completed 6 weekly until week 24 and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Quality of Life questionnaire will be completed by the patient to evaluate their pain and pain-relief use during the treatment period. The best combination of drugs to use after HER2 positive breast cancer has progressed on lapatinib-capecitabine is not known. Vinorelbine and lapatinib both have activity for the treatment of breast cancer. The study aims to evaluate the effect of this combination of drugs on survival rates and quality of life.

Throughout the study the safety of the patient will be continually reviewed by the study doctor (physical examination, vital signs, side effects assessment &amp; regular safety blood tests).  Cardiac safety will be monitored by serial multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or Echocardiograph at weeks 12, 24 &amp; 52.  

For the first 5 patients enrolled in the study the Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review all side effects experienced during the course of cycle 1 and 2. This is to ensure that this treatment combination does not cause unacceptable side effects in a group of patients who have already received several lines of anti-cancer treatment.  

Overall survival will be assessed by contacting the patients every 3 months during the Survival follow up part of the study.</summary>
