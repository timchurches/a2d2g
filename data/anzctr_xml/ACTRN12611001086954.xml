  <interventions>
    <interventions>If participants agree to take part in this study they will be randomly allocated to one of two conditions, an immediate treatment condition or a waitlist control. The immediate treatment condition involves a detailed assessment of psychological functioning and 8 weeks of group psychological treatment based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles. This program is specifically designed to try to improve frequency of dizzy spells, dizziness-related handicap, quality of life and psychopathology in the context of vestibular migraine. Each weekly treatment session will be conducted by a psychologist and last 120 minutes. The sessions will include the following components: orientation to therapy and psychoeducation about vestibular migraine and anxiety; behavioural experiments and addressing avoidance through exposure; cognitive therapy strategies to challenge unhelpful beliefs; consolidation of skills developed throughout the program, identification of high risk situations and development of a plan for managing symptoms.</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-list control. Will be offered treatment three months after assessment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Migraine frequency. This will be measured using participant self-report diaries and the Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire (MIDAS; Lipton et al., 2001) 7-item scale strongly related to migraine frequency.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Diary kept one week prior to commencement of the groups and throughout treatment. MIDAS administered pre-treatment (assessment session) at post-treatment (final therapy session) then 3 and 6 months post-treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dizziness handicap. This will be measured using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI; Jacobsen &amp; Newman, 1990) 25-item scale to measure self-perceived handicap experienced due to vestibular system disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-treatment (assessment session) at post-treatment (final therapy session) then 3 and 6 months post-treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety and depression symptomatology. This will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983) 14 item self-report measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-treatment, post-treatment, three and six month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life. This will be measured using the WHOQoL-BREF Australian version (WHO, 2000) 26 item self-report measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-treatment (assessment session) at post-treatment (post final therapy session) and then 3 and 6 months post-treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The experience of both migrainous and vestibular symptoms is likely to be associated with greater compromise than for either disorder presenting independently. The impact of VM is compounded due to the current lack of evidence-based treatment that has proven to be definitely efficacious. CBT is likely to be an effective adjunct treatment to medication in the treatment of VM. Trials are urgently needed to provide an evidence-base for such approaches.</summary>
