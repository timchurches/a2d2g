          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy with demonstrated
             progression of a solid tumor (non-lymphoma) with no alternative standard-of-care
             therapeutic option (certain exceptions may apply).

          2. At least 1 measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for response assessment (certain exceptions may apply)

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The following are not exclusionary:
             vitiligo, childhood asthma that has resolved, residual hypothyroidism that required
             only hormone replacement or psoriasis that does not require systemic treatment.

          2. Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the programmed death-1/ programmed
             death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1 pathway) (certain exceptions may apply)

          3. Prior treatment with other immune modulating agents within fewer than 4 weeks prior to
             the first dose of REGN2810. Examples of immune modulating agents include blockers of
             CTLA-4, 4-1BB (CD137), OX-40, therapeutic vaccines, or cytokine treatments.

          4. Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active. Patients with previously
             treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (i.e., without
             evidence of progression by imaging for at least 6 weeks prior to the first dose of
             study treatment, and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), and there is
             no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and the patient does not require any
             systemic corticosteroids for management of brain metastases within 4 weeks prior to
             the first dose of REGN2810 (certain exceptions may apply).

          5. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810
