  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background:
15,000 people are admitted to an Intensive Care Unit in Australia with severe sepsis every year. One third of these patients will die.
Severe sepsis occurs when an infection causes dysfunction of one or more of the major organs (such as the heart or kidneys). A significant factor in this illness is that the body's normal response to infection or'inflammatory response' becomes abnormal.
The statins are a class of medications commonly used in Australia to lower
cholesterol. Previous research suggests that they may also have a beneficial effect on inflammation and that it may be harmful for people who are already taking statins to stop taking them if they develop severe sepsis.

There is a lack of current information on the effects of these drugs in acute illness
and the risks and benefits of continuing or starting treatment with them in patients
with severe sepsis in the ICU.
The aims of this project are:
To assess the safety profile of atorvastatin in patients with severe sepsis
To assess the effect of atorvastatin on inflammation and the outcome of patients
with severe sepsis
Research Design:
A randomised controlled trial of atorvastatin 20mg versus placebo.
Methods:
Patients in the ICU with severe sepsis who meet the entry criteria will be given 20
mg of atorvastatin (a commerically available medication) or a placebo ("dummy
drug"). The study drug will be given as a capsule by mouth or the contents will be
given mixed with water via a feeding tube. Drug will be given once per day while
the patient is in the ICU to a maximum of 28 days. Safety blood tests to look for
signs of liver or muscle damage will be taken every day. Additional blood tests to
assess inflammation will be taken 6 times during the study. All other care will be
given as standard care.</summary>
