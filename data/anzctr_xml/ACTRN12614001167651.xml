  <interventions>
    <interventions>The heart rates (3-channel electrocardiograms), noninvasive blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of all the patients were monitored. After anesthesia induction (propofol 2mg/kg ,  midazolam 1mg fentanyl 2mcg/kg rocuronium 1mg/kg) a 20 G catheter placed radial artery. Patients grouped random. First group selected as volume controlled ventilation, second group selected pressure controlled ventilation. Volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) are not different ventilatory modes, but are different control variables within a mode. Just as the debate over the optimal ventilatory mode continues, so too does the debate over the optimal control variable. VCV offers the safety of a pre-set tidal volume and minute ventilation but requires the clinician to appropriately set the inspiratory flow, flow waveform, and inspiratory time. During VCV, airway pressure increases in response to reduced compliance, increased resistance, or active exhalation and may increase the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. PCV, by design, limits the maximum airway pressure delivered to the lung, but may result in variable tidal and minute volume. During PCV the clinician should titrate the inspiratory pressure to the measured tidal volume, but the inspiratory flow and flow waveform are determined by the ventilator as it attempts to maintain a square inspiratory pressure profile. frequency of ventilation measured by end tidal carbondioxide. we aimed 35-45 mmHg end tidal carbondioxide. we ventilated all patients from entubation to extubation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Material and Method: Forty patients aged between 20 and 80 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) risk scores of IIII scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery were included in the study. Randomization was achieved with sealed envelops containing randomisation numbers (simple randomisation using a randomisation table from a statistic book).
Before general anaesthesia, one group was set volume controlled ventilation, and the other group was set pressure controlled ventilation. Heart pressure, SPO2, pulmonary mechanics(supine/prone ppeak, supine/prone  dynamic compliance,  supine/prone  peak, supine/prone  minute volume, End tidal carbondioxide, respiration rate) recorded and blood samples are taken for inflammatory markers (Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8) . We took blood samples at 0. Hour 6. Hour and 12. Hour for inflammatory markers.</summary>
