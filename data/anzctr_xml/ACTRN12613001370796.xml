    <interventions>0.9% saline for intravenous fluid therapy in intensive care.  The rate, duration, and frequency of fluid administration will determined by the treated clinician.  All fluid used for either fluid resuscitation or crystalloid rehydration will be 0.9% saline unless a specific indication exists for another fluid.  Each of the four study ICUs will be randomly assigned, in alternating seven week blocks, to use blinded 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte 148 as the default resuscitation fluid.  There will be no wash-out period between treatments.  Each patient will receive the treatment they were assigned at the time of their ICU admission for the entire duration of their ICU admision irrespective of whether a cross-over occurs while they are admitted.</interventions>

    <concealment>The study is a cluster cross over trial in which the entire ICU will be randomly assigned to using either 0.9% saline or plasma-lyte 148 for routine fluid therapy.  Each of four study ICUs will use each treatment strategy twice over the 28 weeks of the study.  The allocation of study treatments in each cluster will be determined ahead of time by the study statistician.  Masked study fluid appropriate for each study block which is labelled either 'fluid A' or 'fluid B' will be delivered to each study unit by Baxter Pty Ltd (who will prepare blinded study fluids for this study).  Allocation concealment will be maintained until all analyses (including post hoc analyses) are complete.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using longitudinal analysis techniques accounting for attending hospital and drug sequence. Binomial outcomes will be assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with results reported as Odds Ratios (95%CI) while continuous outcomes will be analysed using generalised linear modelling (GLM) and reported as either differences (95%CI) or ratios (95%CI) as appropriate. Sensitivity analysis will be performed adjusting for an a-priori defined list of covariates (presence or absence of trauma, APACHE-III admission diagnosis, age, ICU admission source, APACHE-II score, and baseline serum creatinine level) with results reported both overall and at an individual hospital level. All analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA) and a two-sided p-value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.  

Due to the current lack of established statistical methodologies for calculating sample size for cluster cross over trials with binary outcome variables, we have not performed any sample size calculations for this study.  However, the data obtained in this study will be used to facilitate modelling of sample size requirements for a larger scale study.  This study will enrol between 2,000 and 3,000 patients over a 28-week period and will be the largest prospective clinical trial comparing 0.9% saline to plasma-lyte 148 ever conducted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The administration of intravenous fluid is a common therapy in acutely unwell patients. The study will provide preliminary data from a large interventional trial to inform clinicians looking after acutely unwell patients as to whether 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte 148 'Registered Trademark' is the preferred fluid for routine use in the ICU.  </summary>
