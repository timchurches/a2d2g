  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Worry Severity Score as assessed on the Penn State Worry Scale (PSWQ). The PSWQ is a 16-item measure for capturing the excessive and uncontrollable nature of pathological worry, where higher scores indicate more severe worry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline;  at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks after treatment commencement; and at 4 and 12 weeks after the completion of the treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinician Severity Rating of GAD as assessed on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule - IV (ADIS-IV). The ADIS-IV is a semi-structured interview that assesses for DSM-IV (Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition) anxiety, mood, somatoform, and substance use disorders, and screens for the presence of other conditions (e.g. psychotic disorders).</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline, 12 weeks after treatment commencement, and 12 weeks after completion of treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean score of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.  This scale assesses emotion regulation deficits across six dimensions:  emotional awareness, emotional clarity, nonacceptance of emotions, difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviour, poor impulse control, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline;  at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks after treatment commencement; and at 4 and 12 weeks after the completion of the treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a disabling disorder characterized by the central defining feature of pervasive, excessive and uncontrollable worry.  Although the traditional Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective for GAD patients, a significant proportion of these patients fail to achieve high end-state functioning.  Recent research evidence have found GAD to be associated with a person's intolerance of uncertainty, unhelpful meta-cognitions, and deficits in emotional regulation. The current study thus aims to investigate the efficacy of an enhanced CBT treatment that teaches GAD patients skills in managing emotions, uncertainty and unhelpful meta-cognitions, in addition to the usual CBT skills.  It is hypothesized that GAD-related symptoms in the patients will improve with the enhanced CBT treatment and the change of symptoms will be related to change in scores (baseline to post-treatment) in one or more of the aforesaid factors (i.e. emotion regulation, meta-cognitions and/or intolerance of uncertainty).</summary>
