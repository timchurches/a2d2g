    <interventions>This placebo-controlled, First-In-Human study is looking at the safety and tolerability of a single dose and multiple dose of study drug PRN1008 in healthy volunteers.

The study is designed into two parts:
Single Dose (Part A): 
Each participant will be randomised to receive either a single dose (50mg, 150mg, 300mg, 600mg, 1200mg or 1800mg) of PRN1008 oral liquid or a single dose of matching placebo (6 active: 2 placebo, N=8 per cohort). 6 dosing cohorts may be evaluated. Dosing will be escalated upon review of safety and tolerability of each cohort.

Multiple Dose (Part B)
Each participant will be randomised to receive active or placebo drug either once daily (orally)  or twice daily (orally) for ten days. Up to five cohorts of eligible participants will be studied. The planned doses  of either PRN1008 oral liquid or matching placebo are 300mg once daily, 300mg twice daily, 600mg once daily or 900mg once daily  (8 active: 2 placebo, N=10 per cohort) An optional cohort of either 600mg twice daily or 1200mg once daily may be studied depending on the evaluation of the PK, PD and safety data. 6 dosing cohorts may be evaluated. Dosing will be escalated upon review of safety and tolerability of each cohort

For both Part A and Part B, All doses will be administered in the clinic and directly observed by study personnel to ensure compliance. Participants  in Part A will be admitted to the clinic on day -1 and remain domiciled until day 3. Participants in Part B will be admitted on Day -1 or -2 and domiciled until Day 12. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of PRN1008 when administered to healthy adult participants. Specific assessments to evaluate treatment safety include the following: the frequency and type of adverse events, clinical laboratory testing, 12-lead ECGs and vital signs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For SAD Part A Up to 8 (+/-1) days after dosing 
For MAD Part B Up to 17 days (+/-2) days after dosing</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single once-daily and multiple (once or twice daily) oral doses of PRN1008 when administered to healthy adult participants. For Part A (single dose) blood samples and urine samples will be taken throughout the study for assessment of PK.

For Part B (multiple dose) blood samples only will be taken throughout the study for assessment of PK.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For the SAD Part A first three cohorts blood collection time points for PK  will be 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post dose. 

For the SAD Part A remaining cohorts blood collection time points for PK will be 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post dose.

For the SAD Part A (one cohort only) Urine collections for measurement of PRN1008 (one cohort only, dose to be determined) will occur pre-dose, and at times 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, and 12-24 hours after dosing. All excreted urine will be collected during each time interval.

For MAD Part B, blood samples will be collected within 15 minutes prior to dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on Day 1, at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on Day 10, and within 15 minutes prior to dosing on Days 3, 5, and 7.  


Cohort B1 only will receive a single oral dose of PRN1008 liquid formulation on Day -1 with a standardized meal.  PK blood samples will be collected within 15 minutes prior to dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. Note: the 24 hour sample is the same sample as the pre-dose sample on Day 1.

For MAD part B, PK Blood samples will be collected</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the impact of PRN1008 on occupancy of Brutons Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). 
In Part A (SAD) two blood samples at the following three time points (six samples in total) post dose will be taken to assess the BTK occupancy on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.

In Part B (MAD) two blood samples at the following ten time points (twenty samples in total) post dose will be taken to assess the BTK occupancy on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For SAD (Part A): 4, 12 and 24 hours post dose 

For MAD (Part B): 4, 12 and 24 hours, post dose  then Day 2, Day 3, Day 7 and Day 10 (4hrs and 12hrs post dose) Day 11 and Day 12 (36hrs post dose of Day 11 dose).</timepoint>
