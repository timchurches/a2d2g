  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will include 160 individuals with first episode psychosis who will be randomised to receive either 1g/d (500mg twice daily) of sodium benzoate or placebo (1:1 ratio) for 12 weeks, in addition to their normal routine care. 

Participants will be requested to return all unused study medication (i.e. unopened blister packs or capsules not taken) and empty blister packs to the delegated research assistants. All unused supplies of study medication will be accounted for and documented by the designated Research Pharmacist. Compliance with study medication will be calculated at each visit by means of self-report and a capsule count.  

Face to face clinical assessments will be at baseline (week 0) and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Weekly phone contact  will occur in between face to face visits to monitor medication compliance and discuss any concerns the participant may raise regarding the trial medication. A post-completion visit will be conducted at week 14.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>One hundred and sixty (160) participants will be recruited through the mental health services in five Queensland Hospital and Health Services.

After verbal consent is provided, an assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria will commence.  Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study and the formal consent process will commence. For those who consent to participate, they will be enrolled in the study and randomized according to allocation concealment methods.
 
Randomization lists will be created by an independent statistician, using computerised methods and provided to the manufacturer. The compounding manufacturer will develop the investigational product according to the randomized list. The independent manufacturer will hold the closed randomisation list and be the only one who has the ability to unblind a participant. The Research Pharmacist will dispense the investigational product based on the randomisation list provided. All study personnel (including the research pharmacist) will be blinded to a participantsâ€™ drug group allocation (placebo versus active). 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be carried out using a computer-generated randomization table, stratified by five sites.  Each of the five sites will have separate randomization tables.  Participants will receive either active treatment or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

    <statisticalmethods>All data will be analysed using SAS 9.4. We will compare demographic and clinical differences between the groups at baseline (Fisher exact test for nominal variables and Mann-Whitney test or independent sample t test for continuous variables). Efficacy will be assessed according to standard Intention to Treat (ITT) analytic procedures (i.e. for those who do not complete the 12 week study period, we will carry forward their last observation on the study outcomes). Mean changes in clinical assessment will be assessed using mixed-model repeated-measure (MMRM) methods with treatment, week, and treatment-week interaction as fixed effects and intercept as the only random effect; baseline value will be the covariant.  The MMRM analyses will be performed using the SAS PROC Mixed procedure.  P values will be based on 2-tailored tests with significance levels of 0.05.

The Lane et al study was based on n = 52 patients with chronic schizophrenia.13 They reported a Cohens effect size (d) of 1.53. Our patients (early psychosis) tend have slightly lower mean PANSS total scores (65.0), with a standard deviation of 14.3 units and it is anticipated that the effect size will be smaller in this group. With an alpha value of 0.05, and power of 0.8, we wish to be able to confidently detect a difference in mean PANSS Total of at least 7 units. This will require 66 participants per group (n = 132). Over a 12 week period we predict attrition of 15%. Thus, we will need to randomize approximately 160 subjects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will be a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel-group trial over a 12 week period.  The primary objective is to examine the clinical efficacy of the add-on treatment of sodium benzoate for persistent symptoms in patients with early psychosis.  Specifically, it is hypothesised, that participants allocated to the active arm (1000mg (500mg twice daily)) Sodium Benzoate treatment will have significant reductions in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)  total score at week 12 compared to individuals taking placebo. </summary>
