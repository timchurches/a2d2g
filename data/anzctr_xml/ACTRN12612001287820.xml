    <studytitle>Stroke Self-Management Rehabilitation Trial (SMART)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Prospective, open-label, randomised, multicentre, pilot clinical trial involving about 700 stroke survivors to (a) explore the feasibility of recruitment and likely level of support required to uptake the intervention; (b) to inform the power calculation, identify the inclusion criteria and best primary outcome measure for conducting a full-scale randomised controlled trial; and (c) to assess preliminary efficacy of a DVD-based observational learning intervention in stroke survivors for improving their functional outcomes at 3 months after randomisation.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The role model observational learning tool for stroke recovery and coping (in DVD format) is based on best available evidence, including educational materials and books endorsed by the New Zealand Stroke Foundation, National Stroke Foundation of Australia, the World Federation for Neurorehabilitation and the World Stroke Organization. The DVDs will be provided by the New Zealand Stroke Education Charitable Trust. The observational learning intervention DVD menu includes common areas of post-stroke care and rehabilitation/adaptation. The choice of the most relevant items for each participant will be based on patient-oriented goals as per discussion with and recommendations by the rehabilitation specialist or clinician involved in the trial at the time of randomisation (based upon a standard interview of about 1 hour duration). Stroke survivors and their family caregivers (when available) will be encouraged to watch all or particular sections of the DVD video clips showing rehabilitation, care and/or coping strategies (as instructed by the rehabilitation specialist at the interview) to achieve the identified goal(s) as often as needed but no less than twice a week (1 hour on each occasion) during the first month after discharge, once a week during the second month, and fortnightly during the third month after randomisation. The first DVD educational session of about 1 hour duration with some instructions (if required) will be carried out in-person at the time of randomisation. The participants will be offered an opportunity to phone the rehabilitation specialist should they have a question, whenever it is deemed feasible by the rehabilitation specialist, to maximize tailoring of the intervention to the participants needs/goals. The overall duration of the study intervention will be 3 months. The frequency of each participant's self-rehabilitation sessions may differ on a case by case basis but the duration of the each session should be about 1 hour. The self-rehabilitation sessions will not be supervised by the health professional (except for the first session at baseline). Participants assigned to usual care will not receive DVDs but may be given some recommendations by the rehabilitation therapist at the time of the interview as they would have normally receive from a rehabilitation specialist.  All study participants will receive their usual care from their treating physicians and health specialists.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be randomly assigned to receive standard stroke educational care or the observational learning intervention DVD plus standard stroke education. The standard stroke education care may vary in each participating centre in terms of the frequency and actual content but may include educational brochures, books, stroke club meetings, discussions with health care providers etc. The overall duration of the standard stroke education care will be the same as for the active self-management intervention (3 months). The sub-set sample (10 treatment/10 control in New Zealand and 10 treatment/10 control in Australia) will be interviewed for a qualitative assessment of the effect of the intervention soon after 3 months after the randomisation (upon completion of the intervention).  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure in stroke survivors will include the daily Living Self-Efficacy Scale. It will be measured in-person right after randomisation (as baseline assessment) and over the phone or postal questionnaire at 3 months after the randomisation (upon completion of the intervention). The interviewer should be blinded to participants allocation at 3 months after the randomisation (upon completion of the intervention).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measures will include EuroQol (EQ-5D), MRS, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D). These outcome measures will be measured in-person right after randomisation and by postal questionnaire or telephone interview (interviewer should be blinded to participants allocation) at 3 months after the randomisation (upon completion of the intervention). The compliance with the prescribed regime of watching DVD-based role models will be assessed by self-reporting 3 months after the randomisation (upon completion of the intervention). Outcome measures in caregivers will include the Bakas Caregiver Outcomes Scale measured at 3 months after the randomisation (upon completion of the intervention). A sub-set sample of the participants in selected participating centers (upon agreement with the centers) will also be interviewed for a qualitative assessment of the effect of the intervention soon after 3 months after the randomisation (upon completion of the intervention).</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All consecutive patients with stroke admitted to participating centers will be potentially eligible for inclusion in the study if they meet all the following inclusion criteria: (1) clinically diagnosed stroke with some level of disability; (2) discharged home; and (3) availability of home DVD-player. All such patients and their informal (unpaid) caregiver (next of kin or the person providing most day-to-day support, whenever available) will be approached couple days before or after their discharge to home but no later than 9 months after the stroke onset.</inclusivecriteria>

    <sequence>A stratified minimisation randomisation, stratified by centre, will be used to ensure a balance between the control and intervention groups for major prognostic factors, such as age groups &lt;65; 65+, sex, stroke severity (Modified Rankin Scale, MRS 0-2; 3-5), presence or absence of family caregiver, time passed since stroke onset (&lt;6 months; 6-12 months), and incontinence (yes; no). </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Simple incidence rates, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained for all binary variables in the first instance, with subsequent multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for other variables. Continuous data will be analysed using multiple linear regression modelling if normally distributed. Non-parametric analysis will be adopted if data are not normally distributed. 
Sensitivity analysis will also be carried out to determine the effect of missing data (for example, missing because patients are lost to follow-up). Secondary analyses will be conducted with outcome rates corrected for any discordance between reported and confirmed compliance with the use of role model educational tools. The consistency of effects for DVD based role model educational tools will also be assessed using tests for heterogeneity.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a major health problem in New Zealand and internationally. Current educational tools for stroke survivors and their caregivers remain inadequate and there are major gaps in the ability of the existing educational tools to transfer knowledge about stroke risk factors, warning symptoms, treatment, caregiving and rehabilitation. New technology allows more personal, engaging educational strategies that can be delivered interactively. This randomised controlled trial is to assess the feasibility of a novel observational learning DVD-based educational intervention in stroke survivors and their caregivers as a potentially applicable strategy to improve the function of stroke survivors as well as the health and well-being of both survivors and informal carers. Should this unique role model DVD-based observational learning tool be effective in improving outcomes in stroke patients and their caregivers, it will be a significant advance in stroke care.</summary>
