Participants will also receive cisplatin 80 mg/m^2 intravenously q3w plus capecitabine 800 mg/m^2 orally twice daily for 14 days q3w for up to 6 treatment cycles (Cycles 1 to 6).

Experimental: Capecitabine + Cisplatin + Herceptin (10 mg/kg) - Participants will receive Herceptin at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg on Day 1 of Cycle 1 followed by 10 mg/kg q3w from Day 1 of Cycle 2 until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for another reason (cycle length = 21 days). Participants will also receive cisplatin 80 mg/m^2 intravenously q3w plus capecitabine 800 mg/m^2 orally twice daily for 14 days q3w for up to 6 treatment cycles (Cycles 1 to 6).


Treatment: drugs: Capecitabine
Capecitabine will be administered at a dose of 800 mg/m^2 orally twice daily for 14 days q3w for up to 6 cycles (Cycles 1 to 6).

Treatment: drugs: Cisplatin
Cisplatin will be administered at a dose of 80 mg/m^2 intravenously q3w on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for up to 6 cycles (Cycles 1 to 6).

Treatment: drugs: Herceptin
Herceptin will be administered at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg on Day 1 of Cycle 1 followed by 6 or 10 mg/kg (depending upon treatment assignment) q3w from Day 1 of Cycle 2 until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for another reason.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Died - FAS - The percentage of participants who died as of the analysis data cutoff date of 13 February 2015 was reported among participants from the FAS with available data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of randomization until death or premature withdrawal (up to approximately 31 months or data cutoff date of 13 February 2015)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - FAS - Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Overall survival was estimated among participants from the FAS using the Kaplan-Meier approach. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) for median was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death - PPS - Disease progression was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 as a =20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including Baseline (nadir). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum was also required to demonstrate an absolute increase of =5 millimeters (mm). The percentage of participants who died or experienced disease progression as of the analysis data cutoff date of 13 February 2015 was reported among participants from the PPS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of randomization until first occurrence of disease progression or death; assessed every 6 weeks (up to approximately 31 months or data cutoff date of 13 February 2015)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - PPS - Progression-free survival was defined as the time between the day of randomization and the date of first documentation of disease progression or date of death, whichever occurred first, measured following RECIST Version 1.1 criteria. Disease progression was defined as a =20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including Baseline (nadir). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum was also required to demonstrate an absolute increase of =5 mm. The 95% CI for median was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response - PPS - Objective response was defined as the occurrence of either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by RECIST Version 1.1 based on investigator assessment. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) were required to have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as a =30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. The 95% CI was constructed using Blyth-Still-Casella method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of randomization until first occurrence of disease progression or death; assessed every 6 weeks (up to approximately 31 months or data cutoff date of 13 February 2015)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, open-label, multicenter, international Phase IIIb study will compare the
      efficacy and safety of two Herceptin dosing regimens in combination with
      cisplatin/capecitabine chemotherapy in participants with HER2-positive metastatic gastric or
      gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Participants who have not received prior treatment
      for metastatic disease will be randomized to receive Herceptin intravenously as either an
      8-milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w) as
      standard of care or an 8-mg/kg loading dose followed by 10 mg/kg q3w until disease
      progression. Capecitabine will be administered for 6 cycles at a dose of 800 milligrams per
      meter-squared (mg/m^2) orally twice a day on Days 1 to 14 of each 3-week cycle, and cisplatin
      will be administered intravenously for 6 cycles at a dose of 80 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of each
      3-week cycle. Herceptin will be continued until disease progression occurs.</summary>
