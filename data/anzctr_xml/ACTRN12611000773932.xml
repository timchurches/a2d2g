      <outcome>The aim of this study is to determine whether a diagnosis of OA in the hip, makes failure of internal fixation in hip fractures more likely; in the patient population group undergoing internal fixation for proximal femoral fractures at any Western Australian tertiary hospital between 2002-2004.

Retrospective data will be collected using hospital medical records (operation reports) to identify all patients who sustained hip fractures requiring internal fixation, between January 1st 2002 to December 31st 2004, at the three tertiary hospitals in Western Australia- Royal Perth Hospital, Sir Charles Gardner Hospital and Fremantle Hospital. Hospital operation reports for hip fractures requiring internal fixation will be obtained through the medical records department at each tertiary hospital in Western Australia.

Internal fixation will be defined by the use of any intramedullary or extramedullary implant used for the treatment of a proximal femoral fracture.

Using the IMPAX imaging database, all patients identified who meet the inclusion criteria will have the radiographs identifying their fracture(s) reviewed. Evidence of OA at the time of fracture will be recorded. The Kellgren and Lawrence radiological assessment of osteoarthritis will be used to describe the radiological findings of OA. This method of assessment was chosen based on the study by Reijman et al. (2004) finding the Kellgren and Laurence grade to be a useful OA definition for epidemiological studies focusing on the presence of hip OA. A diagnosis of OA will be made when a grade of 2 or above is identified.

The Kellgren and Lawrence grading system (Reijman, et al., 2004)
Grade	 	Description
0	No OA	No osteoarthritis
1	Doubtful	Possible narrowing of joint space medially and possible osteophytes around the femoral head; or osteophytes alone 
2	Mild	Definite narrowing of joint space inferiorly, definite osteophytes, and slight sclerosis
3	Moderate	Marked narrowing of joint space, definite osteophytes, some sclerosis and cyst formation, and deformity of the femoral head and acetabulum
4	Severe	Gross loss of joint space with sclerosis and cysts, marked deformity of femoral head and acetabulum and large osteophytes
Hips classified as grade 2 or more were defined as having osteoarthritis

Patients identified will be followed up over a period of 4 years to determine if there was failure in hip fracture fixation. Failure of fixation will be determined through using the IMPAX imaging database. Failure will be determined by subsequent radiographs of the hip, taken after the initial fixation, identifying one or of more of the following: non-union, segmental collapse, implant failure, peri-prosthetic fracture, conversion to hemi- or total- arthroplasty. Successful fixation (no failure of fixation) will be determined by the absence of the above findings.

The IMPAX database- this database contains retrospective data on all patients across the metropolitan/outer urban area of Western Australia who have had radiological imaging investigation. The database will be accessed from Fremantle Hospital. User names and passwords are required in order to access the database and these will be supplied by Fremantle Hospital. The database contains patient information, imaging investigations and reporting on those imaging investigations. The information entered into IMPAX database comes from radiologist reports. Only patients who meet the criteria for inclusion into the study will have their information accessed.

Other patient factors that will be collected include: age, sex, fracture type (displaced or undisplaced) and the dates when the radiographs where taken to identify a proximal femoral facture and the dates when the radiographs where taken to identify failure of fixation.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: The aim of this study is to determine whether a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) in the hip, makes failure of internal fixation in hip fractures more likely; in the patient population group undergoing internal fixation for proximal femoral fractures at any Western Australian tertiary hospital between 2002-2004.

Importance: Hip fractures are very common in Australia and are associated with high mortality and morbidity. The number of hip fractures in Australian women is projected to increase from 11 300 per year in 1996 to 44 700 in 2051; In men, the number is projected to rise from 4 000 to 15 300. The cost of this clinical problem is estimated at between 0.9-1.4% of the total government healthcare expenditure. Most will be managed with surgery, through internal fixation. This process can fail (failure of internal fixation). Many of the patient factors behind failure of fixation are unknown. Through clinical observation it is assumed that OA does increase the likelihood of fixation failure, however no published research exists to support this assumption. The reasons behind why OA may have this effect relates to alterations in bone homeostasis. Given that OA is highly prevalent in our society it is important to determine if a link exists between hip OA and failure of fixation. If a link is established, this information would assist clinicians in the choice of an appropriate fixation technique and reduce the likelihood of failure and therefore reoperation. This information would contribute to an improved efficiency of health care provision in this patient group. In addition, it would serve to use the limited health dollar more efficaciously.

Methods: This is a multi-centred study in which data will be collected retrospectively, investigating an estimated 700-800 patients records, across the three tertiary hospitals in Western Australia, where internal fixation was performed after hip fracture. This sample size will allow study estimates to be representative of the population estimate. The presence of OA at time of fracture will be identified. Failure of internal fixation will be identified over a four year follow-up period. The collected data will be analysed using a Proportional Hazard Regression model (Cox Regression model) to measure rates of failure of fixation between two patient groups: the patient group with no hip OA and the patient group with hip OA.

Benefits: The median cost for hospital treated proximal femoral fractures is approximately  $15,984 per fracture. Reducing the number of fixation failures would therefore result in measurable reductions to health care budget expenditure, in combination with the reduction in mortality and morbidity associated with reoperation.</summary>
