  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise
Training period: 6 weeks
Training frequency: 4 days per week
Exercise mode: Walking
Training intensity/duration: 4 km/h, 10 min

BFR is initiated via pneumatic cuffs placed around the limb proximal to the exercising muscle/muscle group that produce an individualized restriction to limb blood flow, but NOT total occlusion to flow. No adverse reactions are noted and participants are supervised/monitored throughout all training sessions to ensure safety and adherence to the protocol.</interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention: Active/Unrestricted exercise
Training period: 6 weeks
Training frequency: 4 days per week
Exercise mode: Walking
Training intensity/duration: 4 km/h, 10 min

The Active/Unrestricted group will undertake exercise without a restriction to limb blood flow, and without application of the BFR cuffs so as to represent the normal expected walking training stimulus.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a student project contributing to a Bachelor of Exercise and Sport Science (Honours) degree.
The purpose of this project is to investigate the application of blood flow restriction during exercise, and the training effects that result. There is a body of evidence that demonstrates benefits in muscle size and strength following low-intensity blood flow restriction training, equivalent to that of high-intensity exercise without the blood flow restriction. Studies have utilised several modes of exercise: walking, cycling, and resistance training and a large proportion of this research involves younger, apparently healthy participants, while research into its application in older adults is lacking.
It is likely that the benefits would be similar in older adults, and that this would directly improve performance in functional outcome measures representative of improved everyday function. Training with blood flow restriction cuffs at a low-intensity can produce these functional benefits while eliminating the intimidation, potential risk and negative stigma that surrounds high-intensity exercise in populations unlikely to adhere to it, such as older adults and frail adults.
This study will utilise functional outcome measures to gauge improvements in lower limb muscle strength following a 6-week blood flow restriction walking program.
