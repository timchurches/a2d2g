    <interventions>Group B will be treated with epirubicin (83mg/m2)  intravenous infusions of 30-60 minutes and paclitaxel (187mg/m2) 3-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by 3 cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide; 840 mg/m2, methotrexate; 57 mg/m2 and fluorouracil; 840 mg/m2) intravenous infusions of 15 minutes every 2 weeks.
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor/GCSF support will be given as follows: pegulated filgrastim on day 2 of each dose-dense cycle subcutaneously administered by nurse or filgrastim on day 3-10 subcutaneously administered by nurse. Radiation therapy (RT) is mandatory for all patients with breast-conserving surgery or for those with four or more positive lymph nodes and/or tumor size &gt;= 5cm. Hormonal therapy (tamoxifen 20 mg/day orally) will be delivered after the completion of chemotherapy for 5 years in all hormonal receptor-positive patients. All premenopausal patients undergo ovarian suppression for 2 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group A will be treated with epirubicin (110 mg/m2)  intravenous infusions of 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks for 3 cycles followed by 3 cycles of paclitaxel (250 mg/m2) 3-hour intravenous infusion every 2 weeks and 3 cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide; 840 mg/m2, methotrexate; 57 mg/m2 and fluorouracil; 840 mg/m2) intravenous infusions of 15 minutes every 2 weeks.
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) support will be given following each cycle of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy (RT) and hormonal therapy will be delivered after the completion of chemotherapy.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized phase III trial in high-risk breast cancer patients, to further explore the impact of dose-density in the adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Node-positive patients are randomized to sequential dose-dense epirubicin 110 mg/m2 for 3 cycles followed by paclitaxel (Taxol) 250 mg/m2 for 3 cycles, all cycles given every 2 weeks (group A/control group), or concurrent epirubicin 83 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 187 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles (group B/ interventional group), both followed by 3 cycles of intensified combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given prophylactically with the dose-dense treatments. By protocol design, dose-intensity of epirubicin and paclitaxel, the 2 most active drugs of the regimen, were double in the control group while total cumulative dose of all drugs and duration of chemotherapy period were identical in the 2 groups. Hormonal therapy and radiation therapy were given appropriately after the completion of chemotherapy.</summary>
