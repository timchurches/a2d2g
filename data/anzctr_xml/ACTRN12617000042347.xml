    <interventions>Study aims to confirm the safety and efficacy of substituting the midday meal with a meal replacement shake (W8Biotic) in clinically overweight and obese adult volunteers for a period of 8 weeks. Participants will self-administer 1 scoop (25g) of W8Biotic in 250mL of water at midday each day for 56 days. Meals consumed morning and night will be participants choice, and will be precisely recorded via a food diary. Clinical Trial coordinator will deliver intervention to qualifying participants. Participants will be monitored by a daily consumption diary and the return of empty tub. 
W8Biotic ingredients: 25 g (1 scoop) dose = 200.8Kj
Hi-Maize Resistant Starch 20 g
L-leucine 2 g
Levocarnitine Tartrate 1.5 g

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To replace the midday meal with Medlabs W8Biotic(Trademark) product for a duration of 8 Weeks. W8Biotic(Trademark) is scientifically formulated to support lean body mass, weight management and maintain healthy blood glucose levels in healthy individuals when taken in conjunction with a calorie controlled eating plan. W8Biotic(Trademark) contains Hi-Maize Resistance Starch, which is a Type 2 Resistant Starch (RS2) with therapeutic properties that may help to increase satiety and assist with weight management. Hi-Maize is also a prebiotic and produces short-chain fatty acids that help to support healthy gastrointestinal function. Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid that assists in the metabolic regulation of healthy blood glucose levels and in supporting skeletal muscle protein synthesis in healthy individuals. W8Biotic(Trademark) also contains Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus paracasei that naturally synthesise alpha-hydroxy isocaproic acid (HICA) from leucine, which is indicated to support lean muscle mass in healthy individuals. Furthermore, L-carnitine assists with modulating energy expenditure in healthy individuals.</summary>
