  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are eating disorders that share a pattern of binge eating or overeating within discrete short time periods. CBT is the most effective treatment for BN and BED, and uses both cognitive and behavioural strategies. However, in spite of CBT being the most effective treatment for BN and BED, fewer than half of individuals fully recover. The proposed study aims to evaluate whether the effectiveness of standard CBT may be enhanced in two different ways. Schema therapy (ST) enhances the cognitive component of CBT by focusing on changing deeper level beliefs or schemas. Appetite enhanced CBT (CBT-A) enhances the behavioural component of CBT by focusing on hunger and satiety. The study will randomise women with BN or BED to standard CBT, ST or CBT-A</summary>
