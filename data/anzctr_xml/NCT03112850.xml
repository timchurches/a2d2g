  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sensorineural type of hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit among older adults.
      Some of the psychosocial consequences of this condition include difficulty in understanding
      speech, depression and social isolation. Studies have shown that older adults with hearing
      loss show some age-related cognitive decline. There is no clinically proven method to predict
      the onset of this condition, as its occurrence is slow and progressive, affecting both ears
      equally. Although hearing aid use and auditory training have been proven as successful
      interventions to alleviate sensorineural hearing loss, no research has been designed to look
      at the effect of both hearing aid use coupled with auditory training on cognitive performance
      in older adults. This study will investigate whether wearing hearing aids will improve the
      impact of auditory training on cognition, mood and social interaction for older adults with
      sensorineural hearing loss.

      This is a crossover trial targeting older adults between 50 and 90 years with either mild or
      moderate symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Consented, willing participants will undergo a
      six month intensive auditory training program (active control), as a rigorous means of
      examining the impact hearing aid use has on a person's cognition, mood and social
      interaction. Participants will be assigned in random order to receive hearing aid
      (intervention) for either the first three or last three months of the six month auditory
      training program. Each participant will be tested at baseline, three and six months on a
      battery of computer based cognitive assessments, together with mood, and social engagement
      measures. Effectiveness of hearing aids and auditory training will be evaluated using an
      online speech perception test (SPT) and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit
      (APHAB) Inventory.

      This study will investigate whether using a hearing aid coupled with auditory training can
      improve a person's cognition and learning abilities, relationships with family and friends,
      and quality of life. Results from the study will inform strategies for aural rehabilitation,
      hearing aid delivery and future hearing loss intervention trials.</summary>
