  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study consists of four test groups.
1. Daily application of a matrix patch system containing 40mg Tocopheryl Phosphate Mix (TPM) and 200mg Oxycodone applied to the same site on the upper right or left thigh every day for 14 days.
2. Daily application of a matrix patch system containing 40mg TPM and 200mg Oxycodone, rotating the application between two sites on the upper right or left thigh every day for 14 days.
3. Daily application of a matrix patch system containing 20mg TPM and 100mg Oxycodone applied to the same site on the upper right or left thigh every day for 14 days.
4. Weekly application of a matrix patch system containing 40mg TPM and 200mg Oxycodone to the same site on the upper right or left thigh for 2 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the pharmacokinetics of transdermally delivered oxycodone from the tocopheryl phosphate mix (TPM) matrix patch system using various dosing regimes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment will be collected within 15 minutes prior to dosing and at the following times thereafter: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, 240, 246, 252, 258, 264, 270, 276, 282, 288, 294, 300, 306, 312, 318, 324, 330, 336, 344, 352, 360, 368, 376, 384, 392, 400, 408, 416, 424 and 432 hours  post first patch application.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of transdermally delivered oxycodone in a novel formulation containing tocopheryl phosphate mix (TPM) using various dosing regimes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Biochemistry, haematology and urinalysis will be performed for safety assessments on Day -1 (baseline), day 5, day 10, day 14 and day 19.
Vital signs will be measured approximately 30 minutes prior to the first patch application and at 6, 12, 24,36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180, 192, 204, 216, 228, 240, 252, 264, 276, 288, 300, 312, 324, 336, 348, 360, 372, 384, 396, 408, 420 and 432 hours post first patch application.</timepoint>
