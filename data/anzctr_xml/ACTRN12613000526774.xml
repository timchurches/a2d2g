  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients scheduled for invasive electrophysiological study will undergo Torso Surface Electrical Mapping (TSEM). TSEM involves the recording of electrical potential from approximately 128 electrodes over the body surface. These recordings are then combined with 3D geometry of the chest wall and heart gained from computed tomography (CT) imaging, in order to project electrical activation back to the heart surface with use of a mathematical model. Participants undergo a single TSEM recording whilst in their clinical arrhythmia, either prior to, or during invasive electrophysiological study. TSEM is anticipated to take approximately 20 minutes including time taken to place electrodes over the torso. CT imaging will be obtained prior to TSEM recording, as part of the routine clinical work-up of the patient to facilitate invasive electrophysiological study.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), taken during the same clinical arrhythmia episode as TSEM. The standard ECG takes approximately 5 minutes to acquire. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study hypotheses are (1) that Torso Surface Electrical Mapping (TSEM) provides a more complete definition of the electrical activation of the heart compared to the standard electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with arrhythmia, and (2) that this more complete definition is useful in guiding arrhythmia treatment strategies, in particular radiofrequency ablation. The project aims to test TSEM in patients in whom the mechanism &amp;/or sequence of arrhythmia is not easily diagnosed by ECG alone. These patients are a minority of all patients with arrhythmia, and include those with recurrent ventricular tachycardia, atypical atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (undergoing ablation) and ventricular dyssynchrony.
