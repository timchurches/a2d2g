  <interventions>
    <interventions>Using a randomised double blind crossover design, up to 160 healthy frequent caffeine consumers will attend 2 sessions (1 practice and 1 test session). 

During the practice session participants will complete a battery of cognitive tasks, mood and fatigue ratings. During the test session they will complete a battery of cognitive tasks, mood and fatigue ratings once before and once after receiving either one 330ml drink corresponding to:

1.	Placebo -	Britvic Tango Orange Sparkling Drink, Diet sugar free fizzy orange drink 
2.	25g Glucose -	Lucozade energy (International) diluted with Tango orange
3.	60g Glucose -	Lucozade energy (International i.e. outside UK)
4.	60g Glucose/40mg Caffeine - Lucozade energy (UK)
