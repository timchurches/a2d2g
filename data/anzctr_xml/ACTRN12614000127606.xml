  <interventions>
    <interventions>Spinal manipulation: High velocity low amplitude (HVLA) spinal manipulation to the thoracic spine and associated rib articulations. One intervention session per participant. Each session lasts for 5 minutes.
Stretching routine: Consists of 4 general stretches applied to each side of the body (right and left) and held for 30 seconds  each. Total time of stretching routine = 5 minutes.
Participants undergo a 5 minute rowing performance immediately followed by stretching routine which is then immediately followed by spinal manipulation which is then immediately followed by a 2nd 5 minute rowing performance.
This is a crossover trial with a washout period of 48 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control - stretching routine.
Consists of 4 general stretches applied to each side of the body (right and left) and held for 30 seconds each. The routine is performed at both sessions in the trial after the initial rowing performance but before the spinal manipulation (where applicable). 
Participants undergo a 5 minute rowing performance which is then immediately followed by stretching routine which is then immediately followed by a 2nd 5 minute rowing performance.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rowing stroke pattern analysis. 
Rowing is performed on an ergometer that is positioned within the field of view of a series of fixed position infrared cameras.
Infrared markers are positioned on pre-determined anatomical landmarks on each participant.  The cameras record the movement patterns of the infra-red markers.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>During each rowing performance</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Electromyography (EMG) analysis of 8 pairs of muscles: trapezius (lower), rhomboids, latissimus dorsi, serratus posterior inferior, quadratus lumborum, pectoralis major, serratus anterior and external obliques.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>During each rowing performance</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Spinal range of motion.
Infrared markers are fixed to a number of pre-determined anatomical landmarks on and around the spine. The cameras record movements of these markers during rowing performance.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers who have met the trial's inclusion criteria are screened for the presence of contra-indications to spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). Assuming the screening is clear written consent is then obtained form each participant.
As this is a cross-over trial all participants receive both forms of intervention i.e. stretching and SMT. Participants are assigned to receive SMT at either the first or second intervention session. Allocation concealment was achieved using sealed opaque envelopes.  
</concealment>
    <sequence>The order in which a participant receives the interventions is randomised through use of sealed envelopes. Each participant randomly selects a sealed envelope that contains a piece of paper in it that is either blank or has the number 1-8 written on it. The numbers 1-8 represent the group that will receive SMT at the initial intervention session while the blank paper represents the group that will receive SMT at the second intervention session. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Attempts have been made to predict kayak performance at the elite level by measuring parameters such as physiological conditioning, body measurements and flexibility. However, certain areas of the body that have been identified as regions of high strain during kayak paddling have not been studied  for their effect on performance. The spine is an example of one of these regions. 
The aim of this project is to test the effect of spinal manipulative therapy on the performance of elite kayakers.  
The study will measure the change in stroke pattern, rowing performance and muscle activation following administration of a stretching program with and without spinal manipulation. Rowing performance will be assessed on an ergometer (fixed rowing machine). Stroke pattern analysis will be conducted using a multi-camera digital recording system while muscle activation will be assessed using surface electromyography (EMG). All of these measures will be taken pre and post rowing performance.
