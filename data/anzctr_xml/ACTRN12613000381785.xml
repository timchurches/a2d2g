  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients were allocated into one of three groups in a double-blind manner. Group B (n=20) received a single-shot interscalene brachial plexus block  with bupivacaine 0.25% (Marcaine, Astra Zeneca, Sweden) 40 ml before induction. Group L (n=20) received a single-shot ISB with levobupivacaine 0.25% (Chirocaine, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, USA) 40 ml before induction in combination with GA.Skin puncture was performed, and the needle was advanced until a contraction of the deltoid or biceps muscle appeared.After evidence of a successful sensory and motor block was obtained, the patients received a standardized anesthetic protocol.Following administration of 100% oxygen, anaesthesia was induced with IV thiopental 5-7 mg/ml and IV fentanyl 2 µg/kg.Then the patients received IV rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, and the trachea was intubated so that the lungs were mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg, with the ventilatory rate adjusted to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (partial pressure) of 30-35 mm Hg. Anaesthesia was continued with delivered (FD) desflurane 6% (FD desflurane Suprane®, Baxter, Puerto Rico, USA) in 60% nitrous oxide with oxygen, and the fresh gas flow was standardized. The desflurane concentration was then titrated to keep the BIS score in the 40-60 range. If the BIS value was less than 40 for more than 30 seconds, the FD desflurane was decreased by 25%. Follow up period is during the surgery and postoperatively 24 hours</interventions>
    <comparator>Group C (n=20 - control group) received GA alone. Follow up period is during the surgery and postoperatively 24 hours</comparator>

      <outcome>The goal of this study was to compare the influence of an interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) performed with either bupivacaine or levobupivacaine in conjunction with general anaesthesia (GA) on desflurane consumption.The desflurane was administered by a Sigma Alpha vaporizer (Penlon Limited, UK), and the amount used was measured in milliliters after completion of each surgical procedure by refilling the vaporizer, which initially had been completely full. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The first time point is the eye opening time after surgery.
It will be assessed at post anesthetic care unit.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary end point of this study was defined as a reduction in desflurane consumption. Sample size estimation was performed by using MINITAB 15 software. Sample size was predetermined by using a power analysis: a=0.05 and ß=0.2, and this showed that 19 patients per group would be sufficient. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose: The goal of this study was to compare the influence of an interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) performed with either bupivacaine or levobupivacaine in conjunction with general anaesthesia (GA) on desflurane consumption, which was titrated to maintain the recovery profiles and postoperateve analgesia while also keeping the bispectral index score (BIS) between 40 and 60 in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery.
Methods: Sixty patients were prospectively randomized to receive GA with desflurane alone (group C) or in combination with a preoperative ISB by either bupivacaine (group B) or levobupivacaine (group L).
Results: The eye opening time was 4.0 ± 2.5 minutes for group B, 4.6 ± 2.4 minutes for group L, and 6.2 ± 2.1 minutes for group C (p&lt;0.05). Group B and group L saved 36% and 25% desflurane per unit time respectively when compared with group C (p&lt;0.001and p&lt;0.05) while the mean pain scores and analgesic requirements the first day after surgery were higher in group C (p&lt;0.05). 
Conclusions: Because of lower desflurane consumption, a superior recovery profile, and a high degree of patient acceptance, this type of balanced anaesthesia may be preferred in arthroscopic shoulder surgery.
