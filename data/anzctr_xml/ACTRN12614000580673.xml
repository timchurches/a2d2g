  <interventions>
    <interventions>The general rehabilitation program will consist of a multidisciplinary education and exercise program, which will be provided as group sessions twice weekly for 8 weeks. The education component will include 1-hour nutritional advice and management provided by a dietitian; 1-hour exercise education regarding the importance of exercise to well-being, bladder and bowel advice, and adherence to exercise provided by a physiotherapist; 1-hour fatigue management and return to work strategies provided by an occupational therapist; and 5-hours health behavior change and self-management strategies provided by a psychologist. The exercise component will consist of a moderate intensity (Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale 12-14), physiotherapist-supervised, combined aerobic and resistance training program. The exercise program will be individualized based on the results from baseline outcome measures. Participants will be required to attend an one hour education session per week and an one hour exercise session per week over the 8-week intervention period. The home-based walking program requires participants to perform daily walking with duration and intensity individually prescribed based on the results of baseline walking tests. To encourage adherence to the home-based walking program, 6 telephone motivational coaching sessions (1 to 2 calls per month) will be provided from a physiotherapist, between data collection time-points 2 (immediately post-intervention) and 3 (6 months following baseline) . Daily feedback for participants regarding distance and number of steps taken will be encouraged with a simple pedometer. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Changes to each measure across time (baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month, 12-month, 24-month, and 60-month after baseline) will be assessed with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing different assessment time-points. All analyses will be tested with a significance level of p&lt;0.05 using the intention to treat principle. The sample size calculation for the pre-post study is based on the results from a previous study. The mean (standard deviation) difference in the 6-MWT distance before and after intervention is 37meters +/- 70meters. Sixty participants will be needed to reject the null hypothesis with a power of 0.8 and alpha 0.05 (two tailed). Allowing for 30% attrition, a total of 80 participants will be recruited.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see if general exercise and education are helpful for patients who have had pelvic cancer (colorectal cancer, gynaecological cancer, or urological cancer). 

Who is it for?
Patients may be eligible to join this study if they are aged 18 - 85 years, have undergone surgery for stage I  III pelvic cancer, and are able to walk and manage self-care, out of bed more than 50% of waking hours (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0  2).

Trial details
All eligible patients will be invited to join the general exercise and education group 6 weeks after all their surgical and medical treatments are finished. The general multidisciplinary rehabilitation will consist of a group education and exercise program, which will be provided twice weekly for 8 weeks. Each session will last approximately one hour. The education component will include advice about nutrition, exercise, fatigue management, health behavior change, and coping with stress. Information will be delivered by a range of clinicians (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, and dieticians). The exercise component will include a general (combined aerobic and resistance) exercise training program supervised by a physiotherapist. All participants will be required to complete some questionnaires and tests (e.g. six-minute walk test, shuttle walk test etc) at the end of the intervention, and at 6, 12, 24 and 60 months from baseline.</summary>
