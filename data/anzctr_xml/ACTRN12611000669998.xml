  <interventions>
    <interventions>Citalopram, 20mg per day for 2 weeks combined with monocular occlusion of the amblyopic eye, 2 hours per day for 2 weeks. Monocular occlusion involves wearing an opaque eye patch over the non-amblyopic eye. Citalopram will be administered in oral tablet form. This study will adopt a cross-over design with placebo and drug arms separated by a 2-week washout period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo combined with monocular occlusion of the amblyopic eye, 2 hours per day for 2 weeks. This study will adopt a cross-over design with placebo and drug arms separated by a 2-week washout period. The placebo wil be made of methlycellulose in a gelatin capsule.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Heart rate variability. Heart rate will be measured using a standard Polar chest strap and watch. This chest strap is a heart rate monitor that is fitted around the participant's chest, so that it is in contact with their skin. The watch is worn by the researcher and is connected with the polar chest strap, displaying the participant's heart rate and recording the hart rate data. The participant's heart rate data will be downloaded to a computer for subsequent calculation and analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). The analysis of HRV will utilise a method called frequency domain analysis, which is based on the theory that the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems of the autonomic nervious system modulate heart rate intervals at specific frequencies. Essentially, the parasympathetic activity is linked to a fast, high frequency range while sympathetic activity is associated with a low frequency range. HRV information can be gained by analysing the fluctuations in frequency.</outcome>

    <concealment>Potential participants will self-identify, by responding to advertisements, posters, flyers, newspaper advertisements and web-based recruitment (such as getparticipants.com). Participants may also be provided with a participant information sheet or given the contact details of the researchers by their optometrist. If screening indicates that the participant is eligible all researchers who have responsibility for data collection will be blinded to whether the participant receives placebo tablets in the first or second 2-week periods of monocular occlusion. The tablets are prepared and supplied in unmarked blister packs by a pharmacist involved in the study who has no contact with the participants. Allocation will be by concealment using central randomization by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Custom computer software will be used to randomize participants into the drug first or drug second groups. This software takes into account the ages and genders of participants already allocated to each group before making an allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Amblyopia, or lazy eye, is a developmental disorder of the visual cortex. An effective treatment for amblyopia in children is patching the healthy eye to encourage use of the amblyopic eye; however this treatment is not effective in adults because the adult brain does not have sufficient capacity for change, a property known as neural plasticity. Neural plasticity is the process by which connections between neurons in the brain are formed and strengthened by new experiences, and is an essential component of learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that anti-depressant drugs are capable of reinstating plasticity in the adult brain. This study will determine whether the anti-depressant drug Citalopram will restore sufficient plasticity within the adult brain to allow for short-term patching (2 hours per day for two weeks) to improve visual function in adults with amblyopia.</summary>
