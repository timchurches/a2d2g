      <outcome>Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) for the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Total Scores - Study participants completed FSS questionnaires during study visits before treatment began and throughout treatment and follow-up to rate the severity and impact of fatigue they experienced in the preceding 2 weeks on their daily lives. FSS total scores are the average of nine questions with a range from 1 [no fatigue] to 7 [worst possible fatigue]. An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the overall severity of fatigue in each treatment group from baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in the amount of fatigue participants experienced throughout the study resulting in equal AUC from baseline to Week 72 (AUC72) for FSS total scores. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</outcome>

      <outcome>Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) for Impairment in Overall Work Productivity Scores Due to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and Its Treatment - Impairment in overall work productivity was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire completed by participants during study visits throughout the study. WPAI Overall Productivity Scores ranged from 0% to 100% (higher WPAI scores indicated greater impairment in productivity). An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the overall WPAI Overall Work Productivity Scores in each treatment group from Baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in the WPAI Overall Work Productivity Scores from Baseline to Week 72. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) in WPAI Work Productivity Scores and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) for Impairment in Daily Activity Scores Due to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and Its Treatment - Impairment in daily activity was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire, Question 6. Scores ranged from 0 (no effect on activities) to 10 (completely prevented me from doing my daily activities). An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the impairment in daily activity scores in each treatment group from Baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in impairment in daily activity scores from Baseline to Week 72. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) in the impairment in daily activity scores and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</outcome>

      <outcome>Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) in Work Productivity and Activity (WPAI) Absenteeism Scores Due to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and Its Treatment - Time missed from work in hours because of HCV infection or its treatment was assessed by measuring the change from baseline in the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire Absenteeism score (time missed from work, question #2). The number of hours missed from work because of HCV was divided by the total number of hours supposed to work, and expressed as a percentage. An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the WPAI absenteeism scores in each treatment group from Baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms WPAI absenteeism scores from Baseline to Week 72. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) in WPAI absenteeism scores and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</outcome>
