  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a feasibility study to determine the ability to obtain data from patients smart phones, looking at data from the 28 days prior to ICU admission. Using information obtained from ICU patients smart phones, pre-hospital mobility will be assessed. This information will be compared to the patients status three and six months post ICU admission using a variety of assessment tools. This study will hopefully provide information about functional outcomes for patients based on pre-ICU status. Patients are admitted into the study after 48hrs admission into ICU and when they are able to give written informed consent which can occur in ICU or following discharge to the ward. Patients will be provided with a Fitbit and given instruction on how to download MOVES prior to the follow up visits at three and six months.</interventions>

      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to establish feasibility of retrospectively obtaining pre-morbid pedometer/accelerometer and GPS data from the smart-phones of survivors of critical illness.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>The initial data collection will occur following consent at which time pre-hospital phone data will be collected (for the 28 days prior to ICU admission). Follow up will occur at three and six months following the initial data assessment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary objectives of the study are to validate accelerometer data extracted from a patients smart phone when they are recovering from critical illness.  This will be achieved by comparison with pedometer data recorded using a fitbit, which we will consider as the gold standard.  Information from the mobile phone app MOVES will also be compared with this data. This data will be collected from 10-28 days prior to the clinic visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Comparisons will be made at 3 and 6 months following initial assessment of phone data with data measured for 10-28 days prior to the clinic visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional assessments will also be performed 3 and 6 months following initial assessment. Measurement tools will include a 6 minute walk test, grip strength and functional questionnaires including the FIM instrument, Katz index, Lawton instrument and WHODAS . This will be used as a comparison with the measured data obtained from the activity data  from the smart phone, pedometer and the app MOVES.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Comparisons will be made at 3 and 6 months with activity data (from smart phone, pedometer and the app MOVES) measured for 10-28 days prior to the clinic visit.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>While impaired functioning has been shown to substantially influence quality of life for survivors of ICU in numerous studies, these studies are always limited as it has not been possible to objectively quantify patients pre-morbid function. This information is crucial as currently we cannot precisely quantify activity levels prior to their critical illness and, therefore, we cannot quantify the change in function for an individual patient. The ability to quantify change in functional ability would be a monumental advancement for researchers in other areas of medicine, but of pivotal importance in our field of critical care as researchers could then quantify the impact of intervention as a change in activity levels for an individual patient. 
Functional capacity after critical illness is an important outcome measure. Previously to determine functional capacity, researchers have focused on the six-minute walk test and questionnaires to quantify quality of life (QOL) and physical function.  Such measures rely upon surrogates being used to subjectively assess pre-morbid functional capacity. There has never been a pre-morbid objective measurement and pedometers have never been used to assess physical activity following critical illness.
The primary objective of this study is to establish feasibility of retrospectively obtaining pre-morbid pedometer/accelerometer and GPS data from the smart-phones of survivors of critical illness.  
The secondary objectives of this study are to validate accelerometer data extracted from a patients smart phone when they are recovering from critical illness.  This will be achieved by comparison with pedometer data, which we will consider as the gold standard. In addition we will compare these data with data from a mobile phone app (MOVES) data, six-minute walk test, grip strength and functional assessment scores. These measurements of activity will be compared against measurements of function, i.e. the Functional independence measure (FIM), independent activities of daily living (iADLs), Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOSE), Rivermead mobility index, (RMI) and EuroQoL05D-5L-35. Comparisons will be made at 3 and 6 months
The tertiary objective of the study is to explore whether we can use GPS data extracted from the patients phone to construct activity or life space polygons to describe the recovery from critical illness at 3 and 6 months.
