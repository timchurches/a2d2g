  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive a single clinic-based appointment with a nurse during the weeks following the birth of their child. They will also be provided with access to an internet-based program for a 6 month period (when their child is aged 4 weeks to 7 months). They will be able to access the internet website using a range of different devices including computers and smart phones. The website is built around the concept of providing support to mothers through asynchronous online mothers groups (i.e., mothers do not all have to be online at the same time) which are moderated by a nurse. The website provides access to substantial information about a range of issues relevant to the care and management of young children. It also utilises a timeline showing normal child development through which nurses provide mothers with reminders about key issues that need to be addressed as their child develops. Mothers are asked to access the website at least two times each week and to respond to comments by other mothers and to "conversation starters" and "quizzes" that are used by nurses to facilitate interaction between mothers and to provide advice about the care and management of young children. </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care: Standard care provided to mothers in South Australia is comprised of a single home-based appointment with a nurse during the weeks following a childs birth. Following this, mothers can access the normal range of services available in South Australia. However, there is no specific service offered other than the single home visit. Approximately 10% of mothers in South Australia enrole in face-to face groups moderated by nurses to obtain support and advice. The remainder either receive no support or utilise a range of community and medical services according to their needs at any given time.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The broad aim of the project is to test the effectiveness of a new service program to be made available to mothers of young children. The unique feature of the program is that it will combine the skills of community nurses and web-based technology to enhance support for mothers of infants. 
Following the development of the new program, it's effectiveness will be tested in trial involving approximately 800 mothers and infants. Half of the mothers and infants will receive the combined program while the other half will receive routine care provided for by CaFHS. 
We will test whether the combined program achieves equivalent outcomes to that achieved by routine care. The outcomes this project will assess include levels of parenting self-efficacy, perceived support, maternal mental health, infant development and the quality of mother-infant attachment. </summary>
