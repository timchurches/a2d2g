  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who have low to mild distress or who have risk factors for becoming depressed will receive a self-directed resource suite which includes handbooks on coping with cancer, a relaxation CD, information about coping with stress and other information about topics such as sleep hygiene and exercise. Information is included about the availability of support through the Cancer Helpline. 
Patients who have mild to moderate depression/distress and/or risk factors for becoming depressed and a HADS score of 8 to 21 inclusive will receive tailored psychosocial therapy, aligned with patient needs as identified on patient self-report on the Distress Thermometer. 
The precise type of psychosocial therapy will vary depending on patient need, examples of which include:
i)	Practical concerns such as about finances; difficulty with domestic tasks: Therapy may include referral to Social Work; clarification of concerns; structured problem-solving; challenging black and white thinking about the need to perform domestic tasks; re-assigning priorities. 
ii)	Family - concerns about children: Therapy components may include empathic listening; acknowledgment of concerns; explanation about children's needs; discussion about the benefits of maintaining routine; reassuring children that they have not caused the cancer. 
iii)	Emotional concerns, for example anxiety about chemotherapy: Therapy may include explanation and provision of information; identification of automatic thoughts; challenging negative cognitions; relaxation and guided imagery.
iv)	Physical concerns such as pain: Therapy would include referral for medical review; exploration of concerns about pain; identifying and challenging misbeliefs e.g. about becoming dependent on analgesia or that use of morphine implies inevitably poor prognosis; relaxation and guided imagery.
v)	Spiritual concerns such as shame about dependence, low sense of worth: Therapy would include dignity-conserving techniques e.g. exploration of past experiences, reflection on strengths; engaging in creative discussion about ways to feel in control; framing assistance as necessary to maintain dignity.
The psychosocial therapy will be delivered by health professionals from diverse backgrounds including nursing, radiation therapy or speech therapy who have undergone focused training. The training will be delivered through a structured self-directed educational manual, supplemented with a day-long skill development training session faciliated by one of the psychiatrist investigators at the specific Site. The duration of the training for participating health professionals will be approximately 10 weeks. During the delivery of the psychosocial therapy, all health professionals will participate in weekly clinical supervision conducted in group format with other participating health professionals at the respective Site, facilitated by one of the psychiatrist investigators, in order to monitor progress and ensure fidelity of the psychosocial intervention.
The therapy sessions will each be of maximum 30 minutes' duration, for a maximum of 4 sessions, delivered over 4 weeks. The therapy may be delivered face-to-face or by telephone depending on patient and health professional convenience. Patients receiving the psychosocial therapy will also receive the self-directed resource suite described above.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients who have no distress and no risk factors for the development of depression will continue to receive usual medical treatment and follow-up of their cancer. These patients will continue to have access to a variety of support services both at their treating hospital and in the community according to their needs and identification of concerns by their treating clinician. However these patients will not have any contact with the trained health professional other than in the course of routine clinical treatment.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a cluster-randomised stepped-wedge design randomised controlled trial (RCT). Clusters (Sites/hospitals) will be randomised progressively as the trial proceeds. Initially, all clusters will be assigned as control cluster, after which one cluster will be selected at random by the trial statistician, to be converted to an Intervention cluster. This process will continue until two clusters remain as control clusters. In the penultimate epoch, one of these will be randomly assigned as an intervention cluster. At the end of this epoch, the final cluster will be aware of its necessary conversion to the intervention. Thus, only at the last epoch, will the allocation not be concealed to the clusters. The first 20 consecutive patients admitted to every cluster will be assigned to the treatment group of the cluster at that epoch. Researchers and patients will be aware of the current cluster assignment at the time of enrolment. To minimise the risk of selective enrolment, we will record details of all non-consenting patients as well as consenting patients. Every consecutive patient attending the outpatient oncology department at each Site will be screened for eligibility and enrolled if eligible and consenting. Careful documentation of outpatient attendance, subsequent enrolments and consent interviews will ensure that no patient is “selected” for inclusion or exclusion from the study.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>The design for this randomised study is a stepped-wedge cluster design, a type of crossover design in which different clusters (the Clinical Sites) cross over in one direction only, from Control to Training then Intervention. The Intervention is sequentially rolled-out across Sites in random order over a number of time periods, so that at the conclusion of the study, all Sites will have received Training and be providing the Intervention delivered by a recruited Health Professional who has received training at that site</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief psychosocial intervention in reducing depression and anxiety in patients with cancer.
Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and have a diagnosis of cancer for which you are attending any of the participating clinical sites for treatment. Patients already receiving current specialised psychological treatments or taking antidepressant medication will not be eligible. 
Trial details
Eligible patients who have mild to moderate depression/distress and/or risk factors for becoming depressed will undergo a maximum of 4 x 30 minute tailored psychosocial therapy sessions over a period of 4 weeks. The type of therapy will vary depending on the each patient's needs, examples of which include practical concerns (e.g. finances), family concerns (e.g. child care), emotional concerns (e.g. anxiety about chemotherapy) physical concerns (e.g. pain), and spiritual concerns (e.g. shame). The psychosocial therapy will be delivered by health professionals who have undergone special training. Patients with low distress or risk factors will receive a patient self-directed resource kit comprising materials demonstrated to be acceptable and effective for patients with cancer. Patients who have no distress and no risk factors for the development of depression will continue to receive usual medical treatment. 
Participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and 10 weeks to assess depression, anxiety, unmet needs, and quality of life.</summary>
