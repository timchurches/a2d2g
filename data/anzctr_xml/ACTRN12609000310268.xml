  <interventions>
    <interventions>The CathRx ablation catheter is a new irrigated ablation catheter that will be assessed in this study. It will utilise the same radio frequency( RF)generator and irrigation pump as a conventional catheter. The main benefit of the CathRx catheter is that it has a hollow lumen which permits the insertion of a range of stylets with different curves facilitating appropriate shape formation of the distal end of the catheter. This  allows accurate positioning for delivery of therapy.The Cathrx ablation catheter is inserted via the femoral vein. Only one ablation catheter will be used during the procedure. The duration of th procedure is up to the clinicial procedures usually take an average of three hours</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is assessing a new burning catheter, the modular ablation catheter, this catheter will burn the irregular electrical connection that causes an irregular cardiac arrthymia. The catheter is being assessed to ensure that is not inferior to a conventional catheter. The trial catheter has benefits for the clinician in that it can be more adaptable during the clinical procedure than standard catheters and hence it is not inferior to current technology it should provide an attractive catheter choice for the clincian.</summary>
