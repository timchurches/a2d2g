Vincristine (max 2.0 mg) 1.4 mg/m2 intravenouslyDay 1

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) 5 years after randomisation, analysed by intention-to-treat analysis including all eligible randomised patients. The reverse Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the estimated median duration of follow-up. OS was measured from the date of randomisation, to the date of death (no matter what the cause). Survival proportions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by the International Prognostic Index (IPI), including a stratum for patients with unknown IPI.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life (QoL) was measured using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C308 version 1 questionnaire and scored accordingly. Quality of life scores were compared using t-tests.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival (PFS) 5 years after randomisation, analysed by intention-to-treat analysis including all eligible randomised patients.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity was analysed by intention-to-treat analysis including all eligible randomised patients. . Toxicity grades were compared using the exact version of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test comparing two ordered multinomial distributions and the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities and other binary endpoints were compared using Fishers exact test. Non-censored continuous variables were compared using the exact version of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluated the effectiveness of high dose Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin, Vincristine and Prednisolone ifosfamide (CEOP) chemotherapy regime with Filgrastim, and standard dose CEOP chemotherapy regime in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
Who was it for?
Patients were eligible to join this study if they were aged 16 years or more, had been diagnosed with NHL (Histological types: Follicular large cell (Group D), Diffuse mixed small cleaved and large cell (Group F), Diffuse large cell (Group G) or Large cell immunoblastic (Group H)), and had not received previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy for NHL.
Trial details
Participants in this trial were randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two treatment groups. Participants in group 1 received a high dose CEOP chemotherapy regime with Filgrastim which involved 1500mg/m2 of Cyclophosphamide intravenously on day 1, 150 mg/m2 of Epirubicin intravenously on day 1, 1.4 mg/m2 (maximum of 2.0mg) of Vincristine intravenously on day 1, 100 mg/day of Prednisolone orally from days 1 to 5, and 5 micrograms/kg/day of Filgrastim subcutaneously from day 2 until Absolute Neutrophil Count was greater than 10 x 109/L for a maximum of 14 days. This treatment regime was repeated every 3 weeks and was administered to participants 6 times. Participants in group 2 received standard dose CEOP which included 750mg/m2 of Cyclophosphamide intravenously on day 1, 75mg/m2 of Epirubicin intravenously on day 1, 1.4mg/m2 (maximum of 2.0 mg) of Vincristine intravenously on day 1, and 100 mg/day of Prednisolone orally from days 1 to 5. Similarly to group 1, this treatment regime was repeated every 3 weeks and was administered to participants 6 times.
All participants were assessed prior to treatment, after 3 courses of the treatment, at completion of the 6 courses of the treatment, at 3 months post treatment, at 6 months post treatment and at 5 years post treatment to assess the effectiveness of the treatment regimes.</summary>
