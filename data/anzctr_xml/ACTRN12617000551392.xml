  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be required to  attend the sensory laboratories at Deakin University on two separate occasions during which detection threshold (DT) and suprathreshold intensity (ST) for glucose (sweet) and maltodextrin (carbohydrate), hedonic ratings for glucose and maltodextrin solutions, and hedonic ratings for a range of sweet and carbohydrate prototypical foods will be determined. For DT and ST measures, participants will be tasting a total of 16 solution samples (8 glucose samples, 8 maltodextrin samples; 25mL each sample), with concentrations ranging from 0.11-6.31% w/v. For hedonic ratings for glucose and maltodextrin, participants will be tasting a total of 16 solution samples (16 glucose samples, 16 maltodextrin samples; 25mL each sample), with concentrations ranging from 0.11-6.31% w/v. Examples of foods that participants will taste includes fairy floss, honey, kidney beans, rice cakes, white rice, white bread, chocolate sauce, dried apples, raisins, pasta, tomato sauce, and pretzels. They will be served in a 30mL medicine cup. Each participant will test both sweet and carbohydrate solutions/foods. During these sessions, participants will also consume two different iso-caloric preload milkshakes (glucose, maltodextrin). Participants were randomly assigned to the sequence of sweet and complex carbohydrate milkshakes using a web-based program (http://randomizer.org) (i.e., either consuming a sweet milkshake in the first visit or complex carbohydrate milkshake). 

Demographic information will be collected, including sex, age, and height and weight measurements. BMI (kg/m2) will be calculated from the height and weight measurements. Participants will also be asked to complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and a Likes and Dislikes Questionnaire online within 1 week of sensory testing. Psychophysics tasks (DT, ST), as well as hedonic ratings for a range of sweet and carbohydrate solutions will be conducted in computerised, partitioned sensory booths in the Centre for Advanced Sensory Science using Compusense Five Software Version 5.2 (Compusense Inc., Ontario, Canada). 

To measure hedonic ratings for a range of sweet and carbohydrate foods, participants will be asked to collect food samples from a counter in the Deakin Universitys Teaching Food Laboratory. They will then be asked to taste and rate their liking of the foods on their individual workbenches. Filtered deionised water will be used as an oral rinsing agent. Participants will be instructed to rinse their mouths with filtered deionised water for five seconds before beginning each task and between each sample set. To eliminate any visual or olfactory input, all testing sessions will be conducted under red lighting, and participants will be asked to wear nose clips during testing (except hedonic ratings). All solutions were served at room temperature, with a three-digit code allocated to each sample. 

Participants will be asked to abstain from eating and drinking (except room temperature water) for two hour prior to each session. Each session will last about 2 hours, and participants will be given breaks between tasks (around 15 minutes). 

The sweet (glucose) and carbohydrate (maltodextrin) milkshakes (per 100g) will consist of: 8.8% glucose/maltodextrin (The Melbourne Food Depot, Melbourne, Australia; Star-Dri 5, Tate &amp; Lyle Ingredients Americas, USA), 63.7% long-life skim milk (99.9% fat free; Devondale Murray Goulburn, Melbourne, Australia), 26.5% light thickened cream (~18% fat; Bulla, Derrimut, Australia), and 1.0% imitation vanilla essence (Queen Fine Foods, Alderley, Australia). All milkshakes will be prepared fresh on the day of testing and stored refrigerated (+/- 3 degree celsius) using plastic food storage containers. 

Visit one will include collection of demographic data, DT and ST measurements for glucose and maltodextrin solutions, hedonic ratings for sweet foods, and milkshake ad libitum measurements for either one of the milkshakes.

Visit two will include hedonic ratings for sweet and carbohydrate solutions, hedonic ratings for carbohydrate foods, and milkshake ad libitum measurements for either one of the milkshakes.

There is a one week washout period between both visits. 

For clarity, 'sweet' foods denotes sweet tasting foods, whereas 'carbohydrate' foods denotes non-sweet carbohydrate foods (e.g., dietary starches).

    <statisticalmethods>Information collected from participants will be used to:
1. Participants will be split into quartile groups for analysis (i.e., more 1/4 sensitive, 2/4-3/4 normal sensitive, and 1/4 less sensitive). Therefore, at least 120 participants will be recruited in line with the central limits theorem to approximate a normal population distribution (30 participants for each analysis groups) (Field, 2009). We aim to recruit a total of 150 participants to account for dropouts as well as participants who couldn't participate in the study due to allergies to the foods/refusal to taste the foods used in this study. 

2. Determine taste thresholds for carbohydrates (maltodextrin, glucose). Correlations between mean thresholds with BMI, food consumption (dietary pattern), and ad libitum intake of carbohydrate foods will be used to determine if there are associations between carbohydrate taste thresholds with food consumption and BMI. 

3. Information concerning participant's food consumption and food behaviour will be used to evaluate differences between subject's thresholds.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to investigate if humans are able to detect small amounts of carbohydrate orally and investigate links with dietary consumption, ad libitum consumption of carbohydrate foods, and weight. Over the past decades, behavioural studies demonstrated that rats are very attracted to starch and that starch is preferred to sucrose at low concentrations, suggesting that rats have different taste receptors for sucrose and starch. Carbohydrates, in the form of sugar and starch, represent a major source of food energy. Except for some fruits, plants contain much more starch than sugar, but it is sugar with its sweet taste that is the most sought after carbohydrate. Compared to sugar, starch is rather bland to the human palate, and has been assumed to be tasteless for other animals as well. However, in the past decades, studies using animal models reported that rats are very attracted to the taste of maltodextrin (starch). The results of these studies suggest that starch and sucrose stimulate different taste qualities, indicating there is an independent taste receptor for polysaccharides. 

Recent studies investigating carbohydrate sensing in the human oral cavity through exercise performance have also found that exercise performance significantly improved after participants rinsed their mouth with solutions containing maltodextrin (see review by e-Silva et al., 2014). The results suggest that there may be an independent mechanism and pathway for oral carbohydrate detection, but as yet, there is not method for assessing carbohydrate detection thresholds in humans. 

A targeted sample of 150 participants will participate in this project and subjects must be over the age of 18 years. It is also preferred that subjects are non-smokers.</summary>
