    <statisticalmethods>Statistical advice has been provided by the Statistics Department of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. The proposed study period will be 12 months and based on estimates, there will be approximately 100 patients potentially included in the study, at which point we will review our data to assess the need for further extension of this study. Demographic and baseline data will be presented as frequencies/percent for categorical data or means/standard deviations for continuous data. Continuous data will be analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the chi square test will be applied to categorical data.  It is difficult in this setting with the aim of deriving normal baseline values for ROTEM and thus formal power calculations cannot be applied.  The statistical advice given was to recruit as many patients as possible over a defined study period.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recruitment of parturients will occur at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital (RBWH). There is increasing use of ROTEM(TM) for point-of-care coagulation monitoring in patients with massive haemorrhage, but there still remains limited data on reference ranges in normal pregnancies and subsequently limited understanding of the effects of complicated pregnancies on ROTEM(TM) interpretation. With the recent implementation of ROTEM(TM) within the RBWH, reference ranges for the obstetric population need to be established to optimise interpretation of derived values.</summary>
