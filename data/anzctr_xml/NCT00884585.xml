  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Treatment Responders - Treatment responders are defined as patients with a = 1 grade improvement from baseline in punctate corneal staining score and a = 4 grade improvement from baseline in composite symptom score in the study eye. The punctate corneal staining score is assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 (0 is =2 dots and 5 is &gt;316 dots (approximately) or ulcer/erosion). The composite symptom score is based on 5 symptoms (itching, tearing, ocular discomfort, photophobia, mucous discharge). The composite symptom score (0 to 15) is the sum of 5 symptoms (each symptom is assessed on a scale of 0=absent to 3=severe).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Punctate Corneal Staining Responders - Punctate corneal staining responders defined as patients achieving a punctate corneal staining score of 0 or 1 in the study eye. Punctate corneal staining is assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is =2 dots, 1 is &gt;2 dots but = 10 dots, 2 is &gt; 10 dots but = 32 dots, 3 is &gt; 32 dots but = 100 dots (approximately), 4 is &gt; 100 dots (approximately) but = 316 dots (approximately), and 5 is &gt;316 dots (approximately) or ulcer/erosion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 2</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With an Improvement in the Composite Symptom Score - Composite symptom score improvement is defined as a 4 or more grade decrease from baseline in composite symptom score in the study eye. The composite symptom score is based on 5 symptoms (itching, tearing, ocular discomfort, photophobia, mucous discharge). Each of the 5 symptoms is assessed on a scale of 0=absent to 3=severe. The composite symptom score is the sum of all 5 individual symptom scores, where 0 is no symptoms and 15 is the most severe symptoms.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Cyclosporine 0.010% eye drops in the
      treatment of Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis (chronic and severe inflammation of the eye). The
      study consists of a double-masked phase, and open-labeled phase, and an open-labeled
      maintenance phase. For the first 3 months of the study, patients will receive either masked
      Cyclosporine 0.010% eye drops or vehicle four times daily; for the next 6 months, patients
      may receive open-labeled Cyclosporine 0.010% eye drops four times daily. At month 9, patients
      who are in remission, will be re-randomized to receive either open-labeled Cyclosporine
      0.010% eye drops four times daily or twice daily.</summary>
