  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether continuous infusion of beta-lactam
      antibiotics or intermittent infusion or beta-lactam antibiotics, offers more health
      advantages to patients or if there is no difference.

      The investigators will be looking to see whether patients receiving beta-lactams via one
      administration method or the other have a better chance of recovering from their illness.
      They will also be looking at long term outcomes such as quality-of-life and healthcare
      resource use.

      Sepsis is caused by toxic substances (toxins) from bacteria and other organism entering the
      bloodstream from a site of infection. In some people, the infection can progress to sepsis
      and septic shock where the functions of organs in the body are affected. Patients suffering
      from sepsis and septic shock are commonly managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) where they
      are prescribed antibiotics as standard therapy, as well as other therapies to support the
      functions of the body.

      Beta-lactam antibiotics are a group of antibiotics commonly used to treat infection in
      patients with sepsis and septic shock.

      Currently, beta-lactam antibiotics are most commonly given to patients be intermittent
      infusions, that is, given at regular intervals throughout 24 hours. New research suggests
      that giving beta-lactam antibiotics as a continuous infusion may mean that antibiotic
      concentrations in the blood remain more consistent and may be more effective at killing
      bacteria.

      However, the benefit to the patient by giving beta-lactams via continuous infusion has not
      been tested in a high-quality, large clinical trial.</summary>
