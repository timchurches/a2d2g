  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients in this study will be allocated to receive active treatment with the bacteria Dietzia C79793-74. Dietzia C79793-74 will be given as a probiotic suspension of a 10^11 cells/mL, to be mixed in to milk-based beverage once a day for 8 weeks. Each patient will receive a constant dose, however the volume of the dose will depend on body weight and will range between 1-3 mL.

Compliance will be assessed by the return of unused doses at study visits.

Patients in this study will be involved for up to 8 weeks prior to receiving Dietzia C79793-74 and will be followed up for 12 weeks after completing their final Dietzia C79793-74 dose. They will be required to attend a total of 10 study visits over a six month period.</interventions>
