  <interventions>
    <interventions>In mesothelioma we have established that Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)-9 plays a key role in the pathobiology of the tumour and that targeting the downstream actions of FGF-9 significantly reduces tumour growth.
AZD4547 is A FGF receptor inhibitor  that will be used in patients with malignant mesothelioma that has progressed despite first or second line chemotherapy.
The selected starting dose of AZD4547 to be used as monotherapy will be 80 mg twice daily in a continuous dosing schedule. This will be taken orally as a tablet.  Participants may continue to receive AZD4547 as long as they are continuing to show clinical benefit, as judged by the investigators, and in the absence of discontinuation criteria such as:
1.     Progressive disease (PD) is documented by a site investigator.
2.     Unacceptable toxicity as determined by the patient or site investigator
3.     Delay of day 1 treatment for 21 days due to toxicity.
4.     The investigator determines that continuation of treatment is not in the patients best interest.
5.     New occurrence of an exclusion criterion affecting patient safety, e.g. pregnancy or psychiatric illness.
6.     Required use of a concomitant treatment that is not permitted.
7.     Failure to comply with the protocol, e.g. repeatedly failing to attend scheduled assessments. If a patient has failed to attend scheduled assessments in the study, the Investigator must determine the reasons and document the circumstances as completely and accurately as possible in the medical records and CRF.
8.     The patient declines further study treatment, or withdraws their consent to participate in the study.

The use of AZD4547 will be a continuous schedule and as such there is no maximum duration of use unless there is evidence of disease progression as judged by the investigators.

Participants will be followed up every 3 weeks by a medical specialist where adherance to the drug and adverse events related to the drug will be evaluated. Adverse events will be assessed by clinical history/examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, ophthalmological assessment and radiological investigations.</interventions>

Adverse events (AE) and Serious adverse events (SAE) to the trial drug will be assessed every clinic visit which will occur every 3 weeks.
Adverse events will be recorded from the start of the first dose of study drug throughout the treatment and follow-up phases until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
All AEs occurring during the study will be documented in the source records and on the respective Case Report Form (CRF), regardless of the assumption of a causal relationship
For each AE (including SAEs), the following aspects must be captured in the CRF:
1) A description of the AE in medical terms according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0
2) The grade as assessed by the investigator according to the definitions in NCI CTCAE
     version 4.0
3) The causal relationship to the study treatment as assessed by the site investigator

Examples of adverse events

1 ) High Phosphate - If a patient has a doubling of phosphate from baseline or a corrected calcium:phosphate product &gt;4.5 mmol2/L2 then the patient may remain on study treatment but phosphate chelation therapy (non-calcium containing agent) should be initiated, and clinical chemistry monitored weekly until resolution of the parameter to below the intervention limit.  Investigators must seek appropriate specialist medical consultation (renal or metabolic) to advise on the prescription and titration of phosphate chelation agents and to raise the patients awareness of low phosphate diets.  Complication of high phosphate is mineralisation of the heart.
Management - regular blood test (at each clinic visit), troponin, electrocardiogram and cardiac imaging done ( 3 monthly)

2) Ophthalmic toxicity - If patients have toxicities regarding the anterior aspect of the eye (dry eyes, punctuate keratopathy and keratitis) such events must be clinically managed to prevent secondary consequences eg, secondary infections following corneal abrasions.  Lubricating eye drops/replacement tears should be used; if there is any indication of extra eyelash growth or eyelashes rubbing on the cornea then these eyelashes should be removed.  It is anticipated that patients will report any visual disturbances or discomfort relating to the eye in advance of any significant pathology such as ulceration occurring.  The decision to continue on study treatment if mild corneal changes in the eye examination are observed will be left to the Investigators discretion, since a patient may indicate a wish to tolerate minor discomfort if there is perceived clinical benefit from the therapy.  A patient should also be immediately withdrawn from AZD4547 if corneal ulceration occurs, and appropriate expert ophthalmologic consultation should be initiated.
Ophthalmology assessment will be done in a 3 monthly basis while on the study drug

3) Renal toxicity - Patients will be excluded from this study if they have serum creatinine &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal concurrent with creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation). Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen should be included in the standard clinical chemistry safety bloods and should be assessed on a regular basis as per the individual study plan.

4) Stomatitis/dry mouth -  In cases of stomatitis particular attention should be given to prophylaxis, maintaining a high standard of oral hygiene with the regular use of antibacterial mouthwashes during the study.

5) Dermatological toxicity -  These include events of dry skin, alopecia, hair changes, trichomegaly and changes to the nails and nail beds

    <designfeatures>The two stage design allows for earlier rejection of an inactive agent at stage 1, with proceeding to stage 2 allowing us to reduce the confidence intervals around efficacy for an agent with potential activity.
It is a two stage design.

We will enrol 26 patients in the first of the two stages. If fewer than 7 (i.e. 27%) of the 26 patients were observed to have progression-free survival of more than or equal 6 months, the study will be terminated and declared negative. Otherwise, recruitment will continue to complete the second stage (to a total of 55 evaluable patients).

AZD4547 will be considered worthwhile for further testing in mesothelioma if 17 or more of the 50 evaluable patients (i.e. 34%) enjoyed a progression-free survival for more than or equal 6 months. To achieve 50 progression events, 55 patients will be accrued, allowing 10% of patients to be non-evaluable at 6 months follow-up.
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The progression free survival at six months (PFS6) will be evaluated to determine if the anti-tumour activity of AZD4547 in mesothelioma is sufficient to justify further study.

Null hypothesis: PFS6 25% in the treatment group, as estimated from PFS of patients following first-line chemotherapy. Alternative hypothesis: PFS6 of 45% in treatment group.

A Simons optimal two-stage design will be examined with the following assumptions; a PFS6 of 45% is considered of interest while a PFS6 of 25% is not. Observing a total of 50 progression events will provide 90% power to achieve this if the true PFS6 rate for AZD4547 is 45% and less than 10% chance of a false signal if the true PFS6 rate is less than25%,with a one-sided a equals to 0.10 and with a probability of early termination 0.68. 

Because the trial is designed to assess whether AZD4547 shows sufficient promise to warrant further investigation, a one-sided a equals to 0.10 (rather than two-sided a equals to 0.05) is proposed.

We will enrol 26 patients in the first of the two stages. If fewer than 7 (i.e. 27%) of the 26 patients were observed to have progression-free survival of at more than or equal 6 months, the study will be terminated and declared negative. Otherwise, recruitment will continue to complete the second stage (to a total of 55 evaluable patients).

AZD4547 will be considered worthwhile for further testing in mesothelioma if 17 or more of the 50 evaluable patients (i.e. 34%) enjoyed a progression-free survival for more than to equal to 6 months. To achieve 50 progression events, 55 patients will be accrued, allowing 10% of patients to be non-evaluable at 6 months follow-up.

The modified Intent To Treat (mITT) analysis set will include all dosed patients who have a RECIST assessment at baseline and at least 1 further assessment following commencement of dosing with study drug, or who has died or discontinued prior to the data cut-off.  The mITT analysis set will be used for outputs that present tumour responses.  The subset of the mITT patients who have a response (CR/PR) will be used for the summary of duration of response.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZD4547 for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma which has progressed following first line chemotherapy. You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 25 years or over, and have been diagnosed with mesothelioma which has progressed following first or second line chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin and/or carboplatin. 

Study details 
All participants in this study will receive two oral doses of the study drug, AZD4547 per day for 6 months, with appointments with study staff every 3 weeks throughout this period to monitor side effects and adherence to the medication. Researchers will examine disease progression and survival at 6 months, as well as side effect data from the three-weekly appointments to determine the efficacy and safety of the drug. 

Information from this study will then be used to inform researchers on whether continued study of this drug is both worthwhile and safe, in the hope that it may provide a safe and effective second line therapy for mesothelioma in patients whose disease has progressed following first line chemotherapy.
