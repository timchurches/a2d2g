  <interventions>
    <interventions>An individual education program delivered over 2 sessions (1 month apart) based on the Knowledge Enhances Your Safety Curriculum (KEYS, Stalvey &amp; Owlsey, Copyright 1998) but adapted for the Australian context.
The sessions will be supervised by an occupational therapist.  The first session will run for 2 hours and the  content will be individually tailored to the participant's stage of behaviour change according to the Precaution Adoption Process Model (Weinstein et al 1998).  The session is conducted in a conversational format and closely follows the educational curriculum in the KEYS program relating to vision but also includes some discussion of cognition, physical abilities and medications.  The driving scenes are replaced with scenes relevant to an Australian context.  The results of the DriveSafe Drive Aware (Kay, Bundy &amp; Clemson 2009) is also integrated into the discussion.  At the outset of the session an inventory of driving and weekly activities is recorded.  Information about alternative transport options is provided.  A set of goals will be developed during the session and strategies devised to achieve these goals.
Session 2 will be of 30 minutes duration and will involve revising some of the material and discussion of progress towards goals.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are using a randomised controlled trial to evaluate a program designed to promote safe mobility for drivers aged 75 years and older.  Half of our study participants will be randomly selected to receive an integrated program which includes individual advice about safe driving and promotion of alternative transport delivered over two sessions in the participants own home.  All study participants cars will be fitted with a monitoring device which transmits GPS location, speed and acceleration patterns during the 12 month study.  We will compare driving exposure and incident involvement (crashes and rapid deceleration events) through this objective measurement.  Community participation and independent mobility will be assessed with surveys.

The trial will determine if an individual program can improve safety in a group of older drivers.  The trial will assess the impact on mobility and evaluate uptake of alternative transport.  The study approach is robust using a randomised controlled design and safety outcomes will be measured objectively.  Safety of older drivers, is of concern due to increased crash involvement per km travelled and their vulnerability to injury.  While there are a number of programs designed to improve safe driving, there is very little evidence about their effectiveness.  The results of this trial will contribute high level evidence for policy makers in this area.</summary>
