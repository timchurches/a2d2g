  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients with advanced or metastatic tumours which are positive for 806 antigen
             expression based on CISH or IHC of archived tumour samples.

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven malignancy.

          -  Measurable disease on CT scan with at least one lesion &gt;/= 2 cm diameter (to allow
             adequate imaging).

          -  Karnofsky performance scale &gt;/= 70.

          -  Within the last 2 weeks vital laboratory parameters should be within normal range,
             except for the following laboratory parameters, which should be within the ranges
             specified: Neutrophil count &gt;/= 1.5 x 10^9/L; Platelet count &gt;/= 150 x 10^9/L; Serum
             bilirubin &lt; 34 micromol/L; Creatinine clearance &gt; 50ml/min

          -  Able and willing to give valid written informed consent</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Untreated active metastatic disease to the central nervous system (new or enlarging
             lesions on CT or MRI), or within 3 months of treatment (i.e. surgery or radiotherapy)
             for brain metastases. Primary central nervous system tumour (e.g. Glioblastoma
             Multiforme) is not an exclusion criterion.

          -  Other serious illnesses, eg, serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding
             disorders.

          -  Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks before study entry (6
             weeks for nitrosoureas).

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III/IV)

          -  Other malignancy within 3 years prior to entry into the study, except for treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ.

          -  Mental impairment that may compromise the ability to give informed consent and comply
             with the requirements of the study.

          -  Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessments.

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent
             within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding.

          -  Women of childbearing potential: Refusal or inability to use effective means of
             contraception.

          -  Concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids except for patients with
             Glioblastoma. (Topical or inhalational corticosteroids are permitted)

          -  Prior administration of monoclonal antibody or antibody fragment, and positive human
             anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) titre.</exclusivecriteria>
