  <interventions>
    <interventions>Home-based upper limb training using interactive videogames 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Participants will perform 20 minutes of exercise per session. The exercises will be performed with one arm, then repeated with the other arm (one arm at a time). Participants will make either rapid whole arm movements or finger movements to a target location in response to randomly presented visual cues. The speed and timing of the visual stimuli will be modified to increase difficulty of the games. Participants will receive 2 initial home visits from the physiotherapist to set up the videogame system and to learn how to use it safely. Regular telephone calls and an additional home visit (week 6) will be provided to monitor and progress exercises.  A final home visit will take place on completion of the 12-week program.  Participants will be provided with all equipment for the 12-week training program, as well as a booklet containing instructions and safety precautions. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive usual care and will be instructed to continue with their usual activities. Specifically, usual care includes any routine medical, nursing or allied health care. Usual care activities include any regular physical activities undertaken by participants on entry to the study, such as regular walks, exercise sessions and hobbies requiring use of the arms. </comparator>

    <concealment>After baseline assessment, participants will be stratified according to upper limb disease severity, then allocated randomly to the intervention or the control group.  Stratification will be based on  upper limb disease severity, as determined by the total score of the 6 upper limb items of the motor section of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) (ie, Item 3.4 Finger tapping, Item 3.5 Hand Movements, Item 3.6 Pronation-supination movements of the hands, Item 3.15 Postural tremor of the hands, Item 3.16 Kinetic tremor of the hands, Item 3.7 Rest tremor amplitude of the hands). The total possible score for these 6 items is 0-48, where 0 reflects no tremor or symptoms affecting the upper limbs.   Stratification will be based on this total score (0-12 vs =&gt;13). Allocation will be concealed as randomisation will be performed off-site by an investigator not involved in participant recruitment using block randomisation. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Between-group comparisons of final test performance for the continuously-scored outcome measures will be made using General Linear Models (ANCOVA) controlled for pre-test performance. An intention-to-treat approach will be used. Calculations of statistical power based on nine hole peg test measures in people with PD suggest 38 participants (19 per group) will be sufficient to detect a 20% between-group difference (mean 29.9 seconds, SD 10.2) in the nine hole peg test time (power=0.8, alpha=0.05, pre/post correlation=0.8, 10% dropouts). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is an expanding evidence-base demonstrating benefits of exercise for improving balance and mobility in people with Parkinsons disease. Yet the role of exercise in improving arm and hand function has been neglected to date. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to determine the impact of a home-based, interactive videogame system designed for people with Parkinsons disease on upper limb function. The secondary aims are to determine the effect on finger and upper limb dexterity, performance of upper limb tasks, quality of life, and cognition.  In addition, the participants perception of the effect of the intervention and acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated. Since difficulty performing upper limb activities is associated with poor quality of life, the development of effective, sustainable and engaging exercise programs to improve upper limb function in people with Parkinsons disease is an urgent research priority.</summary>
