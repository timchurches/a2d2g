  <interventions>
    <interventions>Measurement of serum androgen levels and their variablity over a time-period of three months (visit 1: day 0, visit 2: between day 2-4, visit 3: between day 5-12, visit 4: between day 20-40, visit 5: between day 80-100. At visit 1 and 2 three blood samples will be taken every 20-60 minutes. At visits 3-5 only one blood sample will be taken). Involved will be healthy man (self-assessment) over 40 years of age. All subjects undergo the same procedure.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall aim is to establish an objective, empirically and statistically valid basis for the biochemical confirmation of age-related Androgen deficiency in older Australian men. This will be based on development of an age-stratified reference panel of healthy middle-aged and older Australian men with good quality of life.</summary>
