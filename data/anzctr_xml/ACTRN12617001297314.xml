  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the intervention group will complete a 6-week supervised exercise-based rehabilitation program.  Exercise sessions will occur twice per week for one hour, conducted in a rehabilitation gym, and supervised by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist (5+ years experience). Sessions will be provided in small groups of a maximum of 6 participants per group. Exercise training will comprise a 10min warm-up, followed by 30min training at an intensity of RPE 13 on Borg's 6-20 Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale.  This will be followed by 5min cool-down, totaling 45min of exercise with 30min at the prescribed training intensity.  All exercise will be performed on a motorised treadmill.

Adherence with attendance to exercise sessions will be monitored and patients must complete at least 10 exercise sessions (i.e. &gt;80% of sessions) to be included in final analyses. If a patient misses two or more sessions in a row, another week will be added to their program to account for the missing sessions.  Adherence with exercise intensity will be monitored by a) by confirming the exercising RPE every 5min during training and b) exercising heart rate will be recorded during every session and compared to the heart rate values corresponding to RPE 13 during the initial exercise testing.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control participants will maintain their usual activities for the 6-week intervention period. Participants in the control group will be offered the intervention after completing follow-up testing (i.e. after 6 weeks)</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A priori power calculations suggested 24 participants were required to maintain sufficient power (0.80) for a mixed-effects repeated measures ANOVA (2 groups x 2 timepoints) with significance set at p &lt; 0.05.  This calculation is based on a f = 0.46 effect size observed in a previous study of healthy adults over an 8-week exercise intervention. To account for an expected smaller effect size in this study compared to the previous study and to allow for 20-30% dropout typically observed in cardiac rehabilitation, 32 participants will be recruited in total.

Data will be analysed by repeated measured ANOVA using the 2 groups and 2 timepoints.  Bland &amp; Altmans 95% Limits of agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess the validity, reliability and sensitivity of the perceptually-regulated exercise test (PRET) to predict VO2max compared to direct measurement.
Changes in heart rate and VO2 over the 6-week intervention period (for the intervention group only) will be assessed via repeated measures ANOVA for data collected in week 1 and week 6 of the intervention. Intraclass correlation and coefficients of variation will assess variability within training sessions.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity, reliability and sensitivity of predicting VO2max from a perceptually-regulated exercise test (PRET) and to evaluate the efficacy of regulated exercise intensity during cardiac rehabilitation using perceived exertion.  Specifically, the study will assess how perceptions of effort change over a 6-week exercise program and will quantify these changes in relation to physiological (i.e. heart rate and VO2) and performance (i.e. work rate) indicators of exercise intensity. Participants referred for cardiac rehabilitation, following myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery, will complete a symptom-limited exercise test to establish VO2max and 3 PRETs. Participants will then be randomised to a supervised exercise or wait-list control.  Supervised exercise will consist of 6-weeks of exercise training for 1 hour 2x per week.  Exercise intensity will be regulated at RPE 13 on Borgs 6-20 RPE scale.  Heart rate will be measures in each session and oxygen uptake objectively measured during the first and last week. Participants will then repeat the symptom-limited exercise test and 3 PRETs.</summary>
