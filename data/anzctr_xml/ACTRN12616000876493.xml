  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be recruited during routine follow up visits concerning previous renal/liver transplant. 

Participation involves one visit with the study team where a full skin check will be performed. Swabs will be taken from standardised control sites of sun-damaged skin on the patients forearm, Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), peri-lesional skin to SCCs and actinic keratoses (AKs). The swabbing technique has been tested in previous pilot studies and involves using sterile swabs moistened in saline, to rub over the surface of the lesion/skin. Swabs are then stored in tubes for later DNA extraction and culturing.

All suspected SCCs will be recommended for routine excision and histology. We will request a copy of the subsequent pathology report to confirm SCC diagnosis. The member of the study team will also record information on demographic, and relevant medical history from the patient, as listed below. Clinical non-identifiable photographs of patients forearms and any SCCs will be taken.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All participants in the study will need to have been immune-suppressed for over 1 year as a result of a kidney or liver transplant, prior to enrolling in the study. They will also need to be over the age of 40 years old. Participants are divided into three specific groups based on whether they have current SCCs (anywhere on the body) or AKs (on either forearm).
There will be 3 distinct groups recruited;
1. Renal/liver transplant recipients with over 1 year of immune-suppression, with no AKs
2. Renal/liver transplant recipients with over 1 year of immune-suppression, with at least 2 AKs on one forearm.
3. Renal/liver transplant recipients with over 1 year of immune-suppression, with one SCC located anywhere on the body.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have conducted pilot research in the significance of skin microorganisms in the conversion of AK to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in healthy volunteers and wish to compare these data to transplant recipients. Transplant patients, who are required to take immune-supressing drugs, are at a much higher risk of skin cancers than people in the general population. There is a necessity to study the relevance of the skin microbiome in transplant recipients as they are more vulnerable to the conversion of AK to SCC. We seek to compare the microbiome of transplant patients who have been immune-supressed for over 1 year, who have no AKs, many AKs, and those with suspected SCCs. The microbiome will be examined by taking skin swabs from participants and analysed by DNA extraction and microbe culture and isolation. In the case of suspected SCCs, patients will undergo routine care for their recommended removal, and the study team will request a copy of the subsequent pathology report to confirm SCC diagnosis.

Who is it for? All participants in the study will need to have been immune-suppressed for over 1 year as a result of a kidney or liver transplant, prior to enrolling in the study. They will also need to be over the age of 40 years old. Participants are divided into three specific groups based on whether they have current SCCs (anywhere on the body) or AKs (on either forearm).

Study details: Participants will be recruited during their routine follow up visits with the renal/liver transplant services at Princess Alexandra Hospital. If they consent to take part in the study, the study visit can occur after their follow up visit, or scheduled for a later date. Swabs will be taken from standardised control sites of sun-damaged skin on the patients forearm, SCCs, peri-lesional skin to SCCs and AKs. The swabbing technique has been tested in previous pilot studies. All suspected SCCs will be recommended for routine excision and histology. We will request a copy of the subsequent pathology report to confirm SCC diagnosis. The member of the study team will also record information on demographic, and relevant medical history from the patient. Clinical non-identifiable photographs of patients forearms and any SCCs will be taken.</summary>
