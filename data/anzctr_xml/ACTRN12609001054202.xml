  <interventions>
    <interventions>Electroacupuncture, 
Electroacupuncture at 4 acupuncture points bilaterally indicated for nausea and vomiting. Points are PC6, ST36, LV 3 and LI4. Sensi sterile acupuncture needles 0.20 x 30mm inserted and manipulated until "deqi" or a sensation is obtained. The frequency of the stimulation will be 10Hz and the intensity will be adjusted according to patient's tolerance (maximum 10 mA). Treatment will commence 10 minutes prior to chemotherapy starting and continue for further 20mins and will be repeated on Day 3. Patients recieve standard antiemetics as per protocols.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham acupuncture

Sham acupuncture will inserted adjacent to the true acupuncture point bya defined distance. Once the needles are inserted no further manipulation occurs. The electroacupuncture unit will be connected but will be non-functioning. Treatment is repeated on Day 3.

Contol Arm
Patients will receive standard treatment ie. normal antiemetic therapy and no acupunture.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To test the benefit of using electroacupuncture for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. Specifically test if electroacupuncture has a benefit in delayed chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, which is defined as after the first 24hours post chemotherapy. Even with our new antiemetic drugs and protocols patients still experience nausea and vomiting and is identified as one of the major concerns for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

The trial will address areas that need to be investigated as identified by Ezzo et al 2005 in a Cochrane Collaborative Review. These include obtaining data on the effectiveness of electroacupuncture with modern antiemetics, utilising more than one acupuncture point and getting data on delayed nausea and vomiting.</summary>
