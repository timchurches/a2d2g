             than a total of 3 DNA damaging or cytotoxic regimens in the last 5 years. Less than a
             full dose of a DNA damaging agent, possibly due to reasons such as toxicity or
             documented allergic reaction are allowed. Previous treatments with biologics

                  = 100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L); Hemoglobin = 9.5 g/dL (1.4 mmol/L);

                  normal range OR creatinine clearance = 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with
                  creatinine levels above institutional normal;

               -  Hepatic function: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase
                  (ALT) = 2.5 x the upper normal limit of institution's normal range. For subjects
                  with liver metastases, AST and/or ALT &lt; 5 x the upper normal limit of
                  institution's normal range; Bilirubin = 1.5 x the upper normal limit of
                  institution's normal range;

               -  Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) must be = 1.5 x the upper normal limit of
                  institution's normal range and international normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5.
                  Subjects on anticoagulant (such as Coumadin) are allowed on study and will have
                  PTT and INR as determined by the Investigator

             following listed below) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation
             and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Women of childbearing potential must
             have a negative serum pregnancy test within 21 days prior to initiation of treatment
             and a negative urine pregnancy test on Cycle 1 Day 1. Post-menopausal women must be
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.</inclusivecriteria>
