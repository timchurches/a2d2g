  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard care in early labour is to telephone the midwife in the hospital birthsuite and seek advice on whether or not to come to hospital.  The intervention here is that a known midwife will provide enhanced support (via telephone and/or home visiting) to assist women in the early or latent phases of labour to remain at home until labour is well established unless there is a reason to be admitted earlier. The support will include listening to the woman, taking a detailed history, assessing her current stage of labour and coping ability, advising whether or not to come to hospital, suggesting pain relief strategies and providing reassurance. This will be the midwife's main role, whereas midwives usually providing such guidance are concurrently providing care to women already admitted to hospital in labour. The study midwife will also visit the woman at home if this would be helpful (to be decided on an individual basis by the woman and the midwife). The duration of this additional support will vary according to individual needs between around 15 minutes and 3 hours. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine whether extra support from a midwife in early labour, before arrival at hospital, can safely reduce the number of women who give birth by caesarean. Women who agree to take part are allocated by chance to receiving this extra care, or to the usual support provided at the hospital. Once they arrive at hospital, care is provided according to the usual hospital practices. </summary>
