  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Pralatrexate Injection

Experimental: Pralatrexate - Patients randomized to the Pralatrexate Arm will receive pralatrexate injection and Vitamins B12 and Folic Acid until a criterion for pralatrexate injection treatment discontinuation is met.

No Intervention: Observation - Patients randomized to the Observation Arm will receive Vitamins B12 and Folic Acid and remain under observation until a criterion for observation discontinuation is met.


Treatment: drugs: Pralatrexate Injection
Intravenous (IV) push administration over 30 seconds to 5 minutes via a patent IV line containing normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride).
Initial dose: 30 mg/m2
Administered weekly for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle until criteria for discontinuation per the protocol are met.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see if pralatrexate extends response and survival following
      CHOP-based chemotherapy (CHOP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)
      and if pralatrexate improves response in patients with partial response following CHOP-based
      chemotherapy. Patients will either receive pralatrexate or be under observation. All patients
      will receive vitamins B12 and folic acid and attend regular clinic visits to evaluate their
      disease and health.</summary>
