  <interventions>
    <interventions>Active treatment consist in zinc at dosage of 10 mg/d associated to other vitamins. We used commercial zinc preparation available on the market as drops. Treatment was started at 7 d of life until discharge from the hospital. Other vitamins contained in the preparation were (pro dose)folates (120 mcg), vit. B12 (0.6 mcg) and Vit D3 (400 UI), vit. C (60 mg), vit. E (6 mg), vit. A (480 mcg). To reach Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folates, vit. B12, D3, C, E, A, and B group, all subjects were supplemented daily with folates (56 mcg/Kg), vit B12 (0.3 mcg/Kg), vit. D3 (10 UI/Kg), vit. C (25 mg/Kg), E (2.8 mg/Kg), A (500 mcg/Kg), and B group (B1 0.35 mg/Kg, B2 0.15 mg/Kg, B6 0.18 mg/Kg, niacin 6.8 mg/Kg, and biotin 6 mcg) intravenously when in parenteral nutrition. When full enteral feeding was achieved the RDA for folates, vit B12, vit. D3, vit. C, E, A, and B group were reached in all subjects considering that preterm formula used during the study contained folates (30 mcg), vit B12 (0.2 mcg), vit. D3 (10 UI), vit. C (20 mg/Kg), E (2.4 mg), A (180 mcg), and B group (B1 0.19 mg/Kg, B2 0.30 mg/Kg, B6 0.135 mg/Kg, niacin 1.1 mg/Kg, and biotin 5.5 mcg) per 100 ml, and that all subject were supplemented daily with vit D3 (400 UI) per os. In this way, RDA for zinc was obtained only in the active treatment group. </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo consist in a multivitamins complex not containing zinc. We used a commercial preparation, available on the market as drops, composed by folates (120 mcg), vit. B12 (0.6 mcg) and vit. D3 (400 UI), vit. C (38 mg), vit. E (3 mg), vit. A (375 mcg).

    <concealment>Enrolled subject were randomly allocated to “active treatment” consisting in zinc at dosage of 10 mg/d associated to other vitamins, or to “placebo” consisting in a similar multivitamins complex not containing zinc. We used two commercial zinc preparations available on the market as drops, with similar packaging. The two multivitaminic formulations were placed in 10 mL bottles (one per neonate), labeled with a specific code corresponding to a code reported in the randomization list. Group assignment was concealed until statistical analysis was completed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are many evidences that zinc may be essential for brain, pulmonary and intestinal development and function, as well as for growth, in the fetus and child. Preterm infants have a high risk of zinc deficiency. In this study we will aimed to investigate the efficacy of zinc supplementation in reducing morbidity of preterm neonates related to neurological, respiratory and intestinal complications.</summary>
