    <studytitle>Early Diagnosis of Acute Gastrointestinal Bleeding with PillCam ESO</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding is capsule endoscopy as good as or better than upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy at making a diagnosis</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Capsule endoscopy - A Pillcamera is swallowed by the patient with a small sip of water. The patient wears a receiver belt on the abdomen. The pillcamera takes images and electronically sends them to the recorder worn by the patient. The study duration is for one hour. The belt is removed and the pillcamera is excreted by the patient in the stools.  
This is a one off procedure for the purpose of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Gastroscopy - All patients will also have standard upper GI endoscopy which is the current test of choice. The patient is given intravenous sedation by an anaesthetist. After this the endoscopist inserts a standard video gastroscope down the throat to examine the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. This is a one off procedure that is normally done as parts of the standard hospital management of patients with GI bleeding. The procedure takes about one hour.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful diagnosis - This will be determined by use of standard video upper GI endoscopy which allows direct visual examination of the upper GI lining. This will be compared with the images taken by the pill camera.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 hrs after intervention commenced</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rockall score - The Rockall risk scoring system is used to identify patients at risk of adverse outcome following acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Rockall et al. identified independent risk factors which were later shown to predict mortality accurately. The scoring system uses clinical criteria (increasing age, co-morbidity, shock) as well as endoscopic finding (diagnosis, stigmata of acute bleeding). It is named for Professor Tim Rockall, who was the main investigator and first author of the studies that led to its formulation. Total score is calculated by simple addition. A score less than 3 carries good prognosis but total score more than 8 carries high risk of mortality.
The variables that are measured include: Age, Shock, Comorbidity, Diagnosis and Evidence of bleeding.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 hrs after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>comparison of rebleeding rate which will be  assessed by reviewing the patient's medical record at 4 weeks from study enrolment to assess for evidence of readmission to teh hospital with GI bleeding and also by a telephone interview with the patient where they will be asked if they represented to any other hospital or doctor with recurrent GI bleeding.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks after intervention commenced</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A new simple method of looking at the upper digestive tract has been developed. This is a capsule that has a camera inside it called PillCam ESO. The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic effectiveness of PillCam ESO endoscopy with standard endsocopy in people with gastrointestinal bleeding.</summary>
