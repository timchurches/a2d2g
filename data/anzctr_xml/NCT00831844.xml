  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well cixutumumab works in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      cixutumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them.</summary>
