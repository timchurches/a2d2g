  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mepilex Lite dressings. These consist of a thin flexible foam layer with silicon webbing which does not react with chemicals in and on the skin. The silicon layer allows the dressings to adhere to healthy skin but not to open wounds. As soon as the skin shows signs of erythema, the red skin will be divided into two equal halves. The halves will be randomized to either Mepilex Lite or control cream by the PI Dr Patries Herst who has no direct invovement in the day to day running of the trial (based on computer-generated random numbers).

The dressings are applied to one half of the red skin (they adhere without the need for adhesives). Their position on the skin is indicated by black permanent marker pens. The dressings are removed for radiation treatment and during showering. careful instruction is given to patients how to handle the dressings to keep them in a clean place and how to reapply them after showering. The dressings are changed every 4 days but when moist desquamation occurs, they will be replaced daily. Dressings will be used until the skin reaction is completely resolved, which may be upt o 6 weeks after completion of radiation treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard aqueous cream will be used on the other half of the red skin, This will be applied twice a day from the moment of redness till either the end of the trial (up to 6 weeks after completion of radiation) or until moist desquamation occurs. If moist desquamation occures, these patches will be covered by the standard dressing that is used in each department.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential particpants will be given information about the trial initially by their radiation oncologist, with more information provided by the research assistant at the time of the Computed Tomography (CT) planning scan. Written informed consent will be obtained before radiation therapy treatment commences. Participants will start radiation therapy treatment. At the first sign of erythema (redness) of the skin, this skin area will be divided into two equal halves. One half will be covered in Mepiilex Lite dressings, the other half will be treated with standard aqueous cream.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients act as their own controls. Comparison will be between two patches of skin on the same patient. Allocation of Mepilex Lite dressings and Aqueous cream will be randomized using computer generated random numbers produced by biostatistician and that are held by the PI who is an academic at the University of Otago, Wellington and is not directly involved in teh running of the trial.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Participants will act as their own controls. Once erythema develops on the chest wall, this area will be divided into two equal parts. One part will be randomly assigned to the Mepilex Lite arm and the other half will be treated with aqueous cream. Randomization will be based on computer generated random numbers that are held in the central trial centre.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy for women in New Zealand; most will receive radiation therapy treatment.  Skin reactions occur in 80-90% of patients and these can vary from redness to blistering or peeling (ulceration). To date, there is no standard treatment for radiation-induced skin reactions. 

In a previous pilot study involving 30 women treated with radiation for breast cancer, we showed that Mepilex Lite dressings (a new Swedish silicon-foam skin dressing) were superior to a standard aqueous cream in decreasing redness of the skin. This current trial aims to investigate the effect of the dressings on ulceration in 80 women undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer after mastectomy in public hospitals in Dunedin, Palmerston North, Wellington and in the Auckland Radiation Oncology private Centre. As soon as the skin turns red, the affected skin area will be randomly divided into two similar halves; one half will be covered in dressings, the other half will be treated with standard moisturising cream. Skin condition will be assessed three times a week for the duration of treatment, as well as once a week after treatment until complete resolution of the skin reactions, using an established skin assessment scale (RISRAS).
