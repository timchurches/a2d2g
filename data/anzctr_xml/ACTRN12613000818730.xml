  <interventions>
    <interventions>For unknown reasons, post mechanical heart valve surgery, patients have an immediate post-operative warfarin sensitivity about 50% highter than normal, taking approximately 12 weeks to normalise post operatively. 

Routinely, post-mechanical heart valve surgery, all patients receive an oral tablet of warfarin which is commenced two days post-surgery to protect them from forming blood clots on their new valve. Due to the nature of the action of warfarin and the need to stabilise each patient onto the best therapeutic dose specific to them, all patients routinely have a blood test called an INR (International Normalisation Ratio [INR] measurements) so as to monitor how thin their blood is and thus adjust the warfarin dose up or down so as to achieve and then maintain them within their target INR.  While warfarin dosing is regulated to try to find the best therapeutic INR, subjects are routinely given an anticoagulant injection while the doctor adjusts the warfarin dose to get to a therapeutic INR and each patient on just the right dose of warfarin.

We will compare two arms:
- (Arm 1) The current warfarin dosing regimen (using the 'age-adjusted, warfarin management protocol' while in hospital and in Hospital-at-Home care, then empirical dosing once in GP care) over a 12 week period post mechanical heart valve surgery,
- (Arm 2) Warfarin dosing post mechanical heart valve surgery following revised age-adjusted, warfarin management protocols, specifically designed to meet the needs of the post-mechanical aortic (therapeutic INR range of 2.0-2.5) and mitral  (therapeutic INR range of 3.0-3.5) heart valve surgery patients.  

These investigational protocols, designed to cover the 12 week, post-surgery period, will include a specific first four day instruction for oral tablet warfarin dosing, where we will reduce the warfarin dosing of the currently used 'age-adjusted, warfarin management protocol' by 30% for patients receiving a mechanical aortic valve replacement so as to achieve an INR range of 2.0 to 2.5, and reduce the warfarin dosing by 25% for patients receiving a mechanical mitral valve replacement so as to achieve an INR of 3.0 to 3.5. Then from day 5, if the optimal anticoagulation status or therapeutic INR has reached a relative degree of steady-state or stability, we have added to the protocols the incremental dose adjustment approach described by Meijer et al (1), whereby dosing is adjusted up or down on a percentage basis depending on the INR. For patients not in the therapeutic INR range by day 5, empirical dosing will be recommended until INR steady state is achieved before the incremental dose adjustment approach as defined by Meijer et al (2), is applied.

To monitor adherence a patient diary will be provided to all patients to collect INR results and warfarin dosing during the 12 week period.  Also, INR results for all tests conducted during the 12 week period will be collected by the Principal Investigator. Dosage of oral warfarin will be analysed by intention to treat.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator for this study will be the current warfarin dosing regimen used by the Flinders Medical Centre; Flinders Private Hospital; Hospital-at-Home carers and general practitioners within a 12 week period post mechanical valve surgery.  

The current practice for warfarin administration post mechanical heart valve surgery performed at Flinders Medical Centre/Flinders Private Hospital is as follows:
- two days post-surgery, warfarin dosing commences with the use of the South Australian government-approved 'Warfarin InitiationAge-Adjusted Protocol CC1.347' to determine the best starting dose of oral warfarin as per the patient's age and INR result. 
- NOTE: The target INR is 2.0 to 2.5 for post-mechanical aortic valve surgery patients and 3.0 to 3.5 for post-mechanical mitral valve surgery patients at these institutions. 
- Adjustments to warfarin dosing up or down is made using the 'Warfarin InitiationAge-Adjusted Protocol CC1.347' while in hospital and in the care of 'Hospital-at-Home' practitioners.  
- Patients routinely stay in the care of the Hospital-at-Home practitioners until a stable, target INR/therapeutic warfarin dose is reached.  
- Patients are then referred to their GP for continuing care where INRs are taken 2-4 weekly and empirical adjustments to warfarin dosing is used if required.  

For this study, we are requesting for INRs to be taken at least 2 weekly for the 12 week period. 

Patients will be given a diary to record INR results and warfarin doses while in the study which will be collected at the end of the 12 week period.  </comparator>

The control and test groups will be further stratified into two groups: patients receiving a mechanical aortic valve replacement (target INR range 2 to 2.5) and patients receiving a mechanical mitral valve replacement (target INR range 3 to 3.5).  All data will be collected prospectively. </concealment>
    <sequence>The plan is to enrol 140 elective patients for participation in the study, with enrolment being conducted during the Cardiac Surgery pre-admission clinic at Flinders Medical Centre. The study will consist of two consecutive phases, with Phase 2 to commence at the completion of Phase 1: 
Phase 1 (Control group): 
- 35 patients electing to have mechanical AVR (Aortic Valve Replacement) heart surgery, with warfarin doses post-surgery being regulated according to current standard practice (empirical warfarin dosing with the aim to regulate a target INR between 2 to 2.5).  Patients will be followed up post-operatively, with all INR results being collected.  INRs will be taken as per standard practice until patient reaches a stable therapeutic INR, then at least every two weeks up until 12 weeks, and:
- 35 patients electing to have mechanical MVR (Mitral Valve Replacement) heart surgery, with warfarin doses post-surgery being regulated according to current standard practice (empirical warfarin dosing) with the aim to regulate a target INR between 3 to 3.5) Patients will be followed up post-operatively, with all INR results being collected.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing surgery for mechanical heart valve replacement require post-operative anticoagulation with warfarin as they are at a higher risk of thrombosis and clot formation. To monitor for therapeutic or optimal anticoagulation status, the extent of blood-thinning is measured by a blood test called the International Normalised Ratio (INR). Depending on the type of heart valve surgery, there are two distinct recommended therapeutic INR ranges, either from 2 to 2.5 for patients receiving mechanical aortic valve replacement, or 3 to 3.5 for patients receiving mechanical mitral valve replacement. 
There are two issues with post-mechanical valve surgery patients that distinguish them with respect to warfarin management: 
(1) Their immediate post-operative warfarin sensitivity is about 50% higher than normal;
(2) This increased sensitivity to warfarin returns slowly to normal over the 12 week post-operative period.

Using the current empirical dosing method, that is, dosing by the prescriber using his/her clinical judgement, some patients require up to 3 weeks monitoring, when the average for attaining a stable therapeutic INR in patients other than post heart valve surgery with warfarin is less than 1 week, using the current, proven initiation protocols. 
We therefore propose that two revised age-adjusted, warfarin management protocols be used, specifically designed to meet the needs of the post-mechanical aortic and mitral heart valve surgery patients.  These protocols, designed to cover the 12 weeks post-surgery period, will include the first four days of warfarin dosing not previously discussed by Meijer, where we will reduce warfarin dosing by 30% for patients receiving a mechanical aortic valve replacement, so as to achieve an INR range of 2 to 2.5, and reduce warfarin dosing by 25% for patients receiving a mechanical mitral valve replacement so as to achieve an INR of 3 to 3.5. Then from day 5, if the optimal anticoagulation status or therapeutic INR has reached a relative degree of steady-state or stability, we have added to the protocols the incremental dose adjustment approach described by Meijer et al., whereby dosing is adjusted up or down on a percentage basis depending on the INR. For patients not in the therapeutic INR range by day 5, empirical dosing will be recommended until INR steady state is achieved before the incremental dose adjustment approach as defined by Meijer et al, is applied. </summary>
