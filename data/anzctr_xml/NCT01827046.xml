  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - rt-PA

Experimental: MIS plus rt-PA management - Subjects randomized to the MIS plus rt-PA management arm will undergo minimally invasive surgery followed by up to 9 doses of 1.0 mg of rt-PA (Activase/Alteplase/CathFlo) for intracerebral hemorrhage clot resolution.

No Intervention: Medical management - Subjects randomized to medical management will receive the standard medical therapies for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage, which includes ICU care only and no planned surgical intervention.


Treatment: drugs: rt-PA
Up to 9 doses of 1.0 mg of rt-PA will be administered through the catheter that was placed directly into the intracerebral hemorrhage using minimally invasive surgery.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>modified Rankin Scale score - Efficacy: Demonstrate that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) for three days improves functional outcome by a 12% increase in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-3 compared to medically treated subjects assessed at 180 days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>day 180</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of mortality, rebleeding, and infection as a measure of safety - Safety: Demonstrate that early use of MIS+rt-PA for three days is safe for the treatment of ICH relative to rates of mortality, rebleeding, and infection in the medically treated subject at 30 days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>day 30</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ICH reduction - Secondary Objective: Demonstrate that the end of treatment volume and percent of ICH reduction from MIS+rt-PA is related to improved functional outcome, as compared to medically treated subjects.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Spontaneous supratentorial ICH = 30 mL diagnosed using radiographic imaging
             (computerized tomography (CT), computerized tomography angiography (CTA), etc.), with
             a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) = 14 or a NIHSS = 6.

          -  Six-hour clot size equal to the most previous clot size (within 5 mL) as determined by
             additional CT scans at least 6 hours apart using the ABC/2 method.

          -  Symptoms less than 24 hours prior to diagnostic CT (dCT) scan (an unknown time of
             onset is exclusionary).

          -  Ability to randomize between 12 and 72 hours after dCT.

          -  Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) &lt; 180 mmHg sustained for six hours recorded closest to
             the time of randomization.

          -  Historical Rankin score of 0 or 1.

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Infratentorial hemorrhage.

          -  Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) requiring treatment for IVH-related (casting) mass
             effect or shift due to trapped ventricle. External ventricular drain (EVD) to treat
             intracranial pressure (ICP) is allowed.

          -  Thalamic bleeds with apparent midbrain extension with third nerve palsy or dilated and
             non-reactive pupils. Other (supranuclear) gaze abnormalities are not exclusions. Note:
             Patients with a posterior fossa ICH or cerebellar hematomas are ineligible.

          -  Irreversible impaired brain stem function (bilateral fixed, dilated pupils and
             extensor motor posturing), GCS = 4.

          -  Ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), vascular anomaly, Moyamoya
             disease, hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic infarct, recurrence of a recent (&lt; 1
             year) hemorrhage diagnosed with radiographic imaging.

          -  Patients with unstable mass or evolving intracranial compartment syndrome.

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100,000, international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.4, or an elevated
             prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

          -  Any irreversible coagulopathy or known clotting disorder.

          -  Inability to sustain INR = 1.4 using short- and long-active procoagulants (such as but
             not limited to NovoSeven, Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), and/or vitamin K).

          -  Subjects requiring long-term anti-coagulation are excluded. Reversal of
             anti-coagulation is permitted for medically stable patients who can realistically
             tolerate the short term risk of reversal. Patient must not require Coumadin
             (anticoagulation) during the first 30 days, and normalized coagulation parameters must
             be demonstrated, monitored closely and maintained during the period of brain
             instrumentation.

          -  Use of Dabigatran, Apixaban, and/or Rivaroxaban (or a similar medication from the
             similar medication class) prior to symptom onset.

             genitourinary, or respiratory tracts.

          -  Superficial or surface bleeding, observed mainly at vascular puncture and access sites
             (e.g., venous cutdowns, arterial punctures, etc.) or site of recent surgical
             intervention.

          -  Positive urine or serum pregnancy test in pre-menopausal female subjects without a
             documented history of surgical sterilization.

          -  Allergy/sensitivity to rt-PA.

          -  Prior enrollment in the study.

          -  Participation in a concurrent interventional medical investigation or clinical trial.
             Patients in observational, natural history, and/or epidemiological studies not
             involving an intervention are eligible.

          -  Not expected to survive to the day 365 visit due to co-morbidities and/or are do not
             resuscitate (DNR)/ do not intubate (DNI) status prior to randomization.

          -  Any concurrent serious illness that would interfere with the safety assessments
             including hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular,
             endocrinologic, immunologic, and hematologic disease.

          -  Patients with a mechanical heart valve. Presence of bio-prosthetic valve(s) is

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the patient is unstable and would benefit from a
             specific intervention rather than supportive care plus or minus MIS+rt-PA removal of
             the ICH.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give written
             informed consent.</exclusivecriteria>
