    <interventions>Sampling will be conducted on consenting subjects fulfilling criteria for recruitment to attain a series of at least 300 patients with a clinical diagnosis of HF. Analytes will include hs cTnT, GDF-15, ST2, MR-proANP, MR-proADM and galectin 3. All will be compared with concurrent serial sampling for NTproBNP. Samples will be acquired at admission, 24 hours, pre-discharge and at 7, 14 and 30 days post-discharge. Events (all-cause death, readmission for HF, admission for cardiovascular cause and allcause readmission) will be recorded over two years of follow-up. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 300 patients with ADHF will ensure a minimum of 100 deaths and over 200 readmissions for recurrent ADHF over 2 years follow-up and will allow robust testing of multi-variate predictive models including 10 or more clinical, imaging variables and candidate markers as putative independent predictive markers of the nominated outcomes of interest. The majority of analyses undertaken for this study are considered hypothesis generating.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> Heart Failure is the leading of cause of hospitalisation in adults over 65 years. It is increasing in prevalence due to
aging, rising rates of obesity and diabetes and enhanced long term survival with coronary heart disease (CHD) and
hypertension. In New Zealand there over 12,000 HF admissions annually and, despite clinical advances, morbidity
and mortality remain high. TEMPORALHF will assess prognostic performance (and optimal timing for sampling
within the peri and post discharge period) of recently discovered promising HF biomarkers for indication of 30, 90,
180 days and 1 year prognosis. Results will be compared with NTproBNP as a preliminary step to assessing the
applicability of the new markers in guiding acute and post discharge management of HF. Sampling will be
conducted on consenting subjects fulfilling criteria for recruitment to attain a series of at least 300 patients with a
clinical diagnosis of HF. All biomarkers will be compared with concurrent serial sampling for NTproBNP. Samples will be acquired at admission, 24 hours, pre discharge and at 7, 14 and 30 days post discharge. Events (all cause death, readmission for HF, admission for cardiovascular cause and allcause readmission) will be recorded over two years of follow up.</summary>
