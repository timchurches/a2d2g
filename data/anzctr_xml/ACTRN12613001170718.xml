  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cancer Coping Online (CCO) is a 6-week multimedia internet application, where a new module is released to participants each week, with a reminder email to use the program. The frequency in which participants will access these modules will be at the participants' discretion. Modules cover a range of commonly experienced psychosocial issues. Each module of CCO is comprised of three main components: psycho-education, cognitive-behavioural worksheets / strategies, and survivor stories and quotes. An online journal and a resource section is available throughout the duration of the program.
Website usage and adherence to the intervention is evaluated through online monitoring of the number of logins per user,  the average session duration per user and the number of modules accessed and completed per user.</interventions>
    <comparator>An online information-only version of CCO provides an appropriate attention control for the study. The control condition covers the same 6 module topics, but has no interactive features(i.e., no worksheets, activities, relaxation exercises, or journal). </comparator>

(While advanced cancer patients will not be targeted for recruitment, this is a population that asks for interventions and may self-refer to the program. Therefore individuals who specifically request to participate will be enrolled, but not included in primary analyses. If a large enough sub-sample self-refers to the program, a sub-analysis will be conducted.) </exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The internet is increasingly utilised by people with cancer to obtain information and support. However, to date no randomised controlled study has evaluated the effectiveness of a structured online self-help therapeutic program. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine how helpful 'Cancer Coping Online' is, an interactive online 6-week self-help coping program, compared to receiving online information only, in improving distress, coping and quality of life after cancer diagnosis. </summary>
