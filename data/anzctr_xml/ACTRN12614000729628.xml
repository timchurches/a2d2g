  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of an innovative and time efficient 'High Intensity Interval Training' school-based program to increase fitness (e.g., cardio-respiratory fitness, muscular strength) and improve psychological well-being e.g., physical self-description, executive function) amongst adolescents. The proposed project will involve the development of a 3-arm intervention (Group A: High Intensity Interval Training; Group B: Body Weight Exercise Program; Group C: Wait List Control) to encourage students to participate short sessions of intense exercise. The proposed intervention may assist in reducing rates of obesity and improving physical, social and emotional well-being in Australian adolescents.
We aim to recruit approximately 60 year 9-10 students from one secondary school in the Newcastle region. It has been determined that 20 participants per group would provide adequate power to detect statistically significant effects, assuming a drop-out of 15%. 
An information session will be delivered by a member of the research team and delivered during school hours. The session will outline the intervention and requirements of the students. Students will be given the opportunity to ask questions regarding the program during this session.
Eligible students, will be asked to complete both physiological and psychological assessments at baseline and post-intervention. 
The High Intensity Interval Training intervention will include an evidence-based and innovative approach to improve fitness and psychological well-being amongst year 9-10 students. The 'High Intensity Interval Training' intervention will include face-to-face activity sessions delivered by trained Physical Education teachers, on campus during recess and lunch breaks. Participants will participate in 3 sessions delivered on a weekly basis. 
At the conclusion of the intervention, students will be provided with a range of resources to promote continued participation in self-directed 'High Intensity Interval Training' sessions (e.g., Smart Phone Apps, websites, a booklet of workouts, etc).


The High Intensity Interval Training group will receive cardio based exercises (e.g., running, jumping jacks, jumping rope) administered on a group basis, during 3 weekly session of 8 minute each (for a total of 8 weeks). Intensity will be examined via heart rate monitors (e.g., 80%+ maximum heart rate target).

The Body Weight Exercise Program group will receive cardio plus muscular strength exercises (e.g., push ups, squat jumps, walking lunges) administered on a group basis, during 3 weekly session of 8 minute each (for a total of 8 weeks). Intensity will be examined via heart rate monitors (e.g., 60%+ maximum heart rate target).

Strategies used to monitor adherence include: student enjoyment and participation in the program (e.g., pre and post session feelings state), and session attendance during the 8 weeks.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The program will be replicated for the wait list control group once the intervention and all follow-up assessments have been completed with all groups.  The wait-list control group will receive the High Intensity Interval Training program during term 4 (approximately 3 weeks post-intervention) at school, during school hours (i.e., sessions will be conducted during recess and lunch breaks, using school-based facilities, three days per week). </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be sourced from one school in the Newcastle area. The school principal will be sent an information statement describing the study and a consent letter. If the principal declines the study invitation, another school in the Newcastle area will be contacted. 

Once a school has been successfully recruited, participants will be provided with study information via: announcements at school assembly, announcements during PE lessons and provision of an information statement.

All students in year 9-10 will be invited to participate in the study. 

Students will be invited to an information session at the school describing the study. At this session, interested students will be provided with an Information Letter detailing the intervention, the anticipated benefits, their required commitment level, and a Consent Form. 

Participants will enter the study voluntarily. This will be explained to students at the school announcements sessions. Consent will be sought from both parent and child if interested in participating. 

Participants will be aware of each other's intervention condition allocation, as concealing this information is not feasible in an exercise trial conducted within a school setting (at one school).

Therefore, allocation is not concealed.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Once baseline testing has been completed, students will be randomly allocated to one of the three study arms using a computer based random number-producing algorithm. This method ensures an equal chance of allocation to each group. 
(i) High Intensity Interval Training;
(ii) Body Weight Exercise Program;
(iii) Wait List Control.

Assessors will be blinded to allocation at baseline and post test (assessors will not be aware of participants' groups at post test).

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted with linear mixed models using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (2010 SPSS Inc., IBM Company Armonk, NY) and alpha levels will be set at p &lt; 0.05. The models will be used to assess the impact of treatment (HIIT or BWEP or control), time (treated as categorical levels baseline and post-intervention) and the group-by-time interaction, these three terms forming the base model. The models will be specified to adjust for the clustered nature of the data and will include all randomised participants in the analysis. 

Power calculations were based on change in the primary outcome of cardio-vascular fitness (multi-stage shuttle test (Leger and Lambert 1982)). Based on a previous study (Eather et al., 2014) a between-group difference of 10 laps was considered achievable, assuming a standard deviation of 9, 80% power with alpha levels set a 0.05. It was determined that 20 participants per group would provide adequate power to detect statistically significant effects, assuming a drop-out of 15%.

    <summary>Aim of pilot study: 
To evaluate the impact of an 8-week school-based intervention examining  High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) vs. a Body Weight Exercise Program (BWEP) on various physical and psycho-social outcomes for low active year 9-10 students from the Newcastle region.
i.	Can an 8-week school-based HIIT program improve cardio-respiratory fitness (primary outcome) in comparison to a BWEP for low active students?
ii.	Can an 8-week school-based HIIT program improve secondary outcomes (e.g., Body composition, BMI, Muscular fitness, physical self-description, executive function) in comparison to a BWEP for low active students?
iii.	Will a school-based HIIT program be a feasible and acceptable method to improve fitness outcomes and psycho-social outcomes of students?

Implementation of Pilot Study:

Implementation of the 3-arm 8-week HIIT vs. BWEP intervention will occur during term 3, 2014. After randomisation has occurred:
*Group A (n=20 participants) will proceed as the HIIT intervention group;
*Group B (n=20 participants) will proceed as the BWEP intervention group; and, 
*Group C (n=20 participants) will act as the comparison (wait-list control) group. 

The program will be replicated for group C once the intervention and all follow-up assessments have been completed by all groups.  The intervention and wait-list control groups will receive the program at school, during school hours (i.e., sessions will be conducted during recess and lunch breaks, using school-based facilities, three days per week during term 3). 

Setting and Participants:
The program will be held during school hours (i.e., recess and lunch breaks) utilising facilities available at the school. Equipment for the activity sessions will be sourced from the school and the University of Newcastle PE store room, if required. 
This pilot study will involve three separate groups within one secondary college in the Newcastle region, aiming to recruit a total of 60 participants (Intervention condition A (N=20 participants); Intervention condition B (N=20 participants); Wait list control (N=20 participants)).
Intervention:

This intervention is designed for year 9-10 students from a secondary college in the Newcastle region. The intervention will involve delivery of an 8-week school-based program conducted within school hours (e.g., recess and lunch breaks).
The program will consist of:
*Each week students randomised to the intervention conditions will participate in 3 x 8 minute HIIT or BWTP sessions, which will include a combination of core, upper body and lower body exercises. Sessions will be conducted by trained facilitators (e.g., qualified physical education teachers).
*Sessions will be held in the school gym or another appropriate area within the school campus during recess/lunch breaks on three days per week.
*All sessions will be delivered in a comfortable environment (e.g., indoors, air-conditioned, sufficient space, motivational music, basic equipment) to ensure continued participation and engagement of students. 

Physiological and psycho-social assessments will be conducted at baseline and post-intervention.
