  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims: To evaluate the effects of erythromycin on small intestinal transit and glucose absorption. 
Hypotheses: Erythromycin will prolong small intestinal transit and, thereby, improve absorption of glucose. Background: Delayed gastric emptying is common in the critically ill and leads to inadequate nutrient delivery.  This is usually treated with administration of prokinetic drugs such as erythromycin.  While this increases nutrient delivery, the effect on nutrient absorption is unknown.  However, in healthy subjects erythromycin has been reported to slow small intestinal transit and thereby increase absorption of nutrient . 
Research Plan: 15 critically ill patients will be studied in a randomised controlled, double-blind, cross-over fashion on consecutive days. On each study day either intervention (erythromycin 200mg IV) or placebo will be administered from t=-20 to 0min. At t= 0 min a test meal consisting of a representative nutrient liquid (1kcal/ml), and 3 grams of 3-O-methyl glucose (3-OMG) mixed with 20MBq 99Tc sulphur colloid will be administered at 2ml/min until t=30 min.  Small intestinal transit time will be measured using scintigraphy. Glucose absorption will be measured using plasma concentrations of 3-OMG.  
Significance: If the hypotheses are proven it would support the use of erythromycin in this group.  The alternate outcome (i.e. erythromycin accelerates transit and reduces nutrient absorption) would challenge current feeding protocols common to most Intensive Care Units (ICUs).</summary>
