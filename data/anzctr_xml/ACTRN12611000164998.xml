  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a family-based education programme aimed at reducing screen-based sedentary behaviours such as TV watching and video game console use.  The intervention is grounded in behavioural economics theory (BET) and social cognitive theory (SCT).  Trained culturally appropriate research assistants will deliver the intervention content to participants primary caregivers during a one hour face-to-face meeting, within two weeks of the baseline assessment. Meetings will be at the participants home and will involve providing the caregiver with skills and strategies to monitor and reduce use of screen-based sedentary activities.

The primary caregiver will be responsible for implementing the various strategies of the intervention. 

Television monitoring devices (Time Machine) will be used as a tool to assist families to budget their TV watching time. The Time Machine controls the amount of time the television can be turned on and is used as a tool for parents to help budget TV watching time and can be used to set screen free times by preventing usage during certain time. 

A research assistant will visit the participants home (face-to-face meeting) to connect the Time Machine to the two devices (television, video game console or computer) most commonly used by the child. 

Tailored monthly newsletters will also be delivered to primary caregivers outlining additional strategies for reducing screen-based sedentary activities. A website for participants to access will also be provided to support the intervention content. The website includes the information included in the monthly newsletters as well as links to community-based activity programmes that may be of interest to the family.

The intervention duration is 20 weeks and parents/caregivers will be encouraged to implement the changes on a daily basis.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will continue with their usual screen-based activities (usual care) and will not receive the behavioural intervention. Usual screen-based activities include their usual daily leisure time TV watching, computer and video game play.</comparator>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment will be undertaken via advertising using community contacts, churches, maraes, public health organisations, and word of mouth.  

Potential participants will either contact the research office to register their interest or will be contacted by the research team following direct contact.  Interested and potentially eligible participants and their primary caregiver will be screened over the phone during a recruitment phone call.  A baseline assessment will be scheduled for eligible participants and their caregiver within 4 weeks of the screening call at the participantâ€™s home.

Following the baseline assessment a research assistant will enter the participant's details on the research database using electronic data capture systems using a secure study laptop computer. Once demographic details have been entered participants will be randomised using a central computer system. Allocation concealment will be maintained up until the point of randomisation using this method.</concealment>
    <sequence>Eligible children will be randomised by computerised central randomisation using stratified blocked randomisation with variable block sizes (i.e., multiple of 2 arms) to maintain balance across important prognostic factors. Two stratification factors will be considered: sex (female and male) and preferred ethnicity (Maori, Pacific and non-Maori/non-Pacific). Allocation concealment up to the point of randomisation will be maintained.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite epidemiological evidence supporting an association between TV watching and obesity, to date few interventions have been undertaken.  There has been very little home-based research to date examining the effectiveness of interventions to decrease sedentary behaviours such as TV watching and video game computer use. The proposed trial will implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a family-based intervention to decrease screen-based sedentary behaviour and improve body composition among New Zealand families. Two hundred and seventy children aged 9-12 years and their primary caregivers will be allocated at random to receive a package of information, support and strategies aimed at reducing leisure time screen-based activities over a 24 week period or a control group (usual screen-based activities). Assessments at baseline and 24-weeks will compare BMI, body composition, physical activity, sedentray behaviours, and dietary habits. If effective, this approach has potential to be implemented as part of existing primary care approaches to reduce BMI in children.</summary>
