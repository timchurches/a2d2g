  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a non-drug intervention crossover trial, which instead uses a dietary supplement MCT. All participants will be assessed using the combination of a hyperinsulinaemic clamp, functional MRI and cognitive testing on 2 occasions: I) with ingestion of MCT and ii) with ingestion of placebo. 
The MCT mixture that will be used will be Liquigen (Nutricia), 50% MCT emulsion (compromising 55% octanoate, 36% decanoate and 9% other fatty acids). A single 40g dose (83ml) will be ingested over 10 min. 
An experienced dietician will be in charge of distributing the MCT/Placebo into opaque drinking cups with a lid and hard plastic straws to ensure blinding occurs. 

The two arms will be separated by at least 1 week but no longer than 6 weeks. 


The participants will be block allocated. The MRI scans &amp; cognitive testing will be done prior to either the MCT or placebo, and post the participant drinking the placebo/MCT. The participant will then be required to attend another day, within 6 weeks of the first session, and the same process will happen again. Thus one day will be a placebo drink the other day will be the MCT drink.</interventions>

This schedule will be generated by an independent statistician using block randomisation to maintain balance between groups.  Groups will differ in the order in which they receive the MCT and placebo mixtures over the 2 research days. Participants and all members of the study team will be blinded to study group allocation.  The schedule will be provided to the RCH formula room (who will prepare the drinks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess whether medium chain triglycerides (MCT) can protect the brains of adolescents with type1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) during hypoglycaemia.
Glucose is the dominant metabolic substrate for brain function. Hypoglycaemia is an inevitable consequence of insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Even with good control, children and adolescents with T1D spend up to one hour per day with blood glucose levels in the hypoglycaemic range. If untreated, hypoglycaemia can lead to impaired cognition, loss of consciousness and potentially death. Fear of the neurologic consequences of hypoglycaemia is one of the main impediments to optimal metabolic control in children with T1D. Thus there is an imperative for neuroprotective therapies that mitigate or prevent the effects of hypoglycaemia. 
Using hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp techniques and simultaneous neuroimaging we have previously investigated the effects of hypo- and hyperglycaemia on brain metabolism, neural networks and cognition in adolescents with T1D. Our studies found clinically important, novel, consistent and robust changes in regional brain perfusion, activation and metabolism during passage from euglycaemia to hypoglycaemia. These abnormalities in neuronal activity persist over hours despite return to euglycaemia. We now plan to exploit these novel findings and to study whether the observed changes can be mitigated or prevented by the prophylactic administration of MCT prior to hypoglycaemic challenge.
We will test the efficacy of MCT during clamp-induced hypoglycaemia in a randomised, cross-over placebo-controlled trial. The study population will be 10 adolescents aged 12-18years with Type 1 diabetes, recruited from the Diabetes Clinic at the Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne. Our primary outcome will be difference in cerebral perfusion as measured by arterial spin labelling  ASL) during hypoglycaemia induced following MCT as compared with placebo.. Our secondary outcomes will be differences between groups in, functional connectivity  /activation in the default mode network (measured using blood oxygen level dependent [BOLD] signalling), brain metabolism (measured using BOLD signalling), frontal lobe biochemistry (measured spectroscopically) and cognitive function (measured on a working memory task). We hypothesize that the changes in all of these outcome measures during hypoglycaemia will be mitigated or prevented by prior oral MCT administration. 
Our ultimate aim is to devise a simple oral therapy that can be taken by all children with T1D to protect the brain from hypoglycaemia. This will lead to improved neurologic outcomes and facilitate better overall metabolic control of their diabetes.
