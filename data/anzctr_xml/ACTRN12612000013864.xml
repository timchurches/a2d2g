  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients require transthoracic echocardiography and ECG to confirm eligibility. Eligible patients will undergo cardiac catheterisation to implant the stent into the thoracic aorta under general anaesthesia. Patients will undergo another echocardiogram at discharge, then at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. A chest x-ray will be performed at 2 and 4 or 5 year follow up to evaluate the stent integrity.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A significant reduction in the gradient across the coarctation as assessed pre stent versus immediately post stent and pre stent vs. 12 month follow-up in two values from the Doppler echocardiographic profile: DV (diastolic velocity in cm/sec) and DV/SV (diastolic velocity /systolic velocity atio).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Morbidity rate (that is non-inferior to the surgery rate reported by Carr (The results of catheter based therapy compared with surgical repair of the adult aortic coarctation. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2006; 47: 1101-1107. ).</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device success, defined as the successful delivery and deployment of the study stent and intact retrieval of the delivery system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At implant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major Adverse Event and Major Adverse Vascular. Event. 

Major adverse vascular events defined as: 
Stroke or transient ischemic attack,
Aortic rupture,  
Aortic dissection,
Aortic aneurysm requiring surgical intervention, 
Inadvertent closure of significant aortic side branch, 
Femoral Artery access rupture, thrombosis, clinically 
apparent distal embolization, 
Restenosis requiring reintervention,  
Stent Fracture leading to loss of structural integrity, 
Stent dislodgement, migration or embolization responsible for occluding any side branch or requiring surgical intervention. 

Major adverse event defined as: 
Death, stroke (hemorrhagic, non-hemorrhagic, or 
unknown), significant embolic events causing end-
organ damage, (e.g. lower extremity ulceration or 
gangrene),       
Conversion to surgery due to procedure complication,
assessed by clinical evaluation and use of echocardiography (ultrasound) and radiological procedures (angiography) for confirmation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An increase in the  diameter of the coarctation after stent placement to greater than or equal to 80% of diameter of the transverse arch immediately distal to the left subclavian artery [isthmus] (CoA:DAo greater than or equal to 0.8) as measured by CT.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After the stenting procedure during index procedure and at 12 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>No post procedural (12month) stent migration, where migration is defined as displacement of the stent &gt;20mm from an established anatomical landmark verified during deployment. </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion Criteria: - The physician is not able to access the coarctation with standard techniques. - Presence of other thoracic aortic arterial lesions or aneurysms requiring treatment within 30 days of the implant procedure. - Length of coarctation is greater than 45 mm in length. - Connective tissue and genetic disorders, including William, Marfan, Turner, Noonan syndrome. - The coarctation has adjacent, acute thrombus. - The coarctation was previously treated with a stent. - Proximity of the coarctation to an important side branch resulting in crossing of the side branch with the Large Diameter Advanta V12 Covered Stent device (e.g. "jailing" of the branch vessel). - Subject has a tubular graft, interposition graft, stent graft at or near the coarctation site that would be interfere with delivery, positioning, expansion or stabilization of the Large Diameter Advanta V12 Covered Stent - Subject has contrast agent hypersensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated, has a hypersensitivity to stainless steel, ePTFE or has intolerance to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic medications. - Bloodstream infection - Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. - Subject has a co-morbid illness that may result in a life expectancy of less than 1 year. - The investigator deems the subject to be an inappropriate candidate for the study. - Subject is participating in an investigational study of a new drug, biologic or device at the time of study screening. NOTE: Subjects who are participating in the long term follow-up phase of a previously investigational and now approved product are not excluded by this criterion.</exclusivecriteria>
