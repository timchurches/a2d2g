  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exposure to 1 standard erythemal dose (SED) UV radiation from natural sunlight three times per week for three weeks. 1 SED, which is half the amount of UV radiation required to produce sunburn and takes about 9-12 minutes to achieve in Brisbane in the month of August and September [Samanek et al., 2006]. 
The dose will be monitored using a portable UV detector, which alarms when a set exposure is received.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25(OH)D).
Serum 25(OH)D in blood samples will me assessed using a  Diasorin Liaison assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 1,2,3 and 7 weeks after intervention commences</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total UV received.
The on and off trial UV received by participants will be measured using polysulphone dosimeters. Each participant will wear a dosimeter each day for three weeks during the trial (21 in total).
Participants will insert the dosimeter into a silicone wristband and wear it on their left wrist from the time they arise in the morning until they retire at night, taking care to ensure that the dosimeter is not obstructed by clothing or jewelry. They will be asked to place the dosimeter back in its packet at the end of the day to avoid possible saturation of the dosimeters capacity to register UV exposure. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Once every day for three weeks.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vitamin D is essential for human well-being. Skin conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3 by UVB radiation from sun exposure remain the most abundant source of vitamin D for most humans. Available evidence suggests that relatively high proportions of people in many different countries, including in Australia and New Zealand, have low vitamin D status. However exposure to the sun causes skin cancer and it is therefore critical to develop a better understanding about possible balance between the risks and benefits of sun exposure. In particular, it is important to know how much sun exposure is needed to optimize vitamin D in different groups of people.
The aim of the study is to measure the magnitude of effect of natural sun exposure three days a week for three weeks on the vitamin D level of fair-skinned indoor workers. 
This study will be a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Fair-skinned indoor workers aged 18 to 60 years will be randomized into two groups  control and intervention. Participants in the intervention group will be exposed to natural sunlight three days a week for three weeks while those in the control group will go about their business as usual. Blood samples will be collected from the participants pre- and post-intervention to study their levels of vitamin D. A follow up blood sample will be collected from all participants four weeks after the intervention to determine any wash-out effect. The participants incidental sun exposure will be monitored through UV monitors. Questionnaires will be administered to gather demographic, sun exposure and sun protection behavior as well as outdoor activity in the weekends during the intervention period.
It is anticipated that this study will offer us a better understanding about the extent of effect sunlight has on vitamin D levels of people with fair skin.</summary>
