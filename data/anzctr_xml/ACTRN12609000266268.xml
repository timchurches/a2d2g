  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects randomized to the Early dialysis initiation: commence dialysis as soon as possible with a target glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 10-14 ml/min/1.73m^2.
Dialysis type and regimen used (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) is determined by the caring renal physician.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects randomized to the Late dialysis initiation: delay the commencement of dialysis until their GFR is between 5-7 ml/min/1.73m^2.
Dialysis type and regimen used (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) is determined by the caring renal physician.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All cause mortality</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of the trial. 800 patients will be followed every 3 months for a minimum of 3 years post randomization.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life as measured by using the following research tools:
Health Utilities Index III (HUI III), a multi-attribute generic instrument for measuring quality of life;
Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL), another multi-attribute generic instrument for measuring quality of life;
Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL), a disease-specific instrument for measuring quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Health Utilities Index III (HUI III) is completed by each patient at baseline and every three months thereafter;
Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) is also completed by each patient at baseline and every three months thereafter;
Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) is completed by each patient at baseline and every 12 months thereafter.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost of treatment:
Health Services Utilisation (HSU), an instrument used to collect data on use of hospital resources; and
Patient Diary, an instrument used to collect data on use of community resources.
A separate review of the cost of dialysis in Australia and New Zealand has also been performed and comparisons will also be made with other already published data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Health Services Utilisation (HSU) is completed for each patient every 3 months after baseline (but not at baseline).  This form is completed by the study nurse from the patient's hospital records; and
Patient Diary is completed by each patient each month.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac echo changes that will be studied include:
a) left ventricular mass;
b) systolic function;
c) diastolic function; and
d) myocardial fibrosis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cardiac echo changes will be reviewed in each subject at 0, 6 and 12 months and also just prior to the commencement of dialysis in patients randomized to the late start group.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nutrition will be assessed using the following measures:
a) Total body nitrogen assessment using prompt neutron activation analysis;
b) Subjective global assessment: a clinical nutrition score;
c) Bioelectrical impedance monitoring; and
c) Serum albumin measurement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and then every 12 months for 3 years.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has been suggested that dialysis should be commenced early, in subjects with progressive chronic kidney disease, in order to prevent illness and complications however this had never been proven. The IDEAL study was designed to determine when is the best time to commence kidney dialysis for the very first time.
8 Centers are participating in New Zealand.
24 Centers are participating in Australia.</summary>
