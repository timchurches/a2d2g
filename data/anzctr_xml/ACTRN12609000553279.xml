    <studytitle>Topical vs Oral agents to lower intra-ocular pressure following cataract surgery (Acetazolamide vs Brimonidine)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Among patients who undergo phacoemulsification cataract surgery, is a single dose of topical brimonidine as effective, or more effective than a single dose of oral acetazolamide to lower intra-ocular pressure, post-operatively?</scientifictitle>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Study envelopes containing the patientâ€™s allocation to either group A or B will be given to the clinical nurse of the ophthalmology clinic.  They will be sequentially numbered, sealed, identical and opaque.  These envelopes will be allocated to patients sequentially.</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation of study group within these envelopes will be completed at an earlier time by an individual independent to the study. They will utilize a computer randomization program to generate the allocation of each patient (e.g. 1-56) to study arm A or B. They will then insert the appropriate documentation for the administration of agent A or B into each envelope, prior to sealing.  There will be equal numbers of envelopes for each group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tragically, one patient in this state recently suffered a fatal outcome following a severe allergic reaction to acetazolamide, a routine post-operative oral tablet used following cataract surgery to combat increases in the amount of fluid pressure within the operated eye. If not controlled, this increase in pressure can lead to damage to the optic nerve and retinal artery and vein occlusion in susceptible patients.  There have been 2 similar cases of severe allergic reactions to acetazolamide reported in the medical literature. A survey of consultants in the United Kingdom found that 83% of surgeons who routinely prescribed pressure lowering medications used acetazolamide.
We propose to investigate the use of brimonidine, a topical agent in a case-control study vs. oral acetazolamide in patients who have undergone phacoemulsification cataract surgery.  We hypothesise that this topical agent will have a similar or superior efficacy in controlling ocular hypertension, whilst avoiding potentially serious systemic adverse effects. It is hoped that this may provide the impetus for change in clinical practice, where currently, the majority of patients are prescribed oral acetazolamide. To our knowledge, such a study comparing single dose use of these medications has not been published.</summary>
