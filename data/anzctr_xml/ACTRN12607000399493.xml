  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants are randomised to receive either the new low vision self-management program Living with Low Vision  or continued access to usual low vision rehabilitation services.

The Living with Low Vision program has been developed specifically for this study. It consists of eight 3-hour weekly facilitated group sessions. The program is structured and a facilitator manual clearly outlines the content and delivery. As well as providing information, the topics in the program are covered by exploring participants experiences, difficulties and solutions. Participants are encouraged to draw on their extensive life experience and coping mechanisms and to develop new skills and strategies and apply these new techniques in their daily life. Participants are given the option to bring a relative, friend or carer to the program with them.
</interventions>
    <comparator>
Usual low vision rehabilitation services consist of an initial assessment at a low vision clinic to discuss service goals and an optometric assessment and prescription of low vision devices. Clients have continued access to a multidisciplinary service team consisting of occupational therapy, orientation and mobility, orthoptics and welfare specialists. Additional support and information services are also available. Services are tailored to client goals.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Impact of Vision Impairment Questionnaire (IVI) is used to assess the restriction of participation in daily activities in people with low vision (Lamoureux, Pallant, Pesudovs, Hassell, &amp; Keeffe, 2006)  The 28-item IVI has been extensively validated and has been shown to be sensitive to rehabilitation-induced changes in people with low vision.  

The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) is used to assess psychological well-being (Henry &amp; Crawford, 2005; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 2004). This is a 21-item self-report measure that provides three 7-item subscales of negative affect: depression, anxiety and stress. </outcome>
      <timepoint>
All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 months, 10 months and 16 months follow-up.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) is used to assess general self-efficacy (Jerusalem &amp; Schwarzer, 1992).</outcome>
      <timepoint>All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 months, 10 months and 16 months follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is used to assess the both positive and negative mood (Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988).</outcome>
      <timepoint>All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 months, 10 months and 16 months follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adaptation to Age-related Vision Loss Scale (AVL-12) is used to assess psychosocial adaptation to vision loss, including acceptance of limitations, attitudes towards rehabilitation and appropriate help from family and friends (Horowitz &amp; Reinhardt, 2006).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 months, 10 months and 16 months follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Health Education Impact Questionnaire (HEIQ) scales: Skill and technique acquisition (five items) and Positive and active engagement in life (five items) are used to determine the direct impact of the program on strategies to manage low vision and engagement in life (Nolte, Elsworth, Sinclair, &amp; Osborne, 2006).
