  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment with oral carbimazole (variable dose to achieve euthyroidism; 2.5-60 mg daily) with length of treatment based on TRAb (Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody) titre, performed 3-monthly on blood serum testing.

This is a pilot, single blinded randomised controlled trial assessing whether a treat-to-target TRAb approach with anti-thyroid drugs (carbimazole to achieve euthyroidism, continued until 6 months after TRAb resolution) results in lower risk of relapse of hyperthyroidism after treatment cessation, compared with standard therapy (defined below). In addition, this trial will provide estimates of changes in quality of life, health care utilisation, and assess feasibility of recruitment. It will provide data for a sample size calculation for a properly powered randomised controlled trial.  </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment will occur from the Thyroid Clinic at Royal Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital. A total sample size of 50 will be recruited for this pilot trial. Randomisation will occur using a random number generator within Microsoft Excel, producing 50 random numbers. Patients assigned an even number will be allocated to group 1 (TTT group) and odd numbers to group 2 (standard care).  Randomisation will occur on a 1:1 basis.  Investigators involved in the assessment of outcomes will be blinded to the group allocation.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis.  
Patient characteristics will be summarised and compared between the intervention and control group. The primary outcome will be analysed using Pearsons Chi-squared (or Fishers exact tests, if required) as will other categorical variables.  Continuous variables will be compared using t-tests (for normally distributed data) and Wilcoxon rank sum or Kruskal-Wallis (for non-parametric data).  Rates of relapse will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival methods.
Area under the curve method will be used to calculate quality adjusted life years, using AQOL-6 data, which, along with health care cost data, will be used in Markov modelling to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for TTT over standard care.  Sensitivity analysis will be used to assess for the amount of uncertainty in the model.
