  <interventions>
    <interventions>This clinical trial was conducted at the phase I ward in fuwai hospital All doses supervised at study centre. 
In single dose study, volunteers were assigned to 4 treatment groups of tolvaptan: 15, 30, 60 and 120mg. After a 10-hour overnight fast, volunteers received a single dose of tolvaptan orally at approximately 8 a.m. on the following morning (day 1) with 200mL water
In multiple dose study, volunteers were assigned to 2 treatment groups of tolvaptan: 30 and 60mg..After a 10-hour overnight fast, volunteers received a dose of tolvaptan orally(30 or 60mg) at approximately 8 a.m. on the following morning (day 1) with 200mL water, 3 days after first dose(day 4), volunteers of two groups received oral doses of tolvaptan (same as respective first dose) daily for 6 consecutive days.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetics.
Pharmacokinetic parameters (Tmax, Cmax, t1/2, AUC, MRT, Cav, Cmin, Accumulation Index, Fluctuation%,etc)was calculated by the drug concentration data in plasma using non-compartment model (phoenix winnolin software).</outcome>
      <timepoint>For single dose study, blood will be sampled pre-dose, 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 144h, 216h, 288h and 432h after administration. 
For multiple dose study, blood will be sampled 
1) on day 1, at pre-dose, 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h adn 72h after first dose;
2) pre-dose from day 4 to day 10;
3) on Day 10, at 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h adn 72h after administration.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety was evaluated by adverse events, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, physical exam.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events(AEs) were monitored throughout the study based on spontaneous reports by volunteers, questioning by investigators, physical examinations. 
Physical examinations was performed, blood pressure, heart rate and breath were measured 1) for single dose study, at pre-dose,1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h after administration and at 8:00AM on day 6, day 9, day 12, day 15, day 18; 2) for multiple dose study, at pre-dose, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h after first dose; at pre-dose and 2h after dose on day 4 to day 10; at 24h, 48h, 72h after the last consecutive dose.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed 1)at pre-dose, 6h, 12h and 24h after administration for single dose study; 2)at pre-dose, 6h, 12h, 24h after first dose; pre-dose on day 6 and day 10; 48h after the last consecutive dose for multiple dose study. 
Clinical laboratory test(i.e., serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) was performed 1) at 24h after admimistration for single dose study; 2) at 24h after first dose, pre-dose on day 4 and day 8, 48h after the last consecutive dose for multiple dose study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacodynamic, assessed using serum electrolyte, daily urine volume and daily fluid intake.</outcome>
      <timepoint>serum electrolyte(K, Na, Cl and Mg) was measured 1)at pre-dose , 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h after administration for single dose study; 2)at pre-dose, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h after first dose; pre-dose on day 4, day 6, day 8 and day 10; 48h after the last consecutive dose for multiple dose study.
Urine volume and daily fluid intake was recorded 1) until 48h after administration for single dose study; 2)until 24h after the last consecutive dose for multiple dose study. </timepoint>
