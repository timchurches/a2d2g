  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see if adding stavudine (d4T) to anti-HIV drug regimens (with
      or without zidovudine, ZDV) can improve symptoms of AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC, problems
      involving the brain or spinal cord) in HIV-positive patients.</summary>
