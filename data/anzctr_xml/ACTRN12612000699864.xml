  <interventions>
    <interventions>Supine avoidance therapy using a body position monitoring and supine alarm device (BuzzPOD, Gorman ProMed Pty Ltd, VIC Australia).

The study intervention is a small battery operated device worn on the chest each night. It records body position continuously and uses a vibration alarm activated after 5-sec in the supine position to discourage supine sleep. The device can be configured to record body position with or without supine alarm active, allowing long-term posture recordings with or without active therapy. An event button on the device is used to record bed-time and wake-up time to define periods of time in bed.

Participants will be randomised to 2 weeks of inactive or alarm active therapy before crossing over to 2 weeks of the other condition (no washout). Posture recordings over the full trial period will be used to assess supine-avoidance effectiveness and device usage. In-home sleep studies and questionnaires at the end of each 2 week period will be used to assess other outcomes.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a relatively short-term cross-over trial for which participants will serve as their own control. The comparator / control is the 2-week period of posture recording alone with a completely inactive supine alarm.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Study device measured average nightly supine time with active versus inactive supine alarm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Supine time will be measured from study device posture recordings over every night of the trial, downloaded from the study device at the end of each 2 week period.

    <exclusivecriteria>- Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (Apnoea Hypopnoea Index &gt; or = 15 /hr)
- Co-morbidities that may preclude supine-avoidance treatment (e.g. arthritis, mobility problems preventing non-supine sleep, or a pacemaker given unknown effects of an electronic device in close proximity on the chest)
- Severe oxygen desaturation in sleep (minimum blood oxygen saturation less than 75% during home screening sleep study)
- Sleepiness potentially dangerous and requiring urgent treatment (e.g. history of falling asleep while driving, or Epworth Sleepiness Scale &gt;16) or commercial drivers
- Already on treatment for hypertension</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a research study of a new treatment device designed to discourage snorers from sleeping on their back, when snoring is mainly a problem when asleep on the back. 
The hypotheses of this project are that by avoiding sleeping on their back, snorers would have (1) reduced frequency and intensity of snoring episodes, (2) reduced overnight cardiovascular system disturbances, and (3) lower daytime blood pressure.</summary>
