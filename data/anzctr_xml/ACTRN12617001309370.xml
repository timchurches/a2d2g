  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention employed in the SLIPD Study involved a modification of light therapy that had been employed in the clinic for a time ranging from 4 months to 5 years for patients attending the Bronowski Clinic. The fluorescent, polychromatic  light source employed is an Apollo BL6 designed for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). In patients already using the BL6  there were 3 groups employed in the study. the first is the active group that were supplied at the beginning of the trial with a slightly opaque, clear filter that only slightly decreased the total emission from the source by about 15% (otherwise the emission spectra remained the same, n=10). The second group received a filter that permitted the emission of only primary red (Lee Filters # 106) at the beginning of the study (n-10). The filters were fitted onto the light sources that had been in use by each patient prior to commencing the study. The light was situated approximately 1.0 metres from the patient which delivered approximately 3-4000 LUX of polychromatic light for 1 hour per night just prior to retiring. The procedure was the same as that occurring prior to the trial with the exception that a filter was applied after the first assessment on day 1 of the trial. To insure treatment compliance, the criterion of at least 4 months of program participation was chosen as such patients with such experience routinely exhibit long term commitment. In addition, patients are evaluated during each time point during the course of the trials in the presence of a carer, spouse, relative or partner to evaluate the level of compliance achieved. The trial lasted a total of 2 weeks with assessments made 1 and 2 weeks after commencing the trial.. Dr. Willis was the clinician instructing and monitoring and assessing the patients during the course of the trial. Dr. Willis has had more than 25 years experience in assessing PD patients and in the application of light treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. </interventions>
    <comparator>As a control group 10 patients that had been maintained on light therapy as an adjunct to their routine PD treatment for a period of 4 months to 5 years were instructed to discontinue their treatment for a period of 2 weeks for the duration of the study.  This was termed a "reverse control" in the sense that all patients in the study reported advantageous effects of light prior to commencing the trial. This paradigm was instituted in the present trial to control for technical problems that develop in trials that have employed de novo patients requiring 3-4 months of adjustment before they apply the light properly during each daily exposure. </comparator>

    <designfeatures>While there were two groups implemented in the study that used light, those assigned to the group using the red filter were not aware that the  red filter fitted to the device was the same as the group where no light was  being used.  Also all parties using either the clear filter (the active) and the red filter were instructed at the commencement of the study that each would be using a device fitted with a filter that would alter the emission. Neither was aware of whether or not their filter would work. This controlled for the expectation of a better or worse outcome. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The number of patients was chosen on the basis of results obtained from an open label study undertaken in 2012 by Willis et al, involving 159 patients and published in a refereed journal.. While power calculations were attempted on the basis of that work,  the number of patients involved was limited by the numbers available at the Bronowski Clinic as many of the patients attending the clinic came from distances that would preclude them from attending 3 times in 2 weeks. The cost and health problems were taken into account in this regard. After preliminary assessment with parametric states violations of the assumptions of parametric statistics required movement to non-parametrics including Friedman's Two-way ANOVA and The Wicoxian Signed Rank Test as the primary forms of analysis. . </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluated the efficacy of specific bandwidth phototherapy as an adjunctive treatment for the treatment of Parkinsons disease. This study examined a non-invasive non-significant risk device to be used in combination with ongoing pharmacotherapy for Parkinsons disease, in Parkinsons patients already undergoing light therapy using broad spectrum, polychromatic light. While light treatment has been found to be effective in treating various forms of Parkinsonian symptoms it was originally employed to determine if it might be effective in treating comorbid symptoms of depression and insomnia associated with Parkinsons disease. In several preclinical and clinical studies to date, not only has it been found that light therapy improves these parameters but the primary symptoms of bradykinaesia, rigidity, tremor and nocturnal myoclonus improved as well [Willis and Turner, Chronobiology International, 2007; Willis et al, Reviews in the  Neurosciences, 2012; Rutten et al, Parkinson's Disorders, 2012; Videnovic et al, Movement. Disorders, 2017]. However, with continuing work on this theme the parameters surrounding the use of phototherapy have become better defined as to the frequency, time and duration of light use, the concomitant use of drugs and the management of physiological function so as to define the most effective treatment strategy for use in a double blind, placebo controlled trial. A preliminary blind trail has been undertaken which reports significant improvement in various Parkinsonian parameters (Paus et al, Movement. Disorders. 2007) and the present study  implemented a more effective treatment regimen in a controlled design.  </summary>

    <publicnotes>This SRI Committee was, in fact, a registered NH&amp;MRC committee prior to and for the duration of the present study. At the completion of the study the  Director of the SRI, Philip Stevens, joined the Department of Medicine at Monash University and the Ethics Committee was no longer operational as of August 2015, I was informed on August 12th, 2015 that the remaining post-trial ethical issues in regard to our study  would  be dealt with by the NH&amp;MRC directly. The main issues of concern were storage of trial data, data access and destruction of data at 5 years after formal publication. While we will be accessing the relevant NH&amp;MRC resources when required, the Ethical Standards Committee (SRC) of the Bronowski Institute will be monitoring our activity regarding these issues. Please note the  Bronowski SRC is an advisory committee for the general ethical issues confronting the Bronowski Institute and not a bona fide HREC per se. </publicnotes>
