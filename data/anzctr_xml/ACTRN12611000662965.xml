  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo a crossover of two interventions in random order: i. provided with national physical activity guidelines pamphlet giving information about why physical activity is important, minimum activity guidelines of 60min/day and maximum electronic media guidelines of 2 hours, types of physical activities and where to get more information; ii. the same guidelines were used for participants to use the ipod to measure and monitor their daily and weekly progress towards these physical activity goals for 4 weeks. They captured the activity using an ipod and uploaded it to a website. The website and the ipod provided immediate feedback on activity progress towards the goal. There was no washout as both the intervention and control conditions were exposing participants to physical activity based on the national physical activity guidelines, just using different mechanisms.</interventions>
    <comparator>national physical activity guideline information was provided in the form of the downloadable brochure available on the website. Participants were advised to meet the weekly guidelines for a 4-week period.</comparator>
