    <interventions>Procedure specific consent form. The procedure specific form is essentially a copy of the standard consent form. However the complications section is pre-filled with a set of possible complications including: bile leak, bile duct injury, damage to other organs, conversion, bleeding and infection. These complications were the same complications listed on the Royal Australian College of Surgeons patient information brochure for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 

Both procedure specific and standard consent form were randomised to envelopes, which were stored at the upper GI clinic. The surgical liaison nurse at the clinic provided an envelope to members of surgical staff consenting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The envelope contained either a standard or procedure specific consent form. The study assessed surgical staff behaviour. It assessed whether they document that all complications were discussed. Documenting that a complication was discussed is indicated by ticking a box next to the listed complications on the procedure specific consent form. </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard consent form. Standard consent form is the current standard written consent document used at Western Health. This document has an empty field where surgical staff can document possible complications discussed during an informed consent discussion. Both procedure specific and standard consent form were randomised to envelopes, which were stored at the upper GI clinic. The surgical liaison nurse at the clinic provided an envelope to members of surgical staff consenting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The envelope contained either a standard or procedure specific consent form. The study assessed surgical staff behaviour. It assessed whether staff document all possible laparoscopic cholecystectomy complications as listed on the Royal Australian College of Surgeons patient information brochure for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. These are those same complications listed on the procedure specific consent form and include bile duct injury, bile leak, bleeding, infection, damage to other organs and conversion. Documentation of the complication in the consent forms was assessed by researcher Dr Jack Crozier who reviewed consent forms on the electronic medical record system after all consent forms were uploaded onto the electronic medical record system.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Documentation of a standard set of laparoscopic cholecystectomy complications including bile duct injury, bile leak, bleeding, infection, damage to other organs and conversion. After surgical staff completed written consent forms they were processed and stored on the online medical record system following standard procedures. Identifying patient labels were affixed to study envelopes after the surgical staff completed the written consent. These envelopes were returned to study investigators by the surgical liaison nurse at the Upper GI clinic. Study investigators then used these identifying labels to review both standard and procedure specific consent forms on the medical record system. The proportion of written consent forms with documentation of individual complications including bile duct injury, bile leak, damage to other organs, infection, bleeding and conversion was assessed. We then assessed whether there was a significant difference in the proportion of consent form with documentation of these complications between the standard consent form and procedure specific consent form cohorts. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Documentation patient received information brochure. Patient information brochures have a sticker attached. When the surgical staff provide patients with a brochure, this is indicated by removing that sticker from the brochure and attaching it to the individual patient's outpatient progress note. This was reviewed by study investigators by reviewing the patient file from the outpatient clinic. This was done after the file was uploaded onto the electronic medical record system. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Two-sample test of differences in proportions. Assessing proportion of cases with documentation of specific complications in the procedure specific consent cohort and the standard consent cohort. 

Prior to conducting the randomised trial, we performed a pilot study where we retrospectively assessed the documentation of complications including bile duct injury, bile leak, damage to other organs, bleeding, infection and conversion. This was assessed by study investigators by reviewing 39 standard consent forms for laparoscopic cholecystectomy uploaded on the electronic medical record system. This audit provided us with a baseline level of documentation in the general surgery department. 

A sample size calculation was performed for the prospective randomised comparison of procedure specific and standard consent forms for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Baseline documentation prior to study was approximately 50% for each complication. It was hypothesised that documentation of all complications using the procedure specific consent form would increase to 90% . Accepting a Type I error of 5% and a power of 80%, 25 subjects per arm were calculated for a two-sided significant difference. All analyses were conducted with Stata 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Trial of a procedure specific consent form for laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a set of significant complications listed for discussion vs a standard consent form with no complications listed for discussion. To signify that a complication was discussed on the procedure specific consent form, surgeons/doctors had to tick the complication. We aimed to assess if documentation of these specific complications improved following the introduction of a procedure specific consent form. Participants were randomized to either a procedure specific or standard consent form. Outcomes measured were proportion of consent forms in each cohort with documentation of specific complications. </summary>
