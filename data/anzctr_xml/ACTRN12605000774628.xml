  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lateral epicondylitis is a disabling condition that is associated with pain over the outside of the elbow joint and weakness during gripping activities. It is due to and abnormal repair response to repetitive microtrauma, most commonly involving the attachment of the Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis (ECRB) tendon to the lateral epicondyle of the elbow.This pilot study is investigating the use of botulinum toxin injection to induce selective weakness of the ECRB muscle in order to provide an environment where normal healing of microscopic tears can take place, resulting in relief of pain and decreased disability.</summary>
