    <interventions>Mental Imagery Training Program
Participants will be given instruction and training by the research manager to enable them to undertake a mental imagery training program. This will involve imagining themselves smiling during particular situations which may be unique to each participant. A 3 minute unsupervised mental imagery training session will then be undertaken by the participants as a home-training program 3 times per day after facial nerve paralysis before movement recommences and continued for 3 months after facial movement returns. During this time, they will imagine themselves smiling and producing happy facial expressions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care. This involves waiting until facial movement returns with no exercises and no mental imagery training. Eye care, as specified by their treating doctor, will be emphasized by the research manager and gentle facial massage and warm moist heat may be applied at home by the participant once or twice daily. The participants will be contacted by the researchers once per month over the phone to assess progress, and will be advised as to what to look for when facial movement returns.  When facial movement does return, both groups will be given usual care which involves a home program of specific facial exercises performed in front of a mirror 3 -5 x /day for 5 minutes/session which are designed to maximise recovery of facial movement. Only the intervention group will continue with mental imagery training as well as usual care until 3 months after facial movement has returned.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether early intervention can improve outcomes following acute lower motor neurone facial nerve paralysis. The hypothesis is that by commencing mental imagery training during the time of complete facial nerve paralysis facial movements and quality of life will be improved following movement return.</summary>
