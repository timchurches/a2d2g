  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study was a quasi-randomised controlled study. Randomisation was conducted by a staff member of the school who was independent of the study using cluster randomisation based on their Tutorial groups of which there were eight in the Year group. Tutorial groups had a name and these were listed alphabetically and the first assigned to the mindfulness condition and the last four to the control condition. Randomisation was completed before enrolment in the study because attendance to the workshops was a required curricular activity for students. It was for this reason that there were disproportionate numbers in each condition and the randomisation was considered quasi. The control condition received the mindfulness workshops 5 months after the intervention group.

The intervention is a mindfulness prevention program that utilises the ACT components of: Values, Committed Action, Contact with Present Moment, Acceptance of Emotions, and Thought Defusion. It was delivered in an amphitheatre at the school. The aim of each session was to educate the students on a particular concept (e.g. Values) and encourage them to apply the concepts to their everyday life. To achieve this aim in each session, verbal explanations, personal stories, metaphors, PowerPoint slides, videos, and experiential exercises were used. An example of an experiential exercise was the mindful eating of a sultana to help teach the concept of Contact with Present Moment. The lecture-style presentations were supported by four teacher-led exercises between the presentations, during class time and in a smaller group (approximately 15 students). Teacher exercises were based on the ACT components of Thought Defusion, Contact with Present Moment, and Values. All workshops and teacher-led classes were 25 minutes in duration. In total, students received 4.6 hours of the intervention. Workshops were delivered once per week for 7 weeks. 

A clinical psychologist delivered each session of the mindfulness program face-to-face to participants. The mindfulness workshop facilitator had 6 years of university training in psychology, including 2 years in a clinical masters program. He had also received specialist training and supervision in ACT and had previously delivered the same material to a similar sized group of students in the same school. At the time of workshop delivery, he had approximately 2 years experience using ACT in both an individual and group context. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control condition comprised Pastoral Care, which was their usual class activity during the time slot that the mindfulness workshops were being delivered. In these classes of around 15 to 20 students, material on social justice and cyber-safety was presented by a schoolteacher who had been assigned to the tutorial at the start of the semester, prior to the study commencing. Duration of both programs was equivalent  all Pastoral Care classes were 25 minutes in duration and students received 4.6 hours of Pastoral Care. The control condition received the mindfulness workshops 5 months after the intervention group.

    <statisticalmethods>The present study sought to investigate an ACT-based mindfulness intervention as a school universal prevention program. One problem in the evaluation of a new prevention program is the issue of statistical power. Given there is a low rate of emergence of new cases of anxiety and depression over any given period, it has been estimated that over 30,000 participants are needed to adequately power a prevention program evaluation study. Measuring symptom reduction rather than cases can reduce this figure but still almost 1,000 would be required to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between conditions. However to justify investment in a trial of this size, preliminary evidence, obtained in a feasibility study, is required. The aims of this study were to: a) examine the feasibility and acceptability of using an ACT-based prevention program that targets anxiety and depressive symptoms in a non-clinical sample of adolescents; and b) to compare the impact of the ACT-based program on wellbeing and symptoms of depression and anxiety. It was expected that there would be a trend for the mindfulness participants to demonstrate improvements on a range of measures compared to participants in the control condition. Given the underpowered nature of feasibility studies, this trial sought to use effect sizes as an indication of effectiveness and to provide the evidence required for a large-scale study.

Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS 22.0. For baseline and drop-out comparisons, t-tests were used for continuous variables and Chi-squared tests for independence with Yates Continuity Correction for categorical variables. In the universal analysis comparing outcome scores between the mindfulness and control conditions an intention-to-treat analysis was used. Mixed Models with Repeated Measures (MMRM) is considered to be particularly appropriate for school-based studies or when the dropout rate is above 5% as it accounts for all the available data under the missing-at-random assumption. A single analysis examined the outcome scores across the three time-points. To select the covariance structure, the best fitting model using Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC) was retained. The parameters of the model were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood as the evidence suggests it is preferable over maximum likelihood when the sample is small. The dppc2, formula was used to estimate Cohens d effect sizes were interpreted using Cohens standards. A positive number for the DASS-21 and FS scales represents an improvement in symptoms and wellbeing, respectively. 
For clinical significance analysis, binary mixed modelling was used to examine if the number of participants in the Normal range compared to those in the clinical range differed significantly between the mindfulness and control conditions. The clinical significance effect sizes were calculated using the Cox Logit method.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mindfulness is an important emotion regulation strategy that has shown promise as a prevention program for anxiety and depressive symptoms. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a mindfulness-based therapy, has yet to be evaluated in this capacity. This study examines the feasibility of using an ACT-based prevention program in a sample of Year 10 (aged 14 to 16 years) high school students from Sydney, Australia. Participants were allocated to either their usual classes or to the ACT-based mindfulness condition. Participants were followed for a period of 5 months post-intervention and completed the Flourishing Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and a program evaluation questionnaire. </summary>
