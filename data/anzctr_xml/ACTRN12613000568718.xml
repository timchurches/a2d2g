  <interventions>
    <interventions>Allopurinol (20mg) will be delivered topically in 5g of Smith and Nephew Solosite Wound gel. The topical allopurinol will be applied once for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes the topical allopurinol will be immediately washed off with warm water. 
The purpose of the is study is to determine the safety of allopurinol. Study participants will be assessed prior to administration of topical allopurinol, then after 15 minutes and one week of exposure to the treatment for adverse effects e.g. inflammation, discomfort, apin and pruritus. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is to determine the safety of topical allopurinol compared to the placebo treatment for study participants with venous leg ulcer. A good outcome will be measured by the lack of adverse effects at the completion of the study. These adverse effects include indicators such as inflammation, pain, discomfort and pruritus. These side effects are all temporary changes and will subside after cessation of treatment. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary time point is 15 minutes after application and a one week follow up after the administration of topical allopurinol.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study will also collect Quality of Life Data measured using Spitzers Quality of life scale </outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary time point will be collected at the beginning of the study. This outcome will be assessed prior to the allopurinol treatment i.e at baseline.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study will also collect depression data using the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Philadelphia Geriatric Centre Morale Scale. This outcome will be assessed prior to the allopurinol treatment i.e at baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary time point will be collected at the beginning of the study. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain measures will also be collected using the Rand Medical Outcomes Study Pain Measures. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary time point will be collected at the beginning of the study (prior and after allopurinol application) and at the end of the one week data collection period in the study.</timepoint>

    <concealment>All study participants presenting to the QUT Wound Healing Community Outreach Service with a venous leg ulcer and fitting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. After potential participants are identified by the clinician in charge, the Research Assistant will approach the study participant to invite them to participate and give them an information and consent package. The study will be explained and written consent obtained from potential study participants. Following recruitment and securing of consent, study participants will be assigned a unique trial screening number consisting of their initials and a 3-digit number. The Research Assistant will collect baseline data from the study participant’s records and give the study participant a questionnaire to fill in. All data will be recorded in the study participant’s case report form (CRF). Study participants will then receive 15 minute exposure of topical allopurinol in SoloSite Wound Gel or the placebo treatment (SoloSite Wound Gel). The treatment will subsequently be washed off with warm water. Ulcer assessment data and hypersensitivity data will be collected by the on-site research assistant after the application of the treatment as described above. Study participants will receive standard best practice treatment for their ulcer and asked to return to the study wound clinic at the QUT WHCOS a week later to determine their response to topical allopurinol application. 

A random allocation sequence will be generated by the Mater Health Services Team prior to commencement of recruitment. The research team will be blinded to the study participants treatment group. Sealed “code break” envelopes will be held at the Wound Healing Community Outreach Service and with the Principal Investigator . The code will be broken by the Investigator, Clinician (or nominee) only if the information is required for the urgent and immediate treatment of the study participant.

Descriptive analysis will be undertaken of the primary outcome, the number of any hypersensitivity or ADRs in each group. Differences between the two groups will be tested with Chi-squared tests and Mann-Whitney U tests looking at the type and number of any ADRs. 
Secondary Outcomes:	
Differences between groups in Quality of Life and Pain measures will be analysed using t-tests. 

Allopurinol is commonly used orally for the treatment of gout. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have already known. The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of the treatment. This preliminary trial is unlikely to improve healing in these patients. Therefore, only a minimum number of patients, i.e. 20 patients, were chosen in order to determine whether to progress this topical formulation further.
