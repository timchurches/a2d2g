  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will test the use of two different Niagara Thermo Cyclo Pad units (the Niagara Thermo Cyclo Pad unit, and the Niagara Thermo Cyclo Pad hand held unit) against a sham/control unit, used twice daily for 20 minutes for 4 weeks. The units will be used on the study/target knee throughout the entire 4 week period, which is the most painful, eligible knee at screening.

The two intervention units include:

1) Use of Niagara Thermo Cyclo Pad unit on heat and vibrate setting (heat is set to 8 degrees above the ambient temperature, vibrate setting 3 (32-35 Hz)). 

2) Use of Niagara Thermo Cyclo Pad on heat and vibrate setting (as above), combined with the use of the Niagara Thermo Cyclo Pad hand held unit on vibrate setting (35 Hz).

Use of the Niagara Thermo Cyclo Pad involves placing the Cyclo Pad on your seat/chair/couch with the pad placed under the hamstring and the round motor end positioned directly and firmly under the study knee. The vibrate setting will be set to level 3 (32-35 Hz) and the heat setting is set to 8 degrees above the ambient temperature, therefore it will change based on the temperature of the room it is used in.

Use of the Niagara Thermo Cyclo Pad hand held unit involves placing the hand unit lengthways on the top of the thigh/quadriceps with the black Rubber cup attachment pressing against the top of the knee (where the knee is most painful) and holding it in place until the treatment has finished. The vibrate setting will be set to 35 Hz.  

The units vibrate and heat settings will be programmed into the units by CT Healthcare so that they will not able to be altered by the participants and the participants and study staff remain blinded. 

Participants will be trained in the use of the devices by a study nurse who will be trained by CT Healthcare in the operation of the units. The training session with participants will be approximately 10 minutes, or until the study nurse is satisfied the participant knows how to operate the unit/units. 

Adherence will be measured using a daily diary where participants will be required to record how much they used the device.

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be intention to treat as randomised.

As this is the first trial of these products, the effect size of the interventions beyond placebo is not known.  However, the minimum clinically important improvement in pain VAS score for absolute improvement is approximately 15mm on a 100mm VAS scale; therefore for a treatment to be clinically important, the active treatment needs to have 15mm greater reduction compared to placebo or comparator over the treatment horizon of the study (4 weeks), over and above the change over time reported in each group (placebo effect).  We expect standard deviations of approximately 25.  We will use alpha of 5% and power 80%.  We plan to recruit 20 patients in each group for a pilot study to determine the likely effect size; this will enable us to appropriately power a larger follow-up study.  This will equate to 60 patients total. 

Data will be entered into a central database in Hobart using the teleform system which we have extensive experience with. It will then be analysed in house statisticians using standard models for clinical trials. We will use a modified intent to treat (ITT) approach for data analysis, where all patients who were randomised to receive treatment will be included in the analysis.  Secondly, missing data will be accounted for in the analyses using appropriate techniques eg Statas multiple imputation (MI) functions, using 10 imputations per observation, from non-missing baseline data, using multivariate normal regression to generate outcome data. 

Change in outcomes will be assessed using the difference between the factor at baseline and follow-up using linear regression if continuous, ordered binomial if outcome is ordered categorical, and log binomial / logistic regression if binary.  Data will be analysed by including the treatment as a variable in the analysis, enabling the effect of treatment to be determined.

We will examine the pattern of change using repeated measures regression.
