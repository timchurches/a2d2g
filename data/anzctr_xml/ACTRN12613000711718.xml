    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This pilot study will include 140 patients who experienced a mild or moderate TBI in the Auckland and Hamilton regions. Eligible participants will be randomized to receiving either NeuroAid II (MLC901) or placebo using a computer randomisation programme. This will be a community-based study recruiting consecutive acute TBI patients through the Auckland City Hospital (Auckland) and Waikato Hospital (Hamilton) trauma units, Accident &amp; Medical Clinics, TBI service providers and self-referrals. Assessors and participants will be blind to treatment allocation. Allocation to group will be determined by a central computerised randomisation programme</concealment>
    <sequence>After consenting to participate in the study and completing the baseline assessment, eligible participants will be randomised to receive either the NeuroAid supplement or placebo using 1:1 minimisation randomisation. This approach stratify by center [Hamilton/Auckland], time since injury [1-2 months/2-3months] and sex. The study will be un-blinded only after group analyses have been completed. A researcher will randomise eligible participants using the computerised Minim randomisation programme at the National Institute for Stroke and Applied Neurosciences, AUT University.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive analyses: data collected at baseline will be reported and compared between the NeuroAid and Control (placebo) groups. These baseline differences and differences in outcome will be tabulated between the Neuroaid and the Control group at 1, 3, 6 and 9 month follow-up. All analyses will be conducted by intention to treat. These will be summarised using means (95% confidence intervals [CI]), standard deviations, quartiles and range. Protocol analyses will be carried out for necessary variables from each follow-up. 

Confirmatory analyses
Inferential analyses 

Efficacy analyses  to identify any positive effect of NeuroAid on individuals with TBI using the primary and secondary outcomes. 

Primary analyses  the primary outcome CNS- Vital Signs neurocognition index. 

Secondary analyses  total scores and sub-scale scores of cognitive ability, post-concussion symptoms, mood, fatigue, quality of life and frequency of adverse events. Rates of adverse events will be determined to enable comparison between the proportion of patients with at least one adverse event in the NeuroAid group in comparison to the placebo group.

All data analysis will be carried out with adjustments made to account for multiple comparisons using a normality-based approach. Repeated measures analyses will be analysed using mixed linear regression models adjusting for baseline and potential covariates including but not limited to age, gender, severity of injury. The participant will be used to represent the random effect. Model selection will be undertaken with each outcome using standard selection heuristics. Covariates will be selected based on improving the overall efficiency of the model. Regardless, baseline and age, gender, severity of injury will be included in the model. Selecting covariates for inclusion in these models may be done by:
-	Pooling the SD observed for the outcome in each arm (NeuroAid and placebo) to create an F-value. If the mean difference for an outcome between each arm exceeds this F-value then it should be included as a covariate in the model.
-	If a significant difference is observed for an outcome between the two arms of the trial

Potential confounders, due to an imbalance between the two trial arms will also need to be adjusted for. 

In the event that blatant non-normality is observed (from assessment of residuals) or an association with any other predictor is observed then alternate analyses such as GEE (generalised estimating equation) and exponential family distributions will be considered. 

Covariates such as age, gender and severity of injury will also be examined in relation to the pattern of response of treatment

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many people who have had a traumatic brain injury experience cognitive and functional difficulties that can have a significant impact on their ability to return to everyday life (such as returning to employment and maintaining social relationship). NeuroAid is a herbal supplement that has been shown to improve neurological deficits in people who have experienced a stroke. This pilot clinical trial will examine if NeuroAid shows trends in cognitive and functional improvement in 140 people who have experienced a mild or moderate traumatic brain injury in the last 1 to 3 months as compared to a placebo control group (inactive capsule). Participants will be given either NeuroAid II or placebo to take 3x daily for 6 months. Participants will be asked to complete a computerised cognitive test and questionnaires about their symptoms, mood and quality of life. These assessments will be carried out before, during and after participants have taken their treatment so that we can compare the results between the two groups. </summary>
