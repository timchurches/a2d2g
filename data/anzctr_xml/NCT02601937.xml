  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study with a BID oral dose
      of tazemetostat. Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 14 days of the planned
      first dose of tazemetostat. A treatment cycle will be 28 days. Response assessment will be
      evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment and subsequently every 8 weeks while on study.

      The study has two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.

      Dose escalation for subjects with the following relapsed/refractory malignancies:

        -  Rhabdoid tumors:

        -  Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT)

        -  Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT)

        -  Rhabdoid tumor of kidney (RTK)

        -  Selected tumors with rhabdoid features

        -  INI1-negative tumors:

        -  Epithelioid sarcoma

        -  Epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor

        -  Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma

        -  Myoepithelial carcinoma

        -  Renal medullary carcinoma

        -  Other INI1-negative malignant tumors (e.g., dedifferentiated chordoma) (with Sponsor
           approval)

        -  Synovial Sarcoma with a SS18-SSX rearrangement

      Dose Expansion at the MTD or the RP2D

        -  Cohort 1 - ATRT

        -  Cohort 2 - MRT/RTK/selected tumors with rhabdoid features

        -  Cohort 3 - INI-negative tumors:

             -  Epithelioid sarcoma

             -  Epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor

             -  Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma

             -  Myoepithelial carcinoma

             -  Renal medullary carcinoma

             -  Chordoma (poorly differentiated or de-differentiated)

             -  Other INI1-negative malignant tumors (e.g., dedifferentiated chordoma) with Sponsor
                approval

        -  Cohort 4 - Tumor types eligible for Cohorts 1 through 3 or synovial sarcoma with
           SS18-SSX rearrangement</summary>
