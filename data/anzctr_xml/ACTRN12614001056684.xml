  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ketogenic diet (&lt;30g carbohydrate per day) starting one week prior to standard treatment and continuing until all planned treatment has been completed. Patients will attend a 1 hour session with a dietitian at baseline to go through the dietary guidelines. 

Standard treatment consists of 60 Gy radiation in 30 fractions over 6 weeks with concurrent daily oral temozolomide 75 mg/m2 (for no longer than 49 days); four weeks after completion of radiation patients will start six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, taken orally daily days 1-5 of the 28-day cycle; the daily dose is 150 mg/m2 in the first adjuvant cycle then, if well-tolerated haematologically, 200 mg/m2 for remaining cycles, as tolerated. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary objective of the study is to determine progression-free survival at 8 months from comencement of chemoradiation. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted.
If the true progression-free survival rate at 8 months is 75% then a sample size of 20 will give a 95% confidence interval of 53.689.8%, which does not overlap the observed progression-free survival of 45% at 8 months in a previous randomised trial. A result falling within this 95% CI would be of sufficient interest to warrant a larger randomised trial.
The remaining analyses will primarily use descriptive statistics as they are non-comparative. For repeated assessments over time (such as patient-reported outcomes) repeated measures ANOVA will be employed. A p value &lt; 0.05 (two-sided) is considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the most aggressive form of primary brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), offers only modest disease control, with half of all patients having disease progression before finishing their 8 month treatment programme, and about 3/4 dying within 2 years. Strategies to improve survival have largely been ineffective.
These tumours are almost completely reliant on glucose for fuel, and laboratory studies have reported that radiation treatment for GBM is much more effective when mice are fed a diet extremely low in carbohydrates. Such a diet is called Ketogenic, because the body generates ketones (the smell is like green apples) as an alternative fuel source for the brain and other organs. Such diets have been used for decades to help control seizures in children with epilepsy. There are case reports in the literature of patients with GBM who use these diets while on chemotherapy and radiation without apparent ill effects, and their outcomes appear encouraging. 
However a more careful analysis of patients trying these diets is important to know how well most patients tolerate such a diet, whether it is safe during treatment, whether they enjoy their food and maintain a good nutritional status and whether there appears to be an improved outcome compared to patients treated while having their usual diet. We plan to conduct a pilot study in 20 patients having chemotherapy and radiotherapy for GBM to answer these questions.
