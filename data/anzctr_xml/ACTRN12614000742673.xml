  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will utilise a within subject (cross-over) design and each 3 day intervention period will be separated by a minimum one week washout period. Each participant will undertake four separate experimental trials: (1) a series of low glycemic index (GI) meals (2) a series of high glycemic meals (3) low intensity intermittent training (LIT) and (4) high intensity interval training (HIT). A description of the dietary and exercise interventions are provided below. 

Continuous glucose monitor: The glucose sensor (Medtronic EnliteTM) will be inserted on the side of the torso under the skin 24 h prior to each experimental trial. The device will remain in situ for 72 hours and is water proof and does not prevent bathing or swimming activities. This will be repeated for each of the four experimental trials. Insertion of the microdialysis fibre into the superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue does not require anaesthetic, is minimally invasive and barely discernible. The glucose sensor measures interstitial glucose concentration and is connected to the digital recorder (Medtronic iProTM2). They are both secured to the skin surface by medical adhesive dressing (3MTM Tegaderm) and require no further intervention until removed. 

Dietary Intervention: All meals and snacks will be provided during each 12 h experimental trial.  The low and high GI diets  will be matched for carbohydrate (60%), protein (10-15%) and fat (25-30%) content but will differ in the glycemic index. The glycemic index of breakfast, lunch and dinner of the low and high GI diet will differ by ~40, 40 and 10 U, respectively. Breakfast, lunch and dinner will each be separated by 5 h and consumed at ~0730, 1230 and 1730 h during each experimental trial. 

Exercise Intervention: All meals and snacks from the high GI diet trial will be provided during each exercise trial. The two exercise sessions will be performed on separate occasions and will be matched for total mechanical work but will differ in the exercise intensity and duration. The LIT protocol will involve 3 x 15 minute bouts of cycling performed at 40% peak power output (PPO). One 15 minute bout of exercise will be undertaken prior to each meal (5 h recovery period between exercise bouts). The HIT protocol will involve a 5 minute warm up and 12 Ã— 60 s repetitions of cycling at 80% PPO, each interspersed with 60 s active recovery at 40% PPO. The single HIT session will be undertaken before the first meal (breakfast) during the experimental trial. All exercise will be performed on a stationary indoor cycle ergometer. Heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be measured during exercise. 

Blood samples will be taken at rest prior to commencing the experimental trial, and at regular intervals throughout the day. Blood will be extracted via a catheter placed into a forearm vein. </interventions>
    <comparator>This study will utilise a within subject (cross-over) design and compare glucose modulation and measurement precision with various diet and exercise modalities. In addition, a free-living period where the continuous glucose monitor will be implanted 24 h prior to each experimental trial will also be used as a comparator. The participants glucose profile, habitual diet and physical activity will be monitored.   

There is no control group; each participant will act as their own control.  </comparator>

      <outcome>Accuracy of continuous glucose monitor (CGM). 

Glucose values recorded by the CGM will be compared to reference values (venous blood sample) during  modulation of glucose excursion in response to dietary intake and exercise throughout a 24 h period. Associations between techniques will be determined using intraclass correlations coefficient (ICC) and differences between techniques will be determined by Bland Altman Plots. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The CGM will record 288 glucose values in 24 h for each experimental trial. A total of 22 samples of venous blood will be collected at baseline (prior to exercise), 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 150, 210 and 270 minutes after meals 1 and 2 (breakfast and lunch) and 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and  90 minutes after meal 3 (dinner). </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be completed using SPSS v21.0. Data will be analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc testing. The primary outcome measures in the current study are changes in glucose concentration. Based on data reported in similar studies (Figueira et al., 2013; Van Dijk et al., 2013; Oberlin et al., 2014) in order to detect the smallest clinically relevant differences for the change in glucose concentration and area under the curve (effect size 0.8, P&lt;0.05) a sample size of n=8-10 is required. To ensure the proposed study is sufficiently powered we will recruit 16 participants. This sample size exceeds the minimum sample requirements based on the power analysis and are similar to Little et al. (2011) who undertook a comparable study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to establish the validity and precision of continuous glucose monitors (CGM's) for determining glycemia in response to diet and exercise. CGM's are a new, minimally invasive technology that provide greater insight into the direction, magnitude and frequency of daily glucose fluctuations. Postprandial glycemia is a significant determinant of glycemic control in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. Given the prevalence of diabetes, it is important to identify effective lifestyle interventions to treat and manage pre-diabetes, and quantify the capacity to monitor daily variations in glucose control. We hypothesise that CGM precision will be reduced during high glucose excursions and strenuous exercise, and that high intensity exercise will be superior for promoting the return of glycemia to basal levels.</summary>
