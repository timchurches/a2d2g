  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be four interventions (1) Classes-As-Usual which will be our control group where teenagers will go to their regular classes that do not involve information on sleep; (2) Sleep Education Class plus Parental Involvement (SEC + P) will include Sleep Education Classes (SEC) which is a replication of that described in Cain, Gradisar, Moseley (2011) Sleep Med, 12, 246-251, plus Parent Sleep Education. This is a 4 x 50-min program, 1 class per week over 4 weeks, teaching teenagers the importance of sleep and that regularising their sleep patterns can help to achieve better sleep, but also provide parents with 4 short videos (5-min) describing what their teenage children have learned in class and how they can support them change their behaviours. Parent videos are provided once weekly after their teen's class; (3) Sleep Education Class plus Light Therapy (SEC + L) will be the same as (SEC) but also provide the teenagers with light glasses (Re-Timers) to assist them in regularising their sleep patterns. Teens will use the green light glasses (495nm, 65 IW/cm2) for 1 hour per day in the 3rd week of the education program; (4) Sleep Education Class plus Parental Involvement plus Light Therapy will involve Sleep Education Classes, Parent Sleep Education, and use of the Light Glasses. Compliance with wearing the light glasses will be recorded on the adolescents' sleep diary for that week. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep pattern regularisation (i.e., bedtime and wake times are more consistent across the 7-day week). This will be assessed using a retrospective questionnaire for the past week's sleep developed specifically for these type of studies by the researchers, and previously reported in published trials (see Moseley &amp; Gradisar, Sleep, 2009, v32, and Cain, Gradisar &amp; Moseley, Sleep Med, 2011, v12.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sleep education classes for high school students. As teenagers typically have a sleep pattern where they fall asleep late and wake up late, and which conflicts with getting up for school, this study will test 3 versions of sleep education classes against a control group (normal classes). These are: sleep education classes plus parent sleep education (SEC + P), sleep education classes plus light therapy (SEC + L) and sleep education classes plus parent sleep education plus light therapy (SEC + P + L). We expect that compared to the control classes that improvements in sleep and mood will occur in all 3 versions of the sleep education classes. We expect that the SEC + P + L will show the greatest improvements.</summary>
