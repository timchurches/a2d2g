  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients allocated to Early Supported Discharge and family rehabilitation will have their family nominated caregiver trained by a specially trained stroke trial care coordinator health professional (i.e. nurse, therapist) using a designed structured assessment (cognition, language, function and mobility) and recommended rehabilitation package.  The package will include a structured check-list and culturally appropriate manual covering the key activities relevant to daily living (e.g. positioning, transfers, mobilisation, feeding, dressing, activity and motor practice, and monitoring of mood etc).  Training will begin in hospital and is envisaged to take ~60 mins per day for up to 3 days, with the intention of accelerating the patients hospital discharge when it is safe to do so.  The stroke trial care coordinator will visit (or arrange for other community workers to visit) the patient and caregivers, allocated Early Supported Discharge, up to 6 occasions to monitor progress post-discharge and will be available by telephone for support and guidance as the patient progresses over the next 3 months. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control patients will receive usual care. In general this usually consists of investigation and initial stabilisation of the patient, multidisciplinary assessment, a team meeting and formulation of a multidisciplinary plan, with an early discharge home and an offer of out-patient rehabilitation. Few (10%) patients are able to return to the out-patient rehabilitation service due to family commitments, and so some families pay for private physiotherapy in the home. It is likely that most patients in the control group will not have routine access to post-discharge stroke services.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Project is to evaluate an affordable post-stroke rehabilitation program in a large randomised controlled trial (RCT), that, if shown to be effective, could be rolled out throughout India.

Our study design is a multicentre, randomised, blinded outcome assessor, controlled trial of Early Supported Discharge (ESD) with a trained family-led caregiver-delivered, home-based stroke rehabilitation compared to usual care in at least 1200 patients with mild-moderate disability recruited from about 12 sites in India. 

Eligible patients will be adults (=18 years), with recent  (&lt;1 month) acute stroke, who have residual disability, are expected to survive to discharge from hospital with at least 6 month survival and are able (or by proxy) to provide informed consent.

Randomisation:  Eligible patients will be randomised within 7 days of hospital admission.
Intervention arm:  Patients allocated to ESD and family rehabilitation will have their family nominated caregiver trained by a specially trained stroke trial care coordinator health professional (i.e. nurse, therapist) using a designed structured assessment (cognition, language, function and mobility) and recommended rehabilitation package.  The package will include a structured check-list and culturally appropriate manual covering the key activities relevant to daily living (e.g. positioning, transfers, mobilisation, feeding, dressing, activity and motor practice, etc).  Training will begin in hospital and is envisaged to take ~60 mins per day for 3 days, with the intention of accelerating the patients hospital discharge when it is safe to do so.  The stroke trial care coordinator will visit (or arrange for other community workers to visit) the patient and caregivers up to 6 occasions to monitor progress post-discharge and will be available by telephone for support and guidance as the patient progresses over the next 3 months.
The primary outcome measure will be independent survival measured at 6 months after randomisation.
