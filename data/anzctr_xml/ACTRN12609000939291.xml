  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>En bloc resection (ie. in a single piece) is the goal for removing large sessile colonic polyps. Currently this is limited to 20mm in size with the standard submucosal injection solution (ie. normal saline). Succinylated Gelatin is a colloid, that has been proven to be safe and superior to normal saline for EMR in a porcine model. With Human Research approval, this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of succinylated gelatin for sessile colonic polyps sized 20mm or greated.</summary>
