  <interventions>
    <interventions>Gastric emptying and small intestinal transit will be measured using scintigraphy, which is the gold-standard for the measurement of gastric emptying, total, proximal and distal gastric volume and mouth-to-caecum transit.  Subjects undergo a single test of 6 hours duration. Subjects will be asked to ingest a test drink comprising of 540 ml of Ensure (1 kcal/ml; 15% protein, 60% carbohydrate, 25 % fat) labelled with 20 MBq 99mTc-sulphur colloid.  Gastric emptying will be measured by obtaining 1-minute anterior and 1-minute posterior images, with the subject standing, at regular time points during 5 hrs.  Regions-of-interest will be drawn around the total stomach and gastric emptying curves (expressed as % retention over time) will be derived for the total stomach.  To evaluate intragastric meal distribution, the total stomach region of interest will be divided into proximal and distal regions, with the proximal region corresponding to the fundus and proximal corpus and the distal region corresponding to the distal corpus and antrum.  The mouth-to-caecum transit will be evaluated as the time from ingestion of the meal to the arrival of the head of the meal at the caecum. At the end of the study, subjects will be provided with a cold buffet styled lunch to consume freeely for upto 30 min.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intragastric meal distribution (ie the total stomach region and proximal and distal stomach regions). The mouth-to-caecum transit will be evaluated as the time from ingestion of the meal to the arrival of the head of the meal at the caecum. This was measured using scintigraphy</outcome>
      <timepoint>t = -15 min (baseline) and t = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270 and 300 min</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hormone release - Cholecystokinin (CCK) and Peptide YY (PYY). Blood samples were drawn from subjects every 15 minutes until t=90, and then every 30 min from t = 90 - 300 min and then once more at t=330 after the buffet lunch. Radioimmunoassays were used to determine the concentration of these hormones in plasma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>t = -15 min (baseline) and t = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330 min after consumption of drink'</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite and hunger - Using visual analogue scale questionnaires</outcome>
      <timepoint>t = -15 min (baseline) and t = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330 min after consumption of drink'</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake - At t = 300 min a cold buffet-style meal (t = 300 - 330 min). The meal will be weighted before and after consumption to for the assessment of energy intake using Foodwork</outcome>
      <timepoint>t = 300 min</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects will all be males between age 18 -56 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 - 25 kg/m2 for lean, 25 - 30 kg/m2 for over-weight and between 30 -35 kg/m2 for obese. Lean subjects will be required to be unrestrained eaters.
