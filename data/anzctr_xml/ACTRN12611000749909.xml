  <interventions>
    <interventions>Investigational arm: insertion of endorectal balloon during image guided radiotherapy.  An endorectal balloon is inserted into the rectum prior to the radiation treatment to the prostate each day and inflated with 100mls of air and removed at the end of treatment each day.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control arm: image guided radiotherapy alone.  This treatment is the standard treatment offered for prostate cancer control and does not include insertion of the endorectal balloon each day.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Image guided radiotherapy treatment with endorectal balloon results in less treatment related morbidity and impairment of quality of life compared with image guided radiotherapy alone.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Less treatment related morbidity and impairment of QOL- Lent Soma and QLQC30 and QLQ-PR25:  Baseline, End of Treatment, 6 week, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 1 year, 18 month, 2 year, 30 month and 3 year.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Using the endorectal balloon results in better radiation dose distributions to the rectal and anal walls.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Dose volume histograms: End of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quantify and compare radiation-induced changes in anorectal function using anorectal manometry to compare parameters of anorectal function and radiation dose distribution in the rectal and anal walls with and without the use of the endorectal balloon.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Anorectal Manometry: baseline, 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 year and 3 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Monitor treatment efficacy based on clinical, radiological and serum PSA evaluation at pre-determined intervals after completion of therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serum PSA: Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 18 months, 2 years, 30 months, 3 years.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be introduced to the trial at their initial clinic visit with the radiation oncologist.  They will be reseen at the CT Simulator planning appointment so any questions will be answered and then they can sign the consent form if they wish.  The patient will be enrolled using a eligibility questionnaire to check that they fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  

Allocation is not concealed although a person not involved in the trial will be allocating patients to either group of the trial to prevent bias.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be allocated an arm of the trial via a spreadsheet using permuted blocks by someone not involved in the trial management or administration of trial procedures.

random block allocation downloaded from http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize2.cfm  this has then been saved into an excel spreadsheet.</sequence>
