  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were
      destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal tissues.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of cyclosporine plus
      methotrexate with cyclosporine plus T cell depletion for prevention of graft-versus-host
      disease during peripheral stem cell transplantation in patients who have advanced leukemia or
      lymphoma who are eligible for transplanted peripheral stem cells from a donor.</summary>
