  <interventions>
    <interventions>Non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation will be delivered in a protocol called theta burst stimulation.  This protocol involves a 2 second train of low intensity stimuli, repeated every 10 seconds for 192 seconds (600 stimuli in total).  This protocol will be delivered prior to an upper limb physiotherapy session, 5 days per week for 2 weeks.  Each physiotherapy session will be one-on-one with a registered physiotherapist, last approximately 45 minutes, and will be tailored to the individual's needs and goals.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham theta burst stimulation of ipsilesional primary motor cortex prior to each therapy session.  A special 'sham' stimulation coil is used, which makes the same sound but does not produce any magnetic stimulation.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be enrolled by the lead investigator, and their details passed to an associate investigator who will be responsible for randomising them using a minimisation procedure described below.  The associate investigator will be responsible for delivering the theta burst stimulation (TBS) intervention, and is the only person who will know which intervention (treatment or control) they are delivering.  Participants and all other investigators will remain blinded to allocation, and allocation is concealed from all other investigators.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised using custom software to minimise differences between the treatment and control groups in age, time since stroke, and corticospinal tract integrity.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a leading cause of disability among adults worldwide.  Many people who experience stroke have ongoing weakness and clumsiness in one hand and arm.  In this study, people at the chronic stage of stroke will have a two week burst of physiotherapy for their hand and arm.  A non-invasive magnetic stimulation technique will be used before each session to prime the brain for a better response to therapy.  Participants will be randomly assigned to have either this priming technique, or a placebo version.  Participants in both groups are expected to benefit from the two week burst of physiotherapy.  This study will find out whether the priming technique will produce any additional benefit.  The development of short and effective primed therapy protocols may lead to further functional recovery in people with stroke.</summary>
