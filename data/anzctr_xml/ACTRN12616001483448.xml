  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study participants will be randomly allocated to these treatment arms for 6 weeks
1) 2 X placebo tablets (matching for curcumin) + 2 X placebo capsules (matching for fish oil) per day 
2) 2 X 500 mg curcumin tablets + 2 X placebo capsules (matching for fish oil) per day 
3) 2 X 1000 mg fish oil capsules + 2 X placebo tablets (matching for curcumin) per day 
4) 2 X 500 mg curcumin tablets + 2 X 1000 mg fish oil capsules per day
To monitor adherence to intervention, 
1. Capsule intake by participants will be measured on post-intervention visit 
2. Compliance to the omega 3 fatty acids will be monitored by measuring participant's erythrocyte fatty acid content 
3. Adherence to curcumin will be monitored by measuring curcumin content in the participant blood sample by using HPLC method. </interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the general public through media advertising and from GP practices. Advertisements will be placed on noticeboards at the University of Newcastle and pharmacies and distributed via departmental email lists. Participants will also be recruited from the Hunter Medical Research Institute (HMRI) Volunteer Register. Participants will complete a medical questionnaire  to ensure that inclusion criteria are met. Randomization of participants to one of the intervention will be performed by one of the researchers in the research group. Allocation is not concealed</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size determination 
Based on the data of the triglyceride levels of people with type 2 diabetes from previous studies, with the mean deviation of 0.5 units in triglycerides, a sample size of seventeen participants in each treatment group will give 80% power to detect a 0.5 units drop in triglycerides at type 1 error (alpha)= 0.05. To allow for dropouts we will recruit 4x20 = 80 participants according to the inclusion criteria.
Treatment effects
Data obtained from all participants will be analyzed according to the intention to treat theory. Normality of baseline data will be examined using histograms with a normal distribution curve overlayed and Shapiro Wilks test. Based on the distribution of data, the outcome measures will be analyzed using ANOVA (normal distribution) or Wilcoxon signed rank test (non-parametric data). Two-way ANOVA with post hoc comparisons will be used to determine the effect of the intervention on different variables and also to determine synergistic or complementary effects of two interventions (curcumin and LCn-3PUFA). ANCOVA will be used to assess the effects of confounding factors on treatment that include age, gender, BMI physical activity levels and dietary intake. Significance will be set at P-value &lt;0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed using GraphPad Prism version 6 and IBM SPSS 22 software.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its associated complications represents a major global health hazard. According to the Diabetes Australia, the number of individuals with T2D reached 1.7 million with 1.2 million diagnosed and registered cases. Individuals with T2D are associated with two-four fold increased the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. CVD accounts for more than 70% of deaths in patients with T2D. Epidemiological studies documented T2D as an independent risk factor for CVD in both men and women. Despite effective glucose control measures and advances in the management of CVD in T2D, several other chronic risk factors like high blood pressure, abnormal triglycerides, small dense LDL particles, low HDL-C and insulin resistance increase the risk of developing CVD in individuals with type 2 diabetes.  T2D related changes in the plasma lipid levels are key factors among the other factors that are manageable by interventions to control the CVD risk. It is well documented that combination of high plasma triglyceride levels and low HDL-C (HDL-C2) is well associated with cardiovascular risk. The previous meta-analysis has reported that every 1mmol/L increase in triglyceride increase cardiovascular disease risk by 32% in men and 76% increase in women. Along with the triglycerides, the glycosylation and oxidation of LDL particles differ in type 2 diabetes when compared with non-diabetic individuals. Several randomized controlled trials have supported the association of the reduction of LDL-C (up to 1mmol/L) with reduced cardiovascular disease. Targeting blood lipids and inflammation in type 2 diabetes individuals who are at a high risk of developing CVD will help to resolute these modifiable risk factors and presumably reduce the overall risk of developing CVD. In the present study,  we propose to evaluate the complementary and/or synergistic effects of curcumin and n-3PUFA in modulating lipid profiles (decrease in triglycerides and small dense LDL-C particles) in individuals with type 2 diabetes through a 6 weeks factorial randomised controlled trial . We also evaluate the effects of curcumin and LCn-3PUFA on secondary outcomes such as inflammation, blood glucose, and blood pressure.
