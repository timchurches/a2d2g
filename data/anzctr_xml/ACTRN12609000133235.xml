  <interventions>
    <interventions>The psychosocial program "MAPS: A guide to managing bipolar disorder" comprises 10 weekly sessions (+ one booster session held one month after the conclusion of the weekly sessions).  The program aims to provide information and develop coping strategies to enable participants to effectively manage bipolar disorder.  The acronym "MAPS" refers to the coping strategies taught throughout the program (monitoring, assessing, preventing relapse, SMART goal setting).  The program will be conducted by trained mental health professionals in public and private community settings eg. primary care, private practice, day programs.  The duration of each session is 1 hour for individuals or 2 hours for groups.</interventions>
    <comparator>The intervention in this study will be compared to the intervention and control arm of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that has already been completed.  
In the RCT, the treatment group received the psychosocial program "MAPS: A guide to managing bipolar disorder" in addition to treatment as usual.  The program was delivered in a group format over 12 weekly sessions (+ 3 booster sessions) of 1 1/2 hours duration.  (The format of the program has been revised to be consistent with the Better Access to Mental Health Care medicare items).  The control group received treatment as usual which consisted of care from a psychiatrist or GP and medication if prescribed.   
This RCT is not registered on a publically available Register.</comparator>
