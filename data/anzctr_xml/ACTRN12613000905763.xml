  <interventions>
    <interventions>  The study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with medication for 7 days followed by observation for 7 days also.
There were two groups in the study. The subjects of Treatment group will take Shen Mi Tang (400mg), 5 capsules three times a day(6g per day) per oral  for a 7 days course of treatment. 
Components of Shen Mi Tang 
Ephedrae Herba   6g
Armeniacae Semen  4.8g
Magnoliae Cortex  3.6g
Auranti Nobilis Pericarpium   3g 
Glycyrrhizae Radix   2.4g
Bupleuri Radix  2.4g
Perilla Herba 1.8g
These raw herbs were refined   to 4g  extract  and  mixed with 2g starch  to 6g powder by Sheng Chang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
  dextromethorphan 15mg/TAB per oral one to three times a day  will be given as rescue drug when cough is intolerable 
  To get cough symptom score , a  phone call at day 3,5 of treatment was given to the patients by study coordinator. a card was also given to patient to record their daily drug taking and Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) of cough.
  The Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) will be adopted for measuring the severity of patient reported cough.The patient will be asked to mark the severity of his/her cough condition on a visual analogous scale of  0 to 100 mm at the time points (Day 1,3,5,8,15).

    <concealment>Promotional posters about the study, referral criteria and contact number of primary investigator and study coordinator were pasted on bulletin board outside clinic rooms of investigators, including two internal medical physician of traditional Chinese medicine, one chest specialist and one ENT specialist.
Patients with cough as chief complaint will be candidates and be diagnosed on the basis of detailed history and clinical examination and be referred to study coordinator by investigator if they match inclusion criteria. Trained study coordinator is responsible for enrolment of patients, study explanation, data collection. These patients will be enrolled if they fulfill the studyâ€™s eligibility criteria. The enrolled patients will be administered with study drug by the investigator and be given patient daily diary by study coordinator. Patients not fulfilling the criteria will accept other treatment administered by investigator.
Allocation concealment procedure was performed by Sheng Chang Pharmaceutical Co. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Random allocation was made in blocks to keep the sizes of treatment groups similar. It was performed by Sheng Chang Pharmaceutical Co. which was entrusted with production of study drugs.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size determination
According to reports of Shen Mi Tang s clinical trials and our clinical observation, the response rate (p1) is about 0.6. We also suppose the placebo effect (p2) is 0.1.
Using test for Superiority, a two sided test, 5% significance level test (alpha=0.05) with power 80% power (beta =0.2), p1=0.6, p2=0.1, drop-out rate = 0.05. 
Number obtained is 16 for each group under calculation by formula.
  All analysis will be done on intention to treat basis. 
  Efficacy endpoints will be listed and summarized as appropriate: mean/median,standard deviation, minimum, maximum and total numbers for normally distributed data; median and range for non-normally distributed data; frequencies, total numbers and percentages for categorical data.
       The baseline demographic characteristics in both treatment and control groups will be compared using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t-test or Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test for continuous variables.
      The percentage of patients with "Significant Improvement" and "Improvement" in daytime Cough Symptom Score will be tested using Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test. Logistic regression will be adopted to test the efficacy endpoint, if significant difference is observed in demographic variables.
      Paired t-test will be used to evaluate the change from baseline in VAS score within each treatment group and un-paired t-test will be used to compare the change from baseline in VAS score between the two treatment groups. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used instead if the normal assumption is violated. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) may be used to account for any potential covariate such as baseline and demographic variables when comparing the difference in efficacy endpoints between the treatment group and the control group.
      All efficacy tests will be conducted at an alpha level of 0.05 (2-tailed) and 95% confidence interval will be reported.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cough is one of the most common causes for medical consultation. Post infectious cough is one of main causes of Subacute cough. The effectiveness of Over the counter(OTC) drugs for cough are controversial.  OTC drugs leading to sedation and other side effects also. 
 The Shen Mi Tang is commercially available herbal concentrates preparation, the indications for asthma, bronchitis. We found its good effects in the treatment of persistent dry cough post colds. So, it deserves evaluation by clinical trial.
    The clinical trial will be undertaken at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, 32 Subacute cough patients will be enrolled, 16 patients in Control group and 16 patients in Treatment group. The study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with medication for 7 days followed by observation for 7 days also.The focus of the study is on the evaluation of efficacy of this formula for Subacute cough by Cough Symptom Score(CSS) and Visual Analogous Scale(VAS) and the safety of this formula will also be evaluated.
