  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is in two parts and will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      escalating single intravenous (IV) doses of ocrelizumab compared with placebo in combination
      with methotrexate in participants with moderate to severe RA. Part 1 is the dose-escalation
      study, at one of the following dose levels of ocrelizumab [400, 1000, 1500, and 2000
      milligrams (mg)]. In Part 2, participants will be randomized to explore tolerability and
      efficacy of doses which have been shown to be tolerated in Part 1.</summary>
