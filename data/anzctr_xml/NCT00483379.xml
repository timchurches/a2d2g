  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants' Efficacy Response During the Treatment Period as Compared to Baseline for Participants With Respiratory Decline on Standard Treatment - Participants were enrolled based on clinical decline or sub-optimal clinical response in cardiac, respiratory and/or motor function parameters pre-study while on standard treatment. Each participant was evaluated at Week 52 for change from baseline in the criteria that declined; respiratory decline as measured by change in ventilator use is summarized in this outcome. Ventilator use might have improved (less use of ventilator support), had no change, or worsened (more use of ventilator support). Each participant served as his or her own control.</outcome>

      <outcome>Participants' Efficacy Response During the Treatment Period as Compared to Baseline for Participants With Motor Function Decline on Standard Treatment - Participants were enrolled based on clinical decline or sub-optimal clinical response in cardiac, respiratory and/or motor function parameters pre-study while on standard treatment. Each participant was evaluated at Week 52 for change from baseline in the criteria that declined; motor function decline primarily based on Gross Motor Function Measure 66 and Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory results is summarized. Participants could gain motor function (improve), had no change (declined stopped), or continued loss (worsened). Each participant served as his or her own control.</outcome>

      <outcome>Baseline Values for Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) Z-Scores - Z-Scores indicate the number of standard deviations (SD) from the mean in a normal distribution. Negative values indicate a smaller than mean LVM and values higher than 0 indicate a larger LVM than the mean. The normal range is -2 to 2 and greater than 2 may indicate left ventricular hypertrophy. The Z-scores for all parameters are calculated with reference to the normative data from the Children's Hospital, Boston, MA (Colan, 1992, J Am Coll Cardiol) based on the reference population with matched body surface area (BSA). Z-scores for LVM were provided by the central cardiologist.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) Z-Score at Week 52 - Z-Scores indicate the number of standard deviations (SD) from the mean in a normal distribution. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease and positive change from baseline an increase in LVM Z-score. The normal range is -2 to 2 and greater than 2 may indicate left ventricular hypertrophy. The Z-scores for all parameters are calculated with reference to the normative data from the Children's Hospital, Boston, MA (Colan, 1992, J Am Coll Cardiol) based on the reference population with matched body surface area (BSA).

      <outcome>Baseline Values in Mobility as Measured by the Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) - The Pompe PEDI is a disease specific version of the PEDI that was developed to assess functional capabilities and performance in children with Pompe disease from 2 months through adolescence. Baseline results for the mobility domain are reported. Scaled scores are used as an evaluative measure of change in performance over time with acquisition of new skills or new levels of independence. The range of scores is from 0-100 with scores near "0" reflecting low capability and scores near "100" reflecting high capability.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a
      critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the
      body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures
      called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates
      and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their
      normal function. The objective of this exploratory study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of alternative dosing regimens of alglucosidase alfa in patients with Pompe disease
      who have not demonstrated an optimal response to the standard dosing regimen of 20 mg/kg
      every other week after a minimum of 6 months treatment immediately prior to study entry.</summary>
