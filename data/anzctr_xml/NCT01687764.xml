Experimental: CBGT+ABMT(active) - 

Experimental: CBGT+ABMT(placebo) - 

Experimental: PCI+ABMT(active) - 

Placebo Comparator: PCI+ABMT(placebo) - 


Other interventions: Attentional Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) - Active
The ABMT consists of 160 trials (120 angry-neutral and 40 neutral-neutral presentations). In the ABM condition, the target appears at the neutral-face location in all angry-neutral trials. Probe type (&lt; or &gt;) is not factorially counterbalanced but appears with equal probability for each of the following: angry-face location, probe location, or actor.

Other interventions: Attentional Bias Modification Treatment - Placebo
The Placebo protocol consists of 160 trials (120 angry-neutral and 40 neutral-neutral presentations). In the placebo condition, angry-face location, probe location, and actor are fully counterbalanced in presentation.

Behaviour: Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy
"FRIENDS for Life" Australian protocol for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children

Behaviour: Psychoeducational Control Intervention
Psychoeducational control intervention provides only brief psychoeducational information about anxiety associated with general educational activities
