  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Younger subjects with type 1 diabetes are being encouraged to undertake exercise, with no limitation on type/intensity of exercise (providing that there are no complications of diabetes present, e.g. cardiovascular disease), however, there is very little scientific information on the response of those with type 1 diabetes to intense exercise, and almost no studies on the response of these patients to high intensity exercise training. This study aimed to compare the metabolic (e.g. blood and muscle lactate, blood glucose) and ionic responses (e.g. muscle sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase, blood potassium, blood acidosis) during high intensity exercise, as reflected in samples of blood, muscle, and expired gas analysis, in younger people with and without type 1 diabetes; and secondly to evaluate the responses of both groups to high intensity exercise training.  We hypothesised that acute exercise responses would be similar in the subjects with and without type 1 diabetes; and that high intensity exercise training would improve metabolic and ionic responses during high intensity exercise in subjects with type 1 diabetes; and would not result in deterioration of overall metabolic control (reflected by glycosylated haemoglobin).</summary>
