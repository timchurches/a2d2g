  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multidisciplinary teams to support and up-skill facility staff using evidence-based quality improvement interventions. 

The supports and services provided will comprise an initial stock-take assessment and development of a facility plan, direct access to a geriatrician and to a geriatric or clinical nurse specialist,  multi-disciplinary team meetings to discuss individual cases, provision of targeted education to facility nurses and caregivers (topics include recognition of illness, wound care, care planning, end-stage dementia care, nutrition &amp; dehydration, effective family communication), specific coaching with high-risk residents, role modeling of clinical reasoning processes, and provision of benchmarking systems.  Facilities will receive 9 months of the intervention. 

The unit of selection, randomisation and intervention is the facility. The unit of measurement of outcomes is the residents of the participating facilities.

Recruitment and randomisation: February to June 2011. Active interventions will be completed by February 2012.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual services and supports from district health boards to those facilities providing residential aged care. 

Some training and supports are provided by the DHBs, and each of the 3 DHBs currently does things differently. Some variations of some of these interventions have been implemented in each DHB, but not as fully or systematically as this, and in a non-targeted way. GNS/CNS visit some facilities, and geriatricians are consulted only in very unusual circumstances.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of ambulatory care-sensitive hospitalisations (ASH admissions). 

Routinely-collected data in nationally-collected databases for all hospital stays will be used. A pre-determined set of ICD codes is used to classify all hospital stays as "ASH" or not. Admission will be included if both since randomisation and since entry of the resident to the facility.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Period from date of randomisation to 14 months after first visit by study staff. Hospitalisation records will be sought after 6 months of the intervention in order to get analysis code prepared, then again 5 months after the final facility completes its intervention, in order to allow for any delays in registering admissions. Paper reports from each participating facility will enable some checking against national records.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of (emergency admission) hospital days per occupied bed per year

as for Endpoint 1 above - records are held nationally for all stays.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14+ month period commencing on date of randomisation as for Endpoint 1 above</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>number of deaths from any cause, including death in acute hospital or elsewhere

Deaths are also recorded in the national database and will be included with the admissions data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14+ month period commencing on date of randomisation as for Endpoint 1 above</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of emergency department presentations per bed per year

ED visits data are also now available on our national database and will be obtained with the other data</outcome>
      <timepoint>14+ month period commencing on date of randomisation as for Endpoint 1 above</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>number of medications prescribed per bed per year

Subsidised medications are now listed on the regional databases. We will use pre-specifed groupings that we have derived and that are related to ASH admissions.</outcome>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The unit of selection, randomisation and intervention is the facility. Facilities providing residential aged care within the greater Auckland region are selected for the trial if they have higher than expected rates of hospitalisation (given number of beds, age of residents etc). 
All residents living in the participating facilities during the intervention period will be included for the purposes of measuring outcomes.</inclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At the commencement of the trial, facilities are selected based on risk modeling, and stratified by health region (DHB). After informed consent is obtained and baseline data are collected, the facilities are presented pairwise to the randomisation process, matched by type of facility and approximate number of beds.
Randomisation will be progressive, ie 4-6 facilities per month for a period of nine months.</concealment>
    <sequence>One of each pair is randomly allocated to the intervention for 9 months starting in the year 2011. The other will have usual services and supports from their DHB during 2012, and will receive the intervention starting 14 months later, ie starting 2012 (for purposes of recruitment, not for comparison). 
To achieve this, each facility is electronically ascribed a random number using a random number generator. Another random number list (3, one for each DHB stratum) shows 2011 (active) / 2012 (control) as the intervention year. The facility with the lower random number (in the pair) is allocated to the next listed intervention (ie 2010 or 2011). The facility with the higher random number is allocated the other. Random allocation will be made only by the scientific member of the investigatory team and the data manager, will be held in secure files and advised to the project manager confidentially. Data will be collected using facility IDs, not names, and the treatment coded as 1 or 2 during analyses.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The intervention is a multi-disciplinary team providing supports to facility staff, so the allocation of active facilities has to be known. The design is a cluster trial in that although the facility is the unit of intervention (n= 36), outcomes are measured with residents as the unit of measurement (n =c. 1400). Every effort is being made to not reveal (to other members of the research team or to other facilities) which are the control facilities (ie the 2011 facilities). The investigators are not advised of the identity of participating facilities. The project manager, who recruits, obtains informed consent and collects monitoring data, has been asked not to reveal the identify of facilities during or outside investigators meetings. Endpoints are collected by use of routinely collected data for hospital admissions and discharges, deaths and subsided medications, so are unaffected by the trial design.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older people in residential aged care are a vulnerable group with a high risk of emergency acute admission to hospital. We expect that many hospitalisations could be avoided by improved management or by providing treatment within the facility, with better outcomes for residents. 
This study selects facilities with high acute hospitalisation rates for a randomised controlled trial. The intervention will use multidisciplinary teams to support those facilities and up-skill staff using known quality improvement interventions, to test whether acute admissions are reduced and primary care improved.</summary>
