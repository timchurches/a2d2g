    <interventions>The aim of the Healthy Living after Cancer program is to evaluate the integration of a telephone-delivered lifestyle intervention for cancer survivors into the existing 13 11 20 information and support telephone service offered by Cancer Councils New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. Cancer survivors who take part in the program receive, free of charge, up to 12 telephone coaching calls over a period of 6 months (1 call each week for 1 month, then 1 call every fortnight for the next 2 months, then 1 call per month for the next 3 months), along with a participant workbook. Each call lasts approximately 20-30 minutes, and focuses on increasing physical activity, improving eating habits, and working towards moderate weight loss if appropriate. The calls are delivered by Cancer Council nurses / information and support consultants trained in project recruitment, intervention and evaluation protocols.</interventions>

      <timepoint>The fixed costs (i.e., expenditure required to deliver the HLaC program, including resources associated with modifying Cancer Council databases, refining referral pathways, adapting the HLaC intervention and evaluation protocols and recruiting and training nurses/consultants) will be documented. Dollar values will be attached to these resources using publicly available information such as appropriate salary rates for the time of personnel involved in the above activities and commercial prices for the production of any training materials, etc. Fixed costs will be allocated equally over all participants who consent to participate in HLaC. Variable costs (i.e., those that are proportional to the volume of service provided) will be allocated in proportion to the stage of HLaC reached by individuals. For the purposes of the economic appraisal, outcomes will be defined using a series of pre-defined benchmarks based on pre-post intervention changes to the behavioural and anthropometric variables. Regression analysis will be used to assess the relationship between completion of stages and outcomes achieved. Pre- and post-test differences will be calculated as changes in Quality of Life (SF-12) and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) SF6D (calculated from SF-12).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary (Healthy Living after Cancer implementation) outcomes will be reported descriptively. Analyses of secondary (effectiveness) outcomes will be by mixed models, which allow for repeated measures (baseline and follow-up) and will include all participants with baseline data (including those with missing data at follow-up) with adjustment for predictors of dropouts to minimise selection bias. Results from each Cancer Council will be analysed individually as well as collectively (pooled). To minimise type I errors because of testing multiple outcomes, significance will be set at p&lt;0.001 (two-tailed). Sensitivity of conclusions to missing data assumptions will be evaluated.

Service delivery is expected to provide a sample size of approximately 900 participants across the four participating Cancer Councils over the three year recruitment period. This sample provides &gt;90% power with two-tailed significance of p&lt;0.001 to detect pre-post changes of 60 minutes of physical activity per week, 0.5 serves of fruit or vegetables, 2 kg weight and clinically relevant changes in physical and mental components of quality of life (3 units each), based on assumed standard deviations of change of 300 min/week, 1.5 fruit and 2 vegetable serves, 8kg weight, and 8 units on the mental and physical component scores. These calculations allow for 30% participant attrition and adjustment for up to 10 covariates (10 observations per covariate).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the Healthy Living after Cancer program (HLaC) is to evaluate the integration of a telephone-delivered lifestyle intervention for cancer survivors into the existing Cancer Council 13 11 20 information and support telephone service offered by Cancer Councils New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have completed curative treatment for any type of localised cancer. 

Study details
All participants will receive up to 12 telephone coaching calls over a period of six months to assist them to increase physical activity, improve their eating habits, and work towards moderate weight loss if appropriate. The calls will be delivered by Cancer Council nurses / information and support consultants trained in program recruitment, intervention and evaluation protocols. 

Pre- and post-program evaluation will be conducted, with a focus on program implementation (i.e., number of referrals and number of program completions) as well as assessment of patient-reported outcomes (i.e., physical activity, diet, weight, and quality of life).</summary>
