  <interventions>
    <interventions>Young (18-40 yrs) healthy male subjects (n=12/group) and those born small (Birth weight=1500-2500g) will be recruited and the peak pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2 peak), a well-accepted measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, will be assessed. The body mass composition will also be assessed. Seven days later, they will report to the laboratory after an overnight fast and provide a muscle biopsy sample for biochemical and molecular analysis. Insulin sensitivity will then be measured by infusing glucose into the arm via a catheter (a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp). At the end of the clamp, a second muscle biopsy sample will be obtained for assessment of insulin signalling activation. The subjects will then undergo exercise training for 4 weeks (1 hour/day, 5 days a week) in our exercise lab. Subjects will then complete 4 weeks of exercise training that involves 60 min of exercise on a cycle ergometer per day for repeated blocks of 5 consecutive days, separated by a two days of rest. During the training the subjects will be performing cycling exercise for 1 hour for 4 days at 65% of their VO2 max. The subjects will be provided with an exercise bike to take home and they will perform the above mentioned exercise for 4 days at their home. The subjects will also be provided with a heart monitor to record their heart rate during exercise and monitor their activity levels.On the 5th day subjects will report to the laboratory, submit their heart monitors to the researchers and perform an interval training for 1 hour. At the end of the training the subjects will provide a post training VO2 peak test, leg muscle biopsies and another glucose infusion clamp will be performed to assess their response to training.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of this project are to determine:
1) If adults born small (Birth weight=1500-2500g) show normal aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in response to exercise training. 
2) If the insulin sensitivity in adults born small is normal in response to exercise training.
Method: Young (18-40 yrs) healthy male subjects (n=12/group) and those born small (Birth weight=1500-2500g) will be recruited and the peak pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2 peak), a well-accepted measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, will be assessed. Seven days later, they will report to the laboratory after an overnight fast and provide a muscle biopsy sample for biochemical and molecular analysis. Insulin sensitivity will then be measured by infusing glucose into the arm via a catheter (a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp). At the end of the clamp, a second muscle biopsy sample will be obtained for assessment of insulin signalling activation. Subjects will then complete 4 weeks of exercise training that involves 60 min of exercise on a cycle ergometer per day for repeated blocks of 5 consecutive days, separated by a two days of rest. During the training the subjects will be performing cycling exercise for 1 hour for 4 days at 65% of their VO2 max. The subjects will be provided with an exercise bike to take home and they will perform the above mentioned exercise for 4 days at their home. The subjects will also be provided with a heart monitor to record their heart rate during exercise and monitor their activity levels.On the 5th day subjects will report to the laboratory, submit their heart monitors to the researchers and perform an interval training for 1 hour. At the end of the training the subjects will provide a post training VO2 peak test, leg muscle biopsies and another glucose infusion clamp will be performed to assess their response to training.
Significance: Exercise can help normalise blood glucose levels in diabetics. However, it is not known if adults born small respond to exercise normally compared with control subjects. Further understanding of this response mechanism could lead to development of life style intervention/exercise training strategies to maximise the benefits of exercise in adults who were born small.</summary>
