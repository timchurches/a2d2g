  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial is aimed at assessing how timed blackcurrant consumption influences sugar metabolism and energy production. The trial is a parallel design consisting of three trial arms. This design was selected since the influence of blackcurrant on sugar metabolism is currently unknown; a parallel trial design will eliminate any potential problems from a cross-over design. 
In all three trial arms, participants will be asked to fast for 12 hrs the night before and eat a set breakfast (One Square Meal Bar [Cookie Time Ltd.]) 2 hrs before the start of the trial. Participants will be randomised into 3 trial arms; arm 1 will consume a 200 mL drink containing fruit sugar (equivalent to the amount in the blackcurrant extract, i.e. for 2.2 g glucose, 2.6 g fructose, 0.36 g sucrose) diluted in water and then 1 hr later a 200 ml sugar drink containing 40 g sucrose diluted in water, arm 2 will consume a 200 ml fruit sugar drink (as described above) and then 1 hr later a blackcurrant / sugar drink (containing a whole blackcurrant extract equivalent to 3.2 mg polyphenolic compounds /Kg and 40 g sucrose) diluted in water, and arm 3 will consume a 200 mL blackcurrant drink (containing a whole blackcurrant extract equivalent to 3.2 mg polyphenolic compounds /Kg) diluted in water and then 1 hr later a 200 mL sugar drink containing 40 g sucrose diluted in water.
The blackcurrant extract was commercially sourced from Sujon Berries (New Zealand) and the sugars purchased from Healtheries (New Zealand) and dinks were prepared under New Zealand food safety requirements.
The trial will take place in designated clinical facilitates within PFR and will be conducted by experience trial co-ordinators, who are also First Aider and trained phlebotomist. The trial co-ordinator will monitor the welfare of participants and ensure that they adhere to trial arm protocols.
Participants will be randomised into one of the trial three arms. In all three trial arms a small amount of blood (capillary samples) will be taken prior to the start of the trial, after the consumption fruit sugar, blackcurrant + / - sugar drinks and then 1 hr later at specific times over a 4 hr period; 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240 mins after the consumption of the sugar or blackcurrant/sugar drink. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control is trial arm 1 which involves the participant consumpting a 200 mL fruit sugar  drink (equivalent to the amount of sugar found in the blackcurrant drink) and then 1 hr later a 200 mL sugar drink, which consists of 40 g sucrose.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Prior to the onset of the trial a power analysis will be performed on prior unpublished data to determine volunteer size. Prior research in this area by PFR has shown that when examining changes in the blood glucose in response to a sugar drink containing 40 g sucrose, a sample size of 15 has a desired statistical power level of 0.8 with a probability level of 0.05. Data will be analysed using a Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.1 for Windows (version 5.1.2600). Using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), comparison between feeding (treatment) groups over time for each measure (independent variable) will also be determined, providing levels of significance for trial effect, treatment effect, and interaction effect between feeding conditions. Post-hoc tests will also be performed to identify significant differences at each time point. Values will be presented as mean +/- standard error at a 95% significance level (p=0.05). Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient's will also be assessed using SPSS 15.0 for windows to investigate if there are any relationship between certain variables by giving a R-value between 0.0 and 1.00 (or -0.0 and -1.00).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Scientific evidence suggests that berry fruit-derived polyphenolic compounds can regulate the digestion, absorption and utilisation of sugar. This presents an opportunity for the development of blackcurrant foods that regulate sugar metabolism and energy production.  We have gathered proprietary information on the composition and bioavailability of NZ blackcurrant fruits and derived products, and now turn our focus to how to explore how the timed consumption of blackcurrants influences sugar metabolism to maximise energy production. In particular pilot study, we aim to explore the interactions between blackcurrant and sugar 1 hr post-consumption on sugar metabolism and energy production. </summary>
