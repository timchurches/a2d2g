    <interventions>This community intervention trial is a prospective comparison of efficacy and safety of 3 different treatment regimens for scabies. Two of the regimens involve Mass Drug Administration (MDA) and the third is standard of care treatment of symptomatic people and their household contacts.  Each of the treatment regimens has beenrandomly assigned to the population of 1 of 3 separate island groups, by a person independent form the investigator. After 100% of the sample is reviewed at the initial study visit, study outcomes and adverse events will be assessed at 3 months (analysing 20% of sample), 12 months (entire sample, 100%), and 24 months (20% of sample), with 12 months being the primary endpoint.

Interventions:  Each one of the islands will be assigned to one of the following intervention arms. Assignment will be random, but we note that the study is not formally designed as a randomised trial. In all 3 arms, all residents will be invited to participate, and a skin examination will be undertaken at the initial study visit in those who consent to participate.
1.	Oral ivermectin based MDA: Participants will be offered 1 dose of oral ivermectin at 200 ug/kg, unless contra-indicated (as follows). Ivermectin will be replaced by topical permethrin 5% cream in the following ivermectin contra-indication groups: children under 15 kg, pregnant and breastfeeding women (as according to onchocerciasis guidelines), people with neurologic disease such as Parkinsons Disease or cerebral palsy, and people taking medication that is metabolised by the cytochrome p450 pathway. We estimate the number excluded from the ivermectin group to be approximately 20% of the population (10% being children under 15kg and 10% due to pregnancy, lactation or other contraindication); we will deal with this in our analysis by using an intention to treat approach. At 1 week, those in whom clinical scabies, itch or rash was observed at the initial visit will be offered a 2nd dose of the same treatment that they received at the initial visit.  
2.	MDA of topical permethrin 5%: Participants will be offered a dose of topical permethrin cream 5%, followed by a 2nd dose at 1 week for those in whom clinical scabies, itch or rash was observed at the initial visit.
3.	Standard of care: Those found to have scabies will be referred to the local health care worker for treatment according to the Fiji IMCI guidelines which advise a single application of permethrin 5% for those with scabies and for their families, and a 2nd dose at 2 weeks if symptoms and signs of scabies persist.

Administration of scabies treatment: Participants assigned to permethrin 5%(either as part of MDA or for clinical reasons) will receive a tube of cream and will be asked to apply the cream from neck to toes, and leave it on for a minimum 8 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. For children aged less than 5 years, parents will be asked to apply cream as a directly observed therapy before they leave the clinic. Older children and adults will be able to apply their treatment at home. For participants assigned to ivermectin, the dose will be determined according to body weight and treatment will be administered under supervision before participants leave the clinic.  Participants with very severe or crusted scabies (so-called Norwegian scabies) will be treated with 2 doses of ivermectin (except if ivermectin is contraindicated as outlined above) with a second dose being administered at 7 to 14 days, in conjunction with twice weekly permethrin cream for 1 month. In cases where ivermectin is contraindicated, in people with crusted scabies, ivermectin will replaced by two doses of permethrin cream 5%, one at baseline and one at 7 to 14 days, with review at 1, 2, 3,12 and 24 months. The trained study nurse will administered the second dose of treatment to crusted scabies participants and will follow up on adherence weekly and communicate with the study coordinator.

    <inclusivecriteria>We have chosen 3 isolated island communities, each with a total population of approximately 800, as the sites for this study. These communities are culturally and geographically similar and are large enough to have a wide distribution of age groups that resembles the national population make up, but are small enough that they are only connected to the main island by a weekly boat service, and so receive relatively few visitors.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: The primary end point of the study is the reduction in prevalence of scabies at 12 months from baseline. The main comparison is between the two MDA arms and the standard of care arm at 12 months. Previous research suggests that the overall prevalence of scabies will be approximately 23% at baseline and it might fall to 5% in the MDA arms (using permethrin or ivermectin) compared to 10% in the standard care arm. This difference is the minimum that we would judge to be of clinical relevance. Assuming 80% response rate of the total community of 1000 and 20% loss to follow up at 12 months,  a total of 1,920 participants (640 in each of the 3 arms) are needed to detect a difference of 5% (i.e 5% vs 10% at 12 months) between the randomised groups with at least 90% power. The study will also have at least 80% power to show the non-inferiority of oral ivermectin compared to topical permethrin as MDA strategy for a difference of not more than 3% scabies prevalence at 12 months. Also, at 3 months we will collect and analyse scabies prevalence data in 20% of all 3 treatment arms (160 participants in each arm, total 480 participants). These data will be utilised to monitor progress and to provide an update to the participating sites. In the unlikely event that the lower limit of the confidence interval for the reduction in scabies for both MDA arms indicated an absolute drop in prevalence of 3% or less, we will review uptake of the MDA in detail. However, this outcome is unlikely given data from previous studies using ivermectin or permethrin, and if the trial continues the prevalence data at 3 months will be a valuable aid in interpreting findings at 12 months.

Statistical analysis: Analysis will be performed as follows: 
1.	Efficacy against scabies (and skin sores): The efficacy outcome measures will be combined across the two MDA communities, and compared with the standard treatment community. The statistical test of significance for this comparison, to be applied at the two-sided 0.05 level, will be a modified version of the chi-squared test that takes account of the sample sizes in both the baseline and later sampling points.  
2.	Efficacy against other conditions:  the same analysis method as for 1) will be used for hypertension, anaemia, renal impairment, haematuria, and specific parasitic infections (filariasis, soil transmitted helminiths).
3.	Safety: Safety outcomes will be compared as proportions at each time point between the 3 communities, using the chi-squared test. 
4.	Health economic outcomes (cost-effectiveness analysis CEA): CEA of the alternative treatment strategies will be evaluated using a Markov model (age- and sex-structured) representing the events related to scabies in the participants in the 3 island communities. The CEA will be conducted following recommendations of the Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. We will compare the incremental costs and health outcomes of standard care with those of each of the 2 MDA arms from the perspective of a single health care payer. The time horizon is over the 2-year study period. A 3% discount rate will be applied to the health outcomes and costs in the second year. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted allowing identification of key factors such as treatment cost, adherence and discount rate (0% and 5%). 
The main comparisons will be made initially without accounting for any differences in communities, apart from baseline prevalence of the scabies and age (5 year age groups). Adjustment of comparisons for other factors will be undertaken as secondary analyses only if there is clear evidence of imbalance and these factors appear to be linked to primary outcomes. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Scabies is a major cause of morbidity in many developing countries, and leads to economic disadvantage and reduced quality of life. This proposal addresses the problem of scabies control in high prevalence countries, through the investigation of the efficacy of two alternative mass drug administration (MDA) regimens in Fiji compared to the current standard of care, which centres on treatment of symptomatic cases and their direct contacts. 

AIMS
Primary Aims:
1.	To assess the efficacy of MDA using either a) topical permethrin or b) oral ivermectin for scabies, compared to standard of care treatment using topical permethrin, in an endemic population. 
2.	To assess whether oral ivermectin is at least as effective as topical permetrhin as MDA strategy for scabies.
Secondary Aims:
3.	To assess the safety of MDA using topical permethrin or oral ivermectin
4.	To evaluate the impact of MDA for scabies on other parasitic diseases (strongyloidiasis, ascariasis and trichuriasis).
5.	To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the three alternative treatment regimens. 
Hypotheses:
1.	Scabies prevalence following MDA treatment protocols using permethrin or ivermectin will be lower than under the standard care treatment.
2.	Oral ivermectin will be at least as effective as topical permethrin as MDA.
3.	MDA using permethrin or ivermectin is safe.
4.	There will be a reduction in the prevalence of other parasitic diseases following MDA, compared to standard of care for scabies.  
5.	MDA of scabies using permethrin or ivermectin will be cost-effective compared with standard of care treatment. </summary>
