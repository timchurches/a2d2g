  <interventions>
    <interventions>Real time ultrasound guidance will be used to determine tracheal midline and cranio-caudal distance (i.e number of tracheal rings) from the cricoid catilage to determine the the site of the tracheal puncture which is the initial step in a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. A bronchoscopic image will be taken after the puncture which will be used to evaluate the puncture position during data analysis. After the puncture, insertion of the tracheostomy will proceed as per the routine used for insertion of a percutanous dilatational tracheostomy. The entire procedure is expected to last between 15-30 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Tracheal puncture will be carried out without the use of ultrasound, as per the traditional landmark technique (i.e using palpation to identify the landmarks and correct position for insertion of the tracheostomy tube). Puncture will be followed by taking of a bronchoscopic image and routine completion of the percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy.The entire procedure is expected to last between 15-30 minutes.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All adult intensive care patients where a decision has been made to insert a tracheostomy are potential participants in the study. The decision to insert a tracheostomy lies with the Intensive Care Specialists. All intensive Care Specialists will be aware of the study and the requirement to screen potential participants. It will be part of the study protocol for the Specialist to inform a member of the research team once a decision to insert a tracheostomy has been made. Quite often a potential need for a tracheostomy is realised well before the decision is made to insert one (depending on patient progress, etc) so research staff will also regularly contact Staff Specialists to be made aware and keep track of patients that might potentially require the intervention in order to reinforce the need to screen these patients for the study once the decision has been made.

Informed consent to be enrolled in the study will be sought from the Person Responsible at the time of consent for the tracheostomy procedure in general. 

Patients where consent has been obtained will be randomly assigned to either of the study groups by drawing the top envelope from a stack of 50 (25 randomly allocated for each group - randomisation as per CONSORT guidelines). The envelopes will be identical and will not allow identification of the group allocation until they are opened.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The TARGET Study is a prospective, randomised controlled trial, evaluating two standard techniques of tracheal puncture during insertion of percutaneous tracheostomies: the traditional landmark method versus the ultrasound guided method.
Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomy (PTD) is a frequently performed invasive procedure in the Intensive Care setting, where complications both immediate and short term can contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. It is increasingly recognised that lateral (off midline) and cranio­caudal (too high up or too low down) malposition of PDTs may result in greater incidence of both short and long term complications.
The use of ultrasonography in placing tracheostomies is well described in the literature. We aim to evaluate the use of real­time ultrasound guidance for the tracheal puncture, which is the most important determining element in positioning the tracheostomy, to determine which method results in better midline and cranio­caudal placement. Better midline and cranio-caudal placement in turn may decrease complications and improve clinically significant surrogate markers of outcome.</summary>
