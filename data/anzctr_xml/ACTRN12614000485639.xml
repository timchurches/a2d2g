  <interventions>
    <interventions>The stretching diaphragm technique will be carried out. Patient lying supine with bent legs on a cushion. Standing at the patient's head, the therapist pushes from the lower ribs towards the head during inspiration and keeping during exhalation.The subject is asked to breathe in from the thorax. The process is repeated ten times in two minutes. It was undertaken on a single occasion only.</interventions>
    <comparator>Lying supine with legs bent on a cushion, the patient is going to keep the position for two minutes, which is the estimated time required for the technique. The therapist was watching a cycle of ten abdominal breaths. The hand of the therapist on the patient's abdomen led the exercise.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of study is to assess the effectiveness of the stretching diaphragm technique versus deep abdominal breathing in patients diagnosed of chronic low back pain; by comparing results obtained in the expiratory peak flow, distance finger-floor technique, Modified Schober test and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for the subjective perception of pain.

Materials and methods: Experimental, randomized, double-blind trial. 
Nulle experimental hypothesis: The stretching diaphragm technique does not improve expiratory peak flow, finger-floor distance, Modified Schober test and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for the subjective perception of pain.
Mesures are going to be taken pre and post intervention by an independent trained and blinded evaluator.  As materials, peak flow metter pocket peak" for measuring the peak flow, VAS for the pain, and measuring-tape for the distance finger-floor and Modified Schober test will be used.
The final sample will consist of 53 patients diagnosed of chronic low back pain divided into two groups: An intervention group to whom diaphragm stretching technique will be applied and a control group to whom deep abdominal breathing exercises will be applied.</summary>
