  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will screen newly diagnosed AML patients aged 15-65 for the presence of the FLT3-ITD mutation. Based on power calculations, 99 patients with FLT3-ITD will be randomized 2:1 to receive Sorafenib or placebo on days 4-10 of induction (1-2 x 28 day cycles), days 4-10 of consolidation (2 x 28 day cycles) and then for 12 months as maintenance therapy.

Patients with suspected AML (WHO 2008 classification) will be consented for standard preliminary study procedures, including centralized cytogenetics review, molecular testing, tissue banking and the commencement of standard induction chemotherapy.

Patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) will be excluded. 

All patients will receive the following INDUCTION chemotherapy regimens:

Age 15-55 (HiDAC-3)

CYTARABNE 3 g/m2 IV over 2-4 hours twice daily (bd) days 1,3,5,7. Patients with a serum creatinine greater than ULN prior to therapy should receive cytarabine at 1 g/m2 IV over 2-4 hours bd days 1,3,5,7.
IDARUBICIN 12 mg/m2 IV days 1-3

Age 56-65 (7+3)

CYTARABINE 100mg/m2 IV continuous infusion on days 1-7
IDARUBICIN 12 mg/m2 IV days 1-3

FLT3-ITD identification

Patients will be assessed for molecular eligibility prior to commencement of Sorafenib via a network of molecular centres located throughout Australia and New Zealand. These centres will undergo a regular quality assessment program conducted in association with the Australian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) laboratory sciences committee.  

On day 4 of induction chemotherapy, patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML (allelic mutant: wild-type ratio = 0.05), will be randomized 2:1 by the ALLG biostatistical and coordinating centre (BaCT) to commence taking the FLT3 inhibitor Sorafenib or placebo.

Sorafenib administration

Patients allocated Sorafenib will be given 400 mg twice daily (bd) orally from day 4 to day 10, inclusive (14 doses), after starting induction chemotherapy. If the first dose of Sorafenib is given late in the afternoon on day 4, the final dose may be given on the morning of day 11.

A bone marrow assessment will occur on day 28 to assess response.

Those achieving CR/CRi/CRp will receive CONSOLIDATION chemotherapy. 

Age 15-55 (IcE)

IDARUBICIN 9 mg/m2 IV days 1,2
CYTARABINE 100 mg/m2 days 1-5 IVI
ETOPOSIDE 75 mg/m2 IV days 1-5

Age 56-65 (HiDAC-2)

CYTARABINE 1000 mg/m2 IV over 2-4 hours bd days 1,3,5 
IDARUBICIN 12 mg/m2 IV days 1,2

Those randomized to Sorafenib during induction will receive for consolidation: 
Sorafenib 400 mg bd from day 4 to day 10, inclusive (14 doses)

Maintenance therapy

Patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML who received Sorafenib during induction and consolidation will also receive Sorafenib as maintenance therapy, commencing day 42 after day 1 of the last round of consolidation chemotherapy, or up to day 60 if recovery of neutrophils to 1.0 x 109/L and platelets to 75 x 109/L is delayed. Sorafenib will be given at a dose of 400 mg bd for a total maintenance period of 12 months. Patients allocated to receive placebo will continue to do so in a double-blinded manner.

The tablet cores contain Sorafenib tosylate (BAY 54-9085) and the excipients croscarmellose sodium, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulphate and magnesium stearate. The film-coat consists of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide and red iron oxide.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine 2 year event-free survival (EFS) in untreated adult AML (age 15-65) with FLT3 ITD mutation administered the FLT3 inhibitor Sorafenib compared to a placebo control group not receiving Sorafenib.

The primary endpoint will be the Event-free survival (EFS), measured from the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause, AML relapse or treatment failure. If the patient does not achieve a CR, EFS is defined as the point of progression or death, whichever comes first. Patients with none of these events at the close-out date will have their EFS censored at the close-out date. The atients with none of these events and who were also deemed to be lost to follow-up before the close-out date, will have their EFS censored at the date they were last known to be alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Event-free survival after 2 years from registration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To confirm the safety of Sorafenib given in combination with HiDAC based induction chemotherapy.

Secondary endpoints are: response rate (CR, CRi), RFS (relapse-free survival) from CR, time-to-relapse (TTR) and overall survival (OS) from randomisation, as well as toxicity and biomarkers of response. The percentage of patients achieving CR with this treatment will be calculated as well as the 2-sided 95% CI for these rates using the Blyth-Still-Casella method. Logistic and Cox regression will be used for additional analyses involving the evaluation of additional prognostic factors.</outcome>

    <concealment>The patients will be screened and enrolled by their treating physician. The patients will be randomized according to their fulfilment of the inclusion criteria.

The patients must be registered on the AML Registry prior to induction chemotherapy. In order to do so, the patient must meet all eligibility criteria. In addition, the patient must be informed about the requirement to have blood and bone marrow samples taken, and about the initial screening tests prior to induction therapy, and the requirement to have blood samples taken after the first cycles of both induction and consolidation chemotherapy. A signed and dated AML Registry PICF must be obtained from the patient before commencing screening procedures for trial registration prior to induction chemotherapy. In addition, the patient should be offered the optional ALLG Tissue Banking PICF for samples submitted to the ALLG tissue bank. If applicable, consent must be taken for this prior to registration. 

A patient will only be eligible for M16 if identified to have FLT3-ITD mutant allelic burden grater than or equal to 0.05, and continues to meet the AML Registry eligibility criteria.

If patient is eligible the patient must be randomised on day 3 to M16.

Each randomised pateint will be allocated a unique 5 digit study ID, e.g. ALF01, and a unique drug box number from the drug box numbers provided to the site prior to activation. As this is a double-blind study, neither the Investigator nor the Coordinating Centre will know whether the patient has been allocated Sorafenib or Placebo.</concealment>
    <sequence>The patient’s ID and drug box allocation must be written on the M16 Randomisation Form and it is the site’s responsibility to communicate this with their local pharmacy department to ensure the patient is allocated the correct treatment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of treatment with the drug Sorafenib, in combination with intensive chemotherapy for adults with previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 15-65 years and have been diagnosed with AML with FLT3-ITD mutation. You must have received no previous treatment for AML.

Trial details
All participants in this trial will undergo intensive chemotherapy over a period of minimum twelve months. Participants will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will receive the oral drug Sorafenib whilst undergoing chemotherapy and for a period of 12 months afterwards. The other group will receive a placebo (inactive) treatment in conjunction with chemotherapy. Participants will not know which group they are in until completion of the trial. 

Participants will be assessed at regular timepoints for a period of up to 5 years to determine the safety and clinical benefit of Sorafenib treatment in combination with chemotherapy.

Treatment Duration will be a minimum of 1 year. 


This Phase II study will: 

Investigate the clinical benefit of frontline Sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy  and during maintenance therapy in adult AML

Optimise the dosing schedule of Sorafenib based on the kinetics of circulating FLT3 ligand levels after chemotherapy

Investigate the clinical benefit of Sorafenib in relation to additional molecular AML lesions

Identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlates of response predictive of treatment outcome.</summary>
