  <interventions>
    <interventions>Our proposed research will use innovative and valid, non-invasive techniques, including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), to measure the effect of 8 weeks of: i) low-intensity/low energy expenditure aerobic exercise training (LO-LO); ii) low-intensity/high energy expenditure aerobic exercise (LO-HI) iii) high-intensity/low energy expenditure aerobic exercise training (HI-LO) iv) progressive resistance (PRT) and v) placebo control on liver fat content, abdominal triglyceride partitioning (subcutaneous and visceral fat), serum aminotransferases, blood lipids/hormones, insulin sensitivity and aerobic fitness (VO2max/peak) in overweight and obese individuals with pre-diabetes. 

Specifically, subjects allocated to LO-LO will receive a supervised progressive cycling exercise program involving 2 days of exercise per week with one additional session at home each week, 45 minutes per session at 50% of maximal aerobic power (VO2max) (135 min per week).  Subjects allocated to LO-HI will undertake 3 days of supervised exercise per week with one additional session at home each week, 60 minutes per session at 50% of VO2max (240 min per week); those in HI-LO will receive 2 days of supervised exercise per week with one additional session at home each week, 45 minutes per session at 70% of VO2max (135 min per week).  Subjects allocated to PRT will receive a supervised progressive resistance training program involving 3 days of exercise per week, 8-10 exercises per session, 1-3 sets per exercise at 60-80% of 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) with sessions lasting 45- 60 minutes including warm up and cool down on a cycle ergometer. 

For the LO-LO, the LO-HI and HI-LO groups all supervised exercise sessions will be performed on a stationary cycle ergometer and supervised on a one-on-one basis by an exercise physiologist. The additional home-based session will involve brisk walking at the prescribed intensity. The PRT sessions will also be supervised by an exercise physiologist on a one-on-one basis.

All exercise interventions will be progressed. The LO-LO group will begin cycling for 30 minutes at 50% V02 peak and this will progress to 45 minutes by week 3 of the intervention. The HI-LO group will begin cycling at 50% intensity for 30 minutes and this will progress to 45 minutes at 70% V02 peak by week 3 of the intervention. The LO-HI group will begin cycling for 45 minutes at 50% intensity and this will progress to 60 minutes by week 3 of the intervention. Heart rates and ratings of perceived exertion will be continuously monitored and the power output (Watts) increased in accordance with training adaptations over the 8 weeks to keep the same relative exercise intensity. 


Supervised sessions will be logged by the exercise physiology with heart rates, ratings of perceived exertion and blood pressure recorded. Adherence to home based sessions will be monitored using a home log book and record heart rates and ratings of perceived exertion. </interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects allocated to the placebo control group will undertake three days of stretching, core strength and fit-ball exercise for 15-30 minutes per session. These subject will receive exercise instruction (home-based) with fortnightly supervised training sessions. The supervised sessions will occur at the training institute and will involve instruction of a new set of stretches/fit ball exercises to be performed at home for the following 2 weeks.  The home-based sessions will be logged in a home diary in order to monitor compliance. The control group is designed to elicit no cardiometabolic benefit and to control for factors of attention and participation in a lifestyle program. </comparator>

125 participants will undertake this study (n= 25 per group). 
Sample size estimate was based on a projected change in IHTG (intrahepatic triglyceride) in the aerobic exercise group of 10% versus 0% in the control group, for a total effect size = 0.81, based on papers with an intervention similar to our design that were included in our meta-analysis of previous studies. A priori, two-tailed power calculations at an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 gave an actual power of 0.801 for a sample size of 25 in each group using G-Power software (University of Trier, Trier, Germany).


Data will be analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). A two-way ANOVA for repeated measures will be used to compare time and treatment effects. Significance will be set at p&lt;0.05. Intention to treat analysis will be employed with imputed means for missing data.

Specifically, the effect of exercise volume/energy expenditure will be assessed by comparison of LO-LO and LO-HI; the effect of exercise intensity will the assessed by comparison of LO-LO and HI-LO; and the effect of exercise modality will be compared by comparison of PRT with LO-LO and HI-LO and Placebo Control by 2-way repeated measures ANOVA

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise per se has recently been shown to be effective in the management of fatty liver, independent of weight loss. Sustained weight loss is becoming increasingly recognised as an unrealistic and unsustainable outcome of lifestyle intervention.  There are currently no practical guidelines for physical activity in fatty liver disease. This research aims to examine the components of regular exercise which result in an hepatic benefit by comparing i) low-intensity/low energy expenditure aerobic exercise training (LO-LO); ii) low-intensity/high energy expenditure aerobic exercise (LO-HI) iii) high-intensity/low energy expenditure aerobic exercise training (HI-LO) iv) progressive resistance (PRT) and v) a placebo control on hepatic and visceral fat, liver enzymes, and other health outcomes in overweight and obese sedentary individuals with pre-diabetes.

We hypothesize that: the high-intensity/low energy expenditure aerobic exercise training will result in greater improvement in liver fat content than a) low-intensity/low energy expenditure aerobic exercise training b) low-intensity/high energy expenditure aerobic exercise training and c) placebo control; that the progressive resistance training will result in greater improvement in liver fat content than a) low-intensity/low energy expenditure aerobic exercise training b) low-intensity/high energy expenditure aerobic exercise training and c) placebo control; and that all exercise training groups will result in greater improvement in liver fat content than the placebo control group
