      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed and an Unconfirmed Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to RECIST Version (v) 1.0 - Extension: BRAFV600E- Positive Melanoma - BOR of confirmed /unconfirmed (total) response was defined as CR or PR recorded from baseline until disease progression/recurrence according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.0 criteria. For target lesions (TLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs, and PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of longest diameters of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline (BL) sum of longest diameters. For non-target lesions (NTLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels. Confirmed responses were those which were confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than four weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Percentage of participants with best overall response rate was calculated as the (number of participants with CR or PR) divided by (total number of participants in the cohort), and then multiplied by 100.

    <summary>The primary objective of this FIH study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of
