  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be performed in healthy male subjects with administration of a single oral dose of PRAX-330 or vehicle (placebo) in solution in a sequential ascending manner. In Cohorts 1 through 7 subjects will be fasted overnight (no food or drink except water) for 10 hours prior to dosing. Cohort 8 will be a food effect cohort with dose level to be determined based upon the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of earlier cohorts. For the food effect cohort, study drug will be administered after an overnight fast (no food or drink, except water, for at least 10 hours prior to dosing). Subjects in Cohort 8 will receive a single dose of study drug in a fed state (30 minutes following the start of a high-fat meal).

Up to 56 healthy male subjects will be enrolled. Within each cohort, the subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio with 6 subjects in the active group and 2 subjects in the placebo group. 

Eligible subjects will receive study treatment with a starting dose of 0.1 mg dose escalated up to 15 mg. The last cohort will be to evaluate the food effect at a maximally tolerated dose (8 subjects from a previously evaluated cohort).

      <timepoint>A complete physical examination (PE) will be performed at Screening, Day -1 and Day 8. In addition PEs will be performed at the same time points as vital signs are measured (see below).

Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5  3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and  168 hours post-dose.
 
Vital signs measurement (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and body temperature) will be collected at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose), 0.25, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours post-dose

Blood sample collection for clinical laboratory analyses will be collected pre-dose (day-1), and on day 2 at 24 hrs post-dose, day 4 at 72 hrs post-dose and day 8 at 168 hrs post-dose.

Adverse events (AE) and concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the study period.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Approximately 56 healthy subjects will be enrolled into the study to ensure 8 evaluable subjects per cohort with up to 7 cohorts. As the primary objectives of this study are to describe, for the first time in humans, the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of oral PRAX-330 in healthy subjects, no statistical significance tests are planned. Consequently, the sample size for this study was not selected on the basis of statistical power calculations.
Descriptive statistics will include mean, SD, Minimum, maximum, percent coefficient of variation (%CV), and geometric mean will be presented by dose group for the clinical outcomes and the plasma concentration of PRAX-330 at each scheduled sample time point. </statisticalmethods>
