  <interventions>
    <interventions>Metacognitive therapy (MCT+) is a novel psychotherapeutic approach that builds on the concepts and goals of cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis. MCT+ targets the cognitive biases (i.e. distortions in the collection and processing of information) thought to underlie the formation and maintenance of delusional beliefs, and aims to bring to the attention of patients the cognitive dysfunctions that may be causing or maintaining their delusional symptoms (i.e. metacognitive implies thinking about ones thinking). One  of the three fundamental components of the programme is knowledge translation. The second component is a demonstration of the negative consequences of these cognitive biases via exercises that target each bias individually. Finally, patients are offered alternative thinking strategies, which may help them to arrive at more appropriate inferences and thereby avoid the cognitive traps that otherwise lead to delusional beliefs. It consists of 8 modules covering (i) six cognitive biases common in psychosis (jumping-to-conclusions, attribution bias, belief inflexibility, theory of mind deficits, false memories, depressive thinking styles), (ii) an introductory and relapse prevention module. It is individually administered (face-to-face) by a psychologist (eligible or working towards eligibility for clinical endorsement) across 4 x 2 hour sessions, once/week for 4 weeks (plus 3 assessment sessions at baseline, 6-week follow-up, 6-month follow-up) at Lyell McEwin, Flinders and Noarlunga Hospitals. Attendance to the four individual therapy sessions will be recorded for each participant.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study will utilise a cognitive remediation active control group (i.e., the 'Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry Program' developed by 'HAPPYneuron'), covering four cognitive domains (working memory, processing speed, verbal learning, reasoning and problem-solving); modules are accessed online and will be individually administered (face-to-face) by a psychologist (eligible or working towards eligibility for clinical endorsement) across 4 x 2 hour sessions, once/week for 4 weeks (plus 3 assessment sessions at baseline, 6-week follow-up, 6-month follow-up) at Lyell McEwin, Flinders and Noarlunga Hospitals. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A total of 30 participants per condition is sufficient to produce a power of .80 to detect a moderate-to-large between-within interaction effect in a two-group repeated-measures design (level of statistical significance: 5%; effect size: 0.5). 

It is proposed that repeated-measures analysis-of-variance (RM-ANOVA) inferential statistics will be employed to test the hypotheses on the various measures between the MCT+ and cognitive remediation groups pre- and post-treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Delusions are characteristic of people with psychosis. Many of these people do not respond well to current drug treatments and require additional psychological treatment. This project is an investigation into the efficacy of psychological treatments for delusions in psychosis, focusing on a new therapy (MCT+) which combines cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis and metacognitive training. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for psychosis develops an awareness of the implausible content of a patients delusion, while metacognitive training targets the problematic thinking styles underlying delusional beliefs. It is expected that MCT+ will be one of the most effective psychological treatments for reducing delusional symptoms.

The first aim of the proposed project is to determine the unique contribution of an individually-administered MCT+ program, combining the important facets of MCT and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, over a standard cognitive remediation program (HAPPYneuron) targeting only neuropsychological cognitive deficits. The second aim is to determine the persistence of any improvements due to MCT+ by including a longitudinal follow-up. In sum, this project will provide the theory-driven evidence base that is needed to inform and influence clinicians to roll-out MCT+ to improve treatment for delusional people with psychosis.

Primary Hypothesis: Participants who receive metacognitive training (MCT+) will show a reduction in delusional severity whilst improving clinical and cognitive insight (relative to participants in the cognitive remediation control condition). Participants randomised to the cognitive remediation control condition will show improvements to the cognitive symptoms of psychosis, including improved language and memory skills (relative to participants in the metacognitive training condition).</summary>
