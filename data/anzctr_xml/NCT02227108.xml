  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Composite Complete Response (CRc) - The CRc is defined as achieving complete response (CR), or CR with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL or B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Complete response (CR) as per International Working Group (IWG) is complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. Morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) is defined as the above CR criteria without specified blood counts. The efficacy assessments were evaluated as per investigator assessment.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-Negative CRc Rate - The MRD-negative CRc rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved CRc and became MRD-negative as determined by flow cytometry performed by a central analysis laboratory.

      <outcome>Best Overall Response (BOR) - The best overall response was calculated, based upon the disease assessments recorded during the study visits, and summarized with the number and percentage of participants for the following categories: CRc, PR, HA, SD, PD, and not evaluable. Overall best response is the best response observed for a participant during the study based on International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for malignant lymphoma. Complete response (CR) as per IWG is complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. PR is a minimum of 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses and no increase in the size of other nodes and in size of liver or spleen. Stable disease (SD) is when a participant fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for PD.</outcome>
