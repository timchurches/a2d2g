    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - irofulven

Experimental: Arm I - If the dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression in stratum 1, then stratum 1 is closed and stratum 2 opens.
Stratum 2 consists of the following: patients receiving no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens; patients who have not received prior central axis radiation or bone marrow transplantation; and patients with no known bone marrow involvement. Patients receive intravenous 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene over 10 minutes daily for 5 days. The course is repeated every 28 days unless disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive up to 1 year of therapy. If dose limiting toxicity occurs in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose. Dose escalation will not occur until all patients within a cohort have been observed for 28 days from day 1 of therapy. Patients are followed until death.
