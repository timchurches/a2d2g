  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this 2-year study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and disease
      modifying efficacy of SD 6010, an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in
      overweight and obese subjects with knee osteoarthritis. The efficacy of SD-6010 will be
      evaluated by radiography using joint space narrowing in the medial tibiofemoral compartment
      of the study knee as the primary endpoint.</summary>
