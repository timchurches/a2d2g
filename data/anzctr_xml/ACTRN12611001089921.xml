  <interventions>
    <interventions>A generic brand skin moisturising lotion will be applied twice daily to the limbs of consenting residents in aged care facilities for 6 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin Tear Incidence. Skin tears will be identified and classified using the STAR tool as well as having site of tear noted.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin Tear Severity. Using the STAR tool.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Baseline and six months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin tear location and management. A pre defined list on the data collection tool covers all potential skin tear locations. A treatment options list is included.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and six months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identify the barriers and enablers to skin moisturising regimens in residential aged care facilities. This will be assessed through a series of pre and post intervention focus groups and reviews of site documentation.</outcome>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All participants at a randomised facility (block randomisation) who meet inclusion criteria will be approached to consent to have the intervention used.  Participants at a non intervention site will have no change to routine practice.  Staff applying the intervention work within the randomised site and don't crossover. Strictly speaking allocation concealment is not used.</concealment>
    <sequence>Fourteen aged care sites will be matched for care dependency using nationally defined criteria then randomised to either the intervention or standard practice using simple randomisations procedures. Residents within each facility will then with consent receive the intervention, or continue in non intervention sites with standard care.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>A 6 month retrospective review of resident skin tears in the participating facilities will be included as well as a pre-intervention review of skin care practices and a post intervention review of skin care practices.</designfeatures>
