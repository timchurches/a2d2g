  <interventions>
    <interventions>Family Transitions Triple P - 10, 2 hourly group session parenting intervention designed to address the key risk factors for negative outcomes for children following parental divorce.  Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions (enhanced or standard) or a waitlist control group. The standard group will receive the 10 week group program.  The enhanced condition will receive a brief weekly telephone call to encourage group attendance, in addition to the standard program.    Program facilitators will be blinded to group membership.</interventions>
    <comparator>The waitlist control group will receive the intervention approximately 14 weeks later.</comparator>
