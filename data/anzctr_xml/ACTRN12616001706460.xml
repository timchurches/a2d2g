  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will undergo a total knee replacement in both knees to treat osteoarthritis. Two different skin incisions will be used. The study exposure called the lateral incision. It is an incision that starts 5cm midline above the patella (knee cap) and as is curved inferiorly (down the knee) and laterally (the outer side edge) around the patella. It finishes curving back once passed the patella towards the midline of the tibia (shin). (Please see study protocol attached to ANZCTR registration form for images.) We hypothesize that the more lateral or towards the outside of the knee the incision is, the less insensate skin on the outer side of the knee will be and the patient will be able to  kneel better. The lateral skin incision will be performed with a scalpel. Deeper dissection will be performed with diathermy cautery. Skin flaps will be mobilised. A midvastus medial parapatellar arthrotomy will be done and the knee joint exposed with the patella flipped laterally Computer navigation will be used. The surgery will take 60-90 minutes.</interventions>

Two different skin incisions will be used, the control group will be the opposite knee with an incision centred in the middle of the knee . Computer navigation will be used.

    <statisticalmethods>We will de-identify data and send it to an external statistician to perform the appropriate statistical testing. To perform a sample size calculation, we used a study by Borely et al. The expected surface area of loss of skin innervation in midline skin incisions in TKA was found to be of mean of 66cm2 with a standard deviation (SD) of 30 cm2. As there is are no published observational data for lateral skin incisions, we assumed the loss of skin sensation of 44cm2 with same SD of 30 cm2 with lateral skin incisions. Assuming Type I error (alpha) to 5% (p = 0.05) and Type II error (beta) to 0.2 (power equal to 80%), the sample size calculated was 30 knees in each group, therefore 60 knees. We will investigate 66 knees to compensate for 10% expected loss to follow-up. As we are using bilateral knees, we will need 33 patients.

We will use SPSS software to analyse the data. For the continuous data such as the area of reduced sensation will use repeated measures ANOVA. The difference in the means of the PROMs data, as well as the kneeling grade will determined using the non-parametric Wilcoxons signed- rank test for non-normally distributed data, an unpaired t-test for normally distributed data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The initial skin incision performed to expose the knee during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is centred over the patella for ease of access to the joint. This places the scar directly over the bony points of the knee that bear load when kneeling, leaving the skin on the lateral side (outside) of the scar with reduced sensation and sometimes the skin on the medial side (inside) of the scar with painfully altered sensation (dysaesthesiae / neuromata). Placing the skin incision lateral to the edge of the patella (kneecap) avoids the necessity of kneeling on a scar and has been shown to reduced dysaesthesiae and neuromata in other knee procedures. 

Primary Aim:  
To prove that lateral skin incisions improve the ability to kneel in patients following bilateral total knee arthroplasty

Secondary Aim: 
1.Investigate whether lateral skin incision has improved retention of skin sensation.
2.Investigate the ability to kneel after TKA.
3.Investigate if there is improved deep flexion.
4.Investigate whether there is decreased pain and better satisfaction as per patient reported outcome measures (PROM)

Research Design:
Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial.

Patient Demographic:  Eligible patients aged between 40-90 years of age with bilateral, tri-compartmental osteoarthritis (OA),undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKA.  Patients with previous knee arthrotomy (cut to the joint capsule) will be excluded. 

Patients' limbs will be randomized for surgery into two groups; (1) Midline Incision Group and (2) Lateral Incision Group.  

Outcomes:measured at, six months, and 12 months post-operatively.
- Knee flexion and extension.
- Kneeling Grade Assessment- a novel grading system has been developed that Grades the ability to kneel from 1-5 depending on how far down the patient can knee.
- Area of skin dysaesthesia (uncomfortable change in skin sensation) will be mapped and analyzed using imaging software.
- Neuroma formation.
- PROMs (patient reported outcome measures).
