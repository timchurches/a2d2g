Mediation analysis

A prior pilot study (Sheehan, Stanton and Renner, 2016) examined results in the area of stigma change (SSOSH, SSRPH questionnaires) and self-reported confidence in helping others (on a likert scale) at pre and post intervention.

An analysis of statistical power was carried out using the differences in means and differences in standard deviations from that study. For the outcome variable of confidence in helping others a sample size of 15 is required (P=.05; power 80%) based on a prior effect size of Cohen's D=1.13. For the outcome variables of change in beliefs related to stigma, a sample size of 98 is required for the SSOSH measure (Cohen's D=0.28) and a sample size of 96 is required for the SSOSH measure (P=.05; power 80%; Cohen's D=0.29).</statisticalmethods>
