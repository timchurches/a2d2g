  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are three arms to this trial. Arm 1: Cognitive Therapy/Memory Reactivation. Arm 2: Cognitive Therapy. Arm 3: Wait-List. Therapy is administered once-daily over
4 days on an individual 30 minute basis. Cognitive Therapy/Memory Reactivation is hospital-based and administered by a psychologist. It includes brief reminding the patient of their traumatic injury, followed by audiorecorded instructions encouraging adaptive appraisals about recovery.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 6.5 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Cognitive Therapy includes brief audiorecorded instructions encouraging adaptive appraisals about recovery.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 6.5 months.

Wait-List includes no intervention but involves same assessments as administered to those in active treatments. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 6.5 months. At the conclusion of the Wait-List follow-up, participants in this condition will be referred for individual treatment as indicated.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The thrust of analyses will be using hierarchical linear models (HLM) to investigate the relative effects of the treatments. Analyses will be conducted using Mplus (version 7.11). The benefit of this approach is that it presumes intent-to-treat analyses as HLM allows the number of observations to vary between participants and effectively handles missing data by using the maximum likelihood estimator, which provides the optimal estimates of model parameter values and standard errors. The Level 1 model will represent within-patient change over time, and the Level 2 model will predict variation in within-patient change over time and encompass between-patient variables (treatment condition, injury characteristics, gender). Primary measures will comprise the PDS and HADS. Effect size is based on previous recommendations for multilevel models. Power for this design is estimated to be 80%, entering the parameters of 80 per group, effect-size at .7 (p = .05).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the study is to evaluate the roles of memory reactivation and cognitive therapy as a means of preventing PTSD shortly after trauma exposure.  This study compares the
relative effectiveness of (a) Cognitive Therapy Combined with
Memory Reactivation, (b) Cognitive Therapy Alone, and (c)
Wait-list in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. It is hypothesised that Cognitive Therapy combined with Memory Reactivation will lead to greater symptom reduction than Cognitive Therapy, which will lead to greater symptom reduction than Wait-List.</summary>
