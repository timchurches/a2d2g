    <interventions>This study will determine the number and types of transfusions administered to patients with thalassaemia major treated at a single hospital (Monash Medical Centre) over a five month period (February to June 2017); and the total costs for providing those transfusions. 
To do this detailed process maps will be developed by observing the process and validating process maps with hospital staff. Duplicate measures of the time taken for each process will be made. 
Costs will be calculated using hospital financial information obtained from Monash Health financial and administrative databases, and from published data.
Indirect overhead costs such as administrative and general expenditures will be added as a percentage of the process costs. The percentage will be determined by Monash Healths overall ratio between indirect costs and direct or operational costs.
Hospital records will be used to calculate the number and types of transfusions administered.

    <statisticalmethods>Data on process timings, resource requirements, staffing requirements and staffing levels will be collected on a convenience sample of a minimum of 3 episodes per process, with the average of the recorded episodes used. Where significant variability is identified in the timings of any given process, additional observations will be collected. Data on the costs associated with each process (including direct overhead costs) will be collected directly from Monash Health financial and administrative databases where available, and from published data otherwise (for example, NBA National Product Price List, MBS schedule, Victorian staffing awards). Indirect overhead costs such as administrative and general expenditures will be added as a percentage of the process costs. The percentage will be determined by Monash Healths overall ratio between indirect costs and direct or operational costs. All costs will be expressed in Australian dollars</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine the total cost of administration of a unit of red blood cells for a patient with thalassaemia major treated at Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia.

This study involves determination of the processes and costs associated with administering a unit of RBCs to adult patients with thalassaemia at Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, Victoria, Australia. The unit of observation is the process involved in preparation or administration of a unit of RBCs and as such, patients are not enrolled into this study.

Transfusions can be life-saving, but they also carry risks and substantial costs. Alternatives to transfusions exist for some patients, but evaluations and decisions about treatment options are often complex, and may be more difficult when the benefits, risks and costs are not well characterised.
Australian governments through the National Blood Authority (NBA) spend in the order of $AUD 1 billion annually in provision of blood products for the community. However, visibility of transfusion-Â­-related costs is generally low. The manufacturing cost is now carried on the blood product label, and for red blood cells (RBCs) at October 2015 this is $AUD 374.72(1). 
In some Australian states the costs of the product is devolved to the hospital level, but most hospitals have little or no idea of the true costs of transfusion therapy, over and above the costs of providing components, including laboratory and clinical costs. 
Thalassaemia is associated with significant complications and often requires lifelong therapy, involving red blood cell transfusion every three to four weeks which require the individual to attend hospital for the day. 

Estimates of the total healthcare costs for a beta thalassaemia major patient experiencing minimal complications are $150K per year, however there are currently no Australian transfusion costing data in the thalassaemia context. Understanding the full cost of transfusion will inform policy development and facilitate safe and cost effective treatments and transfusion support for patients with beta thalassaemia; resulting in improved outcomes for patients and better utilization of limited health resources.</summary>
