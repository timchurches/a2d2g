The oral rehydration solution proposed to be used for this study is HYDRAlyte.
The bowel preparation to be used will be PrepKit C which includes Picoprep (Sodium picosulfate,Magnesium, Citric acid powder for oral solution) and Glycoprep (Sodium chloride, Sodium bicarbonate, Potassium chloride,  Macrogol 3350, Sodium sulfate powder for oral solution)
 

The amount and duration for Group B is as follows.
Day before procedure:

- 6pm: one sachet of glycoprep mixed with 1L water + 200ml HYDRAlyte (Orange)
- 8pm: 200ml of HYDRAlyte (Orange) +/- extra colourless fluids 
- 9pm: 200ml of HYDRAlyte (Orange) +/- extra colourless fluids

      <outcome>Percentage of correct estimations of colour of oral hydration solution consumed before colonoscopy will be the primary endpoint. This will inform future studies and suitability of use of these products pre-procedure.

The endoscopist will be asked to assess the acceptability of the bowel preparation at completion of the colonoscopy on the day of procedure. They will rate the bowel preparation using the Ottawa Scale, and will complete a datasheet where they will be asked to estimate which colour fluid the patient ingest pre-procedure.</outcome>

Patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire on completion of their bowel preparation before colonoscopy. At this time they will be asked about their experience of the bowel preparation regimen and symptoms experienced. For example whether they experienced nausea, vomitting, headache, abdominal cramping etc. They will also be asked whether they would repeat the regimen if they were to have another colonoscopy.

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria are conditions generally considered as exclusions to colonoscopy in normal clinical practice.  They are suspected bowel perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, toxic megacolon, severe colitis, and pregnancy or lactation.  For additional safety, will also exclude patients with the relative contraindications of renal impairment (eGFR&lt;60) and heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV).  Prep-Kit C is contraindicated in individuals with phenylketonuria, due to the presence of aspartame and patients with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency given it contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) which is an oxidant.  Diabetics will also be excluded due to the high level of dextrose in OHS. Any person with a known hypersensitivity to a constituent of Picoprep, Glycoprep or OHS will also be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The participants will be undergoing colonoscopy at the Alfred for clinically accepted indications.  Patients will be recruited and written informed consent will be acquired before enrolling patients into the study. 
All patients enrolled in the study will use our current standard bowel preparation of Prep-Kit C (2 sachets of Picoprep and 1 sachet of Glycoprep). Consenting patients will be recruited from the afternoon colonoscopy booking list prior to randomisation.  Patients will be randomly allocated to one of three groups. Group A will be the control group ie; standard bowel preparation with no oral hydration solution. In order for the groups to have consistent amounts of fluid and therefore be comparable; Group A will be instructed to have a minimum of 2 litres of fluid during their bowel preparation. Group B will have 2 litres of orange colour OHS during their bowel preparation pre-colonoscopy. And Group C will have 2 litres of Apple/Blackcurrant purple coloured OHS preparation. 

Allocation will be via sealed opaque envelopes that are mailed to patients by the endoscopy bookings nurse.</concealment>
    <sequence>A sealed envelope with instructions, Prep-Kit, OHS product (if randomised to Group B or C) and measuring instrument will be mailed along with other standard instructions about the time of their procedure.  The bookings clerk will record the patient’s hospital ‘UR’ number with their study reference number on a password protected database at the time of randomisation. 

The radomised study numbers are created via a randomisation table provided by statisticians via a computerised sequence generation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study wishes to investigate whether the consumption of an oral hydration solution (OHS) during bowel preparation will affect the faecal effluent in terms of colour or quality. The investigators will examine whether the endoscopist can detect which colour OHS has been used in conjunction with bowel preparation (if any), and whether the use of an OHS in conjunction with current bowel preparations pre-colonoscopy can reduce the effects of dehydration (ie nausea, dry mouth, headache, lethargy, increased thirst). This may aid in the tolerability of bowel preparation, which in turn may result in better compliance with bowel preparation, with adequate fluid consumption being achieved.
The researchers will also investigate whether the inclusion of an OHS has an impact on bowel cleanliness, polyp/adenoma detection, caecal/terminal ileal intubation rate, and time taken to complete the colonoscopy.
