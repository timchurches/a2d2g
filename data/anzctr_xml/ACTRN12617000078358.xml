  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional drug to be utilized in this randomized controlled trial is the oral anti-epileptic drug, perampanel. Perampanel is an AMPA-receptor antagonist. Both intervention and comparator (levetiracetam) medications will be identically encapsulated. 
Patients with WHO grade II-III supratentorial gliomas will be recruited pre-operatively and receive a 7T MRI scan. Post-operatively, patients will be randomized to receive perampanel  or levetiracetam for 52 weeks.
Perampanel will be started at 2mg at night and over the first 4 weeks (escalation phase) will be uptitrated to by 2mg every 2 weeks. At the start of the assessment phase (week 5-52), perampanel will be increased to 6mg. Participants will remain on 6mg daily from week 5 until treatment completion at the end of week 52 unless seizures or side effects occur.

If post-operative seizures develop, perampanel can subsequently undergo 3 uptitrations of 2mg to a maximum of 12mg at night at the discretion of the investigator. If side effects develop and are intolerable, one dose reduction of 2mg can occur. 	

Participants will have  8 visits following randomisation over the 52-week study period, during which post-operative seizures, compliance and side effects will be assessment by investigators. Participants will be questioned regarding their medication adherence, and tablet/bottle counting will be performed to aid in compliance assessment. Visits will occur at 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks and 4, 6, 9, 12 months. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group will receive levetiracetam. Levetiracetam is generally regarded as first line treatment for control of tumour associated seizures, however this is based on limited evidence.
Levetiracetam will be given orally. 
Levetiracetam will be started at 250mg twice daily and will be uptitrated to 500mg twice daily after 2 weeks. At the start of the assessment phase assessment phase (week 5-52), Levetiracetam will remain at 500mg twice daily.
Participants will have 8 subsequent visits following randomisation over the 52-week study period, during which post-operative seizures, compliance and side effects will be assessment by investigators. Participants will be questioned regarding their medication adherence, and tablet/bottle counting will be performed to aid in compliance assessment. Visits will occur at 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks and 4, 6, 9, 12 months. 
If post-operative seizures develop, Levetiracetam can subsequently undergo up to 3 progressive uptitrations (750mg twice daily, 1000mg twice daily and 1500mg twice daily) at the discretion of the investigator. If side effects develop and are intolerable, one dose reduction to the previous dose can be performed.

    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software.

Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion, depending upon both the operation (biopsy alone vs larger resection) and WHO grade (II vs III). This will ensure approximately equal numbers of each grade glioma are randomized to each treatment arm in study 1 and 2. A computer generated randomisation method will be utilized with an allocation table uploaded to a Redcap database program. An independent clinical researcher will given access randomise patients using the Redcap database, keeping all other researchers blinded. 

Stratifying on the basis of WHO grade will help ensure extra homogeneity between study arms. In study 1 (perampanel vs levetiracetam), patients with one or more pre-operative seizures will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either perampanel or levetiracetam. Investigators and patients will be blinded to the assigned treatment until the end of the assessment phase.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>This is primarily a hypothesis generating pilot RCT, the results of which will aid study design and power calculations in a subsequent phase III trial. Regardless, power calculations have been performed for planned sample size. Given total sample size of 40, allocation ratio 1:1, two-sided significant level of 0.05, and assumed 65% seizure free rate in patients taking levetiracetam, Fishers exact test has power of 0.8 to detect an absolute 33.7% (RR~1.52) increase in seizure free rate. With regards to time to first post-operative seizure analysis, the sample size of 40 patients has 0.8 power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.386, i.e. 38.6% risk of event compared to the control group (placebo or levetiracetam). 
Clinicopathological characteristics will be compared on univariate analysis between intervention (perampanel) and comparison groups (levetiracetam). This will be examined using and Fishers exact test as appropriate for categorical variables, Independent T-test for continuous, normally distributed variables and Mann-Whiteny U-test for continuous, asymmetric variables. P value &lt;0.05 will indicate a significance difference.
Efficacy to be analysed in both i) intention to treat: randomly assigned to treatment groups and received at least one dose of study treatment and ii) per-protocol: excluded patients who were major protocol violators. Protocol violators will include poor compliance with study drug dosing, 

Adaptive statistical analysis:
Adaptive increase in sample size will be performed if the results of interim analysis using data from the first 30 patients in each study are promising as per the methodology of Mehta and Pocock et al. (Statistics in medicine 2011;30:3267-84).. For PEGASUS 1, the maximum sample size will be 162 (n = 81 in each group). Sample size was calculated with two-tailed Fisher's Exact Test, assumes perampanel provides superior outcome, assumes 65% seizure free rate on levetiracetam and is able to detect greater than 20% absolute difference (using 80% power and type 1 error set at alpha 0.05).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine effectiveness of perampanel in the control of tumour associated epilepsy (TAE) in patients with grade II-III gliomas. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18-65 years and have a diagnosis of World Health Organisation grade II-III supratentorial glioma and have experienced a pre-operative seizure.

Study details
Patients will be randomized (allocated by chance) to receive perampanel, or levetiracetam for 52 weeks. Doses will be escalated over the first four week before patients enter an assessment phase for the remainder of the trial. The primary outcomes are i) proportion of patients seizure free for 6 or more months in the assessment phase and ii) time to first post-operative seizure in the assessment phase. Secondary endpoints include measures of drug safety, tolerability and quality of life. Glutamate concentrations will be measured before drug treatment is commenced to assess whether it can be utilized to predict both post-operative seizure and response to perampanel. 

This will be the first monotherapy epilepsy RCT utilizing perampanel. A positive study would support a larger randomized phase III trial examining perampanel monotherapy in tumour associated seizures. The novel use of 7T MRI to quantify glutamate offers the opportunity to assess if a non-invasive biomarker can help stratify seizure risk and perampanel response. This can pave the way for individualised and targeted epilepsy treatment.
