  <interventions>
    <interventions>Priligy (Dapoxetine Hydrochloride), internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention.

Arm 1: Priligy Only- At the initial consultation, 30mg will be prescribed to be used at each sexual encounter according to the manufacturer's instructions. Participants will be given the option of increasing their dosage to 60mg if required, which will be assessed at the second consultation by the medical practitioner. Participants can take the dose at their discretion (not according to a specific schedule) and are instructed to take the oral capsule 1 to 3 hours before sexual activity.  

Arm 2: CBT Program Only- Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy- 1 x 60 minutes per fortnight for 6 weeks. Online therapy sessions consist of 3 components: learning the 'stop-start' technique to control and/or delay his ejaculation, increase interpersonal communication and relationship factors, and unlimited email contact with a clinical psychologist to address issues of gaining/regaining confidence with their sexual performance, reducing performance anxiety, and addressing barriers with treatment. Each of the 3 modules build on the foundations of earlier modules, and are in a similar format: a list of goals to be achieved that module, communication exercises designed for the man to express his feelings about the program and relationship to his partner, information on the stop-start technique to delay ejaculation, and reminders of email contact with the psychologist. All modules concluded with a hurdle requirement which consisted of a list of statements that the man is required to agree with before they could continue. Once they passed the module, the man is provided with a password needed to access the next module.

Arm 3- Combination Treatment- Both Arm 1 and Arm 2 combined (i.e. the participant is required to partake in both Priligy and CBT treatment groups at the same time)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the following treatments for lifelong Premature Ejaculation (PE): (a) Priligy alone, (b) Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) alone, and (b) Combined Priligy and CBT. The effectiveness of the interventions will be measured by pre and post treatment measures including intra-vaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), distress, satisfaction with treatment, sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, self-esteem, self confidence, masculinity, and partner sexual dysfunction. It is expected that all three treatments will be effective, but that the combination therapy will be more effective than Priligy alone or CBT alone in improving all of the above variables.</summary>
