  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will perform 5 short (&lt;1 min) violin excerpts both before and after a randomly allocated warm-up or control protocol.  Participants will only be required to complete either the intervention or control protocols once. The intervention groups are: core muscle warm-up, general cardiovascular warm-up, or on-instrument warm-up; the control protocol is a 15 minute period of rest.  The core muscle warm-up consists of 15 minutes of low-impact exercises targeting the gluteals, abdominals, obliques, back, and shoulders (abdominal planks, gluteal bridges, lower body rotation, single-plane shoulder exercises), performed at a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 11-13. The general cardiovascular warm-up consists of a 15 minute walk at a RPE of 11-13. The participant will be required to perform 15 minutes worth of scalar warm-ups on the violin for the on-instrument warm-up.  16 electromyographic (EMG) electrodes will be attached throughout the performance of the excerpts and warm-ups to the left &amp; right upper trapezius, left &amp; right erector spinae, left &amp; right lower abdominals, left &amp; right upper abdominals, right pectoralis major, right anterior deltoid, right biceps brachii, right triceps brachii, right &amp; left forearm flexors, and right &amp; left forearm extensors.  Questionnaires regarding current warm-up habits and pain levels, as well as any changes in pain levels resulting from the warm-up interventions, will be administered before and after the performance of the warm-ups and excerpts. Both the pre- and post-warm-up performances of the excerpts will be audio recorded and independently and anonymously critiqued by selected Sydney Conservatorium of Music faculty and/or postgraduate students for comparative sound quality.

      <timepoint>Separate sessions following the initial sessions involving warm-up interventions and performance of the 5 violin excerpts. In these sessions, selected Sydney Conservatorium of Music faculty and/or postgraduate students will assess groups of randomly ordered, anonymously identified recordings of participant performances of assigned violin excerpts for comparative sound quality.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) between pre- and post-warm-up performances of violin excerpts.  RPE will be assessed by having the participant circle the number on the Borg scale (range from 6-20) corresponding to their perceived exertion during both their pre-warm-up and post-warm-up performances of the 5 excerpts.  RPE assessment will occur immediately following the performance of the 5th excerpt both at the pre- and post-warm-up timepoints. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in reported pain levels between pre- and post- warm-up performances of violin excerpts.  Participant pain levels will be assessed through pre-test and post-test questionnaires.</outcome>

    <concealment>Upon entry into the testing site, subjects will complete a brief questionnaire regarding their current pain levels and a 5 question validated self fitness assessment to determine current fitness levels. (from Stroyer, Jesper, et al. "Validity and reliability of self-assessed physical fitness using visual analogue scales 1." Perceptual and motor skills 104.2 (2007): 519-533.)

Using the results from these questionnaires, participants will be given one of the following 8 classifications:
Male, Fit, No Pain
Male, Fit, Pain
Male, Unfit, No Pain
Male, Unfit, Pain
Female, Fit, No Pain
Female, Fit, Pain 
Female, Unfit, No Pain
Female, Unfit, Pain

Warm-up group allocation will be randomly determined within each of these 8 categories using a sealed envelope containing group designation prepared by an independent off-site assistant.</concealment>
    <sequence>Envelopes containing randomly ordered (randomisation via Microsoft Excel) treatment designations will be created off-site by non-study personnel for each of the 8 participant classifications. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis conducted with the G*Power 3.1 computer program and using the results of previous warm-up interventions in electromyographic research with athletes indicated a subject size of 14 per group to be necessary to gain significant results.(1-3)   Given this, 60 total subjects (15 per group) will be recruited to provide a buffer for any data collection and/or unforseen errors.

After testing, SPSS will be used to conduct means comparison, ANOVA, and linear regression tests between the pre- and post-intervention EMG, heart rate, sound quality, and questionnaire response data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Warming up is considered an integral part of pre-performance preparation in sport and music, and yet little information exists on how to best prepare to play. As such, this study will investigate the effects of core muscle, general cardiovascular, and on-instrument warm-ups on upper extremity and core muscle activity during violin performance.  Additionally, the effects of the three warm-ups on participant audible performance quality will be analysed.  It is predicted that both the use of warm-up and the mode undertaken will have a variable positive effect on muscle activity and sound quality.</summary>
