  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an extension to a previous research trial testing SABER-Bupivacaine (an experimental
      pain-relieving medication). The purpose of this extension trial is to assess whether
      treatment with SABER-Bupivacaine or SABER-Placebo has had any effect on healing of the
      participant's shoulder, wound, or the skin near their scar. This trial will also assess
      safety (side effects).</summary>
