  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 6-month, randomised controlled trial in which participants with type 2 diabetes will participate in a progressive resistance training program (termed Lift for Life) and receive a daily protein enriched drink and vitamin D supplements for 6 months. The Lift for Life program is an individually tailored and supervised group-based community-based program in which participants undertake progressive resistance training twice a week for the first 8 weeks and then three times each week thereafter. Each session will last 45-60 minutes and target all major muscle groups. Participants will perform 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions at a weight that cannot be lifted for more than 8-10 repetitions. Training will be made progressively more challenging by incorporating the principle of progressive overload (increments of 2-10% weekly). All training is supervised by accredited Lift for Life exercise trainers. To increase protein intake and vitamin D status, participants will be asked to consume a protein enriched drink each day that will contain approximately 20 g of protein and take two 1000 IU vitamin D3 capsules daily for the duration of the study. On the training days, participants will also be asked to consume a second protein enriched drink after training. Exercise logs and completed exercise cards regularly checked by the trainers will be used to monitor exercise adherence. Adherence to the drinks will be monitored using a daily calendar and counting any remaining drinks at 3 and 6 months. Compliance to the supplements will be monitored by a capsule count from bottles returned at 3 and 6 months. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the active control group will also undertake the same progressive resistance training program (Lift for Life) as those in the intervention group, but will not receive an energy matched placebo drink or placebo tablets. </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants who are eligible and registered to commence participation in the Lift for Life resistance training program will be invited to participate in this study. Participants may be referred to the program from their doctor or may respond to local advertisements about the program. Eligible participants will then be screened further to ensure they fulfill the inclusion criteria for this study. All participants must receive approval from their local physician prior to participating in the program. Randomisation will be at the level of the individual participant (ID), stratified by gender and diabetes treatment (diet or oral hypoglycaemic agents), using a computer-generated random number sequence by an independent researcher not involved in the study. The assignment will be blinded to the investigators  involved in all testing so that they will be unaware of the group assignment.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis using Stata (version 11). Wherever possible, we will obtain endpoint measures from all withdrawals and include all randomised subjects in our final ITT analysis. Time, group and group-by-time interactions will be examined using linear mixed regression models. Potential covariates to be included in the model will include: age, sex, race/ethnicity, changes in medication and change in habitual physical activity or diet.

Based on our previous data from progressive resistance training studies in people with type 2 diabetes and work of others that have assessed the independent or combined effects of protein, vitamin D and resistance training on the main outcome measures, we estimate that 168 participants would provide 90% power (P&lt;0.05 two-tailed) to detect a 0.5% absolute difference for the change in HbA1c levels between the groups, assuming a conservative SD of 1.1%. For insulin sensitivity, a sample size of 140 would be required to detect a 0.7 difference for the change in HOMA-2 IR between the groups at a power of 90%, assuming a conservative SD of 1.2. To compensate for a projected 20% drop-out, a total of 202 participants will be recruited into the study and randomised 1:1 to the two groups (101 per group). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lifestyle factors such as exercise and diet remains the cornerstone in the management of type 2 diabetes. Progressive resistance training is one mode of exercise that can improve glycaemic control and other metabolic risk factors that contribute to the development of diabetes complications. Whether diet and exercise combined can have added benefits remains unknown. In non-diabetic adults, high protein diets can enhance the benefits of resistance training on muscle mass and strength. There is also evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, which can be improved with treatment. This study builds upon our current community-based resistance training program, titled Lift for Life (L4L), to examine whether post-exercise ingestion of a protein enriched drink and vitamin D can enhance the benefits of resistance training on glycaemic control, body composition and cardiometabolic health in adults with type 2 diabetes. This study is important as the findings will underpin more precise exercise and nutrition guidelines for the management of glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes, along with the ongoing refinement of community-based initiatives for the management of this condition.</summary>
