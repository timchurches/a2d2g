  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Size of Geographic Atrophy Lesion Area in the Study Eye - Change from baseline in size of geographic atrophy lesion area in the study eye is based on fundus photography as read by an independent Reading Center. Photographs are taken with a specialized microscope with an attached camera to photograph the interior of the eye, including the retina and optic disc. A positive change from baseline indicates an increase in size of geographic atrophy lesion area (worsening; disease progression). Data are reported in disc area where 1 disc area = 2.54 millimeters squared (mm^2).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement and a negative change from baseline indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 24 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Contrast Sensitivity in the Study Eye - Change from baseline in contrast sensitivity in the study eye is measured using a Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity chart at 1 meter. The contrast sensitivity chart contains letters that are darkest at the top and then get progressively lighter. Scores range from 0 to 48 and are based on the number of letters read correctly. A negative change from baseline indicates a worsening in contrast sensitivity and a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 24 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Reading Speed in the Study Eye - Change from baseline in reading speed in the study eye is assessed using modified Bailey-Lovie word charts. Patients read the chart for 2 minutes and the numbers of words read correctly per minute are totaled. An increase in the number of words read correctly indicates an improvement and a decrease in the number of words read correctly indicates a worsening.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stage 1 is a patient-masked, dose-escalation, safety evaluation of brimonidine intravitreal
      implant. Patients will receive implant in one eye and "sham" treatment (meaning no treatment)
      in the fellow eye. Stage 2 will begin after 1 month of safety has been evaluated for Stage 1.
      Stage 2 is a randomized, double-masked, dose-response, sham-controlled evaluation of the
      safety and efficacy of brimonidine intravitreal implant in patients with geographic atrophy
      from age-related macular degeneration. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years.</summary>
