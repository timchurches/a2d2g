  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Drisapersen

Experimental: Open label - continuous SC - Continuous SC injections. Subjects will receive drisapersen via SC injections at a dose of 6 mg/kg weekly

Experimental: Open label - intermittent SC - Intermittent SC injections. Subjects will receive drisapersen via SC injections at a dose of 6 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks off treatment, and will then repeat these cycles.

Experimental: Open label - continuous IV - Continuous IV injections. Subjects will receive drisapersen via IV infusions at a dose of 3 or 6 mg/kg weekly


Treatment: drugs: Drisapersen
Subjects will receive 6 mg/kg of drisapersen by subcutaneous injection once weekly. If subjects have experienced an intolerable injection site reaction(s), in consultation with the investigator, the subject may be allowed intermittent injections (8 weeks on/4 weeks off) or weekly intravenous infusions of 3 or 6 mg/kg

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Any subject who has been previously treated with an exon 51 skipping antisense
             oligonucleotide (drisapersen or eteplirsen) and is not eligible for another ongoing
             drisapersen study. Subjects who withdrew from the previous studies due to meeting
             laboratory safety stopping criteria may be eligible to enroll if:

          2. The laboratory parameters that led to stopping have resolved; benefit of further
             treatment with drisapersen outweighs the risk to the individual subject; and following
             consultation with the Medical Monitor.

          3. Subjects with DMD mutation/deletion within the dystrophin gene and correctable by
             drisapersen-induced DMD exon 51 skipping.

          4. Male subjects age &gt;5 at screening in whom the investigator considers treatment with
             drisapersen is likely to lead to improvement or prevent worsening of the condition.

          5. Continued use of glucocorticoids for a minimum of 60 days prior to study entry with a
             reasonable expectation that the subject will remain on glucocorticoids for the
             duration of this study. Changes to or cessation of glucocorticoids will be at the
             discretion of the investigator conducting this study in consultation with the
             subject/parent and Medical Monitor.

          6. Willing and able to comply with all study requirements and procedures (with the
             exception of those assessments requiring a subject to be ambulant, for those subjects
             who have lost ambulation).

          7. Able to give informed assent and/or consent in writing by the subject and/or
             parent(s)/legal guardian (according to local regulations)</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>5</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>80</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Male</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. Subjects who have previously been treated with drisapersen and who had a serious
             adverse experience or who met safety stopping criteria that remains unresolved, which
             in the opinion of the investigator could have been attributable to drisapersen. Once
             resolved, subject may be eligible to enter the study following investigator
             consultation with the Medical Monitor.

          2. Use of anticoagulants, anti-thrombotics or antiplatelet agents within 28 days of the
             first re-dosing of drisapersen. Chronic use of anticoagulants, anti-thrombotics or
             antiplatelet agents is prohibited during the study. As needed dosing (pro re nata -
             PRN) may be acceptable (except for aspirin) following discussion with the Medical
             Monitor.

          3. Participation in any investigational clinical trial within 3 months prior to start or
             during this study (except for other drisapersen studies). If subjects have
             participated in any other study within the last 6 months this should be discussed with
             the Medical Monitor prior to start of this study.

          4. History of significant medical disorder which may confound the interpretation of
             safety data (e.g. current or history of renal or liver disease/impairment, history of
             inflammatory illness)

          5. Symptomatic cardiomyopathy. If subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45%
             at start of this study, the investigator should discuss inclusion of subject in this
             study with the Medical Monitor.

          6. A platelet count under the lower limit of normal (LLN) at start of this study. A
             re-test is possible at a later stage, and if within normal range, the subject may
             enter the study.</exclusivecriteria>
