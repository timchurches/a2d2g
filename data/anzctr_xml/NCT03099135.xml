Other: Odalasvir and AL-335 With or Without Simeprevir - Participants who completed the LPVPS (Phase 2 or Phase 3 study), in which they received a regimen containing Odalasvir and AL-335 With or Without Simeprevir for the treatment of HCV infection, and who agree to participate in this follow-up study will be assessed for durability of SVR, incidence of late viral relapse, presence and long term-persistence of resistance associated substitutions (RAS) and liver disease status.


Treatment: drugs: No Treatment
No treatment will be given tp participants during this follow-up study of previous phase II and Phase III in which they have received Odalavir and AL-335 with or without Simeprevir.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Maintaining Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) Until the End of the Long-Term Follow-Up - Participants maintained SVR if HCV RNA less than (&lt;) lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) (Detected or Not Detected) per timepoint in this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Late Viral Relapse Among Participants who Achieved SVR at Last Post-Therapy Visit of Parent Study (LPVPS) - Late viral relapse is defined as: participants who achieved SVR at LPVPS but have confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to (&gt;=) LLOQ during follow-up in this study. SVR at LPVPS is defined as participants who achieved SVR12 in the parent study, and maintained HCV RNA&lt;LLOQ until LPVPS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Liver Disease Status in All Participants who Achieved or did not Achieve SVR at LPVPS - Liver disease status will be evaluated using child pugh assessment score and laboratory tests including aspartate amino transferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and Metavir. Child Pugh score includes 5 clinical measures: 1) Encephalopathy grade, 2) Ascites, 3) Serum bilirubin, 4) Serum albumin, 5) Prothrombin time for assessing status of liver disease. Each measure is scored 1 to 3, with 3 indicating most severe derangement. The individual item scores will be summed to yield total score ranging from 5 to 15. Child-Pugh A (mild): 5-6 points, Child-Pugh B (moderate): 7-9 points, and Child-Pugh C (severe): 10-15 points.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
