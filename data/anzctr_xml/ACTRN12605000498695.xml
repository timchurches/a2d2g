    <exclusivecriteria>Premenopausal patientsLocally advanced diseasePrior systemic hormone or chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancerNo other investigational systemic drugs within 1 month of therapyPatients who have received aromatase inhibitors as part of adjuvant therapy and have developed metastatic disease within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapyPatients who are anti-coagulated e.g. on warfarinPatients who are already receiving celecoxib, rofecoxib or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, lithium, glucocorticoids, diuretics, ACE inhibitors or fluconazole. Low dose aspirin may be taken for cardiovascular prophylaxis, but these patients should be monitored closely for any gastrointestinal complications.  Patients with newly diagnosed cerebral metastases. Previously treated, asymptomatic cerebral metastases are acceptableOther concurrent or prior malignancies except curatively treated carcinoma of the cervix and non-melanoma skin cancer or patients with any previous who have had no recurrent disease for 5 years or where the prior cancer was contralateral breast cancerPatients who have a known hypersensitivity to celecoxib or any other component of celecoxib, or patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin, other NSAIDs or sulpha drugs such as the sulphonamides. Patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or a history of NSAID induced ulcer.  Patients with a past history of a previous ulcer (other than the above causes) may be included at the discretion of the investigator but should be on a proton pump inhibitor.Patients with other concomitant severe systemic disease such as cardiac failure or myocardial infarction within the previous 3 months, uncontrolled hypertension (BP&gt;150/100) or arrhythmia, renal disease, hepatic failure or respiratory disease.</exclusivecriteria>
