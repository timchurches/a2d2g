      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score - The HAQ-DI assesses the difficulty a participant has had in the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question, level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The score for each domain is the maximum (worst) score from the items/questions within the domain. Higher score indicates greater disability.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Psoriasis (PGA-PsO) Response - The PGA-PsO is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are rated separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale, scored as 0=none; 1, 2, 3, or 4=most severe. The severity rating scores are summed and the average taken; the total average is rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine a PGA-PsO score on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).</outcome>

Lesion severity is assessed for erythema, induration, &amp; scaling, evaluated separately for head &amp; neck, upper limbs, trunk, &amp; lower limbs &amp; rated for each body area according to a 5 point scale: 0=no involvement; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=very marked. BSA involvement is the extent (%) of body area affected by psoriasis &amp; is assigned a score: 0=no involvement; 1=0-9%; 2=10-29%; 3=30-49%; 4=50-69%; 5=70-89%; 6=90-100%. In each area, sum of severity rating scores is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of numbers obtained for the 4 body areas is the PASI score &amp; can vary in increments of 0.1 &amp; range from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores represent greater severity of psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI.</outcome>

Higher score indicates greater degree of tenderness.</outcome>

Standard vertical 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual's rating for their current health-related quality of life state, with a higher value representing better health status.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scores: Total Score - FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire, with each item scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Three endpoints are derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score (range 0 to 52) is calculated by summing the 13 items. FACIT-F experience domain score (range 0-20) is calculated by summing 5 items : I feel fatigued, I feel weak all over, I feel listless ("washed out"), I feel tired, and I have energy, while FACIT-F impact domain score (range 0-32) is calculated by summing the remaining 8 items. All responses are added with equal weight to obtain the total score. Higher scores represent better fatigue status.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Scores Evaluating Spondylitis Using the Bath Anklyosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) - BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participants with ankylosing spondylitis. Utilizing a visual analog scale of 0-100mm (0=none and 100=very severe) participants answer 6 questions measuring discomfort, pain, and fatigue. The final BASDAI score averages the individual assessments for a final score ranging 0-10cm, with higher scores representing more severe ankylosing spondylitis disease activity.</outcome>
