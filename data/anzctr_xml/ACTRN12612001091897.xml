  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will have pupil diameters measured using an infrared video pupillometer, and then have one drop of either a) tropicamide 1% alone, b) tropicamide 1% and phenylephrine 2.5% a few seconds apart, or c) cyclopentolate 1% and phenylephrine 2.5% a few seconds apart, instilled into one eye. 
After an appropriate delay to allow action of the mydriatic agent (30 minutes except for cyclopentolate = 60 minutes), pupillometry will be performed again.
All participants except group c) (the 'control' group) will return the following day to have pupillometry performed again, then one drop each of cyclopentolate 1% and phenylephrine 2.5% will be instilled, and pupillometry repeated after 60 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control subjects will have their post-dilation pupil size measured without having had mydriatic drops used the previous day.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pupil diameter post-dilation will be measured using an infrared video pupillometer (Neuroptics PLR 200).</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 minutes, except for those who received cyclopentolate 1%, who will have pupil diameter measured at 60 minutes</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase in pupil diameter post-dilation will be calculated by subtracting pre-dilation pupil diameter (measured by infrared video pupillometer) from post-dilation pupil diameter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 minutes</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be enrolled from those patients being seen at the Dunedin Hospital Eye Department, and will be allocated at random to one of two groups: a control group who will receive mydriatic drops on the study day only, and not be required to return the next day, and a 'treatment' group who will receive one of two combinations of mydriatic drops on the study day, and be required to return the following day for a further round of mydriatic drops. Allocation will not be concealed.</concealment>
