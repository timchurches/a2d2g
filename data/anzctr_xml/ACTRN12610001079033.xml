    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from advertisements in the media and from flyers within medical clinics seeing patients  suffering from depression. All participants will have voluntarily provided their telephone details before being contacted by the Research Unit. Participants will initially be contacted by telephone by researchers working on the study. They will be assessed with regards to their suitability to be involved in the study. Those who are deemed suitable will be mailed the participant information sheet to read at their leisure. Those patients who wish to participate will be instructed to contact the Trial Co-ordinator to arrange a visit to the Women's Health  Research Program, Monash University , The Alfred Centre, for a screening visit.

    <summary>The Primary Aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of transdermal testosterone therapy on sexual function over 3 months in women at midlife being treated for depression with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) who are experiencing at least one of: loss of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorder or delayed orgasm/anorgasmia for which they desire treatment Study hypothesis Transdermal testosterone, compared with placebo, will result in a clinically meaningful improvement in the total score of the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self Rating Scale indicating improvement in sexual dysfunction secondary to the use of SSRI/SNRI medication .</summary>
