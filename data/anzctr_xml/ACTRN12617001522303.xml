  <interventions>
    <interventions>Manual lymphatic drainage massage is a light but very specific massage therapy designed to reduce lymph swelling by stimulating lymphatic drainage. The therapist, Angela Balinski, is trained in the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system and the safe use of MLD to facilitate lymph drainage of the vessels. 
The non-thermal laser treatment is used to treat acute and chronic pain, and to relieve swelling and inflammation, all symptoms associated with lipedema and lymphoedema. The laser is applied to the hard, painful areas of the affected limb to increase the softness of the tissue, thereby increasing the amount of fluid that can move out of tissue. Again, the therapist is trained in the application of the laser device. The low-level laser device to be used in this study (model LTU-904; Serial Number L20541) is manufactured by Riancorp Pty Ltd, Henley beach South Australia.  It is approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (AUST R 163516) as a class 11a medical device. The device is a portable rechargeable battery powered unit. It emits a 904-nanometer beam. The average output is 5 milliwatts. The laser goes to a 2 cm depth and 2 cm width. Points of pain or fibrosis or scarring are treated by applying the beam for one minute per point. 
The trial is designed as a single-blind, randomised, controlled n-of-1 trial. The trial participant will attend weekly clinic sessions for eight weeks. Weeks 1 and 8 will be assessment sessions. Weeks 2-7 are one hour treatment clinics where the participant will receive either manual lymphatic drainage massage (MLD) for 30 minutes plus active laser therapy for 10 minutes or MLD (30 minutes) plus placebo laser therapy (10 minutes). The six treatment sessions are divided into 3 active laser sessions and 3 placebo laser sessions according to the randomisation plan prepared by an independent statistician. All laser sessions (both active and placebo) are accompanied by MLD treatment. Each weekly clinic session will be separated by a one-week washout.
One participant will be recruited from the body of patients in Ms Angela Balinskis complementary medicine practice.  All clinic sessions will be conducted at Ms Balinski's practice premises.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo therapy consists of the laser device without power. The indicator light will be covered to avoid power detection. As the laser device is non-thermal, the participant should detect no difference in the application of either the active or non-active therapy. </comparator>

    <concealment> The participant in this N-of-1 trial will receive both active and placebo laser therapy. Blinding is achieved by (1) masking of the power indicator light on the device; (2) the lack of heat generated by the non-thermal device in both the active and inactive modes; and (3) the application of the identical procedures during both active and placebo phases.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be generated by a statistical software package (Stata) and conducted by an independent academic researcher who is not associated with the study. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>The power of an n-of-1 trial is achieved through comparison of multiple exposures of the treatments.  The minimum number of exposures required for an N-of-1 trial is two, this trial has three exposures and withdrawals (placebo condition), which increases the validity of the findings. The sequence will take the form of an AB BA AB design with a 1 week washout period between each phase.  </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>As per the n-of-1 design, one participant will be recruited to the trial. Unlike conventional group RCTs, group sample size and associated statistical power are not as relevant in n-of-1 trials as the trials are not designed to show statistical differences between groups.  Indeed, there is no need to control for the type I or type II error in the current trial, as it is not designed to show a statistical difference. The power of an n-of-1 trial is achieved through comparison of multiple exposures of the treatments.  The minimum number of exposures required for an N-of-1 trial is two, this trial has three exposures and withdrawals (placebo condition), which increases the validity of the findings.

The primary method of analysing the data will be by systematic visual graphing of the pain scales (i.e. the daily 100mm VAS and weekly UPAT). This method is recommended by the CONSORT Collaboration, Extension for N-of-1 Trials (CENT).The primary research question is whether pain is reduced for the patient, which will be evident from the patients reports on which intervention worked best, and reinforced by the visual graph. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to assess whether manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) with non-thermal laser is more effective than MLD alone for reducing pain and swelling in a 43-year old female patient with bilateral lipedema-like symptoms of the legs.

The trial is designed as a single-blind, randomised, controlled n-of-1 trial. The trial participant will attend weekly clinic sessions for eight weeks. Weeks 1 and 8 will be assessment sessions. Weeks 2-7 are treatment clinics where the participant will receive either manual lymphatic drainage massage (MLD) plus active laser therapy or MLD plus placebo laser therapy in a randomised sequence. The placebo therapy consists of the laser device without power.</summary>
