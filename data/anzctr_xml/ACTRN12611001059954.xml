    <concealment>Randomization was performed using a computer based random number generator in permutated blocks of varying sizes and the assignment entered in sealed envelopes that were not opened till informed consent was obtained. The drug was mixed and administered by a nurse who took no further part in the study. The patient, parent, anesthesiologist, observer gathering data and nurses taking care of the patient in the preoperative period remained blinded to the group assignment.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>80 children  aged from 2-5 years scheduled for surgery in lower limb were prepared for spinal anesthesia. Children were classified into two groups, Group 1 (40 children) received intravenous 10 mcg/Kg granisetron diluted in 10 ml saline 0.9% and Group 2 (40 children) received intravenous 10 ml 0.9% saline to be given over 5 minutes just before spinal puncture. Shivering, core temperature levels of motor and sensory block were assessed.</summary>
