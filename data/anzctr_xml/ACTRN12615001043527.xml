    <interventions>Volunteers will be given an information sheet outlining the requirements for participation in the study.  Volunteers will also have the opportunity to ask any questions pertaining to the study and once satisfied will sign a consent form.  Participants will then fill in a General Health and Physical Activity questionnaire, and the researcher will record their height, weight, dominant leg and age on this questionnaire.
Participants will be informed that 2 taping conditions will be assessed, without differentiating which tape is the experimental condition and randomly allocated to the order in which they receive the conditions: no tape, experimental tape (Dynamic Tape (trademark)), placebo tape (Dynamic Tape (trademark)), or; no tape, placebo tape, experimental tape.
Surface EMG electrodes will be applied to the self-nominated dominant leg of the participant. EMG will measure the recruitment of gluteus medius, gluteus maximus and tensor fascia latae. Skin preparation and electrode placement protocol will be applied according to internationally recognised guidelines (Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM)).
Wireless EMG sensors (Wave PLUS 16 Ch, Commeta Systems, Italy) will be attached to each electrode, with data sampled at 2000 Hz. EMG signals will be adjusted for direct current offset, full wave rectification and filtered with a high pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off of 20 Hz. Each stride will be time normalised to 100 data points and data normalised to the maximum signal magnitude during the running phase of the no-tape condition. For each stride the mean and peak amplitude for stance and swing phase will be obtained.

Assessment 1 - Baseline
A blinded assessor will use 3D motion analysis (Vicon from Oxford Metrics, UK) to assess joint kinematics, applying a cluster model outlined by Besier et al. (2003). Retro-reflective markers will be fixed to the participant using double-sided tape and secured using hypoallergenic adhesive tape (Fixomull, Smith &amp; Nephew). Marker locations include; anterior superior iliac spine, posterior superior iliac spine, 3-marker cluster on the long axis of the femur and tibia, lateral and medial malleolus, calcaneus, first and fifth metatarsal head.
 A static trial will be conducted to ensure the proper functioning of both the EMG electrodes and Vicon markers. The participant will then walk on the treadmill at a self-selected pace for 5 minutes to warm up.
To assess muscle recruitment and joint kinematics, the participant will walk on a treadmill at a self-selected pace for 3 minutes, where EMG and Vicon measures will be recorded continuously from 90 sec - 150 sec. The participant will then increase the treadmill to a self-selected running pace for 3 minutes, where EMG and Vicon measures will be recorded during the same interval. The self-selected walking and running paces will be recorded and used for all further treadmill assessments. 
At the conclusion of baseline assessments, the first taping condition will be applied. To minimise error, EMG electrodes and Vicon markers will remain in situ throughout the trial.

Assessment 2. Taping condition 1 or 2
Taping condition: Experimental tape Two parallel double-layered lengths of 7.5cm width elastic tape (Dynamic Tape (trademark)) will be applied as a spiral technique to the hip and thigh with the participant positioned (standing) in maximal combined hip extension, abduction and external rotation. The tape will commence on the anteromedial aspect of the distal thigh approximately 10cm above the medial joint line of the knee. It will extend superiorly in a posterolateral direction, and travel behind the mid thigh to surface on the anteromedial aspect of the proximal thigh. As the tape continues in a proximal direction it will pass inferior and posterior to the greater trochanter and finish on the iliac crest of the contralateral limb. As per the manufacturers recommendations, an anchor point of &gt; 4 inches proximally and distally will have no tension applied to the tape (to minimise skin irritation) while the rest of the tapes length will be stretched to the onset of its resistance only. 
Participants will be given warnings regarding the potential for skin reactions to tape.  In addition their skin will be monitored by the researchers throughout the test procedure and the tape will be immediately removed if any adverse effects are demonstrated.  Following application of the tape the walking and running assessments will be repeated following the protocol that was used for the baseline assessments. The participants previously selected pace for the walk and run will be used during this assessment.
At the completion of the running phase, participants will have the taping condition removed and perform a washout walk (90 sec) and run (90 sec), with Vicon and EMG recordings taken continuously from (15 sec - 75 sec) during both walk and run phases. 

Assessment 3.  Taping condition 2 or 1
Taping condition: Placebo tape  The placebo taping technique is identical to the experimental taping technique except that the tape will be applied with no stretch and in neutral standing position in order to minimise its biomechanical influence during gait.
Following application of the second taping condition the walking and running assessments will be repeated following the protocol that was used for the baseline assessments.
All tape applications and test sessions will be supervised by a physiotherapist and/or exercise physiologist/biomechanist trained in the use of the techniques and equipment.

    <concealment>Female volunteers will be recruited from a convenience sample of staff and students at Australian Catholic University, Sydney.  Flyers containing information about the study will be placed around ACU campuses asking interested persons fitting the inclusion criteria (healthy females &gt; 18 years of age) to contact the researchers by phone or email for more information about the study. 
Once initial contact is made, potential volunteers will be screened by telephone as to their eligibility for inclusion in the study and a time agreed upon for them to participate in the trial.  Eligible volunteers will be provided with an information sheet thoroughly explaining the study and informed written consent to participate in the study will be obtained before the test session commences
Once enrolled in the study the participant will be assigned a pre-allocated number generated by a computer randomisation program denoting the sequence in which they will receive the two conditions.  Being a crossover design all participants will receive all conditions however they will not be informed which taping technique is the experimental condition.  The physiotherapist applying the taping techniques will have access to the allocation schedule however allocation will be concealed from the outcome assessor at all times.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer generated randomisation program will be used to randomise the participants into the two conditions. Condition 1 will have the placebo tape assessed first, followed by Dynamic Tape (trademark). Condition 2 will have Dynamic Tape (trademark) assessed first, followed by the placebo tape. An unblinded researcher will have access to the group allocation for each participant, and will be responsible for the application and removal of each tape throughout the trial. This researcher will conduct the initial briefing, but will have no role in participant assessment or analysis of results. The participant will be informed that the study is analysing the effects of 2 different types of tapes, without differentiating which tape will be the experimental condition.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Abnormal hip biomechanics during walking and running are considered a risk factor for the development of lower limb musculoskeletal conditions such as patellofemoral pain and non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries. These injuries have a higher reported incidence in females which may be attributed, in part, to their relatively higher hip adduction and knee abduction angles than male counterparts.  Altered recruitment of the muscles controlling hip abduction and femoral rotation may also contribute, potentially causing dysfunction further down the kinetic chain at the knee, and foot/ankle and predisposing to injury.
Elastic taping techniques are a relatively recent and popular modality used by clinicians to modify hip position and motion during gait.  
Unlike rigid therapeutic tapes, these new elastic tapes propose to have viscoelastic properties which provide mechanical assistance to joint motion and muscle activity, hence enabling the restoration of normal joint kinematics.  No scientific study however has evaluated the effectiveness of elastic taping at the hip joint.  This project aims to evaluate the effects of a novel elastic tape (Dynamic Tape (trademark)) on lower limb kinematics and hip muscle recruitment in healthy females.  We hypothesize that the experimental elastic tape will produce greater change in lower limb joint range of motion and hip muscle recruitment when compared with a placebo elastic tape and no-tape control condition.</summary>
