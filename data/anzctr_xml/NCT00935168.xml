    <inclusivecriteria>-  Written informed consent has been obtained or if not possible, the procedure for
             obtaining informed consent has been approved by the ethics committee.

          -  Fluid resuscitation is required to increase or maintain intravascular volume that is
             in addition to maintenance fluids, enteral and parenteral nutrition, blood products
             and specific replacement fluids to replace ongoing insensible or fluid losses from
             other sites (e.g., fistula losses from the gastrointestinal tract, urinary losses from
             diabetes insipidus or the polyuric phase of acute renal failure or to correct
             metabolic derangements).

          -  The ICU clinician considers that both 6% hydroxyethyl starch (130/0.4) and saline are
             equally appropriate for the patient and that no specific indication or
             contraindication for either exists.

          -  The requirement for fluid resuscitation must be supported by AT LEAST ONE of the
             following clinical signs:

               1. Heart rate &gt; 90 beats per minute

               2. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 100mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt; 75mmHg
                  or at least 40mmHg decrease in SBP or MAP from the baseline recording

               3. Central venous pressure &lt; 10mmHg

               4. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure &lt; 12 mmHg

               5. Respiratory variation in systolic or mean arterial blood pressure of &gt;5 mmHg

               6. Capillary refill time &gt; one second

               7. Urine output &lt; 0.5 ml/kg for one hour</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Previous allergic reaction to hydroxyethyl starch solution.

          -  Primary non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage or severe traumatic intracranial
             haemorrhage (mass lesion &gt; 25 ml).

          -  Patients who are receiving renal replacement therapy or in whom the ICU physician
             considers renal replacement therapy is imminent (i.e. renal replacement therapy will
             start in 6 hours)

          -  Patients with documented serum creatinine value = 350Âµmol/L and urine output averaging
             = 10ml / hr over 12 hours

          -  Severe hypernatraemia (Serum sodium &gt; 160 mmol/l) or severe hyperchloraemia (Serum
             chloride &gt; 130 mmol/l).

          -  Women of child bearing age (18-49 years old), unless evidence of documented menopause,
             hysterectomy or surgical sterilisation or negative pregnancy test before randomisation

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  Patients who have received &gt; 1000mL hydroxyethyl starch in the 24 hours before
             randomization.

          -  Patients admitted to the ICU following cardiac surgery; patients admitted to ICU
             following cardiac surgery.

          -  Patients admitted to the ICU for the treatment of burns or following liver
             transplantation surgery.

          -  Death is deemed imminent and inevitable or the patient has an underlying disease
             process with a life expectancy of &lt; 90 days.

          -  A limitation of therapy order has been documented restricting implementation of the
             study protocol or the treating clinician deems aggressive care unsuitable.

          -  Patient has previously been enrolled in the CHEST study.

          -  Patient has previously received fluid resuscitation that was prescribed within the
             study ICU during this current ICU admission.

          -  Patient has been transferred to the study ICU from another ICU and received fluid
             resuscitation for the treatment of volume depletion in that other ICU.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether patients in the Intensive Care Unit who receive
      fluid resuscitation with either hydroxyethyl starch (a synthetic colloid solution) or saline
      (a salt solution), have an increased rate of survival at 90 days.</summary>
