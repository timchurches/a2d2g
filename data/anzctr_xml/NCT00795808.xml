  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>1. Metformin increases the pregnancy rate when added to the standard treatment of
           anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

        2. Metformin in combination with clomiphene, is more effective than clomiphene alone or
           metformin alone improves fertility outcomes in women with PCOS of reasonably healthy
           body weight (BMI &lt;/= 32).

        3. Metformin improves fertility outcomes in women with BMI &gt; 32 with PCOS.</summary>
