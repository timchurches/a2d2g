    <designfeatures>This three-armed trial examines the following aims regarding prevention of SSI:
1. The non-inferiority (followed by potential superiority) of povidone-iodine + 70% ethanol compared with chlorhexidine 0.5% + 70% ethanol.
2. The superiority of povidone-iodine + 70% ethanol compared to 10% aqueous povidone-iodine. 
NB from 12 December 2016 the Chlorhexidine arm will change to a 2% concentration with 70% alcohol.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This trial will be structured with two comparisons driving the sample size, statistical power and non-inferiority margin. The first comparison will be an non-inferiority trial between the chlorhexidine+alcohol and povidone-iodine+alcohol preparations. Using an expected rate of infection of 15% in the povidone-iodine+alcohol arm, a clinically significant difference in infection that would influence the choice between the 2 preparations is 4% (non-inferiority margin). This would be demonstrable with 80% power and 95% significance with 990 patients in each arm. If this number is used for the third arm of the trial (10% aqueous povidone-iodine vs 10% povidone-iodine +70% alcohol solution) it would provide sufficient power to detect a difference of 5% (i.e. 15% in povidone-iodine chlorhexidine+alcohol and 20% in the aqueous povidone-iodine group), in line with the effect described in the largest previous trial (Darouiche et al) at a power of 80% and 95% significance. Hence, we propose a recruitment target of 2970, which implies 3300 to be recruited to allow for approximately 10% dropout.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgical site infections are one of the most common infections that a person may acquire in hospital, and can increase the length of stay and the cost of the surgery by up to 5 times. This is a burden on the person and the community. By preventing infections in surgical sites it is hoped that a persons health will be better after an operation.
With any surgical procedure, the skin at the operation site is routinely cleansed with an antiseptic solution. This skin cleansing solution aims to reduce the number of germs (microorganisms) present on the skin and therefore reduce the chance of the surgical wound becoming infected.
It is not known whether one skin antiseptic is better than the other at preventing infection, so the Research Team would like to see if there is a difference between 3 commonly used, approved skin disinfectants. The solutions are used world-wide for disinfecting the skin in surgical procedures.
