  <interventions>
    <interventions>PHiD-CV given as per the Northern Territory infant immunization schedule. Child is not observed for any set period of time. Observation consist of the bronchoscopy alveolar lavage results at the time-point when the procedure is undertaken for clinical purposes and not for research purposes. Thus there is no time limit of the observation period as the bronchoscopy is undertaken when the paediatrician (not related to the study) deemed the procedure is necessary</interventions>

      <outcome>In subgroup where blood could be collected, secondary outcomes are cytokine levels from PBMC stimulation using PHA (Phytohemagglutanin) for adaptive responses (72 hours post stimulation)</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Vaccine effectiveness will be calculated from the number children who have had PHiD-CV with clinically important levels of NTHi will be compared to those who have not had PHiD-CV with clinically important levels of NTHi.

Comparisons between groups will consist of subjects vs. total controls (Brisbane and NT children). 

Subanalysis will be performed comparing subjects with 
(a)  NT controls only, and 
(b)  Brisbane contemporaneous controls

Total number of children in study is expected to be &gt;300 which comprises of at least 79 children who have received at least one dose of PHiD-CV. Our main comparison will be between the cohort of NT children with and without PHiD-CV immunization. We currently have BAL data (2007-2010) from 80 children (who have not had PHiD-CV) in the NT and 50% of these children have NTHi in their BAL. We expect to collect BAL from a further children from NT who have had various number of PHiD-CV doses. 

Assuming a 45% reduction in the proportion of children who have NTHi in their BAL post PHiD-CV, the study provides 88% power (5% level of significance), if we have a minimum of 221 children. However, we will continue to enroll children until the end of 2014 and expect an approximated sample size of 250 (children vaccinated with PHiD-CV and controls). 

In the subgroup with blood available, cytokine profile from PBMC stimulation will be compared between groups using unpaired T-tests or MannWhitney U test</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of our study are to:
1. Determine the frequency of NTHi infection (defined by &gt;10E4 cfu/ml BAL) in the lower airways of children who have received PHiD-CV;
2. Determine the frequency of NTHi carriage in the upper airways of children who have received PHiD-CV; and
3. Evaluate the influence of PHiD-CV  on the systemic adaptive immunity to NTHi in`children with chronic suppurative lung disease.
