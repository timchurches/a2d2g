  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomised to BNP group. For the BNP group, the proBNP result will be given to the physician responsible for the patient's care prior to discharge. The report with proBNP result will include an interpretative statement based on the known prognostic value of BNP levels to predict rehospitalisation and death from heart failure. 

Three hundred (300) patients admitted to hospital with clinical heart failure as a primary diagnosis and not enrolled in other studies will be eligible for inclusion.
Eligible patients will be approached at day 4 of admission to hospital, once initial stabilisation has occurred and prior to hospital discharge. If written informed consent is obtained the patients will provide a blood sample for proBNP levels. 

Clinical follow-up will then be collected on all patients by phone call to patient, physician and GP at 180 and 360 days. Mortality data will be confirmed from the Births, Deaths and Marriages register. Hospitalisation will be confirmed from the Patient Management System and clinical record.</interventions>
