Active Comparator: Part 1-Cohort 1: Pertuzumab 420 Milligrams (mg) IV - Part 1 includes healthy male participants. Participants will receive a single injection of pertuzumab 420 mg IV.

Experimental: Part 1-Cohort 2: Pertuzumab 400 mg SC - Part 1 includes healthy male participants. Participants will receive a single injection of pertuzumab 400 mg SC.

Experimental: Part 1-Cohort 3: Pertuzumab 600 mg SC - Part 1 includes healthy male participants. Participants will receive a single injection of pertuzumab 600 mg SC.

Experimental: Part 1-Cohort 4: Pertuzumab 1200 mg SC - Part 1 includes healthy male participants. Participants will receive a single injection of pertuzumab 1200 mg SC.

Active Comparator: Part 1-Cohort 5: Trastuzumab 600 mg SC - Part 1 includes healthy male participants. Participants will receive a single injection of trastuzumab 600 mg SC.

Experimental: Part 1-Cohort 6: Pertuzumab 400 mg SC + Trastuzumab 600 mg SC - Part 1 includes healthy male participants. Participants will receive a single injection of co-mixed pertuzumab 400 mg and trastuzumab 600 mg SC.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study involves a two-part design. Part 1 is designed to determine the optimal dose of
      subcutaneous (SC) Perjeta, injected alone or mixed with Herceptin, that results in comparable
      exposure to intravenous (IV) Perjeta. Exposure between SC Perjeta and IV Perjeta will be
      compared using a compilation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time of maximum
      concentration (Tmax), and serum trough concentration (Ctrough). Part 2 is designed to confirm
      the dosing regimen in women with EBC on the basis of safety, tolerability, and PK
      assessments.</summary>
