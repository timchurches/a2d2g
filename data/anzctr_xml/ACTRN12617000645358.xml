  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will use CPAP in autoset mode (APAP) during sleep on all nights for a period of 4 weeks (own control group).  During this period, APAP will be administered via the participants usual oronasal mask (ie full face mask) with a pressure range of 5-20cm of water.  Participants with be then fitted with an O2Vent T Mandibular Advancement Device via a trained prosthodontist Dr Chris Hart. The O2Vent T is a customized duo-block titratable oral appliance that is registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) as a Class I therapeutic product.  Fitting and further advancement of the device will occur over 1 to 3 sessions total depending on the individual participants response and overall positioning of the device.  Participants will use the O2Vent T Mandibular Advancement Splint in combination with their APAP for a 4-12 week period depending on the necessary number of advancements made (ie 0 advancements = 4 weeks; 1 advancements = 8 weeks; 2 advancements = 12 weeks).  The decision for further advancement will depend on the dental reviews mentioned above.   Data will be gathered for each treatment period (ie 4 week control group and 4-12 week treatment group). For the 4-12 weak treatment period, the data gathered will be obtained across each separate 4 week period (within the 4-12 weeks) pending the number of advancements made during dental reviews.  Data attained will include daily and total usage, required APAP pressures, AHI and leak.  All of this complete data will be accessible and attained via the participants APAP machine downloads for all treatment periods described.   There is deemed to be no significant washout period in between the two treatments, however, if this does occur, patients will simply continue on their usual CPAP for that time.  This will not impact on the study results.  </interventions>

    <designfeatures>Prospective case-control crossover study to determine whether treatment effectiveness can be improved with combination CPAP and MAD in a group of patients with OSA who are sub-optimally treated with CPAP using an oronasal mask.

Participants will be monitored for CPAP efficacy and compliance using their usual oronasal mask for 4 weeks whilst using an auto-titrating CPAP (APAP). They will then be fitted with a customized MAD (O2Vent T) and use this in combination with APAP with oronasal mask.  Combination therapy will again occur over a 4 week period, although further advancement of the MAD may need occur up to 2 times if clinically indicated.  If this occurs, the combination therapy period may be extended to up to 12 weeks maximum.

Effectiveness of both treatment will be compared using downloaded data from each participants APAP machines at the end of the relevant treatment periods (ie 4 weeks for the APAP monotherapy period and 4-12 weeks for the combination therapy period).

Whilst this is a prospective case series, previous CPAP downloads and sleep study results will be used to evaluate current treatment effect and assess the meeting of inclusion criteria as sub-optimally treated with CPAP. Data from previous sleep studies and downloads may also be collected as part of this research.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome will be to compare CPAP pressures required with and without MAD.
Prior data indicate that the difference in the response of matched pairs is normally distributed with standard deviation. If the true difference in the mean response of matched pairs is 2, we will need to study 16 pairs of subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power) 0.9. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.

Whilst this study is not powered to detect differences in compliance, compliance with and without MAD will be tested for significance using paired t-tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is common and an important contributor to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and depression. The first line treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which is highly effective in treating OSA. However, up to 50% of patients are unable or unwilling to tolerate CPAP. Nasal masks are most frequently used, however oronasal masks covering the nose and mouth, may be chosen due to patient preference, nasal obstruction or air leak through the mouth. There is growing evidence suggesting that oronasal masks are less effective in controlling OSA. Patients using oronasal masks are a clinically difficult group of patients to treat, often requiring higher CPAP pressures, with significant mask leaks, a higher residual AHI and lower adherence to treatment.

Mandibular Advancement Devices (MAD) are emerging as an alternative treatment particularly in patients with mild to moderate OSA, CPAP intolerant OSA and primary snorers. The O2Vent T is a custom-made MAD with an enclosed airway that allows airflow through the device. Like all MADs, the lower jaw is brought forward to stabilize the upper airway, however unlike other devices, patients can also breathe through the device while the jaw position stabilized. This may be of benefit to those with nasal obstruction and a tendency to mouth breathe i.e. patients using oronasal masks.

Our aim is to assess whether treatment effectiveness can be improved with combination CPAP and MAD, in a group of patients with OSA who are sub-optimally treated with CPAP using an oronasal mask. Treatment effectiveness is a clinical decision based on factors including compliance, residual Apnoea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), pressure requirements and leak.  We hypothesize that compared to CPAP with oronasal mask, combination therapy will result in:
a) Lower pressure requirements
b) Lower AHI
c) Lower leak
d) Better compliance

Participants will be monitored for CPAP efficacy and compliance using their oronasal mask for 4 weeks using an auto-titrating CPAP (APAP). They will be fitted with a customized MAD (O2Vent T) and then use this in combination with their APAP (combination therapy) for a further 4 week period.  Further advancement of the MAD may need to occur if clinically indicated (ie for a period of 4 to 12 weeks maximum).  Treatment effectiveness between the groups will be compared using downloaded data from the participants APAP machines.  This will include AHI, pressure requirements, usage and leak, which will all be downloaded from the participants APAP machines at the end of the relevant treatment periods.</summary>
