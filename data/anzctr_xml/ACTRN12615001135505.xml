    <statisticalmethods>All collected data will be analysed using statistical software IBM SPSS version 20. The data will be analysed using intention-to-treat principle. A subsequent analysis excluding antibiotic users and non-compliance will be conducted. Categorical variables will be presented using descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean and median) whereas continuous data will be presented as mean +/- standard deviation. Repeated measures analysis of covariance will be used to compare the 2 groups. For continuous data, an independent t-test will
be performed (MannWhitney if non-parametric) will be employed for comparisons of the 2 groups. On the other hand, chi-square test and Fishers exact test will be used for comparisons of categorical data. A priori level of significance of 0.05 is set for the study.

The number of participants is calculated using the Power and Sample Size Calculations Software version 3.1.2 (Vanderbilt, USA), based on the 1% reduction of HbA1c as outlined by UKPDS Group, 1998. The sample size had been calculated with the consideration of test power 80%, two tailed 95% confidence level and 20% attrition rate, which generate about 100 patients(50 patients per arm) that needed for this study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes mellitus is a looming epidemic worldwide, posing substantial burden on global health and economy. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to increase and is expected to reach 592 million by 2035. Low grade chronic inflammation has been associated with the onset of T2DM. Probiotics, which are health promoting live microorganisms, may influence the levels of endotoxin and gut hormones thus, improving the glycaemic control in T2DM patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of probiotics on glycaemic control in T2DM patients. A total of 100 consenting adult T2DM patients will be enrolled in this study and to receive daily probiotics or placebo for 24 weeks. It is anticipated that probiotics will induce beneficial changes in gut microbiota, reduce systemic inflammatory state and increase secretion of gut hormones, leading to improved glycaemic control and quality of life in T2DM patients. </summary>
