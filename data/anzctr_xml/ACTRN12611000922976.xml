  <interventions>
    <interventions>Apply a manual technique known as suboccipital inhibition technique. With the patient lying supine and the practitioner seated at the head of it, place their hands under the occipital region and pushes his fingers on the suboccipital region anteriorly. The technique was applied for five minutes.
The technique is applied once.</interventions>
    <comparator>the control group received placebo a technique consisting of the support of the therapist's hands on the arms of the participant for five minutes.
Not simulate any other technique with this maneuver. The hands just resting on the patient without any pressure or movement.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fibromyalgia is a disease with a high prevalence, and today presents difficulties, both for initial assessment and diagnosis, especially for further processing, for which have not yet been clearly defined action protocols with significant benefit in symptoms in the disease.
The primary objective of this study will determine whether the application of the inhibition technique  causes immediate changes in cervical mobility in women with fibromyalgia.
The conceptual hypothesis of our study is that the inhibition   suboccipital muscle technique applied to women suffering from fibromyalgia will cause changes in cervical mobility on the pain of fibromyalgia tender points located in the suboccipital region and the traps and the perception of the intensity of spontaneous pain in the cervical and cephalic region.</summary>
