  <interventions>
    <interventions>A battery of tests will be completed at the baseline assessment (following a 7 day run-in period), prior to the first dose of Sativex.  This will include the modified Edmonton Symptom asse3ssment Scale that uses a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) to assess 10 common symptoms, the Beck Depression inventory, the Brief Pain Inventory, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Short Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test.  Vital signs will be recorded. Participants will then receive their first dose of Sativex and dosing instructions from the study nurse.  The patients will then take the medication home with them for a 21 day treatment period.  Sativex is  a sublingual buccal spray.  Dosing will start at 2 doses (sprays)/day and then be titrated by patients depending upon need.  The study nurse will follow-up with the patient either while on dialysis or over the telephone at least every 2 days to review their doses, pain severity, and assess for any adverse effects of the drug.  During the telephone follow-up, patients will be advised to optimize dosing when suboptimal benefit has been achieved (suboptimal being defined as = 4/10 on NRS or considered suboptimal by the patient).  Patients will be asked to keep a daily log of pain scores, time and dose of study medication, time and use of any other analgesics.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	Change in mean numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score of 30% from baseline to end of study</outcome>
      <timepoint>21 days after start of intervention</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in use of escape analgesia for those patients on opioids.  This will be assessed by determining the average daily morphine equivalent in the last 3 days of intervention; i.e. days 19-21 inclusive after starting the intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>21 days after start of intervention</timepoint>
