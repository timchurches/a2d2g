    <concealment>Prior to commencement of the study a randomisation allocation sequence will be generated with a computerised randomisation program. A staff member not working on this project will then fill sealed opaque envelopes with the allocation sequence. A Research Assistant at the clnical site will determine if the patient is elibible for inclusion in the trial, then obtain informed consent and collect baseline data.  THe research assistant will then open the sealed envelope to determine the participant's allocated group.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older people have higher rates of hospital admission than the general population and higher rates of readmission due to complications and falls. During hospitalisation, older people experience significant functional decline which impairs their future independence and quality of life. Current models of discharge planning and follow-up care do not address the need to prevent deconditioning or functional decline. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of innovative strategies including exercise and/or in-home and telephone follow-up for community-based older people at risk of readmission. Results will determine effective strategies to reduce readmissions and improve functional status, independence and psycho-social well-being</summary>
