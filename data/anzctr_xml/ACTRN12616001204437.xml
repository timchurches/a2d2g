  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will be offered a standardised Tai Chi intervention over a period of 24 weeks, consisting of a 12 week intensive Tai Chi intervention and a 12-week sustained Tai Chi intervention. 

In the intensive period the Tai Chi class of 60-90 minutes will take place twice per week, while in the sustained period the Tai Chi class of 60-90 minutes will take place once per week. Attendance will be recorded by the Tai Chi instructor each class. Participants will be required to practice at least 3 other days per week at home. Printed materials containing pictures and written descriptions of the Tai Chi intervention or DVDs will be provided to facilitate home practice. A self-report patient diary for recording the home practice sessions will need to be completed.

The overall contents of classes include Tai Chi history, theories and principles, meditation, walking lunges, 13-form Chen-style Tai Chi modified from the classical Chen-style Tai Chi, and 13-form Tai Chi cool-down exercise. Each class consists of 10-20 minutes of meditation, 10-20 minutes of walking lunges, 30 minutes of Tai Chi practice, and 10-20 minutes of Tai Chi cool-down exercise. Participants will be able to learn the entire sequence by the end of the 6th week, and the entire sequence will be repeated in the following weeks.

Patients assigned to the wait list control group will be instructed to maintain their routine activities and not to begin any new exercise programs during their study participation. These patients will be offered an equivalent 12-week intensive Tai Chi intervention and 12-week sustained Tai Chi intervention at the termination of the study provided the Tai Chi intervention in the treatment is proved to be safe (no severe adverse events directly associated with Tai Chi). </interventions>

The standardized Tai Chi intervention is specifically tailored to this CHD and hypertension population. Tai Chi instructors of this trial are appropriately qualified and experienced. All Adverse Events (AE) will be recorded and signed off by the principal investigator. During home practice, all potential adverse events will be recorded in diaries by the participants. If there is a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), the participant will contact the principal investigator (contact details will be provided on Participant Information Sheets). SAEs will be immediately reported to local Human Research Ethics Committees in accordance with the guidelines. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>We will use SPSS version 20 to perform data analysis. ANOVA and Chi-squared tests will be used to check for any differences between groups at baseline. We will apply ANCOVA to detect changes between the experimental and control groups after treatment, controlling for baseline values and other possible confounders. A p value of less than 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. An interim sample size analysis will also be conducted at n=50 allowing for an acceptable estimate of the population standard deviation and hence considerably more robust sample size calculation to ensure adequate power.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, randomised controlled trial designed to investigate the effect of a standardised Tai Chi intervention on psychological stress and cardiovascular function in patients with coronary heart disease and/or hypertension. The primary outcome will be psychosocial status of stress measured by Perceived Stress Scale 10-item (PSS-10). The secondary outcomes will include psychosocial status of anxiety measured by Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and depression measured by Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), cardiovascular function including blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), blood tests (lipid and glucose profiles and C-creative protein (CRP), quality of life measured by Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), and physical fitness using the 6-Minute Walk test. Approximately 126 participants with coronary heart disease and/or hypertension will be included in this trial to participate a 24-week Tai Chi intervention, comprising of a 12-week intensive intervention and 12-week sustained intervention. This study will be conducted in Sydney, Australia and Beijing, China.</summary>
