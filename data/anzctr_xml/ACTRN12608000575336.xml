    <interventions>Ultrasound guided transversus abdominis block

Once general anaesthesia has been established the primary investigator, or consultant anaesthetist experienced in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia in children, will perform the transversus abdominis nerve block. A Micromaxx ultrasound machine with either a hockey stick or high frequency linear (HFL) probe will be used to identify the relevant structures. Following aseptic preparation of the puncture site and the ultrasound probe, the transversus abdominis nerve block will be performed under cross-sectional continuous ultrasound imaging.  A 22g spinal needle will be used. A transversely orientated ultrasound probe with an imaging depth of 4 to 6 cm is placed on the anterolateral abdominal wall where the three muscle layers are most distinct. After identification of the transversus plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, the probe is moved posterolaterally to lie across the mid axillary line just superior to the iliac crest. The needle is introduced anteriorly, in the plane of the ultrasound beam. The probe is moved anteriorly to identify the needle after skin puncture and then moved posteriorly in order to image the needle during its entire passage through the abdominal wall. The needle obliquely approaches the transversus abdominis plane and near perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. The needle tip is guided posterior to the mid axillary line in order to block the lateral nerve branches. Once the needle is correctly positioned a predetermined volume of 1% lignocaine and 1% Ropivacaine will be injected following a negative aspiration test. A total of 0.3ml/kg (to a maximum of 10 ml) of combined 1% lignocaine and 1% ropivacaine will be infiltrated 5 minutes prior to skin incision.</interventions>

Once general anaesthesia has been established the primary investigator, or consultant anaesthetist experienced in ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia in children will perform the ilioinguinal nerve block. A Micromaxx ultrasound machine with either a hockey stick or high frequency linear (HFL) probe will be used to identify the relevant structures. Following aseptic preparation of the puncture site and the ultrasound probe the ilioinguinal nerve block will be performed under cross-sectional continuous ultrasound imaging. A 22g spinal needle will be used. Once the needle is visualised by ultrasound and placed in optimal position relative to the nerves, a single injection of a predetermined volume of 1% lignocaine and 1% ropivacaine will be injected following a negative aspiration test. A total of 0.3 mL/kg (to a maximum of 10 ml) of combined 1% lignocaine and 1% ropivacaine will be infiltrated 5 minutes prior to skin incision.</comparator>

    <concealment>If the patient is suitable, a patient information leaflet will be sent via mail a week prior to the planned operation date.  The participants will be seen as part of the routine preoperative assessment and at this contact, consent for participation will be obtained.
Randomisation will occur by a computer generated random number and delivered in a sealed opaque envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>According to the randomisation, the patient will receive either the ultrasound guided ilioinguinal nerve block, or the ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block. Randomisation will occur by computerised sequence generation using a randomisation table created by computer software.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of regional anaesthesia on analgesia requirements for paediatric patients during and following inguinal hernia repair or orchidopexy, and assess the technical ease of insertion.  The outcome measures include the quality of ultrasound images, intraoperative fentanyl dose, postoperative morphine dose, pain scores and time to first dose of paracetamol/ibuprofen.</summary>
