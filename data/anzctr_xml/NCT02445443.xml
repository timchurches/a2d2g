      <outcome>Original Knee Society Clinical Score© (KSCS) - The original Knee Society Score© (KSS) is subdivided into two parts. One part is the Knee Society Clinical Score (KSCS) and the other part is the Knee Society Functional Score (KSFS). The KSCS will be administered at the pre-operative visit and all follow-up visits. The purpose of administering this assessment is to determine the statistical clinical improvement over time which may be compared to literature at 1 and 2 years.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Revision - Revision, for any reason, will be assessed throughout the subject's participation in the study.</outcome>

      <outcome>EQ-5D-3L - The EuroQol EQ-5D-3L is a descriptive system measuring health-related Quality Of Life (QOL) and consists of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which takes one of three responses. The responses record three levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D-3L dimension. The EQ-5D-3L is completed by the Subject on the day of their visit.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the current investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new hinged
      revision knee device. This device is designed to provide efficient, reproducible
      reconstructions with optimal limb and implant alignment, durable implant fixation, and
      functional outcomes that increasingly approach those of primary Total Knee Arthroplasty
      (TKA).</summary>
