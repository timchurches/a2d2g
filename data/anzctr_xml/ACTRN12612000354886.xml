    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The treating doctor will order the medication to be given by writing on a medication chart “benztropine or placebo 2ml IM. The medication chart will be given to the emergency department 'team co-ordinator'. Randomisation will then occur by opening sequentially numbered envelopes which are sealed and opaque in which the study allocation has been randomly assigned. These envelopes will be stored with the 'team co-ordinator'. Also, sealed inside will be a data collection sheet. The envelope will be opened by the ‘team co-ordinator’ who will then draw up the appropriate study drug. The team co-ordinator will then give the study drug to the nurse looking after the participant, and the data collection sheet to the doctor looking after the participant. The team co-ordinator will not divulge the contents of the syringe. Instructions in the envelope will re-enforce to the team co-ordinator not to divulge the contents of the syringe. While it would be ideal to have benztropine and saline in matching vials labelled A or B, funding constraints make this option unavailable. The team co-ordinator has been chosen as the person to draw up the study drug as they work in an area of ED physically distant from the clinic/consulting area where participants will be enrolled and treated. This means that the doctor, nurse and patient will be physically distant from the 'team co-ordinator' minimising the chance of accidental un-blinding. This method has been successfully used previously in this emergency department for a clinical trial.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients present to the Emergency department with acute cervical muscle spasm and pain, which may be spontaneous in onset or related to non-traumatic twisting events. In lay speech this may be referred to as a wry neck. Conventional analgesics such as paracetamol, NSAIDs and oral opoids are the mainstay of treatment for wry neck, but often provide inadequate pain relief. Centrally acting anti-cholinergic drugs are used for the relief of pain/spasm from the chronic condition of idiopathic cervical dystonia and from drug induced dystonic reactions. The use of these drugs for acute spasmodic neck pain has been poorly studied. There is a single study in the literature assessing the centrally-acting anti-cholinergic drug benztropine (trade name cogentin) in the relief of pain and spasm from this condition. This is a case series of 5 patients with acute pain and spasm of the neck and demonstrated remarkable relief of pain and improvement in range of motion in all patients following an intra-muscular injection of benztropine.
Our hypothesis is that IM benztropine will provide relief of neck pain and improve range of neck movement in patients presenting with wry neck. We aim to compare the effect of 2mg IM benztropine with placebo on pain scores and range of motion in patients presenting to the ED with wry neck.</summary>
