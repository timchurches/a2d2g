  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomized trial comparing two treatments for urge incontinence
Arm 1: an anticholinergic  drug  (Solifenacin)given 5 mg once daily for 6 months.
Arm 2: surgical plication of the cardinal/uterosacral ligaments plication- this is a minimally invasive a day care operation.performed via the vagina. It involves two small incisions in the vagina. The ligaments are located and repositioned with 2 sutures only. The vagina is closed and the patient is sent home on the same day with very  minor limitations as to what they can or cannot do.    The procedure requires approximately 15-30 minutes to complete and is performed by a gynecologist with minimum 5 years of experience treating women with urge incontinence, 

Monitoring 
of compliance:   by drug returns
of treatment success:  by the UDI-6 and where relevant CRADI-8 questionnaires at 6 weeks, 12 weeks 26 weeks also, the number of patients who completed the treatment.

Statistical analysis
Paired binary response data (per-patient presence/absence of a specific sign/symptom before vs. after surgery/anticholinergic treatment) in the total study cohort were analyzed with a McNemars test, with a null hypothesis of no treatment effect. 
The GraphPad Quickcalcs platform was used for this analysis (http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/mcNemar1/). The sample size (https://www.statstodo.com/SSizMcNemar_Pgm.php) was deemed sufficient to assume a Chi-squared distribution. The Chi-square was calculated with one degree of freedom. 
Post-hoc estimation of the study power was performed, assuming an alpha error equal to 0.01 (https://www.statstodo.com/SSizMcNemar_Pgm.php). In all cases the estimated power for this comparison exceeded 0.95 (table 1).

To evaluate differences between the proportions of patients showing or not a specific sign/symptom when treated with different techniques (CL/USL reinforcement vs. anticholinergics), the Z-ratio and the 95% confidence interval for the difference between independent proportions were calculated.

The Vassar Stats platform was used for this analysis (www.vassarstats.net).</statisticalmethods>

    <summary> 
BACKGROUND TO THE RCT two main paradigms as regards causation and treatment of Overactive Bladder Syndrome(OAB-frequency, urgency, nocturia), the ICS (International Society) paradigm and the Integral Theory (IT) paradigm.

The Integral Theory (IT) paradigm considers OAB symptoms as originating outside the bladder, a result of laxity in the vagina or its supporting ligaments. The Theory predicts that reinforcing the cardinal/uterosacral ligament complex will reverse this cascade of events, thereby improving FNU symptoms. The surgical operations are minimal, usually day-care.The ICS (International Society) paradigm considers that the cause of OAB arises in the bladder, so it is the bladder which must be treated.  The principal management of OAB therefore is non-surgical, some type of anticholinergic.

OBJECTIVES OF THE RCT STUDY is to challenge both paradigms.
Primary aim A multicentre RCT of anticholinergic drugs (Solfenacin) against surgical treatment of OAB,  reinforcing the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments in patients presenting principally with &gt; 2 per day of urge incontinence symptoms.
Secondary aim  To validate (or not) the IT paradigms predictions that strengthening the cardinal/USL complex will also improve other bothersome pelvic floor symptoms: nocturia, chronic pelvic pain obstructive micturition and defecation and non-sphincteric fecal incontinence and whether there is any effect of anticholinergics on these symptoms.
Trial Design Parallel study, native tissue ligament plication vs anticholinergics for patients wetting two or more times /day with urge incontinence symptoms.
End points/outcomes of the study   Review each arm at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 26 weeks using UDI-6, CRADI-8 plus urge and nocturia as per Table 1, good day, average day, bad day.
For power of 95% CI with 1% significance, 192 patients total (96 each arm) are required and will be recruited.
Symptom improvement for each arm endpoint /baseline will be statistically assessed. 
Comparison of the endpoint results from one arm against the other will be statistically assessed.

Two cohorts, randomized for either medical treatment (Solfenacin) or surgical treatment, native tissue reconstruction of cardinal and uterosacral ligaments.
At 6 months, all patients are re-assessed as regards OAB and other symptoms with the modified USI-6 questionnaire.  Cessation of treatment will be considered a failure.  
Informed consent  for both arms will be completed before treatment and relevant Patient Information printed materials will be provided.
