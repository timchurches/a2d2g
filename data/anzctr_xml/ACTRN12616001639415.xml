  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sunitinib malate, hard gel capsules, on a schedule of 14days (2weeks) on and 7days (1week) off
Sunitib is to be taken once daily for 14 days followed by no dosing for 7 days until disease progression or intolerable adverse events (dosing will continue indefinitely until progression or intolerable toxicity)
The investigator deciding the starting doses and dose adjustments will be a qualified and currently registered medical oncologist. 

Recommended starting dose of sunitinib is 50mg daily, if the investigator has safety concerns then a starting dose of 37.5mg daily is allowable. Drug dose will be adjusted to ensure patients achieve grade 1 to 2 toxicity on at least 4 days of every 21 day cycle. Dose may be increased or decreased by increments of 12.5mg. Dose range between patients is expected to be 12.5 to 82.5mg/d with the majority of patients on 37.5 or 50mg daily. Regarding dose adjustment
- if patient  has no toxicity OR Grade 1 toxicity for &lt;4 days of the 21 days then the dose will be increase by 12.5mg/d
- if patient  experiences Grade 1 - 2 toxicity for at least 4 days of the 21 days then the same dose will be continued
- if patient  experiences Grade 3 or 4 toxicity for more than 6 days of the 21 days then drug will be stopped wait until less than Grade 1 Toxicity then recommence with 12.5 mg/d dose reduction (if Grade 4 toxicity the recommence with 25mg/d dose reduction)
- any other scenario will be left to the discretion of the investigator to guide treatment adjustment.
Medical history and records will be used to monitor adherence</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>We estimate a median PFS of greater than 12 months in the toxicity-adjusted dose (TAD), 14/7 treated patients. We estimate that such patients treated with standard dose of sunitinib will have a prognostic-score adjusted median PFS of 9 months (weighted median estimate assuming a median PFS of 11 months in intermediate risk subjects and a median PFS of 4 months in poor risk subjects). Based on the AHern design, a sample size of 80 patients would have 80% power with 95% confidence to detect a 14% increase in progression free survival from 50% to 64% at 9 months. This will be sufficient to rule a median PFS of 9 months in favour of a median PFS of 14 months. At 9 months, this sample size will also have 80% power to exclude a PFS rate of 50% (median PFS 9 months) in favour of a 62% PFS rate (median PFS 13 months) with 90% confidence.

Significance
If the TAD, 14/7 intervention has a PFS of 12 months or greater, this would inform a phase 3 trial using TAD vs standard dosing with PFS and OS endpoints.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sunitinib on a 14/7 schedule with toxicity-adjusted dosing for the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18-80 years and have been diagnosed with metastatic renal cell cancer with a component of clear cell histology. 

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will receive sunitinib capsules to be taken in cycles of 14 days on, then 7 days off, until either the disease becomes resistant to the treatment (disease progression), or due to intolerable side effects despite dose adjustment, in which case treatment will be ceased. Based on the occurrence of any side effects to the medication, the dose may be increased or reduced as required by the treating doctor. The dose is adjusted so as to aim for some side effects for up to four days per cycle. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires relating to toxicity and quality of life, and will undergo scans to monitor disease progression for up to one year following the start of treatment.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether a 14/7 dosing schedule with toxicity-adjusted dosing is effective and tolerable for sunitinib treatment for mRCC.</summary>
