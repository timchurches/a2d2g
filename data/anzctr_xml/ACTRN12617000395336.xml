  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend a screening visit (V1) to assess airway inflammation, and if eligible, a randomisation visit 2 weeks later (V2), All participants deemed eligible for the study, will receive both dornase alfa as well as the placebo medication, which will both be administered via nebulisation. The order in which each medication is received will be randomised and the participant will not be aware of which medication they are receiving at each timepoint. The participant will be randomly allocated to receive either dornase alfa via nebuliser (Pulmozyme, 2.5mg) or placebo, once daily for 10 days. The first treatment sequence will be a period of 10 days (visit 2/3), followed by a 2 week washout period (return for visit 4) and concluding with the second 10 day treatment sequence (visit 5). Participants will be contacted via telephone call midway (Day 5) through each treatment period, to monitor adherence. To further monitor adherence, participants will also be asked to complete a diary and to return all drug ampules (used and unused). </interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo consists of a solution containing 0.9% w/v Sodium Chloride (table salt) in water which will be administered using a nebuliser. In this study we will use a placebo as a control in testing the new treatment option. A control is used to minimise the effects of any factors other than the active drug so that we can conclude whether or not the results of our trial are due to the active drug only. In this study each participant will receive both the active medication (Pulmozyme) as well as the placebo, at different time points. The order of this will be randomly allocated. </comparator>

    <concealment>This study is a double blind crossover study, employing concealed random allocation. Allocation concealment will be achieved as randomisation will be done by an independent statistician. Each participant will receive both the active treatment (Pulmozyme) as well as the placebo treatment, at different time points. The order in which each treatment is completed is randomly allocated;  the assessors and the participants will not be aware of which treatment the participant is receiving during each treatment period.</concealment>
    <sequence>Concealed random allocation will be employed. Randomisation will be done by an
independent statistician using computer-generated codes, in blocks of variable size, stratifying for gender and age.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>In our asthma pilot data, the level of log eDNA in asthma was normally distributed with a SD of 1.97. If the true difference between neutrophilic and non-neutrophilic severe asthma is 1.84 as per pilot data, we will need to study 19 subjects per group to be able to reject the null hypothesis with 80% power and a=0.05. Since the neutrophilic phenotype accounts for between 20-30% of subjects with severe asthma, we will recruit 100 severe asthmatics to ensure we get a minimum of 20 subjects with neutrophilic severe asthma eligible for the treatment trial.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or asthma usually experience swelling (inflammation) in their airways (breathing tubes), that makes is difficult to breathe. This inflammation can worsen their condition and lead to further medical problems. An inflammatory cell called the neutrophil is often present in the airways of people with COPD or asthma, and when activated these cells release molecules that lead to swelling and damage of the lungs. Neutrophils also release extracellular traps called NETs, which look like a spider web and are made up of the cells DNA (the genetic code which carries all the information about how we look and function) and other inflammatory molecules. These traps can kill bacteria, however if they are not cleared they are toxic to the lungs. We have shown a build-up of NETs in sputum from patients with COPD and asthma. In another lung disease called cystic fibrosis, NETs are broken down and cleared by a treatment called Pulmozyme, which improves lung function and decreases lung attacks. This study will investigate NETs in COPD and asthma, their effects on the lungs, and whether treatment with Pulmozyme can improve symptoms. </summary>
