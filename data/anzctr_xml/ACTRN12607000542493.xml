    <studytitle>Cognitive Function Substudy - A substudy to the SOFT trial (ACTRN12605000416695) which evaluates the cognitive function of premenopausal women with endocrine responsive breast cancer participating in SOFT.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A substudy to the SOFT trial (ACTRN12605000416695). The SOFT trial evaluates the role of ovarian function suppression and the role of exemestane as adjuvant therapies for premenopausal women with endocrine responsive breast cancer.  

The Co-SOFT substudy investigates cognitive function of patients participating in the SOFT parent trial at selected centres.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prior to registration in the Co-SOFT substudy, all patients must be randomised to the SOFT (ACTRN12605000416695) parent trial.  

The SOFT trial is a phase III trial evaluating the role of ovarian function suppression and the role of
exemestane as adjuvant therapies for premenopausal women with endocrine responsive breast cancer.  Patients participating in the SOFT trial will be randomised to receive five years
of tamoxifen (20mg orally daily), five years of tamoxifen (20mg orally daily) plus ovarian function suppression (via either  GnRH analogue, surgical oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation) or five years of exemestane (25mg orally daily) plus ovarian function suppression (via either  GnRH analogue, surgical oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation).  The method of ovarian function suppression may be determined by the treating clinican/patient and may be altered during the five year period, if necessary. 

Patients may subsequently be registered to the Co-SOFT substudy, investigating cognitive function for patients participating in the SOFT parent trial.  Cognitive function will be measured with a computerised test battery (CogState) consisting of computerised card games. Self reported cognitive function, psychological distress and fatigue will also be assessed via three multiple response based questionnaires.</interventions>
    <comparator>The primary objective of the Co-SOFT substudy will be to evaluate cognitive function of those patients randomised to receive 5 years of tamoxifen vs those patients randomised to receive 5 years of tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to evaluate and compare changes in cognitive function over 1 year in premenopausal breast cancer patients who receive adjuvant tamoxifen with or without ovarian function suppression.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the relationship between subjective and objective cognitive function.

Cognitive Function will be measured with a computerised test battery (CogState) consisting of computerised card games. Subjective cognitive function will be evaluated via multiple response based questionnaires completed by trial participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cognitive function will be assessed at baseline and at 1 year, 5 years and 6 years following randomisation to the parent SOFT trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the relationship between cognitive function, psychological distress, fatigue, insomnia and quality of life.

Cognitive Function will be measured with a computerised test battery (CogState) consisting of computerised card games. Psychological distress, fatigue and insomnia will be evaluated via self completed multiple-response based questionnaires.

Quality of life will be assessed via self completed mulitple choice questionnaires administered as part of the parent SOFT trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cognitive function, psychological distress, fatigue and insomnia will be assessed at baseline and at 1 year, 5 years and 6 years following randomisation to the parent SOFT trial.

Quality of life will be assessed at baseline and every 6 months during participation in the SOFT trial (until 6 years from the date of randomisation to SOFT).</timepoint>
