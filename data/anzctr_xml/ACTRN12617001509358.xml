  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be delivered by SMS on drinking occasions on Friday and Saturday nights over a 6-week period. The intervention will consist of hourly Ecological Momentary Assessments (repeated, real-time behavioural surveys) and tailored feedback. 

Participants will be sent an SMS at 6pm every Friday and Saturday night during the trial period, with a link to an online survey. This will ask about their plans for the evening and, if they are going out, details about what they plan to do.

If they plan to go out, participants will then receive hourly SMS reminders (7pm to 3am) to complete a very brief online questionnaire. The questionnaire will involve hourly reports of their alcohol consumption and spending, where they are, and their mood. They will then receive an individually tailored feedback message via SMS in response to these data, which aims to stop or slow down their drinking, or avoid harmful consequences of drinking. 

The next day they will be sent a follow-up message with a link to another short survey to confirm details of the night, including total drinks consumed.

Every Monday, they will receive an SMS-linked survey asking them to report on the highest number of alcoholic drinks consumed in a single occasion in the past week (peak number of drinks), and the night of the week it was consumed.
</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two control groups.

The first control group will complete the same alcohol-related assessments as the intervention group (i.e. the same SMS-linked questionnaires), but will not receive any feedback SMS. 

The second will be an attention control group, in which participants will be sent SMS-linked surveys on the same schedule as the other two groups, but not related to alcohol. The surveys will instead address their social environment, social media use, and other non-alcohol related behaviour. They will not receive any feedback SMS. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The main outcome is change in the mean peak number of drinks consumed in a single night, over the six week intervention period. This will be compared between the intervention group and the attention control group.

This outcome will be assessed during the SMS-linked questionnaires sent every Monday to all participants. This asks them to report on the highest number of alcoholic drinks consumed in a single occasion in the past week (peak number of drinks), and the night of the week it was consumed.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption in the past 12 months (Measured using the Graduated Frequency questionnaire; Greenfield, 2000). This measure involves six questions asking about the frequency of consumption of different quantities of standard drinks. The outcome is a composite of these questions.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>

This will be assessed using 5 point Likert scales asking participants to rate a series of individual statements pertaining to their experience of undertaking the intervention (e.g. The assessments were easy to complete). Additional process evaluation measures, such as participant levels of response, refusal, and timeliness of response, will also be explored to assess feasibility and acceptability.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our proposal is to take brief interventions, proven to have a significant impact on young people's drinking, and apply them via mobile phone during actual drinking occasions. The intervention will consist of hourly mobile assessment and feedback. While on a night out, participants will receive hourly reminders to complete a very brief questionnaire through an online survey accessed via the SMS message. The questionnaire will involve hourly reports of their alcohol consumption and spending, where they are, and their mood. They will then receive an individually tailored feedback message via SMS in response to these data, which aims to stop or slow down their drinking, or avoid harmful consequences of drinking. The intervention will be delivered on drinking occasions on Friday and Saturday nights over a 6-week period. This study aims to determine the impact of a tailored brief intervention delivered by mobile phone on young people's high-risk alcohol consumption. We will use a randomised controlled trial design to generate high quality evidence of the impact of this intervention on single occasion risky drinking among young people.</summary>
