    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the proportion of infants in each group with treatment failure.  Treatment failure of either standard subnasal oxygen or HFNC therapy arm is defined as meeting three out of four specified failure criteria receiving escalation of treatment or higher level of care such as high acuity or intensive care. Treatment failure of either standard subnasal oxygen or HFNC therapy arm is defined if three of the four following criteria are met and an escalation of treatment or level of care is required

a.)	heart rate remains unchanged or increased compared to admission/enrollment observations,
b.)	respiratory rate remains unchanged or increased compared to admission/enrollment observations,
c.)	oxygen requirement in HFNC therapy arm exceeds FiO2 greater than 40% to maintain SpO2 greater than or equal to 92% (or greater than or equal to 94%) or oxygen requirement in standard subnasal oxygen therapy arm exceeds &gt;2L/min to maintain SpO2 greater than or equal to 92% (or greater than or equal to 94%)
d.)	hospital internal Early Warning Tool calls for medical review and escalation of care.

    <statisticalmethods>In 2011 there were 478 eligible patients admitted to 4 of 8 pilot hospitals (Queensland), of which 80 required transfer to a tertiary paediatric centre (16.7 %). Assuming a conservative baseline rate of failure of standard therapy (need for transfer to a specialist paediatric centre or PICU admission) of 10 %, a 50 % relative reduction to 5 % with a power of 90 % and type I error of 0.05, 582 participants per group are required, resulting in a total sample size of 1164 patients. An attrition rate of approximately 10-20 % is estimated, which gives an overall sample size of 1400.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of paediatric hospitalisation in Australia accounting for approximately 8000 admissions annually, of which approximately 500-600 are admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) requiring respiratory support. There have been numerous attempts and studies over the last three decades investigating the roles of steroids, salbutamol, adrenalin and inhalation of hypertonic saline in infants with bronchiolitis. None have successfully changed the outcome of the disease or the burden on health care systems. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy has been used over the last 8 years in paediatrics with reports showing a reduction in the need for non-invasive and invasive ventilation. HFNC reduces the work of breathing, improves the gas exchange and can be applied very early in the disease process as there is little interference with the patients comfort. Despite the existing data, the uptake of HFNC therapy in paediatrics is sporadic. This is, in part,  due to a lack of  best practice. Similarly,  many centres do not use the HFNC for bronchiolitis as there are opposing report about its benefit and a lack of consensus on how to use it. This study aims to develop a multi-centre trial and to assess which patients with bronchiolitis benefit using HFNC. For this purpose we will perform a randomised controlled trial comparing current best practice versus HFNC therapy. With the introduction of this simple to use respiratory system in regional hospitals we aim to reduce the need to transfer infants with bronchiolitis to tertiary centres.
