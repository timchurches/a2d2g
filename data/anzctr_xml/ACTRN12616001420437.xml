  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will observe and monitor the mobilisation of intensive care patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for the duration of ICU admission for the four week study limit.  Mobilisation of patients in the ICU will be categorised as: not mobilised, passivly mobilised (minimal patient assistance using a sling or other device to hoist a patient out of bed), active transfer mobilisation (patient assists in a transfer from bed to a chair), or active mobilisation (patient marches on the spot for &gt;30sec or is mobilised away from the bed space).  No intervention will be conducted</interventions>
    <comparator>This study will assess the mobilisation practices of patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at The Canberra Hospital (TCH).  During a four-week period over OCT-NOV in 2008, a similar study was conducted in the ICU at TCH.  The study found that of the 376 patient days audited, patients were mobilised on 176 patient days with active mobilisation on 76 patient days, active transfer on 40 patient days and passive mobilisation on 60 patient days.  Importantly, this study revealed that mechanically ventilated patients could be safely mobilised, and that mechanical ventilation should not be a barrier to mobilisation.  Only two adverse events were observed, both hypotensive events requiring cessation of mobilisation, return to bed, fluid loading and a transient increase in vasopressor requirments.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early mobilisation of intensive care patients has been shown to improve functional outcomes, attenuate-ICU acquired weakness, reduced ICU and hospital length of stay and reduce mortality rates at 12 months discharge (Morris et al., 2008, Schweickert et al., 2009).  Despite these benefits, there are many barriers (femoral vascular lines, staffing logistics and sedation management), which still prevent adequate mobilisation of ICU patients (Leditschke et al., 2012).
An ICU mobility scale has been generated to qualitatively describe on a continuum the level of mobilisation from nil to independent locomotion of ICU patients.  (Hodgson et al., 2014a).  A second strongly correlated measure of physical function, the Acute Care Index of Function (ACIF) has also been used to measure ICU patient function, and is advantageous in that it incorporates a neurological assessment and has been shown to predict patient physical function post-ICU discharge (Bissett et al., 2016).
In addition, a multinational consensus statement was also published in 2014 (Hodgson et al., 2014b) outlining the safety criteria for the mobilisation of critically ill patients. The statement described which intensive care patient could be safely mobilised and how they could be mobilised.  However, it is still possible that these criteria are somewhat conservative compared to existing practices at Canberra Hospital.
This study will determine the current barriers to mobilisation at Canberra Hospital ICU and ascertain whether these have changed compared to data collected in 2008 (Leditschke et al 2012). This study will also describe the safety of patient mobilisation at Canberra Hospital in the context of the consensus statement (Hodgson et al 2014b) and describe the IMS and ACIF scores of patients mobilised in Canberra Hospital ICU as part of routine practice.
