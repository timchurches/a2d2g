    <interventions>Arm: 1 The patients are randomly assigned with warfarin tablet brand A (reference) for 4 weeks then will be swapped over to warfarin tablet brand B (test) for next 4 weeks. The drug dose regimen are equal to the previous ones of the patients.
Arm 2: The patients are randomly assigned with warfarin tablet brand B (test) for 4 weeks then will be swapped over to warfarin tablet brand A (reference) for next 4 weeks. The drug dose regimen are equal to the previous ones of the patients.

The first week of the second warfarin brand treatment period is regarded as the washout period and time to get the second drug brand steady-state. Regarding that warfarin half-life is approximately 20-24 hours, one week period is considered sufficient as the washout period of the first brand and the steady-state for the second brand.

The adherence is evaluated by tablet count on each visit, along with a medication and food diary given to the patients to record for their drug administration. Also warfarin concentration (total and free concentration) in plasma, and warfarin metabolites (4'-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 10-hydroxywarfarin) concentration in urine will be analyzed by LC-MS/MS.</interventions>

      <outcome>Safety profile (adverse drug events). The significant adverse events of warfarin are bleeding at any tissues.
The adverse events will be evaluated by a questionnaire given to the patients on each visit about "head to toe" disorders that they experience during each brand treatment period.

Also the investigator will interview the patients and evaluate the adverse events to double check with the answers in the questionnaire.

The data from the questionnaire and interview will be compared with warfarin concentrations and INR values to confirm the drug-induced adverse events possibility.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size is determined by a power analysis program (G*Power 3.1.3) for a statistical test of difference between two dependence means (matched pairs). Base on the assuming effect size of 0.5, alpha=0.05, beta=0.1, a total of 44 participants is needed. So the sample size of 50 participants is included to assure a sufficient power of the study.  This sample size is consistent with the previous studies with the similar design that approximately 30-40 subjects were needed (Handler et al. 1998; Neutel &amp; Smith 1998; Namazi et al. 2004). 

Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 15.0) will be used for data analysis. Students paired t-test will be used for comparison of continuous variables, including mean warfarin dose requirement, warfarin concentrations in plasma and percentage of adverse events. Two-way ANOVA will be used to detect the differences of ratios of means INR and warfarin concentration between the groups. A Chi-square test will be used for the analysis and comparison of the proportions of participants with INR within target range and outside target range between the two treatment periods.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Substitution of an innovator to a generic drug product has been continuously rising. In the US, approximately $8
billion to $10 billion is the average cost saving per year of brand substitution and the generic drug prescription has
increased from 19% in 1984 to 60-70% in 2009. The increase in drug brand substitution is a call for scientific attention of the appropriateness of available bioequivalence (BE) study guidelines at present. If two products are said to be bioequivalent it means that they would be expected to be, for all intents and purposes, the same. The conclusion of BE studies is based on the assumption that if the test and reference drug products exhibit similar in vitro (i.e. acceptable drug content, similar dissolution/release profile) and in vivo performance (i.e. acceptable bioavailability), these drug products should possess therapeutic equivalence which includes efficacy and safety. However, because bioequivalence studies are conducted in healthy volunteers, these studies may or may not provide definitive evidence to guarantee the therapeutic equivalence in patients.

This study aims to compare efficacy and safety of two warfarin products marketed in Australia, namely Coumadin
or Marevan. The study design is a randomized, open-label, two-way, two-period, crossover study. A total of 50
patients who are prescribed with either brand of warfarin and clinically stable will be recruited in accordance with the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients will be allocated as the assigned randomized treatment sequence into 2 groups. For the first 4 weeks, Group I will start with Coumadin and Group II will start with Marevan. Then the
participants will be crossed over to the other brand for another 4 weeks. Participant blood samples will be collected
at baseline and weekly until the end of the study. Total and free racemic, R- and S-warfarin enantiomer concentration
in plasma, as well as 4',6,7,8, and 10hydroxywarfarin
metabolites in urine will be quantified by LC MS/MS. The
efficacy of the two warfarin brands will be compared by evaluating International Normalized Ratio (INR) values,
warfarin dose variation, mean warfarin dose to achieve target INR, area under the plasma concentrationtime
curve, and warfarin metabolites to drug ratio. The safety profile evaluation will be achieved by recording any adverse drug.</summary>
