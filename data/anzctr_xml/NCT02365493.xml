  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Beta-Lactam

No Intervention: Standard therapy - Intravenous vancomycin dosed as per Australian Therapeutic Guidelines (loading dose of 25 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 15-20 mg/kg every 12 hours) with subsequent adjustment to maintain trough levels at 15-20 mg/dL OR Intravenous daptomycin 6-10 mg/kg per day, adjusted for renal function (details of renally adjusted dosing provided in full protocol).
The choice of daptomycin or vancomycin is clinician-determined and may be influenced by such factors as local practice, the vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolate and evidence emerging during the course of the study

Experimental: Standard therapy + Beta-Lactam - In addition to standard treatment an intravenous Beta-Lactam (ß-lactam) will be added for the first 7 calendar days following randomisation (randomisation is day 1 - hence patients will receive 6-7 days of ß-lactam). This ß-lactam will be intravenous flucloxacillin 2g every 6 hours in Australia and intravenous cloxacillin 2g every 6 hours in Singapore. For those with a history of minor allergy to any penicillin (rash or unclear history, but not anaphylaxis or angiooedema), it will be intravenous cefazolin 2g every 8 hours. For haemodialysis patients, it will usually be cefazolin 2g three times per week post dialysis, however clinicians are also free to choose intermittent (flu)cloxacillin, dosed as for glomerular filtration rate (GFR ) &lt;10, if they desire.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this clinical trial is to determine whether a novel combination antibiotic
      treatment (vancomycin/daptomycin + beta-lactam) is superior to the standard antibiotic
      treatment (vancomycin/daptomycin) for hospitalised adults with Methicillin Resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. The hypothesis is that the addition of beta-lactam
      antibiotics (these are antibiotics from the penicillin family) to the standard therapy will
      lead to more efficient bacterial killing and hence lead to faster clearance of bacteria from
      the blood stream and other areas of infection, thereby reducing the risk of the spread of
      infection and death.

      The study design is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, open-label, randomised
      controlled trial. This will include 440 participants diagnosed with Methicillin Resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia recruited over a period of 4 years (July 2015 - June 2019)
      from within Infectious Diseases inpatient units across 21 hospital sites including 18 from
      within Australia and 3 located in Singapore. Participation will be voluntary and subject to
      informed consent. The participants will be randomised 1:1 to either the standard therapy
      group or combination therapy group. The combination therapy will include a treatment of
      intravenous beta-lactam for the first 7 days of treatment, in addition to the standard
      treatment (either vancomycin or daptomycin). The primary outcome measure will be
      complication-free survival 90 days post randomisation.</summary>
