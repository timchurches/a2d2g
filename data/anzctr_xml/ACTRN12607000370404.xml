  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiopulmonary bypass is a  procedure used for cardiac surgery. Currently during bypass we need to monitor blood gases to make sure we are oxygenating your blood. This monitoring, currently involves taking samples from the heart lung machine  and sending them off  for results.
We plan to assess a new device, that we can place on the heart lung machine, that will allow us to get blood gas results immediately and so we can act upon these straight away. 

The aim of this study is to assess the ability of the CDI 500 blood gas monitor  to detect blood gas parameters during your surgery.  In addition, this study will assess the impact on outcomes of the use of this monitor.</summary>
