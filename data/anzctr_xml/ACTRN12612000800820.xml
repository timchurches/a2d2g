    <concealment>Allogeneic donor recipient pairs fulfilling inclusion criteria for the trial will be identified at planning meetings of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit of Westmead Hospital or Childrenâ€™s Hospital Westmead. Donors and recipients will be approached by the principal investigator or by associate investigators working on the Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit who will explain the purposes and procedures of the trial. For unrelated donors, a request for consent will be made through the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry or via overseas registries once appropriate approvals have been obtained. Once donors and patients have received information sheets and given informed consent, the transplant will be registered on the trial and the following details will be recorded by the Clinical Trials Unit of the Haematology Department of Westmead Hospital: Westmead Hospital unique patient number (UPN) of recipient, donor and recipient age, donor and recipient viral serostatus, recipient diagnosis, planned conditioning therapy.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of combined infusion of immune cells and vaccination to boost immunity to infection after bone marrow transplantation. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are undergoing bone marrow transplantation for any type of non-malignant condition or haematological malignancy including but not limited to acute and chronic leukaemia, myelodysplasia, non Hodgkins and Hodgkins lymphoma or myeloma.

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be allocated to one of three groups. The first group will receive multi-infection specific T-cells intravenously (via the vein) 28 days after bone marrow transplantation. The second group will also receive this treatment in addition to the Fluvax vaccination. The third group will undergo the immune cell infusion, Fluvax vaccination and Varivax vaccination.

All participants will be assessed regularly over a period of 12 months in order to determine the safety of this treatment, and to determine whether it can prevent viral and fungal infection following allogeneic blood or marrow stem cell transplantation.</summary>
