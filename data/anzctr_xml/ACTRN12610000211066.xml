  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention based on  an european method known as Postural Global Reeducation and it was administered by one on one with a trained physiotherapist. It consists in adopting several body postures for stretching shortened muscles and strengthening  the antagonist ones. The treatment consisted in a total of ten sessions with 1 hour of duration, once a week. Then the participant before and after results are compared.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a single arm study and the participant baseline results are compared to their results after intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The electromyography exam verified a decrease of mean values of electrical activity in masticatory and cervical muscles. They were significant lower (p,0,05) at rest and postural alignment after treatment then before.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after ten treatment sessions</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the study demontrated objectively, by electromyography, the efficacy of the Global Postural Reeducation method in the muscle activity. This muscle balance restoration seems to benefit  the masticatory function.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Global Postural Reeducation method is a known european method for postural treatment, widely used in the clinical practice. However it is little scientifically tested. Besides, the temporomandibular joint and masticatory muscles are influenced by the body posture. Then, this study had the purpose of evaluate objectively the effect of this method in masticatory and cervical muscles acitvity in temporomandibular patients with postural deviation.</summary>
