    <interventions>Service change and Supporting Lifestyle and Activity Modification after TIA (S+SLAM-TIA) is a mixed methods within patient trial which seeks to determine the effect participation in a 18 week behaviour change program has in increasing time spent in Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) for the purpose of improving patient cardiovascular health. 
The 18 week behaviour change program is currently delivered by the HNE LHD Community Stroke Team (CST). The 18 week program is designed to equip patients with knowledge, confidence and strategies to identify their modifiable risk factors for the purpose of changing health behaviours so as to improve their cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. 
There are two phases to the program. The first phase involves 6 weeks of group education and exercise delivered in a community gym. Education sessions are conducted face-to-face by a CST clinician, once per week for 30 minutes. Content comprises of information about stroke etiology, risk factors for stroke, lifestyle changes to reduce the risk factors and practical goal setting. Exercise sessions are 1 hour in duration and conducted twice weekly for 6 weeks; the first 9 sessions are facilitated in person by a CST physiotherapist and exercise instructor and the final 3 sessions are independent exercise sessions with telehealth support. Participants complete 20-30 minutes of continuous cardiovascular exercise (treadmill, bike or rower) and functional strengthening (sit-to-stands, step ups, arm weights) with prompting to exercise at moderate intensity on the Borg RPE scale. Heart rate is also monitored to guide intensity of exercise  participants are encouraged to aim for 60-80% of their heart rate reserve. Group attendance is monitored by CST clinicians and any barriers to attending are addressed, using behaviour change methodology techniques if appropriate. 
The second phase of the program is 12 weeks of fortnightly telehealth supported health coaching (5 sessions) delivered by HNE LHD Connecting Care via telephone with each individual. These sessions are approximately 15 minutes in duration. The purpose of the session is to discuss the participants goals and progress, discuss any barriers in achieving the goals and how to overcome these.  
Usual care within this program is the collection of clinical outcomes at entry into the program (initial assessment/baseline) and at the end of both component one and two. Clinical outcomes are collected at baseline, 6, and 18 weeks.
Outcomes collected for the research study, S+SLAM-TIA, running in parallel to the CST SLAM-TIA will be collected at HMRI in the Clinical Trials Unit at entry into the program (baseline) and at the end of both component one and two (6 and 18 weeks). To evaluate the effectiveness of the program on achieving sustainable behaviour change, research outcomes will also be collected three months after the CST SLAM-TIA program has ceased (30 weeks).</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The co-primary outcomes will be the minutes per day spent in moderately vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 6 weeks.  For both of these we will aim to detect an effect that is 0.5SD (Cohen's d=0.5); this translates into a 15.5 minute change in MVPA and a 9mmHg change in SBP.  Assuming 80% power, adjusted p-value of 0.025 (to account for 2 primary outcomes), and a paired t-test to look at change from baseline to 6 weeks within each participant, the sample size needed will be 40 patients.

Secondary outcomes will look at trajectories over time (baseline, 6, 18 and 30 weeks) for MVPA, SBP and HbA1c using linear mixed models to handle repeated measures.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A TIA is a major warning sign for stroke. There is a 15% risk of stroke 90 days following initial event and the risk of cardiovascular events remains high 10-15 years post-TIA. It is best practice for TIA patients to receive secondary medical care to determine TIA cause and to commence preventative pharmacological therapy early post-event. 

Behaviour change programs which include education and group exercise (ie. advice and support to address modifiable CVD risk factors including hypertension, inactivity, poor diet etc) significantly reduce the odds of further cardiovascular events. These programs significantly increase the time TIA patients spend in moderately vigorous physical activity (ie. brisk walking). The latter is extremely important as increasing physical activity independently contributes to significant reductions in cardiovascular risk, with an inverse relationship between time spent in moderately vigorous physical activity and risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. 

Despite the evidence in support of the efficacy of behaviour change programs, TIA patients of Hunter New England Health Local Health District (HNE LHD) do not have access to an evidence based behaviour change program.

It is clear that there is an unmet need in this patient population. S+SLAM-TIA, Service change and Supporting Lifestyle and Activity Modification after Transient Ischemic Attack (S+SLAM-TIA), will address this service gap. 

S+SLAM-TIA will bring together research active (i) stroke specialists and (ii) general practitioners (GPs), and the Community Stroke Team (CST) to embed a clinically feasible evidence based behaviour change program. This program will be delivered in a community gym and will be comprised of group education and exercise with the use of telehealth and telephone coaching.

S+SLAM-TIA aims to:

1. Evaluate the development and implementation of a behaviour change program for people who have had a recent TIA or minor stroke

2. Increase the minutes/week people who have had a recent TIA or minor stroke spend in moderately vigorous physical activity

3. Improve the cardiovascular health, well-being and quality of life of people who have had a recent TIA or minor stroke

4. Determine the cost-effectiveness of this new service including the health service and community cost-savings that increasing physical activity levels in this population brings.
