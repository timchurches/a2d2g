    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Written informed consent will be provided pre-operatively. Randomisation will occur on the day of first passage of flatus. 
Randomisation will be performed by a research nurse, via a centralised web-based randomisation program which will allocate a treatment pack number. The allocated pack number will be dispensed to the patient whilst in hospital by the hospital pharmacy.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be computer generated with randomisation to control and intervention in a 1:1 ratio. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on an audit of local data, 60% of patients with a new ileosotomy have an output of greater than 1000 ml/day on discharge from hospital.

In order to detect a clinically relevant difference in the proportion of high output (&gt;1000 ml) of 30%, a study size of 78 (39 in each arm) is needed to detect such a difference with adequate level of significance (alpha 0.05, beta 0.8). Taking into consideration any subject dropouts or withdrawals we calculate we will need a target accrual of 86 patients.
Statistical analysis on the all data will consist of Chi Square and Fishers exact tests to compare categorical data. Continuous data conforming to a normal distribution will be compared using Student's t test.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the commonest complications of an ileostomy is the potential loss of a large amount of fluids and salts from the ileostomy, and this is called a high output ileostomy. A high output ileostomy can cause a person to become dehydrated and when the losses are large enough, it can lead to kidney failure, and re-presentation to hospital, with admission to hospital with long hospital stay 
The purpose of this study is to see if large ileostomy output can be prevented from occurring, rather than waiting for it to happen and then treating it.
