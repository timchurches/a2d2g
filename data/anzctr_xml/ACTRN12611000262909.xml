  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve 2x90 minute diabetes prevention education sessions for participants and their family members/friends and 13x60 minute peer led small group sessions over a 12 month period. Each group will consist of approximately 17 participants and family members and friends will be invited to attend some sessions such as those discussing diet and exercise. Each small group will be led by two peer leaders and supported by a Local Resource Person (well-respected member of community). Sessions address three linked themes: 1) how to prevent T2DM and the importance of modest but appreciable lifestyle change to accomplish this; 2) how best to provide emotional/social and environmental support for lifestyle change and a healthy lifestyle; and 3) how to access and link with community resources/supports for change, maintenance and sustainability. Participants are provided with a participant handbook, workbook and health information booklet at the commencement of the intervention. Peer leaders are selected by the groups and attend 2x peer leader training sessions. Peer leader training is conducted over 2 full days  at the beginning of the intervention (after session 1 when the peer leaders are selected) and then another two days training after the fifth small group session
Peer leaders also communicate following each session (fortnightly for the first four sessions then monthly from session 5) with the K-DPP intervention team to provide feedback on how the session went and obtain suggestions and support if required for future sessions.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Currently, there is no uniform practice in India for those at high risk of developing T2DM, therefore following baseline assessment, standard care (SC) participants will receive health care advice in the form of a Healthy Living Resource Guide that we have used in similar trials. This guide will comprise culturally appropriate written and pictorial information in Malayalam about a healthy lifestyle and lowering diabetes risk, as well as relevant advice concerning tobacco use, diet, and physical activity in their local community. In addition, SC participants will be advised to inform their health provider of their high risk status at the next visit. They will be contacted by letter and/or telephone for follow-up assessments, which will be conducted as per the intervention arm.</comparator>

    <concealment>Neyyatinkara taluk has four legislative assembly constituencies with 603 polling booths. Unfortunately there was no map available that shows the contiguous polling booths across legislative assembly borders. Therefore, polling booths that lay along the border were removed and 60 polling booths from the remaining 359 polling booths were selected. Contiguous polling booths were replaced by the next polling booth to preclude the risk of contamination across polling booth boundaries. The 60 polling booths were be randomly assigned to intervention or control (health information) conditions by a Biostatistician Chief Investigator who will be blinded to all other characteristics of the sampled units. Eligible residents (as determined by the electoral roll) will be invited to participate in-person, by a home screening data collector. Participants that meet the inclusion criteria will be consented and complete the Indian Diabetes Risk Score during a screening interview in their home.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple random assignment of the polling booths into intervention or control conditions will be determined by using a constant block size and stratified by size of polling booth using Stata statistical software, Release 12. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>A modified simple random sample of 60 polling booths will be selected from the 359 polling booths remaining following excluding the polling booths that lie along legislative assembly borders (approx population/polling booth= 900-1500)  located in the Neyyattinkara Taluk (or sub-district) of Kerala State. This is the largest taluk in the Thiruvananthapuram district (area of 571 km squared), with the greatest number of polling booths. To preclude the risk of contamination across polling booth boundaries, any clusters of contiguous polling booths in the sample will be replaced and re-sampled. The 60 polling booths will then be randomly assigned to intervention or control (standard care) conditions by a bio-statistician who will be blind to all other characteristics of the sampled units, and by using a constant block size and stratified by size of polling booth, using Stata statistical software package</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>India has the largest number of individuals with T2DM globally, and this is expected to double by 2030.  Thus, the prevention of T2DM, through a combination of individual-, community- and population-based approaches, needs urgent attention.  This will be the first implementation trial to target a rural population of India at high risk of developing T2DM by using a validated risk-assessment tool. In this study, we will use an innovative new approach to screening and intervention that first identifies individuals at high risk on the basis of a validated diabetes risk questionnaire. This offers a potentially cost-efficient and low burden approach to screening, which will also enable the detection of those at risk. Our study will evaluate a culturally-appropriate group-delivered lifestyle intervention, already demonstrated to be effective in other populations. We will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this program in a developing country.</summary>
