  <interventions>
    <interventions>Perioperative analgesia:
Intravenous arm of the trial:
1 g paracetamol
40 mg parecoxib
20 mg oxycontin orally in the post anaesthesia care unit

Intravenous paracetamol and intravenous parecoxib are given by the attending anaesthetist after delivery of the neonate, prior to the parturient leaving the operating theatre to be managed in the Postoperative Care Unit (PACU). Intravenous paracetamol is given over 10 minutes, whereas intravenous parecoxib is often given as a push. Any variation to this protocol will be recorded as a protocol deviation.

As per this study protocol, there are no specific analgesic requirements, however, it is usual practice for the anaesthetist to chart on the patient's medical chart, either Targin or Oxycontin 10-20 mg twice daily and paracetamol 1g four times daily as a regular dose. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), either ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily or diclofenac 100 mg three times daily is charted either as a regular dose, or as required, oxycodone 5 - 10 mg as required is charted and occasionally tramadol 50 - 100 mg four times daily as required is charted as well. All of these medications are given once the patient has left PACU and is being managed on the ward.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control (standard treatment). Initial perioperative analgesia via the rectal route:
1 g paracetamol 
100 mg diclofenac 
30 mg oxycodone (Proladone) 

All of the above medications are given per rectum by the obstetrician at the completion of the caesarean section, immediately prior to transfer to PACU.  Any variation to this protocol will be recorded as a protocol deviation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain assessment at discharge, as determined by participant responses to a multidimensional pain score, which has previously been validated for use in labouring women  SF-MPQ, when the intravenous route of initial perioperative, post-caesarean section analgesia is compared to the per rectum route of perioperative, post-caesarean analgesia.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>At 0800 on day 3 post procedure, immediately prior to discharge from the hospital, or on the same day at home by midwives, if the patient was discharged home earlier.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual analogue pain score at time of discharge from hospital
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 0800 on day 3 post procedure, immediately prior to discharge from the hospital, or on the same day at home by midwives, if the patient was discharged home earlier.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Present pain intensity at time of discharge from the hospital.  The present pain intensity is part of the form for the SF-MPQ, which has previously been validated for use in labouring women and is scored by the placement of a tick beside the word in a vertical ist of words that describes present pain intensity (PPI) from no pain to excruciating where:
0 = No pain
1 = Mild
2 = Discomforting
3 = Distressing
4 = Horrible
5 = Excruciating</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 0800 on day 3 post procedure, immediately prior to discharge from the hospital, or on the same day at home by midwives, if the patient was discharged home earlier.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Patient's determination of their worst pain experienced since caesarean section, as determined by a visual analogue scale.</outcome>

      <outcome>Quality of recovery post surgery as determined by the QoR-15 questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 0800 on day 3 post procedure, immediately prior to discharge from the hospital, or on the same day at home by midwives, if the patient was discharged home earlier.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total opioid consumption via the two different routes. From the patient's medication chart, the total opioid consumption for the first 48 hours post caesarean section is compiled. If the patient received morphine or fentanyl, in addition to the medications listed previously, these are converted into oxycodone equivalents. Likewise, if the patient received tramadol, this is converted into oxycodone equivalents, such that the total opioid consumption for the first 48 hours may be summated. </outcome>
      <timepoint>From the time of elective caesarean section, up to and including midnight of day 2, post procedure, with the day of surgery being day 0.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The total cost of all analgesia required by patients allocated to the two different groups will be summated.  This will include the cost of opioids, as well as the cost of any associated ancilliary analgesia (paracetamol and NSAIDS).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>From the time of elective caesarean section, up to and including midnight of day 2, post procedure, with the day of surgery being day 0.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Recently, a prospective audit was conducted at the Northern Hospital.  This audit assigned 50 women to receive intravenous analgesia and a further 50 women received per rectum analgesia post caesarean section, which was either an elective or an emergency procedure. Analysis of the data revealed that the group who had received intravenous analgesia had a lower 48 hour oxycodone usage of 148.9 +/- 36.7 compared to the per rectum analgesia group, which had a 48 hour oxycodone usage of 170.0 +/- 47.5 mg.  This difference is a 12.4% reduction.  Despite this apparent difference in opioid requirements, there did not appear to be a difference in pain scores as reflected by the fact that for three of the four pain questionnaires, all of which were unidimensional measurements of pain, there was no statistical difference between the two groups.  For the fourth pain questionnaire, which measures the multidimensional aspect of pain, a statistical difference was found favouring the group who had received intravenous analgesia.

Therefore, we wish to expand upon these findings and would like to propose a non-blinded randomised controlled trial comparing the intravenous route to the per rectum route.  Based on data previously obtained, if the intravenous route provided better analgesia, we propose that there should be a 20% reduction in the total pain score as determined by the multidimensional pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ).

Using data from previous audits, Mr Mark Tacey, a biostatistician, has determined that we will need to recruit 89 participants into each arm of the trial, using a power of 80% and a two-sided alpha of 0.05%.  To allow for incomplete and missing data, we have increased the sample size to 100 participants for each arm of the trial, thus making a total of 200 participants to be recruited.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently, opinion amongst obstetric anaesthetists is divided as to whether an intravenous (IV) route is superior to the per rectum (PR) route for perioperative mangagement of post caesarean section pain. 

Recently, a prospective audit was conducted at the Northern Hospital.  This audit assigned 50 women to receive IV analgesia and a further 50 women received PR analgesia post caesarean section, which was either an elective or an emergency procedure. Analysis of the data revealed that the group who had received IV analgesia had a lower 48 hour oxycodone usage of 148.9 +/- 36.7 compared to the PR analgesia group, which had a 48 hour oxycodone usage of 170.0 +/- 47.5 mg.  This difference is a 12.4% reduction.  Despite this apparent difference in opioid requirements, there did not appear to be a difference in pain scores as reflected by the fact that for three of the four pain questionnaires, all of which were unidimensional measurements of pain, there was no statistical difference between the two groups.  For the fourth pain questionnaire, which measures the multidimensional aspect of pain, a statistical difference was found favouring the group who had received IV analgesia.

Therefore, we wish to expand upon these findings and would like to propose a non-blinded randomised controlled trial comparing the IV route to the PR route.
