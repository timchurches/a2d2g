  <interventions>
    <interventions>A non-tethered novel micro mobile compression device built into the sole of a shoe will be worn by seated adults over a 60 minute period. The pressure exerted by a small thrusting pad on the plantar venous plexus equates to 314 mmHg. Only one micro mobile compression device will be worn by each subject, which foot receives the intervention will be randomly allocated. The opposite leg will receive the alternative intervention and will be worn at the same time. The effect of each intervention on the popliteal vein blood flow will be measured on each leg.</interventions>
    <comparator>A below knee graduated compression stocking will be worn as an active comparator in the same seated adults, on the leg that has not been allocated the micro mobile compression device, over a 60 minute timeframe. The graduated compression stockings exert between 18-21mmhg of pressure at the ankle.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pneumatic compression devices are commonly used in deep vein thrombosis prevention in the hospital setting, but are often too cumbersome to permit easy ambulation with the device. A novel non-tethered portable mechanical compression device is being compared with a below knee graduated compression stocking, in their relative ability to affect lower limb blood flow in seated healthy adults.</summary>
