  <interventions>
    <interventions>Application of Single Use, negative pressure wound dressing to  medium size (between 50mmx50mm to 100mmx150mm in dimension) split skin graft. Dressing size will be directed by the size of the skin graft required. The dressing will be applied by the treating clinician at time of operation to apply the skin graft, and will take approximately 5-10 minutes to cut to size and apply. It is to remain in place for total duration of 5-7 days (selected on a case by case basis according to patient's needs and scheduled follow-up) and patient can be discharged from hospital from day after surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Application of standard protocol of barrier wound dressing to medium size (between 50mmx50mm to 100mmx150mm in dimension) split skin graft. The current standard protocol of barrier wound dressing on SSG consisting of a combination of jelonet/gauze/hypafix and/or crepe bandaging. This will be selected according to position of the graft, with grafts to limbs more likely to require crepe bandaging for re-information. Patient is to remain as in-patient under direct observation until day 5-7 after initial surgical intervention</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Equivalent/improved wound healing rates in direct observation measured as total graft take. Patients will have a photograph of their wound pre-graft and at review in outpatients. These will be subjectively assessed by an independent and blinded surgical consultant who will grade the level of take. Further to this, an objective measure of the total graft size and take will be assessed with the Visitrak system at time of outpatient review.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between 5-14 days after initial surgical procedure of split skin grafting.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with dressing type, dependent on comfort, impact on activities of daily living and ease of care. This will be directed by a likert patient questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At initial outpatient review, between 5-14 days after initial surgical procedure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complication rates of two dressings, including but not limited to surgical site infection and bleeding. This will be clinically assessed at time of outpatient review.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients will be identified by doctors working in the Royal Adelaide Hospital Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. This may include patients identified either through elective admissions with initial contact through the Royal Adelaide Hospital Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Outpatient Department OR emergency admissions assessed by Royal Adelaide Hospital Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Registrar/Consultant in the Emergency Department. Patients will be allocated by a computer based random number generator and assigned to an intervention concealed in a numbered opaque envelope to be opened by the treating surgeon when the patient is first brought into the operating theater for their initial operation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be allocated into the two treatment arms of the trial by using a randomisation table created by computer
software (computerised sequence generation). Randomisation will be conducted by a junior member of surgical team not directly involved in the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Negative Pressure Wound therapy (NPWT) has been used in surgery for over 15 years for a whole range of wounds with good outcomes and many advantages to promote wound healing.
Recent technological advancements have led to the production of a single use NPWT device designed for small to medium size wounds with low-moderate levels of exudates. 
Early uses of the dressing in literature have shown through individual case studies the potential use of Pico dressing for skin grafts leading to an earlier discharge date. However, there have been no broader studies of the use of Pico dressing in this specific treatment group. The Pico dressing is a type of single use negative pressure wound therapy produced by company Smith and Nephew.
The study has been designed as a randomised control prospective trial. The main hypothesis to be tested is that the use of a single use negative pressure wound therapy with early discharge from hospital will have equal efficacy in wound healing to the current protocol of wound therapy.</summary>
