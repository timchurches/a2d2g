  <interventions>
    <interventions>Early range of motion exercises will be prescribed by the surgical team, and be carried out under the guidance of physiotherapists at Christchurch Hospital. This will commence at the two week postoperative mark. The exercise regime will comprise of various ankle exercises lasting 20 minutes in total, and this will be repeated twice a day, for four weeks. The participants will get educated on the exercises by the physiotherapist or surgical team, and the exercises will be performed at home by the participants. Participants will be contacted by phone weekly to ensure no problems are encountered with the exercise, and also to increase compliance.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to return to work is our primary outcome. This will be assessed at the outpatient follow up clinic at the 12 week postoperative mark.  If the participant has not returned to work at this time, a phone interview will be performed at the 16 week mark to ascertain this information.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 and 16 weeks post surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ankle range of motion. This will be measured using the goniometer at the relevant follow-up clinics. Specifically, ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion will be measured.</outcome>

      <outcome>Patient satisfaction Questionnaire using the Olerud &amp; Molander Ankle Score  The participants will fill out the score sheet at the 12 week follow-up clinic.

    <concealment>Information of this study will be provided to patients whilst they are waiting for surgery in hospital. The first opportunity to discuss the study and its implications will be at this point. The participants will have at least 24 hours to contemplate the study on their own with or without support persons. Subsequently, the study coordinator will then have another discussion with the patients, and obtain their informed consent. The participants will have opportunities to discuss their participation in the study at subsequent postoperative follow up appointments. The participants will then be allocated to the intervention or control group by block randomization. Allocation concealment will be performed with the use of sealed opaque envelopes.  Each envelope (stem) will have further sealed opaque envelopes (branches) within them (the number of envelopes will be determined by the block size). The branch envelopes will have either a 'control' or 'intervention', predetermined by random binary sequence generator. One stem envelope will be used for each strata (fracture type) until the desired number of block has been used up. A new stem envelope will be opened at this stage.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation will be done by stratified random assignment. There will be 4 strata, divided by the fracture type (Weber A, Weber B, Weber C, medial malleolus). </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Estimation of sample size: Standard power 80%, alpha value 0.05. The effect value was based on current available literature on early postoperative range of motion in ankle fractures; mean time to return to work was 96.6 days (SD 36.4).

Data will be described using means and standard deviations or medians and ranges, as well as application of parametric and non-parametric tests to test hypotheses respectively, depending on the distribution of obtained data. Chi-squared tests will be applied to comparisons of categorical data. Univariable and multi variable adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be used to explore variables associated with differences in outcome.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to compare the safety and effectiveness of early postoperative range of motion exercises in an ankle brace, versus conventional cast immobilization, in patients who undergo surgical fixation of their ankle fractures. The outcomes measured will be time to return to work, ankle range of motion, and patient satisfaction scores. We hypothesize that the early postoperative range of motion exercise group will have better outcomes compared to the conventional cast group.</summary>
