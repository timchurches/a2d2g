             for =18 months but =30 months for early breast cancer.

        Note: Patients who have received neo/adjuvant endocrine treatment within a clinical trial
        and patients who have received pharmaco-prevention are eligible.

          -  The adjuvant endocrine therapy must have stopped within 1 month prior to enrollment.

          -  Patient wishes to become pregnant. Note: Patients who have undergone
             oocyte/embryo/ovarian tissue cryopreservation at breast cancer diagnosis and/or have a
             previous history of assisted reproductive technology (ART) are eligible.

          -  Breast cancer for which patient is receiving endocrine therapy must have been
             histologically-proven stage I-III, endocrine-responsive (i.e., estrogen and/or
             progesterone receptor positive, according to local definition of positive, determined
             using immunohistochemistry (IHC)), and treated with curative intent.

        Note:

          -  Patients with synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer (diagnosed histologically
             within 2 months) are eligible.

          -  Patient with invasive breast cancer or synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer
             (diagnosed histologically within 2 months) during pregnancy are eligible.

          -  Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations are eligible.

          -  Patients could have received neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, or other systemic therapy
             (e.g., neo/adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy) according to institutional policy and
             patient's desire.

          -  Patient must be premenopausal at breast cancer diagnosis, as determined locally and
             documented in patient record.

          -  Patient must be without clinical evidence of loco-regional and distant disease, as
             evaluated according to institutional assessment standards and documented in the
             patient record.

          -  Written informed consent (IC) for trial participation must be signed and dated by the
             patient and the investigator prior to enrollment.

          -  Written consent to biological material submission, indicating the patient has been
             informed of and agrees to tissue and blood material use, transfer and handling, must
             be signed and dated by the patient and the investigator prior to any procedures
             specific for this trial.

          -  The patient has been informed of and agrees to data transfer and handling, in
             accordance with national data protection guidelines.

          -  Patients with previous or concomitant non-breast invasive malignancy.

          -  Exceptions are limited exclusively to patients with the following previous
             malignancies, if adequately treated: basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in
             situ non-breast carcinoma, contra- or ipsilateral in situ breast carcinoma, stage Ia
             carcinoma of the cervix.

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that would make the patient inappropriate for study
             participation or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the patient's
             safety.

          -  Patients with a history of noncompliance to medical treatments and/or considered
             potentially unreliable.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The best available evidence suggests that pregnancy after breast cancer does not increase a
      woman's risk of developing a recurrence from her breast cancer. In particular, the most
      recent data suggest that this is the case also in women with a hormone receptor-positive
      breast cancer. There is also no indication of increased risk for delivery complications or
      for the newborn. The aim of the study is to investigate if temporary interruption of
      endocrine therapy, with the goal to permit pregnancy, is associated with a higher risk of
      breast cancer recurrence.The study aims also to evaluate different specific indicators
      related to fertility, pregnancy and breast cancer biology in young women. A
      psycho-oncological companion study on fertility concerns, psychological well-being and
      decisional conflicts will be conducted in interested Centers.</summary>
