  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - polypill
Treatment: drugs - Usual cardiovascular medications

Experimental: polypill - Red Heart Pill Version 1 and Red Heart Pill Version 2. In general, participants with a history of coronary heart disease will be given version 1, and those with a history of stroke or cerebrovascular disease will be given version 2.

Active Comparator: Usual Care - Participants in the usual care arm will take their usual cardiovascular medications. The participants will be seen as needed by their usual doctor between study visits.


Treatment: drugs: polypill
The polypill will be taken once/day in the form of a hard capsule, to be taken orally. There are two versions of the polypill (Red Heart Pill):
Version 1 contains aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, Lisinopril 10mg and Atenolol 50mg; Version 2 contains aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, Lisinopril 10mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg.

Treatment: drugs: Usual cardiovascular medications
Participants in the 'Usual Care' arm will continue to take the separate, individual medications prescribed by their usual doctor, e.g. aspirin, blood pressure lowering drugs, statins.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Adults (= 18 years)

          -  The participant is able to give informed consent.

          -  Established atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) or high cardiovascular risk,
             of for individuals without established cardiovascular disease, a calculated 5 year CVD
             risk of 15% or greater (calculated using the 1991 Anderson Framingham risk equation
             with adjustments as defined by the New Zealand Guidelines Group recommendations)

          -  The trial Investigator considers that each of the polypill components are indicated

          -  The trial Investigator is unsure as to whether a polypill-based strategy or usual care
             is better.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Contraindication to any of the components of the polypill (e.g. known intolerance to
             aspirin, statins, or ACE inhibitors,pregnancy or likely to become pregnant during the
             treatment period).

          -  The treating doctor considers that changing a participant's cardiovascular medications
             would put the participant at risk (e.g. symptomatic heart failure, high dose ÃŸblocker
             required to manage angina or for rate control in atrial fibrillation,accelerated
             hypertension, severe renal insufficiency, a history of severe resistant hypertension)

          -  Known situation where medication regimen might be altered for a significant length of
             time, e.g. current acute cardiovascular event, planned coronary bypass graft
             operation.

          -  Unlikely to complete the trial (e.g. lifethreatening condition other than
             cardiovascular disease) or adhere to the trial procedures or attend study visits (e.g.
             major psychiatric condition, dementia).</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with established cardiovascular disease need secondary prevention that addresses
      multiple risk factors. Complexity &amp; cost confer particularly difficult barriers to uptake of
      treatment; recovery from a stroke or heart attack typically necessitates multiple drugs for
      cholesterol, blood pressure and platelet function. A low-cost, fixed-dose, once-daily
      combination polypill, the Red Heart Pill, has been formulated by Dr Reddy's Laboratories.
      UMPIRE will evaluate whether provision of this polypill compared with usual medications
      improves adherence and clinical outcomes among high-risk patients in Europe and India. The
      results will be used to develop recommendations for equitable access.</summary>
