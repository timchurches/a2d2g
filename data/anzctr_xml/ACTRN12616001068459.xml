  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive restructuring intervention administered by a post graduate student in clinical psychology. Intervention delivered face to face, delivered once and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. Is delivered in a lab at the University of Sydney.  Intervention is structured but tailored to reflect an individuals unique concerns about the upcoming speech task they will be asked to participate in. One week following the intervention participants complete a 3 minute speech task on a topic of their choosing. The speech task is filmed to allow two independent judges to appraise it for performance at a later time point. No feedback is provided to the participant regarding performance. 

Procedure is as follows:
 The cognitive intervention involved initially presenting the results of a study by Rapee and Lim (1992) in which it was found that people with and without social phobia have a tendency to appraise their performance in a speech task more negatively then an independent judge. Following this a brief introduction to cognitive restructuring was provided by showing a completed thought monitoring form in which the thought The raters will think I look stupid had been challenged by looking at evidence against the thought, and the true probability and consequence of the thought. The participants were then guided in challenging any negative thoughts they had regarding the upcoming speech task by filling out a blank thought monitoring form.  The cognitive intervention took approximately 30 minutes to complete. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control group do not complete any intervention.

Note: Originally study design included two additional groups of  individuals, both without Social Anxiety disorder, with one of these group receiving the intervention and the other serving as a control group without Social Anxiety Disorder. Delivering the intervention to the former group was ceased after approximately 5 participants due to it becoming apparent the intervention had little to no affect on this non-socially anxious group. While participants without social anxiety disorder were still recruited, and completed the same study protocol as the non-intervention group, their data was not included in the write up of this trial. It is hoped that this data will be used in analyses for separate studies in the future. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power analysis was initially carried out with a different study design which was later modified. Originally study design included two additional groups of  individuals, both without Social Anxiety disorder, with one of these group receiving the intervention and the other serving as a control group without Social Anxiety Disorder. Delivering the intervention to the former group was ceased after approximately 5 participants due to it becoming apparent the intervention had little to no affect on this non-socially anxious group. While participants without social anxiety disorder were still recruited, their data was not included in the study.

 Sample size analysis was conducted on this original 2x2 study design. GPower indicated that a total sample size of 76 participants was required for this initial design with power of .8 and alpha set at .05 to detect a large effect size [Fc(3, 72) = 2.7318]. A revised sample size analyses was not conducted on the altered study design. However as this is a preliminary study, findings were aimed to guide future research designing more powerful interventions with a larger sample size. Sixty eight participants were ultimately included in the write up of this study, all of whom met criteria for a Social Anxiety Disorder diagnosis. 

 Statistical analyses include MANOVA's, Univariate ANOVA's and hierarchical regression.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>According to the cognitive models of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), negative rumination is a key maintaining factor in the vicious cycle of social anxiety. However, there is a lack of research investigating treatment effects on rumination in social anxiety, as well as other key cognitive variables. The current study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a brief intervention on a range of cognitive processes, most notably negative rumination. Furthermore, the predictors of negative rumination and state anxiety are investigated.
Specifically, we hypothesise that: 1)Participants in the cognitive restructuring condition will report reduced negative affect, state anxiety, negative rumination, and threat appraisals, as well as stronger performance appraisal, objective performance, and positive self-beliefs relating to the speech task as comparted to SAD individuals who do not receive the intervention.  
2) Despite recent evidence suggestion that more cognitive processes are at play during pre-event rumination than post-event rumination, making the process potentially more difficult to address in a single-session intervention, we further anticipate that the cognitive intervention will significantly reduce both pre-and post-event rumination, comparted to the socially anxious group whom do not receive the intervention 3) The predictors of levels of negative rumination, both pre- and post, will mirror those reported by Previous research
