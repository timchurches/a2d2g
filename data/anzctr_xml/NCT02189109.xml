          5. Manageable risks associated with potential radiation necrosis in the radiation field,
             based on size of the field and proximity to eloquent brain regions (as assessed by the
             investigator).

          7. Congenital long QT syndrome.

          8. Clinically-significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.

          9. Active major infection requiring treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical trial is testing the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of NVX-108
      administered via intravenous infusion in combination with standard radiation and
      chemotherapy.

      NVX-108 is being developed to increase the amount of oxygen delivered to tumors which is
      hoped to increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy.</summary>
