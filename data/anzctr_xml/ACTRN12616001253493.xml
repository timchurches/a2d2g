    <interventions>The study will employ a mixed methods design to produce a prototype eHealth intervention for treating anxiety in young people with long-term physical conditions. The study will involve two phases:

During the first phase, a prototype eHealth intervention will be designed and refined via a co-design process with young people from Starship Hospital with long-term physical conditions.  3 stages of consultation will be undertaken, with 4 focus groups of up to 12 participants at each stage.  At least one focus group at each stage will be arranged for Maori young people. By the end of this phase, a working prototype that is ready for pilot testing will be created and beta-tested to de-bug it and ensure it is compatible with end-user expectations. 

 During the second phase, an open trial will be undertaken with 20 young people aged 13-18 years. with long-term physical conditions from Starship Hospital. Each will be loaned a device (ipad or similar tablet) on which the prototype intervention, questionnaires and scales have been pre-loaded. They will be given up to 4 weeks to complete the intervention, at a rate of their choice.    The intervention is likely to be an eHealth game comprising of between 5-10 modules of CBT-based therapy (i.e. relaxation training, cognitive restructuring and others) and to take between 1-5 hours to complete.   The specifics of the intervention will be determined during the CO-DESIGN process. Intervention use will be assessed using an inbuilt tracker.  No strategies will be used to improve fidelity.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical methodology: Associate Professor Chris Frampton will provide statistical advice for the study.  He will assist in the development of a statistical analysis plan and oversee the analysis of quantitative data.  Quantitative data will be analysed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS (Statistical Software Package). Analyses will include basic descriptive statistics (e.g., number of duration of use, changes in anxiety score and demographic characteristics of the sample). t Tests and McNemars chi-square tests will be used to assess the statistical significance of changes in anxiety scores over time. A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be taken to indicate statistical significance and 95% confidence intervals will be used to establish the extent of any difference between pre and post measures. A sample size of n=20 will enable detection of changes within the study group with effect sizes of 0.40 or more as statistically significance (alpha = 0.05) with 80% power.  Qualitative data will be analysed using a general inductive approach with collated text analysed to identify emerging themes, which will then be independently coded by two researchers and consensus reached by adjudication. Data analysis will be conducted once saturation of themes has been achieved.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to co-design and test a prototype eHealth game for treating anxiety in young people with long-term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. A series of focus groups will be undertaken with young people (particularly Maori young people) at Starship Hospital to refine the prototype intervention.  The intervention will be based on well-established cognitive behaviour therapy and integrate biofeedback relaxation, for which there is recent evidence off effectiveness. An open trial with 20 young people will be undertaken to determine how acceptable, usable and effective the prototype intervention is. The information from this study will inform the design of a larger randomised controlled trial. If acceptable and useful, this eHealth intervention may offer a cost-effective and clinically useful solution for addressing the psychological needs of over 16,000 young people in New Zealand.</summary>
