  <interventions>
    <interventions>6 week rehabilitation program where patients attend twice a week and have land based exercises of 1 hour, water based exercises of 1 hour and information sessions of 1 hour.
Patients will complete the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the FACIT Fatigue Scale on admission to the program and on completion, as well as a personal satisfaction survey developed by the researcher.
The researcher has 18 years experience as a registered nurse and 10 years experience working in oncology rehabilitation.
The Exercise Physiologist has 6 years experience.
All exercise sessions are supervised and structured.  Patients are assessed by an exercise physiologist prior to commencing to assess the ability of the patient and the exercise program is then prescribed. 
The information sessions are face-to-face and are presented by our in house allied health team. Sessions use a variety of mediums, but most are powerpoint presentations or group discussions. The topics covered are the importance of exercise, stress management, pacing yourself, living with a chronic illness, and healthy diet options.
If a patient misses 50% or greater of the hydrotherapy sessions, their outcomes won't be included in this study.
All sessions are group based.
Patients attend twice a week for 2 hours each day, and all sessions are located onsite at St John of God Health Care Frankston Rehabilitation Hospital.</interventions>
