  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomized study, on arrival at the venue participants (20 healthy volunteers) will receive a standard dose of 1 g paracetamol (two 500 mg tablets), and will receive one of the following treatments.  

Treatment 1:	Tablets will be swallowed whole with 250 ml of water.
Treatment 2:	Tablets will be swallowed whole with 250 ml of water.
Treatment 3:	Tablets that have been crushed and mixed with 100 ml of water will be swallowed, followed by another 150 ml water to be used to rinse the mouth during swallowing.
Treatment 4:	Tablets that have been crushed and mixed with a commercial thickened fluid (15 g EasyThick) will be swallowed, followed by 250 ml water to be used to rinse the mouth during swallowing.
Treatment 5:	Tablets that have been crushed and mixed with jam (15 g) will be swallowed, followed by 250 ml of water to be used to rinse the mouth during swallowing.

    <statisticalmethods>In order to address the primary aims of the study, a sample size of 20 participants has been selected.  Previous research has indicated that the between-subject variability in the extent and rate of absorption of paracetamol in healthy participants is within 15% ; therefore, in order to detect a 10% difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between the treatment groups, at 80% power and an a-level of 0.05, a sample size of 18 participants is considered sufficient.  An extra 2 participants will be recruited to allow for a predicted 10% withdrawal rate.  .  

Paracetamol plasma concentration time profiles will be used for calculating absorption pharmacokinetics.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using concentrationtime profile, and a standard model-independent approach will be used.  Pharmacokinetic parameters also include: area under the concentrationtime profile, maximum observed concentration, apparent volume of distribution.  
To investigate the effect of thickening agents on paracetamol absorption, between group statistical comparisons of pharmacokinetic data will be performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA).  ANOVA will be used to assess the effect of treatment, sequence, period and subject nested in sequence, on natural logtransformed data of AUC, Cmax, and rate of absorption.  The residual error (error mean square) will be used to construct the 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of treatment means. Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis will be conducted using validated software.  Treatment differences will be determined by P values and the significance will be set at a a-level of 0.05 for all statistical analyses.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People having issues swallowing their medications may crush it and mix with food or drinks. In aged care homes and for dysphagic patients it is common to thicken water with commercial thickening agents to provide the correct viscosity to enable swallowing.  In an in vitro study, we have found that drug dissolution was consistently reduced when the tablets were crushed and mixed with a commercially available thickened fluid consisting of xanthan gum and maltodextrin.  It was observed that mixing crushed tablets with thickened fluid caused prolonged dissolution time compared to other mixers (water, jam, yogurt, honey and juice) and compared to dissolution of the whole tablet.  

Based on our in vitro data, we hypothesise that the rate of drug absorption will be significantly slowed, and the maximum drug concentration reached will be reduced when a drug is crushed and mixed with the thickened fluid in comparison to the whole tablet, crushed tablet delivered in water, and crushed tablet mixed with jam.
