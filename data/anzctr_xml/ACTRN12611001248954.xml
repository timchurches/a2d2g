    <scientifictitle>Femoral Artery closure using the Cardiva VASCADE Vascular Closure System (VCS) to reduce time to hemostasis and reduce time to ambulation and hospital discharge versus manual compression in patients who have undergone diagnostic or interventional endovascular catheterization procedures utilizing 6 Fr or 7 Fr procedural sheaths</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Cardiva VASCADE VCS consists of a sterile disposable catheter containing a deployable extravascular collagen patch and a clip.  The VASCADE VCS is intended to seal a femoral arterial access site at the end of any procedure that uses a 6 or 7  French introducer sheath to access the femoral artery.  This is a one time use device.  The procedure of deploying the collagen patch takes less than 3-5 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>VASCADE VCS / Manual Compression
Randomization will be 2:1 treatment device to control ratio

Manual compression is the current standard treatment for post-procedure vascular management and involves compression applied by hand to the vascular access site until hemostasis is achieved, according to the Institution's guidelines.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary effectiveness endpoint is the time to achieve arterial hemostasis following device removal for Cardiva VASCADE VCS and sheath removal for manual compression</outcome>
      <timepoint>Index procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary safety endpoint is the 30-day rate of combined access site-related major complications.  Major complications include:
- Access site-related bleeding requiring transfusion - assessment of site-related bleeding is via direct observation and excessive blood loss would be determined via Institutional guidelines
- Vascular injury requiring repair - prolonged bleeding would require further assessment for vascular injury using techniques such as ultrasound imaging
- New ipsilateral lower extremity ischemia causing a threat to the viability of the limb and requiring surgical or additional percutaneous intervention - compromised blood flow is documented by subject symptoms, physical exam and/or a decreased or absent blood flow on lower extremity angiogram
- Access site-related infection - assessment made based on subject symptoms and physical exam
- New onset access site-related neuropathy in the ipsilateral lower extremity requiring surgical repair - assessment made based on subject symptoms and physical exam
- Permanent access site-related nerve injury (greater than 30 days) - based on subject symptoms and physical exam</outcome>
      <timepoint>Index procedure and 30 day Follow-up post procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary effectiveness endpoint is time to ambulation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Elapsed time between device removal for Cardiva VASCADE VCS and sheath removal for manual compression, and when subject stands and walks 20 feet without evidence of arterial re-bleeding from the access site</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to discharge eligibility</outcome>
      <timepoint>Elapsed time between device removal for Cardiva VASCADE VCS and sheath removal for manual compression, and when subject is medically able to be discharged based solely on access site assessment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to hospital discharge</outcome>
      <timepoint>Elapsed time between device removal for Cardiva VASCADE VCS and sheath removal for manual compression, and when subject actually is discharged from the hospital, as recorded on the discharge order.</timepoint>
