  <interventions>
    <interventions>Conventional low frequency (35Hz stimulation of quadriceps, hamstrings and gluteal muscles) functional electrical stimulation supported recumbent cycling.  Participants are seated with their lower limbs strapped into pedals, electrical stimulation of lower limb muscles assists voluntary muscle work to cycle against a mechanical resistance set by the bicycle.  Subjects will train for 40 minutes, resistance will be increased over the training period to ensure power output is optimised.  Weight resistance (set to the individuals 8 repetition maximum) will be applied for inner range quadriceps muscle strength training.  Range will be from approximately 20 degrees of knee flexion to full knee extension.  Three repetitions of eight repeated contractions, with a two minute rest between each, will be used.  Nine sessions of training over three weeks (3 per week) will be used in this arm of the study.
This is a cross-over study.  First arm duration - 3 weeks; washout period - 2 weeks; second arm duration - 3 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Higher frequency (100Hz) electrical stimulation to support recumbent cycling training (40 minutes per session) and inner range quadriceps muscle strengthening (3 x 8RM as described above). Nine treatment sessions over three weeks (3 per week) will be applied in this arm of the study.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) supported standing &gt; 100% of baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time points: Measured pre-training, after first intervention phase (ie after three weeks of training) and after second intervention phase (ie after six weeks of training).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of repeated sit-to-stand/stand-to-sit cycles before fatigue. Fatigue will be determined by the inability of the subject to perform the movement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time points: Measured pre-training, after first intervention phase (ie after three weeks of training) and after second intervention phase (ie after six weeks of training).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional ability to reach forward and to the side while standing with FES support.  The subject will be filmed from above while moving the hands over a flat board with a grid imprinted on it.  Each hand in turn will be moved in an arc forward, then sideways. Then both hands will be moved together forwards. Amplitude of movement will be measured from digitisation of the video film.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time points: Measured pre-training, after first intervention phase (ie after three weeks of training) and after second intervention phase (ie after six weeks of training).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peak and mean isometric and isokinetic muscle moments (torque) generated by the quadriceps muscles with FES stimulation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time points: Measured pre-training, after first intervention phase (ie after three weeks of training) and after second intervention phase (ie after six weeks of training).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Level of post-activation depression of H reflex will be measured using stimuli applied to the nerve every 4 seconds with increasing intensity until the maximal muscle action potential is reached. This will assess the size of the maximal M wave and the recruitment curve of the H reflex and the maximal H reflex. Quadriceps and soleus will be tested separately. Testing of post activation depression in quadriceps and soleus will set stimulus intensity sufficient to evoke an H reflex with an amplitude 50% maximum H reflex. Pairs of stimuli will be delivered with different interstimulus intervals: 1 s, 2.5 s, 5 s, and 10 s with 15 s between each pair of stimuli. Each interstimulus interval will be repeated 10 times. Quadriceps and soleus will be tested separately.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time points: Measured pre-training, after first intervention phase (ie after three weeks of training) and after second intervention phase (ie after six weeks of training).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research is to investigate the use of electrical stimulation to support a muscle strengthening program aimed at increasing standing function in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Specifically, this project will establish whether there are any differences in outcome using a conventional stimulation pattern (low frequency) or a new, higher frequency stimulation pattern. 
The project will test the hypotheses that, following training using a combined FES-voluntary muscle strengthening program, motor-incomplete SCI individuals will be able:
1. to stand for longer; 
2. to perform significantly more repetitions of the sit-to-stand/stand-to-sit activity ;
3. to achieve significantly greater upper limb reach.</summary>
