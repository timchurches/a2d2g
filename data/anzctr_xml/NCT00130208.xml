  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Conversion from microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria - Run-in period, followed by a treatment period, followed by a Washout Period. Treatment period is 30 weeks and Washout Period 4 weeks.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Greater than 50% reduction in microalbuminuria - During the treatment period, KRX-101 is being compared to placebo to assess whether a 50% reduction in microalbuminuria has been achieved.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Observed change in albumin excretion - Review of albumin excretion during the treatment period will be made and will also be compared to albumin excretion during the washout period.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of adverse events, laboratory parameters, and physical exams between active and placebo patients - Patients will be reviewed for adverse events, laboratory parameters, and physical examinations throughout the trial and compared by treatment arm (active v. placebo).</outcome>
