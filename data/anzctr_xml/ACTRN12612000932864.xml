  <interventions>
    <interventions>A regular moderate intensity exercise program staring from the 20th week of pregnancy and continuing to the 36 th week of pregnancy consisting of 30- 45 minutes of exercise, 5 times a week. The intervention will consist of stationary  cycling at home, supervised/overseen  by a trained exercise physiologist. Exercise sessions will be monitored by heart rate monitors and exercise intensity kept at moderate intensity (40-59% VO2 reserve)</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Neonatal body composition by DEXA scanning</outcome>
      <timepoint>at 14 days after delivery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maternal weight gain based on weight taken at initial obsteric assessment at 20 weeks and compared to weight at 36 weeks gestation. This will be measured on electronic scales at the Liggins Institute.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change in maternal body weight from 20 weeks (baseline) to 36 weeks of gestation (end of intervention)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maternal body composition by DEXA scan</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 weeks post-partum</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maternal obstetric complications- gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy induced hypertension. Data from obstetric visits (which will be different obstetricians caring for these women) will be collated by the research team and analysed. Oral glucose tolerance tests will be performed as part of the study at 28 weeks and these results will be analysed seperately.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline (20 weeks of gestation to time of delivery)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obese women who become pregnant have increased pregnancy weight gain, pregnancy complications and their offspring develop obesity. Lifestyle interventions during pregnancy may restrict fetal overnutrition and metabolic programming of offspring disrupting the obesity cycle.  The central hypothesis for this project is that increasing maternal physical activity can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes, in particular protecting the offspring from obesity. Furthermore we hypothesise that these interventions will be reflected in altered gene expression in placenta, muscle, fat and liver. This human study will confirm the clinical efficacy of moderate exercise in overweight and obese women during the last half of pregnancy.  Outcome measures in will include alterations in auxology and body composition during fetal life, at birth and through childhood (latter stage will be another study), serum biochemistry and hormones.  These studies represent translational research targeting the very earliest development of obesity to reduce the health burden of this major health issue.</summary>
