    <interventions>Integrated oncogeriatric care

Integrated oncogeriatric care consists of comprehensive geriatric assessment and management, integrated with standard oncology care. In addition to seeing their oncologists, participants receiving integrated oncogeriatric care will have a comprehensive assessment and management by a consultant physician in geriatric medicine within 3 weeks from randomisation, followed by reviews at approximately 12 weeks and 24 weeks from randomisation. After 24 weeks from randomisation, participants in the intervention arm may continue to receive integrated oncogeriatric care but will not be required to complete further study assessments.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participation in the study will be completely voluntary. Potential participants will be referred by their treating  clinicians  to  the  researcher  and,  if  interested,  they  will  be  provided  with  a  Participant Information  and  Consent Form  (PICF)  and  given  sufficient  time  to  consider whether  or  not  to participate in the study. If they are willing to participate in the study, participants will be requested to sign the PICF and an optional Medicare Australia participant consent form. Once a participant has consented, participants will be screened for suitability according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If they are suitable to participate in the study, the study doctor will perform the baseline assessment prior to treatment allocation. All participants will also receive brief generic advice about nutrition and activity and will be given the Cancer Council of Victoria’s booklet on “Understanding Chemotherapy: a guide for people with cancer, their families and friends”.
 
Participants will be randomly assigned via a computerised system using the method of minimisation (with a 80:20 random element) to receive integrated geriatric care or standard oncology care in a 1:1 ratio. In this study, minimisation will be used to achieve balance between groups using the following characteristics: tumour type, age, gender, and ECOG performance status (physician-rated). This method will be conducted using the MinimPy software package by a researcher not involved in the care of the study participants. The allocation code will not be released until the participant has been enrolled into the study.

Allocation concealment will be ensured, as the allocation involves randomisation by computer which is operated by a researcher who is blinded to the results of all assessments and outcome measures except the variables required to allocate participants (i.e. tumour type, age, gender and ECOG performance status).</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION
The target sample for this study is based on an independent t-test at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 to have an 80% power to detect a significant between group difference in Trial Outcome Index (TOI) from baseline to 12 weeks with an effect size of 0.5. Under these assumptions, a minimum sample size of 64 evaluable participants in each group (or a total of approximately 128 evaluable participants) who have completed the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires at baseline and 12 weeks is required. 

PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS
The primary efficacy analysis will address the primary objective of the study which is to assess the effects of integrated geriatric care on HRQoL in older adults with metastatic cancer receiving first line chemotherapy. This will involve a hierarchical set of HRQoL analyses.

The primary HRQoL analysis will to compare the longitudinal change in TOI score for significant between-group difference using linear mixed models. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using pattern-mixture models and/or joint model of longitudinal and survival data if greater than 20% of TOI data are missing and if the reasons for missing data and patterns of missing data are not missing at random.

The secondary HRQoL analyses will compare: i) the proportion of participants who experience change in TOI by at least the clinically important threshold, using Fishers test; and ii) time to change in TOI by at least the clinically important threshold using log-rank test. 

The tertiary HRQoL analyses involve analyses using t-test or Wilcoxon test (according to normality of distribution) of all the scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-ELD14 and EQ-5D-5L, to complement the primary and secondary HRQoL analyses, to make full use of all HRQoL data collected and to assist in interpretation of the of the primary endpoint.

SECONDARY EFFICACY ANALYSES
Overall survival between treatment groups will be analysed using a closed hierarchical method in the following pre-specified order: (1) palliative-intent treatment subgroup; (2) overall study population; and (3) adjuvant/curative-intent treatment subgroup.

Overall survival will be estimated using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method. Summary statistics will be presented with appropriate confidence intervals. The non-parametric log rank test will be used to compare the two arms of the study and, if appropriate, a Cox proportional hazard model will be used to estimate the treatment effects. Additional details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

Other secondary endpoints will be summarised according to established guidelines specific to the measurement instrument. In general, categorical variables will be tabulated and key summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, range, etc.) will be presented for continuous measurements. Comparisons between treatment arms will be made where appropriate and the test selected depending on the distribution. Additional details will be provided in the SAP.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if integrated oncogeriatric care improves outcome in older patients who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 70 years or above, have been diagnosed with cancer and are about to start chemotherapy (this includes cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy).

Study details. Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two treatment groups. Participants in one group will receive integrated oncogeriatric care. In addition to seeing their oncology doctors, participants receiving integrated oncogeriatric care will also have a comprehensive assessment and management by a geriatrician to identify problems early on and help co-ordinate care to support patients, their carers and their families better. Participants in the other group will receive standard oncology care and continue to see their oncology doctors for treatment of their cancer.

Participants will be regularly assessed over 24 weeks by questionnaires to determine whether integrated oncogeriatric care improves quality of life, function, mood, nutrition, chemotherapy delivery, healthcare utilisation and healthcare costs.</summary>
