  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Disability free survival after major abdominal surgery is of importance to patients and their care givers.  Replacement fluid given to patients is likely to make a difference to this outcome.  The RELIEF study looks at a low volume compared to a high volume fluid replacement technique to determine which results in the best outcome.

What is relatively unknown is how these two different fluid replacement techniques change the cardiovascular signs that are frequently monitored as part of general anaesthetic care.  These cardiovascular monitored signs can include the volume the heart pumps each beat (stroke volume) or the changes in cardiac volume over time (stroke volume variation).  These cardiovascular signs are often used to guide how much fluid to give.

This is because we know that if the cardiac function does not meet the needs of the extra demands from surgery, it can result in harm to the patient.  For example, the patient may require additional drugs to support their circulation or suffer from poor wound healing.

We aim to recruit 100 patients who are part of the RELIEF study to observe the changes in cardiovascular function using cardiac monitors.

These cardiac monitors are used as part of routine monitoring care and represent established approved devices in clinical monitoring.

The information from this study will help determine the usefulness of these signs for the specialist anaesthetic doctor looking after the patient.  Careful and accurate monitoring of a patients condition can help a clinician tailor the fluid resuscitation for the patient.  It can also help identify patients who may need extra support through additional drugs or closer monitoring.

As this is an observational study, there will be no direct benefit to the patient.  However, the information gained from the study would be of use to clinicians better look after future patients.
