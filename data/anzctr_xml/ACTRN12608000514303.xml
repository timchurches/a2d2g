    <studytitle>Simplified Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in General Practice</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A randomised controlled trial to evaluate a simplified management strategy for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea comparing improvements in daytime sleepiness in patients managed in primary care (general practitioner assisted by a sleep specialist nurse) versus usual care in a sleep specialist centre</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>General practice-based management for a total of 6 months. Patients will have an auto-continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration study at home over 3 nights to determine their CPAP treatment pressure. CPAP therapy will be worn by patients at night for the 6 month duration of the study and followed up by a sleep nurse based in the community at 1, 3 and 6 months and their general practitioner at 3 and 6 months. Each follow-up visit with the nurse will be of 30 minutes duration, and 15-20 minutes for general practitioner review.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sleep specialist centre management for a total of 6 months. Patients will have a sleep laboratory-based CPAP titiration over one night to determine their required CPAP treatment pressure. CPAP therapy will then be worn by the patient at night for the 6 month duration of the study.  Patients will be followed up in the hospital outpatient setting by the sleep nurse at 1, 3 and 6 months and by a sleep specialist at 3 and 6 months. Each follow-up visit with the nurse will be of 30 minutes duration, and 15-20 minutes for sleep specialist review.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients attending their general practitioner (GP) for any reason will be screened for high risk of OSA using a screening questionnaire (OSA50) and Epworth sleepiness scale. Patients with OSA50 score&gt;=5 and ESS&gt;=8 or poorly controlled hypertension despite 2 antihypertensive agents will be eligible for inclusion.  Patients will undergo a home ApneaLink study to confirm a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe OSA, defined as a 3% oxygen desaturation index &gt;=16. Patients confirmed to have moderate-to-severe OSA will be randomised into the study. Treatment will be allocated externally via a third party (ie pharmacy telephone system).</concealment>
