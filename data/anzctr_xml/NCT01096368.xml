Experimental: Arm I (radiotherapy, chemotherapy) - Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy over 6-7 weeks. Patients then receive liposomal vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, and 15 (courses 1-3 only); etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3; carboplatin on day 1, cisplatin IV over 1-8 hours on day 1; cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-2 and filgrastim. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Active Comparator: Arm II (radiotherapy) - Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy over 6-7 weeks.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free survival (EFS) defined as time to the first occurrence of disease progression, disease recurrence, second malignant neoplasm, or death from any cause - Using Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate the observed EFS for the two randomization arms (post-radiation Maintenance arm and post-radiation Observation only arm). Log rank tests will be used to compare the observed EFS between the two randomization arms. Stratified log rank test will also be performed to examine the treatment difference with consideration and adjustment for the randomization groups.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS) - Using Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate the observed OS for the two randomization arms (post-radiation Maintenance arm and post-radiation Observation only arm). Log rank tests will be used to compare the observed OS between the two randomization arms. Stratified log rank test will also be performed to examine the treatment difference with consideration and adjustment for the randomization groups.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying maintenance chemotherapy to see how well it works
      compared to observation following induction chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating
      young patients with newly diagnosed ependymoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      vincristine sulfate, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation
      therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor
      cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells and allow doctors to save the part of the body where the cancer
      started.</summary>
