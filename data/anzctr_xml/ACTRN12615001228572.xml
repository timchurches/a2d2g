  <interventions>
    <interventions>The investigational product for this trial is CRD-102. CRD-102 is currently available as an immediate release tablet, but the Extended Release version is currently for investigational/trial use only.

14mg of CRD-102 will be administered to participants via the oral route. CRD-102 comes in 2mg minitablets. To make up a dose of 14mg, 7 minitablets will be encapsulated by the pharmacist into a capsule, and this will be administered to the volunteers orally. Administration of this tablet is done in a supervised clinical unit, hence compliance will not be an issue. Safety bloods, ECGs, vital signs are monitored regularly to ensure participants safety.

This trial is a food effect trial. Participants will be administered 14mg CRD-102 in a fasted state, where participants are required to fast from food for a minimum of 8 hours prior to dosing. Water is permitted.

Following dosing of CRD-102 in the fasted state, a washout period of 7 days is required, prior to the second dose. Participants will be readmitted to the clinical unit, and will be administered the capsule of 14mg CRD-102 following breakfast which will be provided.

The investigational product will be stored in a locked pharmacy with secure authorised personnel access, and all drug accountability logs will need to be completed.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess tolerability of CRD-102 in fasted and fed state This will be done via adverse event monitoring that will occur from dosing until end of study. Possible adverse reactions would include nausea/headaches/dizziness/or drop in blood pressures. Subjects will be assessed in person by nurses/clinical unit and medical staff on a regular basis to ensure wellbeing. This will occur at various timepoints throughout the study, ie 2, 4 8, 12 and 24 hours post dose when ECGs, blood pressures are done. Should there be any concerns expressed by the subjects, subjects will be assessed by a medical doctor to determine if further treatments or investigations are required. </outcome>
      <timepoint>From 0 hours (time of administration) until 24 hours post dose for each fasted/fed group, and at end of study, 5 days post fed group</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is conducted to evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Haemodynamic Effect of CRD-102 in a Fasted and Fed state in Healthy Adult Volunteers. 8 Healthy Adult volunteers will be administered a single dose of CRD-102 in a fasted state, followed by a single dose of CRD-102 in a fed state 7 days later.
PK samples, blood pressures, ECGs will be taken to assess the PK and haemodynamic profile of the medication following administration in a fasted and fed state.

Healthy volunteers will be screened up to 28 days prior to trial enrolment, Following enrolment, 8 healthy volunteers will be dosed with CRD-102 in a fasting state on day 1, followed by administration of CRD-102 in a fed state following a 7 day wash out. Subjects will return to clinic for a follow up 5 days after administration of the last dose of investigational product for a safety visit. </summary>
