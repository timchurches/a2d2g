    <interventions>This randomised equivalence trial will assess the relevance of the lateral cephalometric radiograph for diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics. The orthodontists who are willing to join this study will be randomly allocated into two groups. One control group and one intervention group. Those in the control group will receive a questionnaire consisting of one random orthodontic case, with all diagnostic material including a lateral cephalometric radiograph. Whereas, those in the intervention group will receive a questionnaire consisting of a random orthodontic case, without the lateral cephalometric radiograph. Orthodontists will be required to give their diagnosis and treatment plan for the given case using the provided information, taking approximately 10 minutes of their time.

    <statisticalmethods>Convenience sampling will be used to recruit participants. The parameters used to calculate sample size were as per an equivalence trial, as shown below. Interim analyses may be performed during the trial to test the levels of significance. Ideally, these will be performed when 50% and 75% of the data has been collected.

Sample size calculations as per an equivalence trial:
AHPRA Registered Orthodontists - 608 (n)
Type 1 Error - 0.5
Power - 0.8
Expected Proportion - 0.9
Equivalence Difference -0.05
Sample Size - 135 per group, 270 in total (n)

Statistical methods will be used to compare control and intervention groups for primary and secondary outcomes. Methods for additional analyses, such as subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses will also be carried out. The response rate of the surveys will be calculated depending upon the sample size calculation, the surveys received after one reminder and two reminders, and those who did not respond at all. A more detailed description of the statistical methods will be provided in the final report.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lateral head radiographs are routinely prescribed to every patient who is willing to have braces to correct their abnormal teeth positions (malocclusion). However, the information gathered during a clinical examination of the patient is fundamental to determine the diagnosis of a given malocclusion. The aim of the present investigation is to test the null hypothesis that lateral head radiographs will not alter Australian Orthodontists diagnosis and treatment planning decisions.

If the results are consistent with our hypothesis and lateral head radiographs are not a must have diagnostic record in orthodontics, we can suggest that lateral head radiographs should not be prescribed routinely to all patients. This would alter the conventional prescription of lateral head radiographs required for orthodontic diagnosis. The omission of the lateral head radiograph from a susceptible age group would limit the amount of ionising radiation exposure.

    <publicnotes>Informed consent will be attained from each participant prior to commencing the project. Participants will give their consent by ticking the informed consent box on the questionnaire. The questionnaire will be sent out to AHPRA registered orthodontists, and their responses will only be considered in the project if this box has been selected. 
The dental records of the patients to be sent to the participating orthodontists are to be de-identified and have had prior consent for use for academic/teaching purposes.
