  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Mean Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Through Week 24 - Spirometry (as measured by FEV1) is a standardized assessment to evaluate lung function that is the most widely used endpoint in cystic fibrosis studies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline through 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Mean Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 Through Week 48 - Spirometry (as measured by FEV1) is a standardized assessment to evaluate lung function that is the most widely used endpoint in cystic fibrosis studies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline through 48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) Score Through Week 24 and Week 48 (Respiratory Domain Score, Pooled) - The CFQ-R is a health-related quality of life measure for subjects with cystic fibrosis. Each domain is scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A difference of at least 4 points in the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R is considered a minimal clinically important difference (MCID).</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline through 24 weeks and 48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Sweat Chloride Concentration Through Week 24 and Week 48 - The sweat chloride (quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis) test is a standard diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF), serving as an indicator of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline through 24 weeks and 48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time-to-first Pulmonary Exacerbation Through Week 24 and Week 48 - Pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a change in antibiotic therapy (intravenous, inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more of signs/symptoms such as change in sputum; new or increased hemoptysis; increased cough or dyspnea; malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 38 degrees C; anorexia or weight loss; sinus pain/tenderness and discharge; change in physical examination of the chest; decreased pulmonary function by 10%; and radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary infection.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline through 24 weeks and 48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Weight at Week 24 and Week 48 - As malnutrition is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) because of increased energy expenditures due to lung disease and fat malabsorption, body weight is an important clinical measure of nutritional status.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline to 24 weeks and 48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects
      with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older who have the G551D mutation in the cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Ivacaftor is a potent and selective
      CFTR potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and R117H forms of human CFTR protein.
      Potentiators are pharmacological agents that increase the chloride ion transport properties
      of the channel in the presence of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation.</summary>
