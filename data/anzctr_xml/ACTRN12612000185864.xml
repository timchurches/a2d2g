  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are three arms to this trial. Arm 1: CBT/Exercise. Arm 2: CBT/Yoga. Arm 3: CBT/Delayed Exercise. Therapy is administered once-weekly over 9 weeks on an individual 90 minute basis. CBT includes education about PTSD, cognitive restructuring of erroneous beliefs about the trauma experience, and exposure to memories of the trauma and to avoided situation.  Exercise involves 10 minutes of aerobic exericse via a stepping activity, with the target heart rate (HR) being [60-80% / 100 x (Max HR  Resting HR) + Resting HR].  In the CBT/Exercise condition this exercise will occur immediately at the conclusion of the CBT session.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 9 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The CBT/Yoga condition is identical to the CBT/Exercise except that participants complete 10 minutes of stretching immediately following the CBT sessions.  CBT includes education about PTSD, cognitive restructuring of erroneous beliefs about the trauma experience, and exposure to memories of the trauma and to avoided situation.  Yoga will comprise simple body stretches for a period of 10 minutes.  Therapy is administered once-weekly over 9 weeks on an individual 90 minute basis. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 9 months.  

The CBT/Delayed Exercise condition is identical to the CBT/Exercise except that participants complete 10 minutes of exercise 1 day following the CBT sessions.  Therapy is administered once-weekly over 9 weeks on an individual basis. CBT includes education about PTSD, cognitive restructuring of erroneous beliefs about the trauma experience, and exposure to memories of the trauma and to avoided situation.  Exercise invovles 10 minutes of aerobic exericse via a stepping activity.  In the CBT/Delayed Exercise condition this exercise will occur 1 day after the conclusion of the CBT session.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 9 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the study is to evaluate the roles of exercise and yoga in enhancing the effectiveness of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in reducing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.  This study compares the relative effectiveness of (a) Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Combined with Exercise, (b) Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Combined with Yoga, and (c) Cognitive Behaviour Therapy with Delayed Exercise in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.  It is hypothesised that whereas all conditions will lead to symptom reduction, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Combined with Exercise will lead to greater symptom reduction than either Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Combined with Yoga or Cognitive Behaviour Therapy with Delayed Exercise.</summary>
