    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - nilotinib

Experimental: nilotinib - 70 patients who maintain MR4.5 during the one year nilotinib consolidation phase will stop treatment when they enter the treatment-free remission (TFR) phase


Treatment: drugs: nilotinib
Nilotinib will be labeled as AMN107 and supplied as 150 mg and/or 200 mg hard gelatin capsule. Nilotinib will not be dosed by weight or body surface area. Nilotinib will be administered orally at 300 mg twice daily (BID) or 400 mg BID, at approximately 12 hour intervals, and must not be taken with food. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. No food should be consumed for at least 2 hours before the dose is taken and no additional food should be consumed for at least one hour after the dose is taken. Patients who were previously treated with 400 mg BID, and required subsequent permanent dose reduction to 400 mg QD will be allowed to enter this study on the same dose, 400 mg once daily.

                  i+iii or ii+iii): i) Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap

                  suppository ii) Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of
                  contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal
                  hormone contraception iii) Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A clinical research study to find out if it is safe to stop the drug nilotinib (Tasigna) in
      chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Patients who started treatment with imatinib
      (Gleevec) when they were first diagnosed with CML, then switched to nilotinib (Tasigna) for
      at least 2 years with the combined time on imatinib (Gleevec) and nilotinib (Tasigna) for at
      least 3 years and have very small amount of leukemia cells remaining after the nilotinib
      (Tasigna) treatment will qualify for the study.</summary>
