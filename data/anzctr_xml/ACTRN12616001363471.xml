  <interventions>
    <interventions>A total number of 360 children were cluster randomized assigned to two groups: children in the intervention group were served milk supplemented with probiotic and the control group received standard milk.

The children will be examined at baseline, the pH in saliva will be taken, samples of saliva, plaque index. Their teeth will be brush and them make the evaluation of dental caries with the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS).

It will start the supply of milk with probiotics and without probiotics. At three, six, nine and twelve months milk consumption controls will be made to children. 

Controls consist of taking the pH before the milk consumption. Pass an hour it will take again to the children salivary pH; saliva samples, the plaque index. The teeth will be brush and them make the evaluation of dental caries with the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS).

The milk supplemented with probiotic contain two probiotic strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus 5x106 UFC/g and Bifidobacterium Longum 3x106 UFC/g) "Registered Trademark". The milk (test and placebo), identical in taste and appearance, will be supplied in packages separated by the colors "White" or "Blue", 

The chefs prepare 200 grams of milk to the children every day for five days a week, for twelve months and are served at breakfast. It is made daily children attendance record and the consumption of milk.

Parents will be instructed about the report to the staff of the project's adverse effects on the children immediately happen.

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>Count of colony-forming units' (CFU) of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus sp.

Participants will be requested to void saliva into a wide-mouthed disposable tube after their breakfast. Saliva (0,1 mL) will be diluted with 0,9 mL of sterile saline solution and tenfold serial dilutions of saliva will be made up to 103, before plating. 

Mitis Salivarius Agar (MSA) supplemented with potassium tellurite and bacitracine will be used as culture media for isolation of total salivary Streptococci and Rogosa agar will be prepared for the growth of Lactobacilli. Appropriate amounts of semisolid media will be poured onto petri plates in a laminar air flow unit and allowed to solidify at room temperature.

To each plate 100 microlitres of the diluted sample will be spread evenly and the plates will be sealed, placed in an anaerobic jar with Anaero Gas Pack system, and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 48 hours. Bacterial colonies will be observed under a dissecting microscope and deduced on the basis of colony morphology, shape and color; and in case of doubt confirmation for Streptococci and Lactobacilli will be done by gram staining or catalase tests, respectively. The number of CFU will be multiplied by the number of times the original mL of sample will be diluted (the dilution factor of the plate counted) and expressed as the number of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) of saliva.

      <outcome>1. Dental caries lesions: Clinical dental examinations will be performed at baseline and tracing at three, six, nine and twelve months of the study. One dentist, using an artificial light, a mouth mirror, will examine all of the children at the nursery schools. ICDAS (International Caries Detection and Assessment System) criteria were used for the visual and tactile detection of dental caries lesions and for describing the severity of lesions. The essential elements of the ICDAS caries detection codes, are the visual criteria for the full series of six caries codes, using from the histologically more extensive distinct visual change which is visible wet or dry from code 2 through steps to the most severe stage, the extensive distinct cavity with visible dentine until code 6, during baseline and tracing three, six, nine and twelve months. </outcome>

      <outcome>2. Presence of bacterial plaque: Using a mouth mirror, gauze, and a dental probe under a focusable flashlight was recorded the presence or absence of clinically visible plaque, during baseline and tracing three, six, nine and twelve months

      <outcome>3. Salivary pH: For pH saliva, the testing lead tape into mouth saliva for three seconds, is removed and compare to color chart of pH testing tape it to get a value of pH, digital pH meter analyzed the collected saliva, during baseline and tracing at  three, six, nine and twelve months

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4.Salivary buffer capacity: Measured salivary pH values both before and after addition of acid (HCl) to assess salivary buffer capacity, It was obtained by mixing 1 ml of saliva with 3 ml HCl in a tube and measuring the solution pH with digital pH meter after 20 minutes in vortex mixer, during baseline and tracing at three, six, nine and twelve months</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Type of sampling: probabilistic cluster sampling. The sampling frame will correspond to three headquarters of the ICBF of the city of Cali, Colombia, that be the primary sampling unit, the random participants selected by each (secondary sampling unit) headquarters for an estimated 360 children. The calculation of the sample was based on the driving a confidence level of 90% and a power of 0.80 (80% power for a good sampling). Sample size: 360 children.

The information will be well-typed in duplicate in rules created for that purpose as the study progresses. These will be validated through the Epidata 3.1 software so as to obtain a fully refined base.

Analysis of the information: initially, it will be described and compared study on the baseline population. The information to be processed using descriptive statistics for each of the variables (measures of central tendency and dispersion and proportions according to the type of variable frequency) using 95% confidence intervals. For the comparison between groups (intervened and control), will be used parametric statistics where variables assume a Normal distribution. Non-parametric tests will be used otherwise. Likewise, an analysis will be held by Protocol. Use the statistical package Stata 13.0 Marca registrada assuming a p-value &lt; 0.05 as significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dental caries is a disease that can occur during any stage of the life cycle, as a result of the imbalance in the ore the tooth surface, product of the metabolism of microorganisms, acidifying more the environment, contributing to the dynamic degradation of enamel. 
Probiotics are microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts can confer health benefits. In vitro and clinical studies support the idea that lactobacilli have protective effects on oral health. Some studies have shown a reduction in the count of cariogenic microorganisms with Streptococcus mutans when you consume probiotics containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily consumption of milk beverages enriched with Lactobacillus rhamnosus on the incidence of caries in preschool in the city Cali, Colombia.
