    <interventions>Enrolment in this paediatric long term outcome audit will be offered to new patients offered ITB therapy. 

We are collecting a minimum data set for children and teenagers receiving intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy in Australia. 
 
We have applied The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model to assess the impact of ITB therapy upon participants.
The main domains of the ICF are:
1.  Body Functions - physiological functions of body systems.
2. Body Structures - anatomical parts of the body such as organs, limbs and their components.
3.  Activity is the execution of a task or action by an individual.
4.  Participation is involvement in a life situation. 

During the assessment phase individual therapy goals are set.  The Canadian Occupational Measure (COPM) can be used to set the therapy goals and the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS).

Several outcome measures are being used to assess change in the ICF domains described above.  These are fully discussed in the Outcomes section of this document. 

On average 12 ITB pumps are implanted each year in Australian children.  Therefore data, will be collected for 10 years.</interventions>

Communication
Changes in communication will be evaluated using three tools:
The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS).    
Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD)
Care and Comfort Hypertonicity Questionnaire.</outcome>

Spasticity
Changes in spasticity will be evaluated using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).
There are issues with using the MAS including:
-	The procedure is poorly described.
-	There is more than one criterion within each classification category for the scale.
-	The scales use subjective terms such as more and slightly increased.
-	There is a wide range of Inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). 
With these numerous issues it has not been possible to develop a standardised way to use the MAS across the various centres. It is acknowledged that the MAS will be performed differently by the clinicians at each of the centres.</outcome>

Dystonia
The Barry-Albright Dystonia (BAD) Scale is a reliable and responsive rating scale for secondary dystonia.  
The BAD Scale is a five-point ordinal scale for secondary dystonia. It rates the severity of dystonia in eight body regions, including eyes, neck, mouth, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs.</outcome>

Need for orthopaedic surgery
Theoretically, decreased spasticity from treatment with ITB therapy would reduce the occurrence of soft tissue contractures, prevent or delay bony deformities, and potentially impact the need for orthopaedic surgical interventions.
Specific musculoskeletal problems associated with spasticity include hip migration and scoliosis.  The long term effect of ITB therapy on hip migration is poorly understood.  The development of scoliosis following the introduction of ITB is an area of debate.
Participants will have annual spinal x-rays to monitor their cobb angles.  Orthopaedic intervention, if required, will be documented.</outcome>

      <outcome>Body Structure and Function 5
Medication Usage 
The evaluation of changes of medication usage is important.  Children with intractable spasticity are prescribed a variety of muscle relaxants and analgesic medications.  Decreased oral medication usage is predicted. 
The relationship between ITB therapy and seizures has been debated. There are a few anecdotal reports of increased seizure frequency after pump implantation, but no good data confirming such an increase, and in one pediatric multicenter study, no change in seizure frequency was observed.  The introduction of new anticonvulsant medications will be collected.</outcome>

 Pain assessment
The etiology of pain in children with chronic neurological disorders is multifactorial.  Confounding factors such as reflux, constipation, feeding difficulties, positioning, spasticity, activities of daily living, hip pain and dental pain may all contribute to pain experienced by children and adolescents with chronic neurological disorders.  
Accurate assessment of pain in children is challenging.  Cognitive immaturity and inability to separate pain from fear and anxiety, and the subjectivity of pain all complicate assessment.  Franck et al. suggest pain intensity can be described by a child with a cognitive age of 4 years.  Several pain assessment scales have been developed that include self report, physiological measures and behavioural measures.
There is no easily administered technique for assessing pain directly in children.  Houlihan et al. used the parent-report Child health Questionnaire (CHQ) to assess pain frequency in 198 children with cerebral palsy. 11% of patients reported pain almost every day.  Pain was related to severity of motor impairment  and the presence of a gastrostomy; parents of the most severely affected children reported the highest pain frequency.  Significant consequences of pain included missed days of school and days in bed.
The Comfort/Emotions &amp; Behaviour dimension of CPCHILD evaluates pain.</outcome>

Mobility
Changes in participants mobility will be evaluated using three assessments, the Functional Mobility Scale (FMS) 
The FMS was constructed to classify functional mobility in children, taking into account a range of assistive devices a child might use over three distances; 5 metres, 50 metres and 500 metres.
Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) 
The GMFCS describes the gross motor function of children and youth with cerebral palsy on the basis of their self-initiated movement with particular emphasis on sitting, walking, and wheeled mobility.  Distinctions between levels are based on functional abilities, the need for assistive technology, including hand-held mobility devices (walkers, crutches, or canes) or wheeled mobility, and to a much lesser extent, quality of movement.
1 minute walk test.  
The 1 minute walk test is a measure of functional ability and walking endurance. Children are tested at their maximal walking speed.</outcome>

      <outcome>Activity 3
Activities of Daily Living
The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is used to:
-	Identify problem areas in occupational performance
-	Provide a rating of the client?s priorities in occupational performance
-	Evaluate performance and satisfaction relative to those problem areas and
-	Measure changes in a client's perception of his/her occupational performance
The COPM will be used to set Goal attainment scale (GAS) goals.  The change in GAS goals will be used to document a change in the participants limitations in activities of daily living.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participation 1
The Care &amp; Comfort Hypertonicity Questionnaire (CCHQ) was developed to evaluate functional care needs, and to a lesser extent quality of life in children with increased tone of cerebral origin, particularly those with severe cerebral palsy.  It is a self-report questionnaire and requires parents or caregivers to rate how easy or difficult it is for them or their child in the last two weeks to perform a range of tasks relative to a cooperative person without a disability</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy is used to manage severe spasticity.  ITB therapy is available to children and adolescents at 6 tertiary Paediatric hospitals in Australia.  ITB is a new therapy, with  12-15 ITB pumps implanted in Australian children and adolescents each year.  There is no standard pre assessment tool or follow up protocol for children and adolescents receiving ITB therapy in Australia. 
The objective of this study is to identify and collect a minimum data set for assessment and follow up of children and adolescents receiving ITB therapy in Australia. 
Two of the aims of this study are (1) Identifying which assessment tools are useful at assessing the effect of ITB upon your childs daily functioning; and, (2) document the complications associated with ITB therapy. 
  For the purposes of data collection a prospective multicentre audit is proposed.  This would include children attending Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (Perth), Royal Childrens Hospital (Melbourne), Monash Medical Centre (Melbourne), Westmead Childrens Hospital (Sydney), Women &amp; Childrens Hospital (Adelaide) and the Royal Childrens Hospital (Brisbane).  All Australian children and adolescents who are offered ITB therapy will be asked to enrol in this audit.  
A standardised assessment protocol will be utilised by each centre to capture data across each domain of the World Health Organsiation international classification of functioning, disability and health. 
Participation in this prospective audit reflects standard care and is voluntary.</summary>
