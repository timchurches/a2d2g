  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current approaches to counter dental caries are mainly limited to fluoride treatments which include water fluoridation, fluoridated toothpastes, and professionally applied topical fluoride preparations. The effectiveness of fluoride is limited as almost half the NZ population has an unfluoridated water supply, and toothpaste use is infrequent for many people. New approaches and interventions are needed.  The overall aim of our research is to counter caries development by depositing a tooth-like mineral into dental plaque by using a plaque-mineralising toothpaste containing the tooth minerals, calcium and phosphate.  The aim is to protect the tooth mineral from acid dissolution, enhance the effectiveness of remineralization induced by fluoride (which will also be supplied in the toothpaste), and modify the plaque microbial composition.  This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the plaque mineralising toothpaste by determining the levels of mineral deposited in dental plaque in vivo after its use over a four week period.  This study is based on laboratory-based findings in our previous studies.</summary>
