  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomized controlled crossover-design trial will be conducted to investigate the acute effects of chewing gum on metabolism of nitrogen oxides, as well as neurocognitive performance outcome measures and endothelial function.

Each participant will complete 2 visits in random order with a minimum of one week washout between each visit. Prior to each visit participants will be asked to consume a standard meal for dinner.  For each visit participants will attend the School of Medicine and Pharmacology Research Unit at Royal Perth Hospital in the morning after standard low nitrate breakfast.  They will be randomly allocated to:
1.	No chewing
2.	Chewing 
Participants will consume a standardized lunch containing a fixed level of nitrate derived from spinach. They will begin chewing gum 30 minutes after lunch and continue chewing for 2 hours. A fruit-flavoured, sugar-free chewing gum will be used.</interventions>

    <concealment>The treatment order for eligible individuals will be randomly assigned using computer generated random numbers. The treatment order allocation will be sealed in numbered envelopes. The envelopes will be used for randomisation by opening an envelope, in consecutive order, as participants are entered in the study. The envelopes will be held by an independent person within the University of Western Australia. The study coordinator will contact the independent person to obtain the next available envelope once an individual is deemed eligible. The envelope will be opened and the code will be recorded.</concealment>
