  <interventions>
    <interventions>Change in protocol re timing of measurement of blood flow by ultrasound - which is now as follows:

Floor- based footrest. This is a small device, approx 300mm in length, with two raised domes. Viewed from the front it looks like the letter m. The participant flexes and extends the plantar portion of the sole of their foot over the dome to promote venous blood return through compression of the venous plexus in the sole of the foot.

For this study, participants will be asked to sit on an apporpriately adjusted chair so that their feet rest flat on the floor with their knees at 120 degrees (measured by a goniometer). 

They will remain in this position until time 10 minutes when basline ultrasound measures of popliteal venous flow will be done. 

Then at time points 14 and 18 minutes, they will be asked to flex and extend the sole of one foot (selected by pre-prepared randomisation programme) over the dome device for 60 seconds. Two ultrasound measurements at the popliteal vein will be done in the mobilising leg while it is mobilising, and two measures of popliteal flow will be done in the immobile leg immediately after. 

The study will be deemed to be completed after the measures that start at the 18 minute time point. </interventions>

    <concealment>Subjects will be assessed to ensure they meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria, and for infomred consent. They will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to use the floor-based dome device with either their left or right foot whiel keeping the contra-lateral foot still.
Randomisation will be provided via randomisation programme run by biostatistitian.
Allocation concealment of randomisation will be by sealed, opaque envelopes which will be opened by the study coordinatros after the subject has provided informed consent and is deemed to have met all inclusion / exclusion criteria</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>We anticipate that use of the dome device will achieve a performance similar to that of the Micro-mobile foot compression device used in a previous study. The Micro-mobile device achieved a change from baseline blood flows in an immobile limb of approx 15cm/s. This study is designed to assess whether the dome device can achieve a change in blood flow that is within 5cm/s of the lower flow limit for micro-mobile compression device.

Using a paired SD of 7.49cm/s for the paired change from baseline 60 minute peak systolic flow, as seen in the micro-mobile study, a sample size of 10 participants has at least 90% power with a one sided alpha of 5% to rule out a difference from baseline of less than 8cm/s.


The primary outcome variable analysis will be a mixed linear model comparing the peak systolic blood flow between legs adjusted for baseline flow as a co-variate. For the primary outcome variable analysis P=0.05 will be used to assess statistical significance.

For exploratory purposes paired t-tests will compare the outcome variables for the mobile and immobile leg at each time point separately, and also for the change from baseline.   No adjustment for multiple statistical testing will be used for the secondary outcome variables and analyses.

A mixed linear model will be used to estimate the overall difference between the two interventions, the effect of time, and whether there is an interaction between interventions and the effect of time.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Blood flow in the veins of the legs usually slows down when a person sits for a period of time. This study is designed to see if blood flow in the veins can be improved by using a small foot rest that encourages people to compress their foot on it intermittently. This may help reduice the incidence of blood clots in legs that can occur with protracted periods of sitting.</summary>
