  <interventions>
    <interventions>Percutaneous embolization of the left gastric artery performed under conscious sedation by Dr martin Krauss, an Interventional Radiologist. The common femoral artery  is accessed using seldinger technique and guidewires and catheters placed to reach the target left gastric artery. Embozene particles are used to embolize. The procedure takes 45-90 minutes and performed as a day case</interventions>
    <comparator>Lifestyle changes, diet and exercise is the treatment. Dietary intake and exercise will be recorded. The patients are followed up in research clinics at the same timepoints as the embolization group. patients will be asked to keep food diaries and follow the green prescription exercise plan as per the New Zealand Ministry of Health guidelines
 Patients that do not qualify for bariatric surgery in normal practice are routinely referred back to their GPs and have no regular follow up, intervention or surveillance</comparator>

</outcome>
      <timepoint>  clinical assessments including a physical examination including adverse events such as haematoma at groin puncture site, ongoing pain as assessed at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60 months
Pain is assessed using a 10 point VAS score</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Morbid obesity is a signifiacnt health problem in New Zealand, especialy among the Maori and Pacific Island population. The most effective way to treat this condition is bariatric surgery but not all patients are eligible if their obesity related co-morbidities deem surgery as too risky.
Percutaneous embolization is minimally invasive and performed as a day case under local anaesthetic and sedation. The study aims to prove this new embolization procedure to be a safe effective treatment for obese people that have no other options available to them.</summary>
