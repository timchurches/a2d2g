  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Parents can positively influence their children's alcohol use. One strategy they use is to
      provide their children with alcohol, believing it is the best way to teach their children how
      to drink responsibly. The impact of parental supply is not well understood and may be
      unintentionally harmful. This study will research the consequences of parental supply within
      the broader context of parent, child and peer relationships. It will help to determine how
      parental supply influences the different patterns of adolescent alcohol consumption over
      time, providing essential information to help parents prevent alcohol misuse in their
      children. Parents can play a pivotal role in prevention of alcohol misuse, but at present we
      don't know exactly how.</summary>
