      <timepoint>A baseline assessment will be made prior to undergoing trial SCS implantation, followed by daily assessments during the temporary trial phase (6-14 days).  Following permanent implantation, follow up assessments will be scheduled at 3, 6 and 12 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome measure will assess the impact of HF10 SCS on quality of life.  This will be assessed via questionnaires addressing levels of depression, anxiety, stress, affected daily activities and daily analgesic use.  Questionnaires will include medication use, DASS21, LANSS, ODI, GIC, SF-36 and Subject Satisfaction. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>A Baseline assessment will be made prior to undergoing trial SCS implantation, followed by an assessment at the end of the temporary trial phase (in 6-14 days).  Following permanent implantation, assessments will be scheduled at 3, 6 and 12 months.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>This study is statistically not powered for a specific efficacy hypothesis test so no formal sample size has been calculated. Target size has been set on 100 successfully trialed subjects.

Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected and analysed using PASW Statistics 18.0. Non-parametric 2-tailed cross-sectional and pair-wise comparisons will be undertaken to assess changes in daily pain scores and daily analgesics use. Simple linear and non-linear regression will be used to calculate possible outcome predictor values from the baseline demographic, pain, daily activity and psychometric data collected.  Significance will be set at the 0.05 level.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with persistent back pain and suspected mechanical instability are referred to spine surgeons for spine stability assessment and, if need be, stabilization surgery.  A significant proportion of these patients fail however to derive adequate benefits from the surgery and these chronic pain patients are often left with few options.

Traditional spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a widely accepted, cost-effective therapy for patients with chronic pain, especially in patients with post-surgery back and leg pain. 

High-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation at 10 kHz (HF10 SCS) has established itself as a key treatment in treating patients with chronic back pain: data from European pain centers has shown that HF10 SCS is safe and effective at reducing pain, improving function and sleep, and reducing opioid in patients with predominant back pain.

HF10 SCS has been used in Australia to treat chronic pain ever since its TGA approval, especially back and leg pain patients. The purpose of this non-interventional data collection study is to collect data on the improvement in pain relief and quality of life associated with HF10 SCS, as used in the clinic routine practice in patients with chronic back pain following back surgery.
