    <interventions>To compare reversal effect of rocuronium with neostigmine or sugammadex towards cough response on emergence in patients undergoing general anesthesia. At the end of the surgery, each patient will be receiving different types of reversal agent, either:
Group 1: Intravenous Sugammadex 2mg/kg  (half dose given prior to extubation and another half exactly after extubation)
Group 2: Intravenous Sugammadex full dose of 2mg/kg prior to extubation

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the incidence of severe cough on emergence  in patient undergoing general anesthesia receiving two types of reversal agents with different dosage.
Assessment done by the investigator who is blinded based on a reference table of cough severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The emergence phase will be considered starting at the time of discontinuation of the volatile or intravenous anaesthetic agents until 5 minutes after tracheal extubation, during which the patient will be intermittently stimulated at 1-2 minutes interval verbally or with gentle tactile stimulation. Once clinically suitable to reverse, the attending anesthetist will administer the study drug for reversal of muscle relaxant. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To look at parameters associated with severity of cough on emergence such as sympathetic activation on emergence 
i) Blood pressure using sphygnomanometer(hypertension; SBP&gt;160 or DBP &gt;90)
ii) Heart rate on ECG (tachycardia; &gt;100 ) </outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored every 10 minutes from time of emergence to time of discharge to the ward</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare reversal time taken by each drug at different dosages</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from discontinuation of anaesthetic gas or intravenous anaesthesia to extubation</timepoint>

  <trial_design>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1.	Once all inclusion criteria have been fulfilled and all exclusion criteria have been excluded, patients will be recruited from both elective and emergency lists in operating theatre. 
2.	Consent is taken from the patient and each of them will be given a patient information sheet.
3.	The sealed envelope corresponding to the research ID will be opened:
Group 1 : Sugammadex 2mg/kg  (half dose given prior to extubation and another half exactly after extubation)
Group 2 : Sugammadex full dose of 2mg/kg prior to extubation
Group 3 : Neostigmine 0.05mg/kg + Glycopyrrolate 200 mcg
The attending anesthetist is unblinded and will prepare the reversal drugs required according to the randomized drug groups.



</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization:

A computer generated randomization method is used for this study. The patients will be randomly allocated a unique ID no and a study group to receive either sugammadex or neostigmine at the end of surgery. The allocation will be prepared by the research assistant and sealed in an envelope. Both the patient and the research personnel, who are present during general anesthesia, will be blinded till completion of the study. Unblinding of the researcher is done in case of medical emergency when the identity of the study drug must be revealed ( eg in case of suspected anaphylaxis to the study drugs). Any adverse events likely resulting from study drugs participation will be reported to the Ethics Committee.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation was performed using OpenEpi version 3.03 open source software. A total of 120 patients with n=40 per arm of the trial is required to achieve a=0.05 and power (1-ÃŸ) &gt;80%. Estimation was based on 15% reduction of main outcome in the intervention group.The three arms include sugammadex group 1 (1mg/kg for reversal and another 1mg/kg post extubation) , sugammadex group 2 (2mg/kg) and neostigmine/glycopyrrolate group (0.05mg/kg and 200mcg). CHI SQUARE test and multivariate analysis to analyze the results.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of cough response during emergence in general anaesthesia with sugammadex or neostigmine as the reversal agent.  We hope this study will help and guide clinicians to choose a safe and appropriate drug that can efficiently reverse the patient under general anesthesia with minimal risk of coughing on emergence and other adverse events.

Hypothesis:

Reversal of neuromuscular blockade with either sugammadex or neostigmine at the end of neurosurgery will result in difference in the grade of cough response during emergence.  Different dosage of sugammadex used for reversal may have different outcome in cough response.
