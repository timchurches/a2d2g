  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will use 3 questionnaires and a medication diary as a research tool. The 3 questionnaires are the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); Sleep Questionnaire (SQ) and MASCC (Multinational Association of Supportive Care) Anti-emesis Tool (MAT). The questionnaires will be filled in at 3 different time points. On day 1 of cycle 1 of chemotherapy- the HADS and SQ will be completed. On day 5 of cycle 1 of chemotherapy- the HADS, SQ and MAT will be completed. The day before cycle 2 of chemotherapy- the HADS and SQ will be completed. It is anticipated that the completion of the booklet will take around 30 minutes in total. The patient will have help filling in the diary by the pharmacist who fill in the medications that the patient needs to take. The patient only has to tick a box when they take an anti-nausea tablet.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to clarify whether patients on the first cycle of chemotherapy receiving anti-emetics recommended by international anti-emetic guidelines experience a change in mood (especially anxiety and depression) or sleep disturbance. We would also like to determine if there is a difference between anxiety and depression levels and level of sleep disturbance in patients with different cancer types; particularly breast cancer versus non-breast cancer patients. The final aim is to confirm prescribing compliance with international anti-emetic guidelines and assess the control of both acute (first 24 hours after chemotherapy) and delayed (2-5 days after chemotherapy) nausea and vomiting.</summary>
