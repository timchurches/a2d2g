    <concealment>Randomisation sequence was generated centrally and kept at a central location in sealed envelopes grouped according to age of potential study participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequences were generated centrally to ensure a 2:2:1 randomisation stratified to age group to ensure equal recruitment to each arm across a range of ages. Computer generated randomisation cards, specifying a treatment allocation, were then grouped according to age (age groups a-d) and each individual card placed in an envelope marked with the age group. Envelopes remain at a central location and study staff request a treatment allocation based on potential study subjectâ¿¿s age from administrative staff not directly associated with the study.</sequence>
