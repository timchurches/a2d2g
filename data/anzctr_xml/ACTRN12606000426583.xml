  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to assess whether undertaking a structured, non-weightbearing exercise program over 20 weeks will accelerate healing in people with chronic diabetic foot ulcers.  We also aim to assess whether this program improves glycaemic control, body mass index, wound bed substrate and quality of life.</summary>
