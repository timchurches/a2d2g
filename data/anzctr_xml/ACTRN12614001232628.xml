  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a m-health diabetes self-management support program. Participants will receive an individually tailored package of text messages via their mobile phone to increase diabetes self-management. The dose and duration of messaging is tailored to the patients preferences ranging from 3 months to 9 months and from 2 messages per week to multiple messages per day. 

The text messages are informational and motivational messages on a range of topics relevant to diabetes self-management. Topics include: General diabetes information, diabetes management tips, nutrition/diet, exercise, young adults with diabetes, stress and mood management, smoking, foot care as well as optional blood glucose monitoring reminders.

Participants who choose to respond to messages with their blood glucose test results will be able to view a graph of these results either by logging into a website or by opting to have their graph mailed to them. 

The messages are tailored based on participant demographics (e.g. ethnicity and age), preferences (e.g. timing of messages, module choice, frequency of reminders) personal characteristics (e.g. motivations) and clinical characteristics (e.g. foot risk category, treatment). Tailoring information is obtained from those participants randomized to the intervention group during the baseline phone interview with a research assistant (approximately 20-30minutes).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual care. Usual care, for the purposes of this study, includes the standard diabetes care provided in primary care settings including (e.g. GP and nurse visits, HbA1c tests) and where needed the care provided by secondary care services. In addition usual care includes where appropriate access to current diabetes resources and services.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through Primary Health Organizations (PHOs) and District Health Boards (DHBs). Healthcare professionals will identify potential participants according to the eligibility criteria. Contact details for those eligible and interested in participating will be forwarded to the research team, who will make contact to consent them and complete baseline measures over the phone. Alternatively participants will self-refer to the study and following confirmation of their eligibility they will complete consent and baseline measures over the phone.

Following baseline data collection, eligible participants will be randomised to either intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by diabetes type (1 or 2) and ethnicity (Maori &amp; Pacific, or non-Maori &amp; non-Pacific). The randomisation sequence will be generated by computer program and allocation concealed in consecutively numbered sealed envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes is a national health priority due to its increasing prevalence and the costly consequences of poor control, particularly for Maori. Better diabetes control results in fewer long-term complications such as blindness, amputations, and heart disease. Mobile phone-based interventions have potential to support people to self-manage their diabetes and improve their communications with their healthcare team. This study will look at the benefits of a text message-based program (SMS4BG) developed by the National Institute for Health Innovation and Waitemata DHB for people with poorly-controlled diabetes. One thousand volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive either usual care alone or usual care plus the mHealth program to use for up to 9 months. The primary outcome will be change in HbA1c level from baseline to 9 months. This research will allow DHBs to make informed decisions on the use of technology-based support for self-management. </summary>
