  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a medication used to HIV prevention in people who do not have HIV to reduce their risk of becoming infected with HIV. Current literature recommends that PrEP is taken orally every day to minimise the risk of HIV. All participants in the PrEPX trial will be given PrEP as an intervention. The intervention used in this trial is a single pill, taken daily containing two antiretroviral medicines: Emtricitabine 200 mg/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg tablets. There is evidence that if individuals take PrEP daily that they may reduce their chance of HIV infection by up to 99%.PrEP is recommended in individuals as long as they are at a high risk of HIV infection.  Intervention adherence will be assessed by self report surveys and script collection intervals.

The study duration is a maximum of 21 months, beginning  July 2016 until April 2018.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of the study is the number of new HIV infections in Victoria during the 36 months from the time that the PrEPX study opens, as reported by the Victorian HIV  Surveillance registry.

Study participants who are attending clinics that participate in the ACCESS surveillance system will have their results collected by ACCESS, using the software GRHANITE. GRHANITE is able to access the clinics' patient management systems to retrieve study participants' HIV and STI test results.
Study participants who are not attending clinics that participate in the ACCESS surveillance system will have their test result data collected manually.</outcome>
      <timepoint>We will monitor new HIV infections in Victoria from July 2016 until July 2019.
This outcome is not for study participants only: the outcome reflects new infections across all populations in Victoria.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Concern about HIV infection will be measured in a subset of 200 individuals who complete six monthly online surveys. Individuals will rate their concern on a Likert scale from 1-5. Individuals will also be asked about anxiety in qualitative face-to-face interviews at baseline and at the end of the study. </outcome>
      <timepoint> Face to face interview will take place at baseline and month 21.

Online surveys will be completed 6 monthly for 21 months post enrolment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in condom usage during the intervention period measured by ACCESS study self reported surveys completed at each 3 monthly visit and in online PrEPX study specific 6 monthly surveys in a subset of 260 people.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 months for 21 months for ACCESS survey and 6 monthly surveys for month 21 for PrEPX study specific online surveys in a subset of 260 people.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change during the intervention period for concurrent sexually transmitted infections evaluated by urine and rectal swabs tested for chlamydia and Neisseria gonorrhoea PCR, throat swab Neisseria gonorrhoea PCR and chlamydia and blood tests for syphilis serology </outcome>
      <timepoint>STI tests are done a minimum of every 3 months  for 21 months post enrolment.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size estimate for the PrEPX study was undertaken as follows. There are an estimated 300 new HIV infections per year in Victoria; this is based on back-calculation methods which have used available surveillance data and a modelling framework to estimate these levels for recent years and demonstrated that in the Australian context, with high and fairly stable testing rates, numbers and trends in HIV notifications are a strong surrogate marker for the actual number of and trend in new infections. Approximately 75% of all new HIV diagnoses in Victoria occur in MSM, which is 300 new HIV infections x 75% = 225 new infections occur in MSM annually in Victoria. 

We determined that a thirty percent reduction in new HIV infections in MSM, which would represent an overall 23% (=75%x30%) decline across Victoria, would be a meaningful outcome at a population level, of scaling up PrEP through the PrEPX study.

Analyses of changes in the rates of HIV infection will be undertaken using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests to determine whether there has been a significant decline in new HIV infections during this 36-month period, compared to the 36 months prior to PrEPX commencing.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pre Exposure Prophylaxis eXpanded (PrEPX) is a new study that will expand the provision of PrEP to 2,600 Victorians who have a high chance of acquiring HIV. Alfred Health is responsible for conducting the study. Associate Professor Edwina Wright from the Department of Infectious Diseases Alfred Health, Monash University and The Burnet Institute will be the Chief Investigator of this study. The study is sponsored by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services and, co-sponsored by Alfred Health and the Victorian AIDS Council. The chief research partners are The Burnet Institute and the Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW. The aims of PrEPX are to:
-Reduce the incidence of new HIV infections in Victoria,
-Expand access to PrEP in Victoria, including rural and regional locations
-Build capacity in the Victorian Health Service system so that the use of PrEP will become a routine option for preventing HIV infection

PrEPX will start enrolling people on 26th July 2016 and run for 21 months.
We will monitor the rate of new HIV infections in Victoria for a period of 36 months after the PrEPX study commences.
