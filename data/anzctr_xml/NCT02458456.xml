Sham Comparator: IHG 5% Hypertensive - Participants who are either un-medicated pre-hypertensive or medicated for blood pressure management conducting isometric resistance training using a hand dynamometer at 5% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Participants with perform 4 x 2 minutes isometric handgrip exercises 3 times per week under supervision for 8 weeks.

Experimental: IHG 30% Hypertensive - Participants who are either un-medicated pre-hypertensive or medicated for blood pressure management conducting isometric resistance training using a hand dynamometer at 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Participants with perform 4 x 2 minutes isometric handgrip exercises 3 times per week under supervision for 8 weeks.

Experimental: IHG 30% Normotensive - Participants who are normotensive conducting isometric resistance training using a hand dynamometer at 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Participants with perform 4 x 2 minutes isometric handgrip exercises 3 times per week under supervision for 8 weeks.

Sham Comparator: IHG 5% Normotensive - Participants who are normotensive conducting isometric resistance training using a hand dynamometer at 5% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Participants with perform 4 x 2 minutes isometric handgrip exercises 3 times per week under supervision for 8 weeks.

Experimental: IHG 10% Hypertensive - Participants who are either un-medicated pre-hypertensive or medicated for blood pressure management conducting isometric resistance training using a hand dynamometer at 10% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Participants with perform 4 x 2 minutes isometric handgrip exercises 3 times per week under supervision for 8 weeks.
