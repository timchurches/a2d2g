    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children aged between 4and 14 years, ASA grade I to II, scheduled for appendectomy, in a randomized, blind,
controlled clinical trial. Patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups:
One group of patients will receive an ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block using 0.4 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.25% with 1:200 000 epinephrine  The total dose of bupivacaine will not exceed 2 mg/kg and the total volume will not be more than 20 ml.
. The second group will receive local anesthetic infiltration  by the surgeon at the end of surgery 

. The allocation sequence will be generated by a random number table, and group allocation will be concealed in sealed, opaque envelopes, which will not opened until patient consent  obtained.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was determined After post-hoc power analysis of the time to first analgesic, with power 0.95, effect size 2.3, and alpha equal to 0.05, 18 participants per group were required. This was rounded upwards to 20.

Data will be statistically described in terms of mean +-standard deviation , or frequencies (number of cases) and percentages when appropriate. Data will be tested for normality using Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Comparison between the two study groups will bedone using Student t test for independent samples. p values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All statistical calculations will be done using computer programs SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) version 15 for Microsoft Windows </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Appendectomy is one of the most frequently performed
surgical procedures in children and is associated
with significant postoperative discomfort and
pain.Multimodal approaches to the provision of postoperative
analgesia often incorporate blockade of the abdominal
wall, such as ilioinguinal blockade or wound infiltration. However,
the efficacy of these approaches is unclear.
This study is a prospective,randomized comparison of 2 patient groups. One group of patients will receive an ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block using 0.4 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.25% with 1:200 000 epinephrine  The total dose of bupivacaine will not exceed 2 mg/kg and the total volume will not be more than 20 ml.
. The second group will receive local anesthetic infiltration  by the surgeon at the end of surgery for a laparoscopic appendectomy. </summary>
