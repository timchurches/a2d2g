    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With HBV DNA &lt; 400 Copies/mL and Histological Improvement (2-point Reduction in Knodell Necroinflammatory Score Without Worsening in Knodell Fibrosis Score) at Week 48 - Complete response was a composite endpoint defined as histological response and HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL. Histological response was based on the Knodell numerical scoring of liver biopsy specimens and defined as at least a 2-point reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score. The Knodell necroinflammatory score is the combined necrosis and inflammation domain scores and ranges from 0 to 14; the Knodell fibrosis domain score ranges from 0 to 4.
A participant was a nonresponder for the primary endpoint if either biopsy (baseline or end-of-treatment) was missing or if there was not an HBV DNA value available at or beyond Week 40.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objectives of this study are to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) versus adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for the treatment of
      HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Participants will receive TDF or ADV for 48 weeks
      (double-blind). After 48 weeks, eligible participants switched to open-label TDF for up to
      480 weeks.</summary>
