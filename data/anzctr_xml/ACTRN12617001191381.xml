  <interventions>
    <interventions>The CATH TAG is an electronic device that adhesively attaches to the catheter bag. It has a non-intrusive green light that flashes intermittently for a period of 24 hours upon activation. After 24 hours the green flashing light changes to red, flashing with increased rapidity and visibility. The light will flash red for 4 hours and subsequently change back to green, slower flashing, restarting the cycle. The red flashing light is an indication for the nurse to reassess the need for a urinary catheter and remove it when it is no longer required. This circle will continue for 10 days and then change permanently to the red flashing light to indicate that the battery of the CATH TAG is exhausted.  There is no option for nurses to manipulate the flashing light or amend the circle. </interventions>
    <comparator>The proposed study has adopted a stepped wedge randomised controlled design. This design enables each group to act as its own control.

During control phases no intervention is carried out, i.e. the CATH TAG will not be used. Usual practices according to local policies of the hospital regarding catheter removal will be followed.</comparator>

Computer-generated randomisation of the cross over dates for the wards will be performed independently by one of the investigators, who will not be involved in assessment or delivery of the intervention. Wards will not be blinded because it is not feasible to blind staff to the intervention. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>The proposed study has a stepped wedge randomised controlled deisgn. A mixed methods approach will be used, as a qualitative approach is included. The clusters in the study are pairs of individual hospital wards. The stepped wedge design includes an initial period where no wards are exposed to the intervention. Afterwards, at regular intervals (the steps) two wards, forming one cluster, are randomised to cross over from the control to the intervention, approximately every four weeks, with the process continuing until week 20, when all enrolled wards have crossed over.   The study design enables each ward to act as its own control, which removes the potential for some confounders such as variations in ward size and case mix. Staggered commencement and duration of the intervention, supports feasibility while maintaining the rigour of the study. This design will allow research staff to work with individual wards as they change over, maximising consistency of the intervention and aiding implementation.  In addition, data collection continues throughout the study, so that each cluster contributes observations under both control and intervention observation periods. In month 6 of the study, an online survey of nursing staff will be administered. Approximately two months after the stepped wedge study is completed, a focus group will be conducted.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Objective 1: To determine the efficacy of an electronic reminder system in reducing urinary catheter usage.

The primary outcome measure is the duration of catheterisation, and the study aims to evaluate the effect of the intervention. The analysis will be performed using the generalised estimating equations, using the duration of catheterisation as the dependent variable and intervention as the independent variable. Duration of the intervention will be treated as a confounding variable. It is anticipated that duration of catheterisation will be normally distributed, but exploratory analyses (and where necessary transformation) will be performed. Robust standard errors will be used to adjust for correlation at ward level and autocorrelation in time. There is no expected delay in the effect of the intervention on the outcome. 

Objective 2:  To determine whether the CATH TAG has an effect on nurses ability to deliver patient care.

Survey:
Data from the anonymous online survey will be analysed using SPSS. It is anticipated that data will be normally distributed but exploratory analyses will be performed, including testing of assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, multi-collinearity and normality of errors and if necessary transformation of data. Validity and reliability will be examined. Subsequently a general satisfaction score and individual satisfaction scores for the four dimensions of nurses experiences with the CATH TAG (Ease of use, Effectiveness, Changes in ownership, Barriers) will be calculated. Regression analysis will be conducted to determine if the duration of the intervention or the ward nurses primarily work on had an effect on nurses experiences with the CATH TAG. 

Any problems reported in the open questions will be taken into the focus group to be discussed and subsequently analysed qualitatively (see below).

Focus group:
Audio files from the focus group will be transcribed and these data will form the basis of data analysis. Data gathered from the focus group/s will be coded and analysed using qualitative analysis software (NVivo). The data analysis process will aim to identify and investigate both, pre-determined and emerging themes, in the data. The pre-determined themes will be drawn from the broad responses to the open questions in the survey, as well as from the studys objectives and will be reflected in the focus group questions. As themes are identified in the data, constant comparison analysis will be utilised. This process reduces redundancy in the analysis results by collapsing similar themes, identifies any relationships between the themes and ensures saturation is achieved. In this way, the essence of the hospital personnels perceptions will be determined.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> Indwelling urinary catheters are commonly used in healthcare facilities, with foundation work by two investigators indicating that 26% of patients admitted to an Australian hospital receive an indwelling urinary catheter and 1% of these patients develop catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Healthcare associated urinary tract infections (HAUTIs), including CAUTIs have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, higher hospital costs for patients and health systems.  In Australia, an estimated 380,000 bed days are lost each year due to HAUTIs, a large proportion of which are CAUTIs. Urinary tract infections (UTIs), specifically CAUTIs are associated with higher risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), making the treatment of patients difficult and compounding the effects of AMR when treatment is provided. A recent high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly addressed the issue of increasing AMR. This further emphasises the need to develop interventions to reduce the incidence of CAUTIs.

Despite advances in infection prevention and control, CAUTIs remain problematic, hence further research is needed to identify ways to reduce the burden they create. The greatest risk factor for CAUTIs is prolonged catheterisation, with catheters often placed unnecessarily, lacking documented reasons for insertion, and catheters remaining in place too long and not being promptly removed. Interventions that prompt removal of unnecessary catheters may therefore enhance patient safety. A reminder intervention is a mechanism used to remind either a physician or nurse that the catheter is still in place and that removal may be warranted if the catheter is no longer required.

The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic reminder system  the CATH TAG  to reduce urinary catheter use.</summary>
