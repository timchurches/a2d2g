    <summary>The study is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicenter clinical trial. The purpose
      of this study is to assess the efficacy of ABX203, a new chronic hepatitis B therapeutic
      vaccine administered as an adjunct therapy to nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs), in maintaining
      control of Hepatitis B disease after cessation of treatment with NUCs in subjects with HBeAg
      negative chronic Hepatitis B.</summary>
