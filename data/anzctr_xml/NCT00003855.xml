  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - axillary lymph node dissection
Treatment: other - whole breast irradiation

Experimental: Surgery + radiotherapy - Patients undergo axillary lymph node dissection involving removal of at least level I and II nodes, followed by whole-breast radiotherapy (exclusive of a third supraclavicular field) 5 days a week for a maximum of 7 weeks. Patients may receive adjuvant systemic therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.
Patients are followed up at 30 days, at 6, 12, 18, 30, and 36 months, and then annually for a total of 10 years.

Active Comparator: Radiotherapy - Patients undergo breast radiotherapy only. Patients may receive adjuvant systemic therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.
Patients are followed up at 30 days, at 6, 12, 18, 30, and 36 months, and then annually for a total of 10 years.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>PLEASE NOTE: Patients registered to this study may undergo intra-operative or
        postÂ¬operative randomization.

          1. Patient must be female.

          2. Patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          3. Patient's clinical stage must be documented as tumor size less than 5 cm, with no
             palpable nodes and no evidence of metastatic disease (T1 or T2 N0 M0; see appendices
             for staging criteria) and the tumor documented as amenable to lumpectomy.

          4. Patient must have a tissue diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma. Note: A patient can
             be registered to this study if they have a cytologic diagnosis suggestive of carcinoma
             from a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a palpable or non-palpable breast lesion and
             the investigator believes the breast lesion is clinically suspicious for invasive
             breast carcinoma.

          5. Date of the patient's first tissue diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma or cytologic
             diagnosis of carcinoma must be no more than 60 days prior to the SLND.

          6. The patient who had BCT (segmental mastectomy) performed previously, and is now
             referred to the local investigator for SLND, is eligible if the BCT was less than or
             equal to 60 days prior to the SLND. NOTE: Copies of the operative and pathology
             reports must be submitted as part of the registration process.

          7. Patient must have ECOG/Zubrod status =2, as documented in patient's medical record.

          8. Patient must be available for follow-up.

          9. Patient of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 14 days of beginning study interventions.

         10. Patient must have access to radiation therapy.

         11. A sentinel lymph node must be identified that contains metastatic breast cancer as
             documented by frozen section, touch prep, or H&amp;E staining on permanent section.

               -  NOTE: Patients with metastatic breast cancer identified by immunohistochemistry
                  (IHC) are not eligible.

         12. Patient randomized to ALND must undergo ALND within 42 days of their SLND.

         13. A patient with a history of a previous malignancy is eligible for this study as long
             as the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer survivor
             is eligible provided that the following criteria are met:

               1. The patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior
                  malignancies,

               2. There has been no evidence of any prior malignancies for at least five years with
                  no evidence of recurrence (except for effectively treated basal cell or squamous
                  carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in -situ of the cervix that has been effectively
                  treated by surgery alone, or lobular carcinoma in-situ of the ipsilateral or
                  contralateral breast treated by surgery alone), and

               3. The patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk for
                  recurrence from prior malignancies.

         14. Patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative must provide a signed and
             dated written informed consent prior to registration and any study-related procedures.

         15. Patient must provide written authorization to allow the use and disclosure of their
             protected health information. NOTE: This may be obtained in either the study-specific
             informed consent or in a separate authorization form and must be obtained from the
             patient prior to study registration.</inclusivecriteria>

          4. Patient has concurrent invasive bilateral breast malignancies.

          5. Patient has clinically and radiologically identified multi-centric disease that is not

          6. Patient has had previous ipsilateral axillary surgery such as excisional biopsy of
             lymph node(s), treatment of hidradenitis.

          7. Patient has a medical contraindication to ALND or is considered a poor surgical risk
             due to a non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, etc.) that would
             preclude the treatment options.

          8. Patient who is noted to have matted nodes or gross extranodal disease at the time of
             SLND.
