  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: Single tablet orally taken twice daily, 12.5 and 25 milligrams of Hydrochlorothiazide.
Group 2: Single tablet, twice daily, 12.5 and 25 milligrams of Atenolol.
Group 3: Single tablet, twice daily, 20 and 40 milligrams of Nifedipine Sustained Release
Group 4: Single tablet, twice daily, 25 and 50 milligrams of Captopril. 
All interventions were for eight weeks. Patients were first treated with lower dosage; if their blood pressure was still above 140/90 mmHg after two weeks, the dosage was increased to the second higher dosage.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypertension is an important public health problem. The inter-individual clinical response to antihypertensive therapy is highly variable. Genetic variations may influence the clinical response to antihypertensive treatment and side effects. This double-blind, active-controlled randomized trial was aimed to investigate the association between polymorphisms of candidate genes and blood pressure response to antihypertensive drugs in untreated hypertensive patients in countryside Chinese. All study medications were identical in appearance. The code was used to conceal drug name. The drugs were distributed to four groups according to predetermined number of each block.</summary>
