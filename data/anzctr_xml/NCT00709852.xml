  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study involves the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents called
      gadobutrol (Gadavist) Injection and ProHance Injection. The purpose of this study is to look
      at the safety (what are the side effects) and efficacy (how well does it work) of gadobutrol
      when used for taking MR images of the brain and spine. The results of the MRI with gadobutrol
      Injection will be compared to the results of MR images taken without contrast and with the
      results of the MR images taken with ProHance.</summary>
