  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic treatment based on the interrelation of cognitions, behaviours and affective responses. In CBT, the therapist and client collaborate to identify and modify unhelpful patterns of thoughts and behaviours which may maintain distress. CBT skills are practiced both in session and at home to consolidate gains. 

Mindfulness-integrated Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (MiCBT) integrates the teachings of mindfulness meditation practices with the core principles of CBT to address distress across a broad range of emotional and behavioural problems. Mindfulness skills include developing heightened sensory awareness of the present moment, disengagement from a cycle of judgement and reactivity to experience, and use of deliberate sustained attention to sensory and cognitive processes.

Both interventions above will be conducted in the form of group therapy sessions, held once a week over 8 weeks, with 2 additional weeks (before and immediately after the 8-week therapy program) to take baseline and post-test measures. Each session will be approximately 1.5 to 2 hours long, facilitated by Provisional Psychologists in the Master of Clinical Psychology, supervised by registered Psychologists and Clinical Psychologists. Participants will be encouraged to attend each session, and attendance will be monitored by therapy administrators through marking a roll each session. In both CBT and MiCBT, participants will be taught various techniques in session, and will be assigned home practice tasks based on the material discussed in session to complete in the following week. Participants are expected to complete approximately 30 minutes of home practice per week.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The research will compare two types of group programs (MiCBT and CBT). Both are existing treatments, and the study aims to directly compare the efficacy of these two treatments in this particular population.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was determined through use of previous literature on stress reduction to determine the average sample size observed in this area of research. A power analysis via the program G*Power (computerised statistical program, Universitat Dusseldorf) indicated that a sample size of 35 participants for group (total of 70 participants) was required for a large effect size with 80% power.   
Further statistical analyses will be conducted using ANCOVA on post-intervention stress symptoms, holding constant pre-existing stress symptoms as co-variates. In addition, a correlational analysis will indicate which secondary measures may potentially contribute to the effect of CBT and MiCBT.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to compare the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), with mindfulness-integrated cognitive behaviour therapy (MiCBT) on the reduction of stress for parents of children with Intellectual Disability (ID). We aim to evaluate which intervention is most effective, in terms of treatment effect size as well as acceptability for this population of individuals. We also aim to evaluate the overall service of these two therapies, for future implementation in treatment settings. In addition, we also aim to identify potential variables which may modulate the efficacy of the treatment, such as parental cognitions, child behaviour, and the quality of the interaction between parents and children. Identifying contributing variables may help us better understand the mechanisms involved in parental stress reduction, and provide avenues for further research.  </summary>
