  <interventions>
    <interventions>A six month intervention comprising  four face to face physiotherapy sessions (consisting of exercises working towards a specific goal), five telephone calls and 1-2 text messages per week, to encourage continuation of the prescribed exercise plan. Each physiotherapy intervention will be approximately 45 mins in duration and will occur at baseline, after 2 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. The phone calls will be approximately 20 mins in duration and will occur at 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 20 weeks. The treating physiotherapist makes the phone calls and discusses whether the exercises have been managed and how the participant is working towards their goal. They discuss any barriers to exercise completion and make suggestions to modify the programme if problems are occurring. The exercises will consist of simple functional exercises such as sit to stand, walking and balance, which directly pertain to acheiving the desired goal. The therapist and participant between them will agree on when the exercises will be done, including how many, what level of difficulty and any safety concerns. The participant will then do the exercises in their own home.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrolment will occur in New Zealand in the North Island at Middlemore Hospital (South Auckland), North Shore Hospital (North Auckland) and in the South Island at Princess Margaret Hospital (Christchurch), and Dunedin Hospital (Dunedin). In addition to the hospital recruitment, advertisements will be placed in local newspapers and in the Stroke foundation newsletter. These will alert people to the trial, who may have moved to the area since their stroke, or not been admitted to hospital. It will also include people who were not initially keen to join but changed their mind at a later date. Randomisation will be stratified by centre (4 locations) with recruitment targets of 32 participants from each of the North Island centres and 16 from each of the South Island centres, to proportionately represent the number of stroke admissions expected in each location. Stratified randomisation will be used according to centre and baseline mobility. Baseline mobility will be decided on the Functional Ambulation Classification: either ‘less mobile’ if they have a level of five or below or ‘more mobile’ if they have a level of six.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation software will be coded and tested by the study statistician, then handed over to a third independent party for random number generator seeding, execution of allocation and day-to-day management of the randomisation. The recruiters, assessors and personnel involved in data management and analysis will be blinded to treatment assignment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In New Zealand, around 45,000 people live with stroke and many studies have reported that benefits gained during initial rehabilitation are not sustained. This leads to reduced function over time; however, evidence indicates that participation in physical interventions prevents this functional decline. Whether a person receives ongoing stroke services is often related to factors, such as whether resources are available and geographical location. This trial will determine if the Augmented Community Telerehabilitation Intervention (ACTIV) programme supports people with stroke in the transition from rehabilitation to independence and if that results in better outcomes and quality of life. The ACTIV programme is a low cost intervention and uses readily available technologies, such as telephone and mobile phones combined with face-to-face visits from a physiotherapist to help people with stroke resume activities they enjoyed doing before the stroke. In-depth interviews will also be used to explore the experiences of people with the intervention. Measures of cost will be collected to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</summary>
