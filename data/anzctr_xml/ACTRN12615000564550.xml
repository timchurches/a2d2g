  <interventions>
    <interventions>The proposed project will be conducted as a randomised controlled pilot study. In addition to completing assessments, and receiving pamphlets and standard care, participants randomised to the intervention will be immediately engaged in the peer delivered Better Health Choices telephone intervention. Better Health Choices was developed to target the specific needs and barriers facing people with Schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses and aims to help participants decrease their smoking, increase their intake of fruit and vegetables (F&amp;V), and reduce their sedentary behaviour. It incorporates clear health messages, well-established behavioural strategies and can be tailored to the personal goals of each participant. Better Health Choices consists of 8 telephone sessions delivered by trained peer workers over a maximum of 11 weeks. Session 1 will be of 45-60 minutes duration, and consists of feedback from the baseline assessment regarding smoking, activity, screen time, F&amp;V intake and alcohol use with motivational interviewing employed to assist clients in identifying goals for change. A box of F&amp;V will be delivered between sessions 1 and 2 to assist initiation of behaviour change in F&amp;V intake. Sessions 2-8 will be conducted over 15-30 minutes and consist of motivational interviewing, education, and goal setting focused on smoking, F&amp;V consumption, and screen use. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored through a log of telephone sessions. Where clinically appropriate, smokers will be encouraged to access their general practitioner for nicotine replacement therapy (subsidised by the MBS). </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment of participants will occur from Neami services across Australia. 
Establishment: Neami staff nationwide will receive education around identification, initial eligibility screening and referral to the project. 
Identification: As part of current routine care, Neami support workers conduct regular needs and goal assessments with consumers. For all consumers who identify health needs or goals, support staff will refer the consumer to the study. Participants may also self-refer. Advertising of the study will include flyers in Neami offices, Neami newsletters and via letters mailed to Neami consumers. 
Referral: With the consumerâ€™s permission, Neami staff will provide the project officer with the contact details of eligible and interested consumers. 
Screening: The project officer will screen referred consumers to determine if they meet inclusion criteria. Non-eligible consumers will be referred to appropriate services, and with permission, feedback regarding ineligibility will be given to their local support worker. 
Consent: Eligible and interested participants will provide informed consent. A participant information statement and consent form will be mailed or emailed to the participant. All research activities will take place via phone.
On enrolment to the study, each participant will be allocated a study number. A sealed envelope will be pre-prepared that will include the study number on the outside of the envelope, and the persons treatment condition on the inside of the envelope. Immediately following the initial assessment, the assessment officer will open the envelope and inform the person of their treatment condition. Results of the baseline assessment will be provided to the allocated peer health coach, by the assessment officer, for participants allocated to the intervention. An electronic record of allocations will be kept to verify correct treatment receipt. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be managed independently by a member of our team (RM). Participants will be assigned a unique study number according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule and stratified for smoking status, gender, and duration of illness (&lt;5, 5-10, or 10+ years). Immediately following trial enrolment and baseline assessments, the participant will be informed of their treatment allocation.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Outcome assessment officers who are blind to condition will complete the 12 and 16-week outcome assessments. Assessors will be located within a separate organisation to the peer coaches and will not have any direct contact with the peer workers. Assessors will not have access to treatment files. Participants will be asked not to divulge treatment information. If a participant does divulge their treatment condition, an alternate assessment officer will complete all follow-up assessments for that participant.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The proposed study will be conducted using a randomised controlled pilot study design with intention-to-treat analyses applied. The effect of the treatment condition on the primary outcome measure of number of cigarettes smoked per day will be assessed against the control group using a pre-test vs. post-test by treatment group interaction in a repeated measures random effects regression model (xtreg in Stata SE version 11.2). The pre- vs. post-test contrast will consist of baseline vs. the two post-test measures together.  
Being a pilot trial the study will not be powered to detect a significant treatment effect but it will provide an indication of the size of the treatment effect that we can expect from the intervention and it will allow us to derive a more precise indication of the sample size required to detect a clinically meaningful reduction in smoking in subsequent full-scale trials.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a peer-delivered, telephone-based intervention targeting smoking, fruit and vegetable intake and sedentary behaviour (leisure screen time).

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are registered as a consumer of Neami services, are currently living with a severe mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), are at least 18 years of age, and can identify a health related personal goal.

Study details
Participants randomised to the intervention will participate in telephone sessions delivered by peer workers. These sessions focus on reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks by decreasing smoking, increasing fruit and vegetable intake and reducing sedentary behaviour. The intervention involves reinforcement of change, checking on current behaviours and simple behavioural strategies over 8 telephone sessions over up to 11 weeks.

Results from this study will inform the development and implementation of interventions to reduce the risk of CVD and cancer in people living with severe mental illness. By tailoring the intervention to be delivered by peer workers via telephone, Better Health Choices may become a more accessible intervention for people within mental health services, with the potential to help reduce the risk of CVD and cancer in this population.</summary>
