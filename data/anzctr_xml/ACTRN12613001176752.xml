  <interventions>
    <interventions>Training phase: Following baseline data collection, participants will be randomly assigned to a12-week specific exercise training intervention (n=33) or control group (n=33). The training intervention will comprise a multi-modal exercise program consisting of core strengthening -resistance exercise and balance exercises. 

Training sessions will be run for 12 weeks in small group sessions, 3 times a week for 45-minutes that fully administered and supervised by qualified exercise scientist.

Once participants complete 12 weeks training, we assess all the outcome measures (approximately 2 weeks), they will immediately start detraining phase.
 
Detraining phase: At completion of the 12-week multi-modal training intervention, participants will be invited to cross-over into the walking (control) condition and all assessments repeated (at week 24). Individuals from the initial control group will be invited to continue with their cardiovascular training. 


Motivation/adherence/ compliance strategies: Every participant of the training intervention received a paper with the individual improvements after the programme. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive a cardiovascular exercise program consisting of walking (indoor cycling will be used on days where it is deemed unsuitable to go outdoors) at approximately 60% of heart rate max. 

Detraining sessions will be run for 12 weeks in small group sessions, 3 times a week for 45-minutes that fully administered and supervised by qualified exercise scientist.

A walking program has been used as the control group since walking is not expected to change the size or strength of the muscles being targeted (trunk muscles).

Motivation/adherence/ compliance strategies: Every participant of the control group received a multimodal training after the post-measurements.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A repeated measure of analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) will be performed, , to identify between group differences at each of the four measurement points (0, 6, 12, 24 weeks) in each of the outcome variables.

We have estimated the effect size based on previously reported studies which were considered to be of high-quality were relevant to our study in terms of the training intervention and duration. Then, sample size was computed using G*Power 3 (http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/gpower/) and percentage of dropouts (20%) was considered. 

The total sample size 66 (approximately 33 per group) was determined, assuming a type I error probability (alpha=0.05), a type II error probability (beta=0.20) and effect size= 0.33.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Age-related loss of skeletal muscle leads to reduced engagement in physical activity, impaired performance of activities of daily living and reduced quality of life. This may be associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety. 
We aim to explore a role for exercise in improving the multiple factors comprising quality of life in aged individuals.
