  <interventions>
    <interventions>The experimental group will undertake task-specific walking training plus targeted strength training 3 times per week over 10 weeks. The overall duration of the section will be approximately 60 minutes (30 minutes of task-specific walking training and 30 minutes of strength training). Task-specific walking training plus targeted strength training: The 30-minute sessions of task-specific walking training will include practising part of the task (= 20 min) where muscles are working in a similar manner to full task performance and practising the whole task (= 10 min). Additionally, of the12 lower limb muscle groups (hip flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors, internal and external rotators; knee flexors and extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors, plantarflexors, invertors and evertors), all those Grade 4 or less on Manual Muscle Test (MMT) will undergo training. For very weak muscles (Grade 1 on Manual Muscle Test), strengthening exercises will be set up so that minimal muscle activity will result in movement. This will be achieved by focusing on the mid-range of muscle length; decreasing the effect of gravity; decreasing friction and decreasing the lever arm of the limb. Progression of exercises (Grade 2 on Manual Muscle Test), will focus on range of motion; sustaining contractions; increasing speed; beginning to add resistance to mid-range and resisted exercises. Once resistance can be introduced (Grade =3 on Manual Muscle Test), it will be implemented using weight machines, free weights and body weight. Programs will be individually-tailored and 50% of 1 Repetition Maximum (the maximum weight that can be lifted on a single occasion) will be used to set the initial load. Participants will be instructed to perform three sets of 10 repetitions for each exercise with a 12 minute rest period between sets. Then, the load will be increased to 80% of 1 repetition maximum (RM) and the training stimulus will be adjusted to stay at this load every two weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will undertake task-specific walking training  3 times per week over 10 weeks. The 30-minute sessions of task-specific walking training will include practising part of the task (= 20 min) where muscles are working in a similar manner to full task performance and practising the whole task (= 10 min).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lower limb muscle strength. Strength of all 12 lower limb muscles will be measured using hand-held dynamometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline,10 weeks after randomisation; 4 weeks after treatment cessation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lower limb motor coordination. Motor coordination will be measured using the Lower Extremity Motor Coordination Test (LEMOCOT). It consists of moving the lower extremity as fast as possible from 1 target to another for 20 seconds.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 10 weeks after randomisation; 4 weeks after treatment cessation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Walking ability.
Walking ability will be quantified by parameters such as speed (m/s), step length (m), and cadence (steps/min).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 10 weeks after randomisation; 4 weeks after treatment cessation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life.
The Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL)(39) will be used to measure participation. It consists of a single stroke outcome measure that assesses the various domains important in determining stroke-specific health related quality of life across the spectrum of stroke symptoms and severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 10 weeks after randomisation; 4 weeks after treatment cessation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 3 outcome measures (lower limb strength, motor coordination and gait speed) will be estimated using the method of patient?s global ratings of change.</outcome>
      <timepoint>10 weeks after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Evidence suggests that muscle strengthening after stroke can improve strength and activity. The improved lower limb muscle strength is related to improvement of walking speed. Additionally, task related practice performed at a high intensity may enhance walking competency in people with stroke. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that any one physiotherapy approach is more effective than any other. This clinical trial investigates if 10 weeks of progressive muscle strengthening of lower extremities in addition to a task-specific walking therapy in acute stroke patients results in better strength, motor coordination, walking ability and quality of life in comparison to task-specific walking training alone.</summary>
