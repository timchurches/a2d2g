    <studytitle>The effect of blood-flow restriction resistance exercise training of the legs on unrestricted exercising training of the arms.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In males aged 18 to 25 years does 7 w x 3d/w blood flow restriction resistance exercise of the legs more effectively improve muscle size and strength of arms that undertake unrestricted exercise training when compared with unrestricted resistance exercise training of the legs (active placebo).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Blood flow restriction (BFR) leg exercise
Training period: 7 weeks
Training frequency: 3 days per week
Training duration: 30 min per session
Exercise mode:
     * Bicep curl exercise of the dominant arm without BFR, and
        (3 sets of 10 reps; 3 min between sets)
     * bilateral knee flexion and extension exercises with BFR
        (4 sets of each comprising 30, 15, 15, 15 reps; 30 sec rest between sets)

Training intensity/duration: 30% 1 repetition maximum for leg exercise; 50% for arm exercise

For BFR exercise a pneumatic cuff is placed around the limb proximal to the exercising muscle/muscle group that produces an individualized restriction to limb blood flow, but NOT total occlusion to flow. No adverse reactions are noted and participants are supervised/monitored throughout all training sessions to ensure safety and adherence to the protocol.

All training sessions are administered individually or with other participants by an exercise physiologist.
Bicep curl exercises are completed first during all sessions, followed by the knee exercises (with all flexion then extension exercises in an alternate order during each subsequent session).</interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention: Active/Unrestricted leg exercise
Training period: 7 weeks
Training frequency: 3 days per week
Training duration: 30 min per session
Exercise mode:
     * Bicep curl exercise of the dominant arm, and
        (3 sets of 10 reps; 3 min between sets)
     * Bilateral knee flexion and extension exercises
        (4 sets of each comprising 30, 15, 15, 15 reps; 30 sec rest between sets)

Training intensity/duration: 30% 1 repetition maximum for leg exercise; 50% for arm exercise

The Active/Unrestricted group will undertake exercise without a restriction to limb blood flow during the leg exercise, and without application of the BFR cuffs so as to represent the normal expected exercise training stimulus.

All training sessions are administered individually or with other participants by an exercise physiologist.
Bicep curl exercises are completed first during all sessions, followed by the knee exercises (with all flexion then extension exercises in an alternate order during each subsequent session).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is student lead and forms part of a series of studies as part of a larger PhD project/thesis.
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether light-load blood-flow restriction training of the legs can improve the muscle size and strength of the arms that also undertake light load exercise but without a blood flow restriction.
There is a body of evidence that suggests there is circumstances in which muscle size adaptations are transferable between
limbs without the necessity for heavy load resistance exercise that is traditionally considered optimal for muscle growth.
Blood flow restriction exercise being performed in another limb is one such circumstance, and while one prior study has show this to be effective, it was underpowered and with other limitations.
The present study will replicate many of the conditions used previously to confirm whether arm muscle can be 'sensitized' to leg exercise and so achieve gains in muscle size and strength without the use of heavy load resistance exercise.</summary>
