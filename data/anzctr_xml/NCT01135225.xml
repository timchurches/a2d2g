             index procedure prior to the treatment of the target (study) lesion. The treatment of
             lesion(s) in non-target vessels more than 24 hours prior to the procedure does not
             preclude the treatment of an additional non-target lesion during the index procedure.

             has not reached its primary endpoint

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the EVOLVE Trial is to assess the safety and performance of the
      everolimus-eluting Evolution stent for the treatment of a de novo atherosclerotic lesion of
      up to 28 mm in length in a native coronary artery 2.25 mm to 3.5 mm in diameter. The safety
      and performance of two different drug release rate formulations of the Evolution Stent will
      be compared to the commercially available PROMUS (TM) Element (TM) drug-eluting stent.</summary>
