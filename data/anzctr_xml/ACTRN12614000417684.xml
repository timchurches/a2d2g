  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational. Prospective recruitment of patients identified by our protocol as non- high risk are followed up at thirty days from their index presentation to the Emergency Department (ED).
Patients are eligible for the protocol if they have chest pain, a  non-diagnostic electro-cardio-gram (ECG) and no immediate non-cardiac cause. 
Based on the clinical presentation a Senior ED Physician assesses the pre-test risk for a thirty day event.  High sensitivity cardiac troponin T is taken as close to arrival time as possible with a second troponin at two hours, based on serial clinical observation ECG and High sensitivity troponin testing a post test judgement of high or non-high risk is made by a senior ED physician. An initial troponin T of &lt;14ngm/l with a two hour delta of 5 or less is non-high risk, an initial troponin of between 14 and 52ngm/l with a delta of &lt;5ngm/l equals non-high risk a value &gt;52ngm/l equals high risk. Senior physician gestalt trumps the protocol.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Rule-out rule in high risk within six hours ED length of stay. Rule out requires a non diagnostic ECG and early SMO pre test probablitiy for ACS 30 day event. HS trop TR is taken at time zero and again at two hours if required. Basline  tropnin &lt; 14ng/l with delta of &lt;5 at two hours is rule out. Mid range troponin 14-53 ng/l and delta &lt;5 was rule out. SMO gestalt for rule in trumps the protocol.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Determine the safety/efficacy of a locally developed accelerated diagnostic protocol for identifying "non-high risk" status for adverse outcome at up to thirty days in patients who present to the ED with chest pain. Candidates who are not obviously ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or otherwise have an ischemic ECG but no immediately apparent non-ACS cause for chest pain are prospectively enrolled and followed up up at thirty days.
Major points of difference are, 1. Ability to safely dichotomize patients as either high risk or non-high risk.
2. no requirement for a formalized risk score
3. mandates early senior ED physician assessment for risk of ACS
4. very early rule out (,4 hrs) based on High Sensitivity Troponin  -T (Roche) values and or delta.
