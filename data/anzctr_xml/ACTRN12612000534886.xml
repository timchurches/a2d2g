  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single meal of a 250g charred beef steak, 1.5 cm thick, cooked on a hot plate at 220-240oC for 4 minutes on each side, to a minimum internal temperature of 70oC and served with 20g tomato sauce on two slices of white bread. The meal consists of 3210 kJ, 37g fat, 30g carbohydrates and 77g protein. The meal is consumed for breakfast after an overnight fast (10pm to 8am). Following a two week wash-out period, participants will consume the un-charred beef meal as a control.</interventions>
    <comparator>A single meal of a 250g un-charred beef steak, 1.5 cm thick, cooked under sous-vide conditions (vacuum sealed) in a water bath at 80oC for 3 hours, to a minimum internal temperature of 70oC and served with 20g tomato sauce on two slices of white bread. The meal consists of 3210 kJ, 37g fat, 30g carbohydrates and 77g protein. The meal is consumed for breakfast after an overnight fast (10pm to 8am) and followed by a two week wash-out period between study meals.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by public notices and advertisements placed in community newspapers. Telephone screening will firstly identify participants within the required age range and exclude those likely to be experiencing exclusion factors (family history of diabetes and heart disease, anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical use and BMI &gt;30). Participants meeting this screening will be forwarded the Participant Information Sheet and Consent form. The participants will be invited to a face to face meeting with the researchers to ensure the Participant Information Sheet has been read and understood. If written consent is provided, a written general health questionnaire and baseline blood sample will be drawn to verify inclusion criteria by excluding diabetes and risk of heart disease. Participants meeting the inclusion requirement will be invited to undertake the study and a date provided for the first breakfast meal. Allocation will be concealed by use of sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Red meat is a major component of the typical western diet. Despite providing between 30-50% of the daily intake of protein and an equivalent proportion of daily iron/zinc intake, red meat intake also positively correlates to colorectal cancer risk. The cancer risks from red meat depend in part on the cooking methods.  Burnt, barbequed or red meat cooked at high temperatures have higher concentrations of a diverse array of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidative and carcinogenic compounds including; heterocyclic amines (HCAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) and N-nitroso compounds (NOCs).  These potentially carcinogenic compounds are likely to initiate an oxidative stress response in the body. However, there is very limited data on what impact the methods of cooking red meat have on the digestion of the meat protein, and also responses elicited by hormonal and acute inflammatory pathways.</summary>
