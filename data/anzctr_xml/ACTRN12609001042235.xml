  <interventions>
    <interventions>After standard 3 port pars plana vitrectomy(PPV),a probe specialy desinged for the surgery was used to penitrate into the optic nerve head along the central retinal artery, at the same time, diretcly massaging along the central retinal artery wall (5-6 times, about 3 minutes).If the circulation did not recover, then a scleral depressor was used to press the optic nerve slightly retrobulbarly 5-6 times (about 2 minutes).</interventions>
    <comparator>central retinal artery occlusion with traditional treatments:ocular massage for 20 minutes, sublingual isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg and oral acetazolamide 500 mg daily for 3-4 days, oral asparine 100mg daily for at least 2 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect and safty of vitreous surgery with direct central retinal artery massage for central retinal artery occlusion. Pressing the central retinal artery in the optic nerve head 
with a probe or retrobulbarly with a sclera
depressor led to deformation and bending of the blood vessel wall. During the mechanical movement of the vessels 
induced by the probe, the embolus may be
broken into smaller pieces and then be dislodged, followed by curculation recovery. More than 15 cases received the sugical treatment, and more than 100 patients received the traditional treatments.</summary>
