  <interventions>
    <interventions>This stage involves testing the effectiveness of an enhanced model of contact (the intervention) for parents and children in Out Of Home Care who are in permanent foster care or kinship care placements. The proposed intervention draws from the protocols of two key programs Visit Coaching (Beyer, 2004, 2008) and a strengths based approach to supervised contact (Smith, Shapiro, Sperry, &amp; LeBuffe, 2014). The intervention consists of increased preparation for contact for parents, provision of guidance about activities for parents and their children during contact, improving communication between all parties, and debriefing after contact.

Intervention: The intervention for each child and parent will be delivered by  by the parents Key Worker within the out-of-home care program (the practitioner who has an existing relationship with the parent). 
The intervention includes the following aims: 

- To establish or maintain a constructive relationship with parents;

- To support the parent to attend visits and plan age appropriate activities to do with their child.

The intervention will include the following components:

- Orientation to discuss the intervention, expectations and concerns; 

- Assessment of the childrens needs to be met in visits;

- Confirmation of attendance at visits; 

- Preparation to identify the goals and aims they would like to achieve during visits with their children and plan activities that consistent with the childs needs and the parents goals; 

- Follow up support, feedback and planning; 

- Reviews of progress and new goal setting.

Resources will be provided to staff and parents to assist in visit planning, preparation and providing post visit support to parents. 

To ensure fidelity and adherance to the intervention protocol. Key workers responsible for the intervention delivery will attend training sessions, complete intervention checklists to ensure each component is provided to parents and will complete interviews prior to the intervention implementation and at follow up. A random selection of Intervention delivery sessions will also be observed by the research team to ensure adherance to the protocol and a high quality of delivery of the intervention. Feedback from these reviewed sessions will be provided to staff members for supervision and professional development purposes. The intervention will be supported by the research team until the conclusion of data collection, after approximately 9 months.

Parents will receive a 1x up to 1 hour session (including preparation and follow up) for each visit they attend with their children. The intervention will be delivered on at least 2 occasions between baseline and follow up dependent upon their case management plan.  
The intervention will be administered face to face or over the phone depending upon the parent's needs. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control: Usual care. Children and parents in the control groups will continue to receive supervised contact services as outlined in their child protection case management plan as provided by the agencies. As this is usual care, it is not being delivered by the research team. Researchers will collect data on the services provided as part of usual care to ensure comparisons can be made between intervention and control sites. </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>There are four groups of participants who will be recruited and interviewed as part of the study. 

1. Children who are in permanent out-of-home care and have supervised contact managed by one of the participating agencies in ACT and Victoria will be interviewed if they are aged between 8 and 14 years. Information will be collected from others about children under 8 years of age (with consent).

2. Parents of children aged 0 to 14 years who are in permanent out-of-home care and have supervised contact managed by one of the participating agencies in ACT and Victoria.

3. Carers of these children are also eligible to participate.

4. Workers from the partner agencies allocated to the children in the study will also be invited to be interviewed. 

Although parents, carers and workers are also to be interviewed, the sample is based on 180 child participants (90 in the intervention group and 90 in the control group).</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial of an enhanced contact intervention with children in out-of-home care and their birth parents. Partner agencies are from two jurisdictions: ACT and Victoria.

Allocation to ‘intervention” and “control” sites was concealed as follows.

Randomisation in both jurisdictions was undertaken at a meeting where representatives of all the participating agencies were present, to ensure transparency of the process.
 
As is standard in a cluster randomised trial, the intervention will be implemented across the intervention sites and all clients of that service will receive the intervention whether they are actively recruited into the study or not. 

At each intervention and control site, children, parents and carers will be initially approached by workers from the Partner agencies. A researcher will provide more detail about the study. Informed Consent will be obtained from the person with parental responsibility for the child (parent, carer or the Department). Assent will also be obtained from the child after the study has been explained at a level appropriate to their age.
For children in sibling groups simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software to select the study child to be recruited and the focus of data collection in the interviews with parents, carers and workers. For eligible children without siblings no randomisation was used as the randomisation occured at the agency level. </concealment>
    <sequence>Stratified allocation was employed in this study. Agency programs were randomised according to the numbers of children in their program and their jurisdiction were the factors for stratification.
Agencies were stratified by jurisdiction to ensure intervention and control sites in both the ACT and in Victoria. We paired the agency sites in both jurisdictions according to the size of the program based upon data collected from the agencies of eligible participants prior to randomisation.  To minimise selection bias, for each of the nine pairs an independent researcher randomly allocated  each agency (using opaque, identical, sealed envelopes) to the intervention group and the other to the control group. Simple randomisation was conducted by picking envelopes out of a box,  resulting in 9 intervention and 9 control sites in the two jurisdictions.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>This is an open study; however, the training of agency staff and the monitoring of the fidelity of the intervention will be independent of the outcome data collection. The research team member providing the intervention training will not conduct baseline or follow up interviews with participants.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>There are no estimates of effect size on which to base our sample size calculations, as there are no trials of contact interventions published. We have made some assumptions to determine the sample size necessary to detect change in the primary outcome variables (namely, increase childrens emotional safety and reduction in their distress related to contact) using PASS software (2014). As there are no estimates available for the matching correlation, we have used a conservative approach and estimated power using an unmatched cluster randomised design (Donner and Klar, 2000). Assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.06 (Miller-Lewis, Sawyer, Searle, Mittinty, Sawyer, Lynch, 2014) and an average cluster size of 10, randomising 18 clusters to two groups (i.e. Total n=180, i.e. 180 carers, 180 parents, 180 workers = 540 interviews) will yield 100% power to estimate an effect size of 1.0; 72% power to estimate an effect size of 0.5; and 39% power to estimate an effect size of 0.33. 

NVivo will be used to analyse qualitative data, and quantitative data will be analysed using SPSS.

Comparisons of the control and intervention groups will be made at baseline by calculating descriptive statistics to assess randomisation. Analysis for the continuous primary outcome, SDQ, will be performed using a linear mixed model to allow for the matched, clustered design of the trial. We will adjust for the baseline value and any potential confounding variables that display baseline imbalance between intervention groups. Secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar way. For dichotomous variables, we will use a generalised linear mixed model, which extends the standard logistic regression model to account for the clustered data. The qualitative data will be coded for themes and used to add additional context to the quantitative data.
