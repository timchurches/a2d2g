  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1. Usual clinical care plus 9 sessions of behavioural self-management training using an applied behaviour analytic approach. Behavioural self-management training will involve daily self-monitoring of target behaviours, individual objective goal-setting, performance feedback, and behavioural consultation and problem-solving based on functional assessments. 1 x 30 min session per week for 9 weeks, administered one-on-one by a therapist with doctoral-level qualifications in psychology.

Arm 2. Usual clinical care plus 9 sessions of stress management training. Stress management training will involve daily self-monitoring of target behaviours (identical to Arm 1) and cover relaxation and stress reduction skills including diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness. 1 x 30 min session per week for 9 weeks, administered one-on-one by a therapist with doctoral-level qualifications in psychology.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Behaviours linked to better health outcomes for people with diabetes include regular blood glucose monitoring, appropriate insulin dosing, regulation of carbohydrate intake and increased physical activity. However, knowing what to do, and why, is often not enough to set-up and maintain the complex set of personal behaviours needed to improve health outcomes. This study examines the extent to which adding psychological intervention to usual medical care for young adults with type 1 diabetes can improve behavioural self-management of diabetes and associated health outcomes. Type 1 diabetics aged 18-25 years receiving regular outpatient multidisplinary care for their diabetes will be assigned to one of three conditions: (1) usual care alone; (2) behavioural self-management training based on the principles of applied behaviour analysis; and (3) stress-management training. Groups will be compared on behavioural adherence to diabetes self-management regimens, physiological health outcomes including metabolic control, and psychological wellbeing.</summary>
