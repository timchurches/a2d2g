  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adolescents with sleep disorders will be randomly allocated to a 7-week Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) program for sleep disorders, or a 7-week no-treatment waitlist control condition. The treatment involves 4 structured 2hr group sessions administered by a psychologist or clinical psychologist. Session 1 focuses on rapport building, goal setting, and sleep psychoeducation. Session 2 focuses on changing sleep behaviour (stimulus control and sleep restriction). Session 3 focuses on changing negative thoughts, attitudes and beliefs about sleep. Session 4 aims to tailor the program to the individual, allow for problem solving and information about relapse prevention</interventions>
    <comparator>Adolescents with sleep disorders will be randomly allocated to a 7-week Cognitive Behavioural Therapy program for sleep disorders, or a 7-week no-treatment waitlist control condition. Teenagers in the waitlist condition wait 7 weeks and repeat baseline assessments before beginning treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep as measured by Actigraphy data. Actigraphy will provide the primary objective measure of sleep/wake cycles. Participants will wear an actiwatch (Mini Mitter Co., Inc.) on their non-dominant hand for one week. Actigraphy units are light-weight watch-like devices that measure sleep-related movement and activity in the client's home environment. Actigraphy data will be used to calculate sleep parameters  such as the length and number of night-time awakenings; total sleep time; sleep efficiency and naps.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There are three timepoints: At baseline (T1); after CBT or waitlist (T2) and 3 months after completing CBT (T3).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep as measured by a week long sleep diary. Each day adolescents will complete a sleep/wake diary in which they will record periods of being asleep and being awake over a 24-hour period. Diaries will be completed for 1 week overlapping with actigraphy data. Diaries will be used to calculate sleep parameters such as sleep onset latency; the length and number of night-time awakenings; total sleep time; sleep efficiency and naps.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There are three timepoints: At baseline (T1); after CBT or waitlist (T2) and 3 months after completing CBT (T3).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Daytime sleepiness and fatigue: The Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (Drake et al., 2003) will provide a measure of daytime dysfunction. It consists of 8 items that ask children to rate how sleepy they feel in various situations (e.g., at school, on the bus, etc.) over the past two weeks. The Fatigue Severity Scale (Krupp, LaRocca, Muir-Nash &amp; Steinberg, 1989) contains nine items assessing the severity of fatigue symptoms over the past week.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep problems are common during adolescence and have a significant impact on the daily functioning and future potential of young people. This project evaluates the effectiveness of Cognitive-Behavioural Treatment (CBT) for sleep disorders in high-school aged young persons. Young people will take part in a randomised controlled trial in which they will be randomly allocated to complete a 7-week group-based Cognitive-Behavioural program for sleep or a 7-week waitlist control condition. Participants allocated to the waitlist condition will be asked to wait 7 weeks and be assessed again prior to beginning treatment. The effect of treatment will be measured on young persons sleep, mood, daily functioning, externalising behaviour and quality of life immediately after completing treatment and 3 months later. 

Hypotheses: We expect that compared with the no-treatment waitlist group, young people that complete CBT will show:
1)	Improved sleep/wake behaviour, including less time to fall asleep, longer total sleep duration, fewer night-time awakenings, and more consolidated sleep.
2)	Improved daytime functioning including less reported daytime sleepiness and fatigue.
3)	Improved anxiety and depression symptomatology.
4)	Improved quality of life.
5)	Reduced externalising difficulties on questionnaire measures of disruptive, aggressive and delinquent behaviours. It is expected that treatment gains will be maintained at 3 month follow up.</summary>
