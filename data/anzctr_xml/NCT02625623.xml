  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Avelumab
Treatment: drugs - Irinotecan
Treatment: drugs - Paclitaxel
Other interventions - Best Supportive Care (BSC)

Experimental: Avelumab+Best Supportive Care (BSC) - 

Active Comparator: Physician's choice chemotherapy+BSC or BSC alone - Physician's choice chemotherapy comprises of the following:
Paclitaxel or
Irinotecan
Subjects who are not deemed eligible to receive Paclitaxel or Irinotecan at the dose and schedule specified will receive BSC as per investigator discretion and visit the clinic once every 3 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Avelumab
Avelumab will be administered as a 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion at 10 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) once every 2-week treatment cycle until confirmed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity along with best supportive care (BSC).

Treatment: drugs: Irinotecan
Irinotecan will be administered at a dose of 150 mg/m ^2 on Day 1 and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities along with BSC.

Treatment: drugs: Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel will be administered at a dose of 80 mg/m^2 on Day 1, 8, and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities along with BSC.

Other interventions: Best Supportive Care (BSC)
BSC is defined as treatment administered with the intent to maximize Quality of life without a specific antineoplastic regimen and is based on investigator's discretion. BSC will be administered once every 3 weeks.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Time (in months) from randomization to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the subject's death</outcome>
      <timepoint>Until 256 events (deaths) have been observed and a minimum of 6 months follow-up since the last subject randomized (assessed up to 2 years)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization until date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurs first. PFS will be assessed as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest diameter (SLD), taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Until 256 events (deaths) have been observed and a minimum of 6 months follow-up since the last subject randomized (assessed up to 2 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Overall Response (BOR) - BOR will be determined according to RECIST 1.1 and as adjudicated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). BOR is defined as the best response of any of the complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) recorded from the date of randomization until disease progression or recurrence (taking the smallest measurement recorded since the start of treatment as reference). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. Stable disease (SD)=Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Until 256 events (deaths) have been observed and a minimum of 6 months follow-up since the last subject randomized (assessed up to 2 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in European Quality Of Life 5-dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) Health Outcome Questionnaire - The EQ-5D-5L Health Outcome Questionnaire is a measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 5 items are combined to generate health profiles. These profiles were converted to a continuous single index score using a one to one matching. The lowest possible score is -0.59 (unable to walk, unable to self-care, unable to do usual activities, extreme pain or discomfort, extreme anxiety or depression) and the highest is 1.00 (no problems in all 5 dimensions).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Until 256 events (deaths) have been observed and a minimum of 6 months follow-up since the last subject randomized (assessed up to 2 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status - EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life (QoL) in cancer subjects. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial impact. The EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score ranges from 0 to 100; High score indicates better GHS/QoL. Score 0 represents: very poor physical condition and QoL. Score 100 represents: excellent overall physical condition and QoL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Until 256 events (deaths) have been observed and a minimum of 6 months follow-up since the last subject randomized (assessed up to 2 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Stomach Cancer Specific (EORTC STO22) Questionnaire Scores - The QLQ-STO22 is a gastric cancer quality of life questionnaire. There are 22 questions concerning disease, treatment related symptoms, side effects, dysphagia, nutritional aspects, and questions about the emotional problems of gastric cancer (dysphagia, pain, reflux, eating restrictions, anxiety, dry mouth, body image, and hair loss). For the symptom scales or single items, participants will be assessed using a 4-point scale (1=not at all; 2=a little; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). All scales and single-item scores ranged from 0 to 100. For the symptom scales or single items, a higher score indicated a high level of symptoms and problems, i.e. 0=no symptoms, 100=most severe symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Until 256 events (deaths) have been observed and a minimum of 6 months follow-up since the last subject randomized (assessed up to 2 years)</timepoint>
