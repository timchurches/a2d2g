  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: 1) CBM intervention (OxIGen) plus Internet based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) for depression, or 2) Waitlist control.
All participants will meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Group 1 participants will first complete a 1 week online computer CBM program, called OxIGen (Oxford Imagery Generation). The OxIGen program consists of a series of auditory stimuli that Group 1 participants will listen to and make ratings in response to. Group 1 participants will login 1 time per day for a period of 7 consecutive days to complete a new module. Each module will take between 13-20 minutes to complete. Group 1 and  participants will then complete 6 lessons of Internet based treatment about the management of symptoms of depression. One lesson will be completed every 7-14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 7 days between lessons and a maximum of 14 days). Each lesson will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Group 1  participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, homework exercises, extra resources, weekly reminder emails, and contact with a Clinician as required. The duration of the program will be 8-10 weeks. Group 2 participants will receive the same iCBT treatment as Group 2 (without the additional Oxigen Program) after 11 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Waitlist control group. These participants remain on the waitlist until Group 1 has completed treatment (11 weeks). At that time (11 weeks) the waitlist group will receive iCBT.</comparator>
