    <interventions>The aim of this project is to conduct a safety, tolerability and exploratory end-point pilot study assessing the administration of a cannabis extract containing approximately 2.4 mg of cannabidiol (CBD) and approximately 2.6 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) compounds extracted from cannabis sativa L. per dose (300 micro litres) delivered in a fine-mist oro-buccal spray as an adjunct to opioid analgesia for the management of intractable pain in patients with a positive diagnosis of advanced cancer. This is an open label pharmacokinetic and dose escalation study, comprising of two stages:
STAGE 1 (n= 5 people with advanced cancer):
Day -2: 
	participants assessments and on satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria and completion of signed informed consent. Baseline blood sample collection.
Day 1:
	Open label single treatment group pharmacokinetic arm of the study administering standard a dose of 2.6 mg THC and 2.4 mg CBD in 0.3 mL (representing 1 standard dose of 2 actuations from the buccal spray delivery system). 
Day 2 (consecutive):
	Administering 7.8 mg THC and 7.2 mg CBD in 0.9 mL (representing 3 standard doses of 6 actuations from the buccal spray delivery system).
Day 1 and 2: Participants remain under clinical supervision in hospital for 48 hours [2 nights] to carefully assess safety and tolerability of the product.
If an unforeseen adverse event is reported, the PI may require the participant to remain admitted for extended monitoring.  

STAGE 2 (n=25 participants with advanced cancer and intractable pain not responsive to opioid analgesic medicines): 
Consists of (i) dose escalation phase; (ii) dose treatment phase; 
(iii) follow-up phase. 
Please note: If an unforeseen adverse event is reported, the PI may require the participant to remain admitted for extended monitoring.  
(i) Dose escalation phase:  
	Day -2: Participants assessments and on satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria and completion of signed informed consent. Baseline blood sample collection. Participants will be advised that they will be hospitalised for days 1, 4 and 7 of this stage of the study.
	On Days 1 to 3:  Dispense new cannabis vial. Administer 2 actuations of the pump (delivering 2.6 mg THC+2.4 mg CBD in 0.3 mL) every 4 hours (unless asleep) repeat for 3 days.  Participants to complete questionnaires at the end of each day in the case report form.  On day 1 of stage 2 participants will be hospitalized for 1 night at RNSH and assessed. At the discretion of the PI (based on tolerability) participants may require longer observational periods in hospital.  
Return to RNSH on day 4 for admission to RNSH and for assessments. Return used cannabis medicine vial.  Dispense new cannabis vial.  Increase dose to two doses (4 actuations of the pump delivering 5.2 mg THC+4.8 mg CBD in 0.6 mL) every 4 	hours repeat for 3 days.  Blood sample collection.   On day 4 of stage 2 participants will be hospitalized for 1 night at RNSH.  At the discretion of the PI participants may require longer observational periods in hospital.  
	Return to RNSH on day 7 for admission to RNSH and for assessments. Return used cannabis medicine vial. Dispense new cannabis vial.  Increase dose to three doses (6 actuations of the pump delivering 7.8 mg THC+7.2 mg CBD in 0.9 mL) every 4 hours repeat for 3 days.  Blood sample collection.
(ii) Treatment phase (ongoing):
	Return to RNSH on day 10 for assessments.  Return used cannabis medicine vial.  Participants undergo physical examination. Participants return completed Phase 2 Case Report Form (CRF). Dispense new cannabis vial.  Administer, either, one, two or three doses for 3 days once every 4 hours as indicated by clinician.  Blood sample collection. 
	Return to RNSH on day 13 for assessments.  Return used cannabis medicine vial.   Dispense new cannabis vial. Continue administration of cannabis medicine at the same dose as directed by clinician.  Blood sample collection.  Final dose of investigative product will occur at the end of day 15. 
	Return to RNSH on day 16 for assessments.    Return used cannabis medicine vial.   Participants undergo physical examination.  Participants return completed Phase 2 Case Report Form (CRF).  Blood sample collection.
Follow-up phase:
	Return to RNSH on Day 30.  Participants will be followed-up after completing dose escalation and treatment phases 2-weeks post completion. Participants complete questionnaires and a blood sample will be collected.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>For the two secondary efficacy variables (i.e., NRS pain score and use of breakthrough medication), the Hochberg (1) method will be used to test the global hypothesis for a treatment effect on pain. The null hypothesis will be rejected if either secondary variable produce a two-sided P&lt;= 0.025 or both produce a P&lt;= 0.05. The pre dose NRS score will be the average of the 3 NRS scores on any given day. The pain NRS score will be the mean of the first 12 hours post dose assessments. The change in mean NRS pain score from baseline (all days in run-in period) to the post dosing will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline pain as a covariate and grouped study and treatment as factors (2,3). The proportions of responders (patients with &gt;= 30% improvement from baseline to end of study NRS pain score) will be compared. Use of breakthrough medication) will be analyzed
using logistic regression with a cumulative logit model. In addition, the change from baseline in mean number of doses of escape medication will be analyzed using ANCOVA. 
The study will be powered assuming an underlying treatment difference of 1 point on an NRS and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.6 (estimated from previous studies), with 80% power and two-sided 5% significance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to conduct a safety, tolerability and exploratory end-point pilot study assessing the administration of a cannabis extract as an adjunct to opioid analgesia for the management of intractable pain in patients with a positive diagnosis of advanced cancer. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and have been diagnosed with an incurable malignancy (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and reported experiencing moderate to severe pain (Stage 2 only). 

Study details
This study will be conducted in two stages. During the first stage, participants will be enrolled and remain under clinical supervision in hospital for 48 hours. On day 1, a standard dose of 2.6 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 2.4 mg cannabidiol (CBD) in 0.3 mL will be administered using a buccal spray delivery system. On day 2, three standard doses will be administered. Participants will be monitored for any adverse events during hospital stay. 

Stage 2 will involve a dose escalation over 7 days commencing with one standard dose every 4 hours and three standard doses every 4 hours by day 7 which are then maintained until day 15. Several assessments are conducted over administration period and on day 30 post intervention commencement. 

This study may greatly contribute to the research into the pharmacokinetic and medicinal properties of the Cannabis plant, in particular C. sativa L. and C. indica L. strains. The treatment may be beneficial for the treatment of intractable pain in cancer patients in conjunction with the conventional opioid treatment.</summary>
