    <interventions>This study explores the effectiveness of a parent training programme that utilises a treatment strategy called Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cueing (DTTC) to improve the speech skills of children with Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS).  This strategy utilises the principles of motor learning to cue children with CAS to say difficult sound combinations.  Parents will provide the treatment at home to the children for 15 minutes twice a day 5 days a week in two 4 week blocks. The 4 week blocks are separated by a period of 2 weeks.  Parents will be trained in direct one-to-one sessions with one of the researchers who is also a speech pathologist.  These parent training sessions will be for 1 hour a week over 4 weeks. 

The outline for the study is as follows:
* 4 weeks of baseline data collection (probe data is collected from the child once a week to obtain a stable baseline)
* 4 weeks of parent training.  This takes place in the clinic with the parent and the child attending for 1-2 hours once a week.
* 4 weeks of home treatment.  Parents work with the children in the home. 15 minutes twice a day, five days a week.  Parents work on the target set 1 words. Probe data is still collected once a week (either the parent records it and uploads it or it is recorded on Adobe Connect when an online meeting is organised between the researcher and the parent).
* 2 week maintenance period. No therapy is done at home.  Probe data is still collected once a week.
* 4 weeks home treatment. Parents will work on target set 2. Probe data is still collected each week.
* 4 weeks maintenance. No therapy is conducted. Probe data is still collected once a week.  At the end of this period, the post assessment data is collected. The child will attend the clinic for this.

 Only one parent will participate (the parent that will provide the home programme).  The researchers will maintain regular phone contact with the parents to monitor their adherence to the intervention.  Parents will also be provided with aides to help them remember to do the homework.  This might include calendars or notifications on their phone.</interventions>

      <outcome>Percentage accuracy of words correct (PWC) based on a 3 point scaled system of perceptual judgement. A score of 2 is correct, 0 is incorrect and 1 is a close approximation.  The scores are then converted to a percentage based on the total possible number of scores. These scores will also be obtained from the 60 probe words. Data will be collected by the parent via the use of an audio digital recorder.</outcome>

Participants will be recruited from the current caseload or waiting list of the Speech Pathology Department at the Mamawetan Churchill River Health Region, Saskatchewan, Canada.  They will be handed an information flyer by someone independent to the study when they arrive for a therapy appointment.  They will be asked to contact the local researcher if they have more questions.  If they agree to participate in the study, a pre-test battery of assessments will be undertaken to determine their eligibility.  If they are eligible and consent is obtained, they will be entered into the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>This is a single subject multiple baseline across participants study design. Randomisation is obtained through the study design rather than allocation of participants.  For instance, there are two treatment blocks and treatment words are randomly assigned to the different treatment blocks.</sequence>

Single subject experimental designs (SSED) are built on the premise of a small number of participants.  They are a useful and legitimate form of clinical research (Byiers, Reichle, &amp; Symons, 2012).  They often help to establish the realistic clinical applications of a treatment regime in the messy world of real world clinical circumstances.  They can be a useful means of evaluating the effectiveness of treatment for conditions which are rare making large scale randomised controlled trials (RCT) difficult or where scarce resources limit the ability to conduct RCT.  They can also be a useful stepping stone towards RCT.  However, because of their small sample size, their strength or validity (both internal and external) has to arise out of a different source other than the number of participants.  Repetition is the main means by which the validity of SSED can be strengthened.  Multiple baselines, several phases, multiple data points, alternating treatment designs and at least 2 participants can allow SSED studies to achieve more confidence in the strength of their results (Kratochwill et al., 2013; McReynolds &amp; Thompson).  Building in randomisation into the design of the SSED study also allows for greater confidence in the results.  The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) which was established by the Institute for Education Sciences (IES), has developed a guide in determining the effectiveness of SSED studies (Kratochwill et al., 2013).  Multiple baseline SSED studies are said to have met the standards when they have at least 6 phases with at least 5 data points.
In our study, these standards are met in the following ways:
* By having at least 4 participants with 6 phases each (baseline, parent training, parent treatment phase 1, no treatment, parent treatment phase 2, maintenance), our study has built in replication into the design of the study.
* Our study will also have at least 5 data points per phase allowing for adequate comparison of results.
* By having multiple baselines across participants, our study has built in randomisation in terms of the start of the treatment phase.
* There will be randomisation in terms of which treatment word list is targeted first
* There will be randomisation in terms of which participant starts first.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to explore the effectiveness of a parent training programme that utilises Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cueing (DTTC) to improve the speech skills of children with Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS).  It will not only add weight to the effectiveness of DTTC as a treatment programme but will examine whether a parent delivered DTTC programme is an effective treatment option.  The success of a parent delivered DTTC programme will have significant real world application as it will allow clinicians to juggle the competing demands of clinical practice and evidence based practice.  It is hypothesised that a parent implemented DTTC treatment programme for CAS will result in the children producing more accurate speech sounds and words at the conclusion of the study</summary>
