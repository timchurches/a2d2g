  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Verruca vulgaris, otherwise known as the common wart, is caused by the human papillomavirus
      (HPV). Common warts are generally located on the hands and feet, but can also occur elsewhere
      (e.g., any areas of frequent contact). Common warts have a characteristic cauliflower-like
      surface, are typically slightly raised above the surrounding skin and are generally diagnosed
      by visual inspection.The treatment of warts poses a therapeutic challenge for physicians. No
      single therapy has been proven effective at achieving complete remission in every
      patient.This study will aim to evaluate an up-to a three-day course of therapy with 0.05%
      PEP005 Topical Gel.</summary>
