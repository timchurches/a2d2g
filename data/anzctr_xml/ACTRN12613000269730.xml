  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised controlled crossover trial where oral pancreatic replacement therapy (in Australia called Creon) will be compared to placebo.  Each study arm will be 4 weeks. Creon will be prescribed at a dose of 40,000 BPU lipase three times daily with meals, and 25,000 BPU with every snacks (from 0 up to a 2 maximum per day). The placebo will physically (as much as possible) represent the active medication and will contain an inert substance.

After the 4 weeks participant will be reviewed and assessed for weight, bowel function, faecal elastase and Quality of life questionnaire.  The participant will then have one week 'washout' and then take the other medication of the crossover.  The same parameters at the 4 week will then be done again at completion of week 9.</interventions>

    <concealment>Twenty patients post major upper gastrointestinal surgery, who are at least 3 months post surgery and are at least 6 weeks post chemoradiotherapy.   Will be recruited for the study from the Box Hill Hospital Upper GI and Hepatobiliary surgical unit outpatient clinic  The treating clinician will see the patient in the normal way and identify potential patients for recruitment, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the clinician has completed their consultation with the patient, they will leave the room. The principal researcher will then meet the patient in the consulting room with a written summary of the project and explain the project verbally. The patient will be given an opportunity to ask questions regarding the trial, and may either decide to participate at the time of the initial interview, or take a period of a week or more to make their decision. The principal researcher will take patient’s contact details if they would like to participate or are considering participating, and will likewise provide their contact details. For those patients considering participation, verbal consent will be obtained to contact the patient by phone after one week, to establish their decision. Informed consent in the form of a document requiring the patient’s signature will be obtained at the time of the final decision of the patient. Once a participant has consented, they will be sent to the Box Hill Hospital Pharmacy. Allocation will be conducted by the Box Hill Trial Pharmacist, who will randomised the patients to either container A or B.  The principal researcher and the participant will be blinded as to which medication is taken. </concealment>
    <sequence>In order to successfully randomize participants to commence the treatment or placebo arm and to avoid imbalance in the number of patients assigned to each group, a blocked randomization process will be used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is aimed at people who have had major upper gastrointestinal abdominal surgery more than three months ago, are not currently on chemoradiotherapy and who may therefore have symptoms or signs of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). 

Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) occurs when something prevents the pancreas from functioning properly. In the healthy state the pancreas releases substances into the intestinal system to break down the food we eat. In patients with major upper gastrointestinal abdominal surgery this process can be impaired due to changes in the mechanical passage of food, physiological changes from the surgery due to hormonal changes or due to poor function of the pancreas. This means that some patients with major upper gastrointestinal abdominal surgery cannot breakdown fats and so they cannot absorb fats from their food. This results in:

-	weight loss
-	 or inability to gain weight
-	 non-absorption of essential vitamins found in fats (for example vitamin A, D, E and K)
-	unpleasant fatty diarrhoea which is frequent, foul smelling and difficult to flush

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (or PERT) refers to a medication which replaces the most important of the bodys natural pancreatic enzymes and therefore can allow better breakdown and absorption of fats. This may help patients who have had major upper gastrointestinal abdominal surgery to maintain a healthy weight, and have reduction in the unpleasant side effects of frequent diarrhoea. Hence the treatment may reduce weight loss, and malnutrition, and may improve quality of life. 

Creon (Trademark) is the trade name of this medication, and is approved in Australia to treat the symptoms discussed already (such as diarrhoea) in patients with evidence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. However, it is not always prescribed by specialists and the exact indications for its use have not been fully defined. Therefore, this medication needs to be tested to establish if it is an effective treatment for some of these major upper gastrointestinal abdominal surgery symptoms.
