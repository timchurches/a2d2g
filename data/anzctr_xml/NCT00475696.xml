          -  Patients must have predominant symptoms of bladder overactivity defined as meeting
             both of the following criteria:

               1. bothersome urinary urgency (the sensation of the urgent need to void for fear of
                  leakage) for a minimum of 3 consecutive months prior to study entry, or urge
                  urinary incontinence (UUI; the involuntary loss of urine preceded by urgency) for
                  a minimum of 3 consecutive months prior to study entry

               2. abnormal frequency of micturition (an average voiding interval of 2 hours or less
                  [2] during waking hours) as confirmed by at least two days of recording on the
                  screening dairy collected at Visit 1.

               -  A significant arrhythmia despite antiarrhythmic medication, uncontrolled angina,
                  or a significant abnormality on ECG within 6 months prior to study entry that, in
                  the opinion of the investigator, requires investigation or intervention.

               -  Any active cardiac ischemic condition, including myocardial infarction within 6
                  months prior to study entry

          -  Have any condition, limitation, disease, or abnormal laboratory value that could, in
             the judgment of the investigator, preclude evaluation of response to duloxetine.
