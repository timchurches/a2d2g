  <interventions>
    <interventions>Point of care troponin testing will be made available on some weeks.On other weeks the point of care troponin machine will be unavailable.The availability of the machine represents the intervention and the weeks that it is available will determined by computer generated randomization prior to the study and then concealed until the monday morning at the beginning of each week.At that time after opening that weeks allocation the machine will either be made available for use( which may save time for patients or not) or withdrawn for one week. If the machine is withdrawn for that week the clinical staff will be forced to use usual (laboratory bench-top methods) of testing troponin.The expected duration of the trial is 3 months assuming adequate numbers to power the study (150 in each arm)are recruited.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control will be non availability of point of care, ie use usual in-lab methods. In lab methods means measuring the troponin level with a beckman coulter troponin assay system in the hospital laboratory</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary analysis will be intention to treat, however it is intended to perform a secondary efficacy analysis which may demonstrate that the machines save time if not always actually used. This is because there will not be mandatory use of the intervention and staff may choose not to use it.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomized comparison of two types of troponin testing for ED patients.Currently ED patients with possible coronary syndromes wait significant times to be "cleared " or declared low enough risk for stress testing or discharge. One component of this wait is the time for troponin results to become available which may be reduced by using bedside or point of care(POC) tests.This could  result in acute ED bed space being more efficiently utilized.Many other factors however may affect the speed of patient flow and a controlled trial will help to quantify this.</summary>
