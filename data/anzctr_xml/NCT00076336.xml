  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Clinical Response - Clinical response defined as achieving all of the following 3 criteria on at least 2 consecutive visits or at the last on-treatment visit: Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA &lt; 4 log10 copies/mL, normal Alanine transaminase (ALT) level (ALT = Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)), and improvement (a 2- point or greater reduction in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score) or stabilization (not more than a 1-point change in CTP score), compared to the baseline value. CTP scores range from 5-15, higher scores indicate more liver impairment. For Improvement/Stabilization, either of the individual criteria were met.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Baseline to Week 52</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Initial Clinical Response - Time to Clinical Response defined as the number of days elapsed from the baseline visit to achieving initial Clinical Response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Baseline to Week 104</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Initial Clinical Response - Kaplan-Meier method was used. The duration was calculated as: date of last visit before initial loss of clinical response - date of initial clinical response occurred+1. If a patient did not lose clinical response, it was then censored at the efficacy overall censoring date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 104</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Improvement, Stabilization, and Worsening in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Score at Week 52 and Week 104 - Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) uses 2 clinical variables, ascites and encephalopathy, and 3 laboratory parameters, serum bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time. Each variable is assigned a score from 1 to 3, with the combined score comprising the CTP score range of 5 to 15 points. Higher scores indicate more impaired liver function. "Worsening" of CTP score was defined as a 2-point or greater increase from baseline, "improvement" in CTP score was defined as a 2-point or greater reduction from baseline, and "stabilization" of CTP score was defined as a change of 1-point or less from baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Baseline to weeks 52 and 104</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Improvement, Stabilization, and Worsening in a Modified (3-component) CTP Score - Modified CTP was calculated using the 3 biochemical-components (serum bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin). Total scores range from 3-9; higher scores indicate more liver impairment. Improvement was defined as 2-point or greater reduction in score from baseline. Stabilization comprises a score change of 1-point or less from baseline. Worsening of CTP score was defined as a 2-point or greater increase from baseline. The rationale for assessing changes in this modified (3-component) CTP score is that this maneuver removed the two subjective components of CTP scoring (ascites and encephalopathy).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study was conducted to compare the safety and effectiveness of the
      investigational medication, LdT (Telbivudine) versus Lamivudine, a drug currently approved by
      the US, European and Asian Health Authorities for the treatment of Hepatitis B infection. The
      results for patients taking LdT will be compared to results for patients taking lamivudine.</summary>
