  <interventions>
    <interventions>(i) Urethral muscle training - comprehensive individualized program focused on training the striated muscles that pressurize the urethra. Exercise relies on the principles of motor skill training with trans-perineal ultrasound imaging for assessment (during voluntary contraction, coughing and a 60-s maximal contraction) and biofeedback. Training is based on assessment outcomes and commences with skill acquisition (training of optimal muscle recruitment patterns to increase urethral pressure). A key focus is the striated urethral sphincter, but with tailoring to include the other muscles, based on the assessment. Treatment is progressed using principles of exercise physiology according to a decision tool developed with the Clinical Advisory Committee. Based on the assessed needs and deficits of the patient, progression includes; training of sustained holding to enhance adaptation of striated muscles to provide ongoing maintenance of continence, training of ballistic efforts for episodes of increased bladder pressure (lifting, coughing, etc), skill development for functional training into broad range of activities including training with increasing bladder volumes, and high performance training for demanding tasks including strength training. Daily home exercise to practice tasks taught in each session is encouraged and monitored.  

Participants in Urethral training and Conventional training (described below) groups will attend up to 10 sessions of face-to-face pelvic floor muscle training supervised by a physiotherapist. The number of sessions will be determined by the need for further training at the discretion of the treating physiotherapist or when the participant meets the criteria for continence on the home 24 hour pad test. Each session will last approximately 30 minutes. Participants will attend a session 1-2 weeks prior to surgery. Participants will commence training before surgery. They will attend up to 9 sessions post-surgery, 1 week apart, commencing on catheter removal (~2 weeks post-surgery). Adherence to treatment (home-based exercises) in both groups will be recorded using a daily diary which will be inspected by the physiotherapist at each face-to-face treatment session. Participants in both training groups will be instructed to perform their home-based exercise program up to 3 times per day initially, but more frequently when exercise becomes more functional. For participants in the Urethral muscle training group, home exercises will involve practice of the tasks provided by their physiotherapist at the previous visit based on individualized assessment. For participants in the Conventional training program, participants will perform brief 6-s maximal voluntary contractions and the number of repetitions will be determined/progressed by the physiotherapist at each visit. Adherence to exercise will be encouraged and monitored using a smart phone application. </interventions>
    <comparator>(ii) Conventional training program - training focused on muscles around the anus. This program is commonly offered in physiotherapy clinics and hospitals and will follows principles used in most previous clinical trials. Training commences with assessment of muscle activation which may include digital rectal examination or anal surface electromyography (EMG). Participants perform brief 6-s maximal voluntary contractions for up to 60 repetitions per day. Daily home exercise is encouraged and monitored using a smart phone application. Training progresses by repetitions.

(iii) No training control group - Participants will be provided with an information sheet that includes description of pelvic floor muscle anatomy and brief instruction on how to perform pelvic floor muscle exercise (as is currently standard in many hospital settings). Participants will be requested to refrain from seeking additional treatment until the primary end point at 3 months. Any treatment sought by participants will be recorded. Participants in this group will not perform home exercises</comparator>

    <concealment>Randomisation will be in permuted blocks, stratified by surgeon and baseline neuro-muscular control of urethral pressure (patients dichotomised as good [or poor] by ability to achieve both greater than or equal to 4.1 mm of striated urethral sphincter displacement and greater than or equal to 3 mm of puborectalis displacement). Different physiotherapists will provide the two training programs. Group allocation will be determined using an automatic independent phone-based randomisation service to ensure concealed allocation. Assessors and statisticians will be blinded to group allocation. It will not be possible to blind the participant or treating therapist to the treatment, but patients will be blinded to the hypotheses.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary outcome is the proportion of participants continent at 3 months. This was selected as, qualitative research highlights that rapid/complete recovery of continence is a priority for men, and it was considered unethical to withhold treatment from men allocated to No training for more than 3 months if they continue to experience incontinence. This study is powered to determine whether the Urethral training is more efficacious than Conventional and No training, and whether this effect is moderated by baseline neuromuscular (NM )control of urethral pressure. Data from seven RCTs indicate ~60% of men receiving Conventional training will be incontinent at 3 months. Our data of healthy men suggest ~50% have good NM control at baseline. We make the assumption that among those with good NM control at baseline, incontinence outcomes at 3 months will be similar regardless of their treatment assignment. Using the estimate of reduction of incontinence by a third to 40% of men at 3 months (based on the difference identified in previous study, which included some features we consider critical in the proposed program), with 80% power and two-sided significance level of 0.05 we need 97 men per group. With this number of participants we have 88% power to detect a significant interaction between baseline NM control and treatment arm if we assume that 30% men with good NM control at baseline will be incontinent at 3 months regardless of treatment, but that, of the men with poor NM control at baseline, 90% and 50% will be continent with urethral or conventional training, respectively. We will recruit 121 men per arm (adjusting for a potential drop-out rate of 20%).
Statistical analysis: A biostatistician will analyse blinded data, with all patients enrolled and randomised to treatment/no treatment arms comprising the data set for analysis. Baseline characteristics of groups will be tabulated using summary statistics. Multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data, with missing data imputed using logistic regression models for binary outcomes and predictive mean matching for continuous outcomes. 
Primary analysis: For the continence outcome, a hierarchical logistic regression model including random effects to account for multiple measurements per participant, and random effects for physiotherapist, will be fit. This model will include a three-way interaction term between time, randomised treatment group, and baseline NM control, and all two-way interactions and main effects, as well as the stratifying variable of site. For the primary hypothesis, this model will be interrogated to yield differences in the proportions of participants recovering continence at 3 months between the groups and 95% confidence intervals. The model will be similarly interrogated to determine whether the effect of urethral training relative to conventional training is moderated by NM control of urethral pressure at baseline. Post-operative NM control measures will be considered in a secondary analysis.
Secondary analyses: The continuous measure of continence (24-hour pad test weight) and other continuous outcomes (ICS-male short, SF12) will be compared between groups by fitting a similar random effects linear regression model. Time to recovery of continence will be compared between groups using a Cox proportional hazards model using weekly 24-hr pad test. Model assumptions (linearity, normality and homoscedasticity of residuals for the linear regression models) and the Cox proportional hazards assumption will be assessed using standard diagnostic plots. A secondary analysis will be undertaken to explore the relationship between baseline NM control and the outcome, including the baseline NM control measure as a continuous variable, flexibly modelled using fractional polynomials, in the logistic regression models described above. 
Mediation analysis: To determine the extent to which the effect of urethral training program on the primary outcome and on the continuous measurement of continence is mediated through an improvement in NM control, as hypothesised, we will apply a causal mediation analysis. Mediation analyses will be conducted for the NM control measure recorded at week 6 and month 3, with all analyses adjusted for baseline levels of NM control and other potential confounders of the outcome-mediator relationship. The analysis will be conducted in two stages: at the first stage, the effect of randomisation to the study arms on NM control measures will be assessed. Those measures that differ between groups will then be carried forward to the second stage of the analysis. In this second stage, models will be fit to estimate the direct effect of randomised group on outcome and the indirect effect of randomised group on the outcome that acts through the putative mediator.
If significant mediation is found, logistic regression will be undertaken using the 3 month data of the NM control variables to determine which variables are best linked with continence. A factor analysis across all participants will be applied to extract common NM control features from the NM control variables. NM control features are then used as predictor variables in the logistic regression analysis to assess the relative contribution of each to the odds of regaining continence. This analysis would enable generation of an equation that predicts the probability of continence given the level of the measured NM control features, and therefore the amount of change that is required in individual features of NM control to achieve continence. This equation would have high clinical utility for targeting/prioritisation of treatment. 
Cost effectiveness analysis: Costs of services and devices will be estimated using market prices. We will undertake two analyses at 3 and 12 months. First we will compare cost effectiveness between trial arms. Second we will address the question of whether treatment is more cost effective if only offered to men with poor NM control at baseline. For this analysis we will test the interaction between treatment arm and baseline NM control. This will test the hypothesis that continence-related costs will be similar for men with good NM control, regardless of treatment allocation, but costs will be significantly less for men with poor baseline NM control allocated to Urethral training. Quality-adjusted life-years saved (QALYs) will be computed using the EQ-5D-5L data collected from the trial. Cost-effectiveness ratios will be computed and n-way sensitivity analyses will be conducted to produce cost effectiveness acceptability curves for relevant sets of assumptions about costs and outcomes.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy of a personalised pelvic floor muscle training program on urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.

Who is it for?
Individuals may be eligible to join this study if you aged 30 years or above and are scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy (open or robotic) for prostate cancer. 

Study details
Study participants will be allocated by chance to one of the three groups, Urethral muscle training, Conventional training or No training. Urethral muscle training will involve an individualised program of pelvic floor muscle training that relies on the principles of motor skill training of the striated muscles that control urethral pressure with ultrasound imaging used for assessment and biofeedback. Participants in both treatment groups will attend up to 10 sessions of pelvic floor muscle training supervised by a physiotherapist, and participants in the No treatment group will not receive treatment. Participants in the treatment groups will attend a session 1-2 weeks prior to surgery and will commence training before surgery. They will attend up to 9 sessions post-surgery, 1 week apart, commencing on catheter removal (~2 weeks post-surgery).

This study will provide new insight into whether individualised pelvic floor muscle training is more effective than current treatments or no treatment for management of post-prostatectomy incontinence.  </summary>
