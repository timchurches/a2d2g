  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive a maximal of 3 months of weekly individual multimodal physiotherapy of 1 hour session composing of neck strengthening exercise, passive stretching and education.</interventions>
    <comparator>Prior to self stretching exercise, the participants in the control group will be invited to attend a 1-hour education class. The education content covers neck strengthening and stretching exercises, functional care and daily coping skills. After that, they will have weekly 'physiotherapy' in which they are asked about their progress, functional concerns and will complete the self stretching exercise for 20-30 minutes under supervsision over the 3 month period. The subjects will be encouraged to perform stretching exercise at home as well.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be recruited once weekly from an Oncology Follow-up Clinic of the Prince of Wales Hospital. They will be first screened by an oncologist for eligibility for the study. A research assistant then invites all eligible patients to participate in the study during their waiting time at their regular oncology follow-up session. Eligible patients will be provided with an information sheet by the research assistant explaining the study details and informing them of the potential side effects of the 'intervention'. Consenting patients will be further screened by the research assistant for the nature and the extent of their musculoskeletal complications, and their time availability for the study. Concealed allocation will be done by central randomization using computer to assign patients to treatment groupings.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomly allocated into a multimodal physiotherapy treatment or a self management exercise group by using computer generated pseudo-random numbers to assign patients to these two groupings. The principal investigator will inform the participants about their 'treatment' allocation.  Cervical radiography will be prescribed to each consenting patient in the multimodal treatment group to check for signs of cervical instability or other contraindications to physiotherapy before the 'intervention' will be provided. Orthopaedic consultation will be provided by an orthopaedic specialist as necessary.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is the first trial investigating the effect of physiotherapy on neck muscle fibrosis for post irradiated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, NPC. Exercise and education are commonly received by patients as a means of self empowerment. These treatments will be compared. Patients with NPC are studied because they are usually young and are the breadwiner of the family in a Chinese society. The study also bears significant meaning because musculoskeletal complications post radiotherapy are commonly neglected globally.</summary>
