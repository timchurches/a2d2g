  <interventions>
    <interventions>Decision aids developed for parents to communicate the benefit and harm of antibiotics for treatment of acute otitis media, sore throat and acute bronchitis (cough). 

The single A4 double-sided decision aids (one for each condition) was developed in accord with International Patients Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) international quality criteria; and informed by: 
a) a nationwide survey exploring parents expectations of antibiotic benefits and harms for childhood ARIs (needs assessment); 
b) relevant Cochrane systematic review evidence for quantification of antibiotic benefit and risk (clinical evidence); 
c) Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group assessment (quality of the evidence), and; 
d) Risk communication research (for numerical, graphical and narrative presentation of data). 

The instruments are designed to be read in approximately 5 minutes, and no further information or advice is required to aid comprehension. The decision aids have initially been developed in English only, and the Flesch-Kincaid readability score used to ensure content is suitable for readers at around the eighth grade level.</interventions>

    <sequence>Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 parallel groups to receive one of two formats – a decision aid (intervention) or a ‘fact sheet’ (control). Each participant will be randomly allocated written information for one of the three conditions (acute otitis media, acute bronchitis (cough) or sore throat). The randomisation sequence will be computer generated by a CREBP staff member who is independent of the project team. An independent CREBP staff member will place and seal the allocated written format for one condition and corresponding questionnaire into sequentially numbered opaque A4 envelopes. Group allocation will be concealed to participants and interviewers until voluntary consent has been obtained.   </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute respiratory infections in children are one of the most common reasons for consulting in primary care. An antibiotic is prescribed in the majority of cases, despite high quality evidence that antibiotics provide marginal benefit for many common acute respiratory infections, which may be outweighed by exposure to common harms (such as diarrhoea, vomiting and rash) and development of antibiotic resistance - now a global public health crisis. 

Shared decision making - which aims to elicit patients expectations, clarify misperceptions, and discuss the best available evidence for treatment benefits and harms - may enable clinicians and parents to choose appropriate treatment or management options, including the decision to not use an antibiotic. Decision aids are a tool that have been shown to improve communication between patients and their doctor, and their active participation in decision making. 

Therefore, the aim of the current study is to develop and evaluate (pilot) decision aids about antibiotic use for common acute respiratory infections (middle ear infection, sore throat and acute cough).</summary>
