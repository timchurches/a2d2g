    <concealment>During routine presentation of clients to Withdrawal Unit Joslin (WSJ) successive clients will be recruited to this study.  All clients admitted to WSJ for alcohol withdrawal who for fill the Selection Criteria   will be informed of the study.  At arrival for assessment they will be provided with information on the study by a nurse or medical officer.  Subjects will be informed that their participation status in the study will have no impact on their admission status or treatment, other than that as a potential result of the trial medication.  Subjects will then be asked to consent to participate in the study and sign a consent form to confirm this. The person who determines if a subject is eligible for inclusion in the trial will be unaware, when this decision is made, to which group the subject would be allocated. This will be concealed as the medication will be dispenced from a numbered container. Each container will be randomly allocated medication or placebo at an off site pharmacy</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study seeks to compare the prevalence of cognitive impairment in a population of alcohol dependent patients randomly allocated to have either Acamprosate or a Placebo during inpatient alcohol withdrawal.  Acamprosate is thought to stabilise Glutamate mediated NMDA receptors and reduce hyper excitatory neurotoxicity in the neurons on which they occur.  These neurons are thought to play an important part in neuroplasticity and working memory.  Sensitive computerised psychological testing which has been shown to detect neurocognitive impairment in patients during medicated alcohol withdrawal will be used to compare the response in the test and placebo groups. A standard measure of ataxia will also be used to compare the two groups.</summary>
