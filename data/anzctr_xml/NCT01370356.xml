  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Carbon Monoxide (CO) Confirmed 10-Week Continuous Abstinence (CA) From Smoking - Percentage of participants who remained abstinent from Week 15 to Week 24, inclusive, reporting no smoking and no use of nicotine-containing products since the last study visit or contact on the Nicotine Use Inventory (NUI) and confirmed by expired CO &lt; 10 ppm at any time point (CO measurements conducted at the clinic visits) during Weeks 15 through 24, inclusive. Missing CO was imputed as negative (CO = 10 ppm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 15 - 24</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With CO Confirmed 4-Week CA From Smoking - Percentage of participants who remained abstinent from Week 21 to Week 24, inclusive, reporting no smoking and no use of nicotine-containing products since the last study visit or contact on the NUI and confirmed by expired CO &lt; 10 ppm at any time point (CO measurements conducted at the clinic visits) during Weeks 21 through 24, inclusive. Missing CO was imputed as negative (CO = 10 ppm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 21 - 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With CO Confirmed Long Term CA From Smoking - Percentage of participants who remained abstinent from Week 21 to Week 52, inclusive, reporting no smoking and no use of nicotine-containing products since the last study visit or contact on the NUI and confirmed by expired CO &lt; 10 ppm at any time point (CO measurements conducted at the clinic visits) during Weeks 21 through 52, inclusive. Missing CO was imputed as negative (CO = 10 ppm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 21 - 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With 7-Day Point Prevalence of Smoking Cessation - The 7-day point prevalence of abstinence was defined as being abstinent from smoking and using tobacco products during the last 7 days at Week 12, 24, and 52. The participant`s smoking status and other nicotine use was evaluated based on the "last 7 days" questions on the NUI and confirmed by CO expiration. Responders were defined as those, who answered "no" to both questions ("Has the subject smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 7 days?"; and "Has the subject used any nicotine products and/or other tobacco.... in the last 7 days?") and whose expired CO &lt; 10 ppm. Missing CO was imputed as negative (CO = 10 ppm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 12, 24, and 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With 4-Week Point Prevalence of Smoking Cessation - The 4-week point prevalence of abstinence was defined as being abstinent from smoking and using tobacco products during the last 4 weeks of the study. The participant`s smoking status and other nicotine use was evaluated based on the "last 4 weeks" questions on the NUI and confirmed by CO expiration. Responders were defined as those, who answered "no" to both questions ("Has the subject smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 4 weeks?"; and "Has the subject used any nicotine products and/or other tobacco.... in the last 4 weeks?") and whose expired CO &lt; 10 ppm. Missing CO was imputed as negative (CO = 10 ppm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 52</timepoint>
