  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undertake an 8-week modified very-low-energy diet (VLED), in which 2 meals per day will be replaced with a commercially available very-low-energy diet formulation (Optifast VLCD milkshake or bar), along with a third meal consisting of lean protein and up to 2 cups of low-starch vegetables.  At least 30 minutes per day of moderate intensity physical activity will be advised for all participants.
After a 2-week transition period in which participants will consume 1 meal replacement and 2 meals, participants will cease the meal replacements and be instructed to follow a weight maintenance diet individualised for their energy requirements for weight maintenance for one year.
Participants will be seen by a study physician or dietician every 2 weeks during the VLED phase, and every two months during the weight maintenance phase. At these visits, participants' weight, hip and waist circumferences will be measured, and dietary and exercise goals/advice will be reinforced. Beyond this, no specific strategies or tools will be used to improve or monitor adherence to the intervention protocols, in order to replicate a clinical setting as far as possible.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>This is a non-randomised, single arm dietary intervention trial in which participants will undertake an 8-week VLED-based weight loss diet followed by 12 months on a weight-maintenance diet.  
At the end of the study, participants will fall into one of 3 categories: those who lost at least 10% of their initial weight during the VLED and maintained their weight loss (maintaining at least 70% of initial weight loss at week 60), those who lost at least 10% of their initial weight during the VLED but regained the lost weight (regained &gt;30% of initial weight lost), and those who did not lose 10% of their initial weight, or who did not complete the study.  
Using the participants baseline anthropometric, biochemical and psychosocial questionnaire data, we will examine the ability of a statistical (linear discriminant analysis) model to predict the weight outcome 12 months after initial weight loss.  </designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Amongst people undertaking any weight loss program, there is considerable variation in the amount of weight lost.  Many studies have attempted to predict the outcome of weight loss treatments from information about biological, behavioural and psychological factors collected from participants before the start of treatment, but it has been difficult to predict outcomes using current methods.  In a previous study conducted in our research group, we examined a statistical method which appeared to be useful in predicting the outcome of a medically supervised very-low-energy diet program using participants baseline physical measurements and psychological characteristics.  However, further research is required in order to create a tool which will be useful to patients and healthcare providers.  The overall aim of this study is to create a statistical model which can accurately predict the result for a person about to start a weight loss program.  </summary>
