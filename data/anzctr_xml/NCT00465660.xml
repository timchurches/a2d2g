  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Female subjects over the age of 40 will be recruited and randomised into a progressive
      resistance training (PRT) or sham-exercise group. The PRT group will train at 80% of their
      peak strength, using Keiser pneumatic resistance machines, and progress approximately 3% per
      session. Strength will be re-assessed fortnightly. Exercises will target muscles around the
      hip and knee. The sham-exercise group will train on the same equipment as the PRT group
      except hip adduction, but without added resistance or progression. Both groups will train 3
      days per week for roughly 45 minutes for 6 months.

      It is hypothesised that high intensity PRT will decelerate the tibial and femoral cartilage
      degeneration in the knee affected most by OA.

      Primary Outcome:

      Articular cartilage morphology following 6 months high intensity progressive resistance
      training

      Secondary Outcomes:

      Muscle and fat cross-sectional area (CSA) (pre and post) Muscle strength, power, endurance,
      and contraction velocity (pre, 3 months, &amp; post) Medications (pre, 3 months, &amp; post) Body
      composition (pre, 3 months, &amp; post) Balance; Physical function (pre, 3 months, &amp; post)
      Questionnaires (pre, 3 months, &amp; post)

        -  Habitual exercise (PASE) -WOMAC index (pain, stiffness and functional ability)

        -  Depressive symptoms (Depression Scale) -Quality of life (SF36)

        -  Confidence performing physical activity (Ewart) -Demographics</summary>
