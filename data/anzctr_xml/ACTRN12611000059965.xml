  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 3 month trial consists of 2 intervention groups 1 A printed brochure providing information about a free healthy eating, physical activity or weight loss telephone coaching service mailed to participants once. 2. A electronic brochure providing information about a free healthy eating, physical activity or weight loss telephone coaching service e-mailed to participants once. It is not compulsory for participants in each group to read or attend to information provided in each format (mail, or email)or to contact the coaching service. The use of materials and the telephone coaching service will be at the discretion of participants</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study seeks to test the efficacy of a variety of strategies to encourage the use of a telephone coaching service to encourage healthy eating, physical activity and weight loss among adults in the community. It is hypothesized that telephone, emailed and mailed information about the service will be more effective then no information about the service. The use of the telephone service as well as any changes in physical activity, healthy eating or weight status will be assessed by telephone interview 3 months following baseline data collection.</summary>
