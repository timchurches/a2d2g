    <interventions>Video-game intervention group

Participants in the video-game exercise group will participate in an 8 week home-based unsupervised exercise program using Nintendo Wii console technology and the Wii Fit Plus software. The video-game exercise protocol consists of a range of exercises that will be pre-selected from the Wii Fit Plus software by a research physiotherapist. Exercises will be included under the following categories: warm up, functional muscle strengthening, aerobic, and balance. Each participant will be able to self-select exercises within each category based on their preference for certain exercises and recommendations by the physiotherapist, thus allowing participants to tailor their exercise program. Exercise sessions will be tailored to last 60 minutes (10 minutes warm up, 20 minutes  functional muscle strengthening, 15 minutes aerobic exercises and 15 minutes balance exercises) and are to be completed 3 times per week, with at least one day of rest between exercise sessions. Participants will be asked to maintain exercise intensity at 12-13 (somewhat hard ) on the Borg rating scale of perceived exertion (RPE) during the functional muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise components. The research physiotherapist will schedule fortnightly phone calls with the participant to monitor for any adverse events , and to encourage the participant to engage in more difficult exercises if appropriate. The participant will also be given an information booklet containing information on how to safely progress their exercises. In addition, if the participant is using the Wii Fit Plus software often enough and improving their scores on certain games, the software will give the participant the option of progressing their exercises through an increase in the amount of repetitions, duration or speed of a task. Participants will be provided with a choice of weekly reminders to complete exercise sessions and to fill in their exercise diary, via emails or telephone calls. The exercise diary will be used to monitor adherence.

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of sixty participants will provide a 95% chance of detecting differences between groups of 9 points on the 60-point measure of pain self-efficacy (PSEQ). These calculations assumed a worst-case loss to follow-up of 20 %. A 9 point change on the PSEQ represents the minimal clinically important difference. Sample size estimation was performed on GPower Software Version 3.1. For a pre and post-intervention standard deviation of 14.6 and 11.9 respectively, using a two group, one-tailed t-test (p=0.05) and having 80% power we required twenty eight participants in each group . 
Estimates of treatment efficacy (means and 95%CI) will be calculated separately for each outcome using linear mixed models with time as a repeated factor, group as a fixed factor and participants as a random factor. Each analysis will be adjusted for baseline outcomes. The coefficient of the group x time interactions will provide estimates of the effects of interventions over time. Between-group differences in self-efficacy and care seeking , at 3 and 6 months, will be analysed with ordinal regression. We will dichotomise these outcomes for ease of interpretation . All analyses will be performed by intention-to-treat and blinded to treatment group. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate how well people with low back pain can manage their symptoms following a video-game exercise program. We are specifically interested in people who are currently awaiting treatment for their back at the Physiotherapy Department of Westmead Hospital. 

Low back pain is the leading cause of disability in Australia and is more disabling in older people. Exercise programs are frequently used to treat low back pain and are known to offer moderate improvements for pain and function. However, usually exercise programs require supervision and the need for patients to travel to treatment sites, which can be problematic for older people with disability. Additionally, limited availability of health resources and an increasing number of people with chronic diseases means patients are often on long waiting lists for treatment. Video-game exercises for low back pain could be particularly useful in older people because they can be implemented at home and therefore reduce the need to travel to treatment sites. This has the potential to reduce the number of people waiting for treatment in public hospitals and reduce management costs of chronic low back pain. Video-game exercises are starting to be used to treat a variety of conditions and have been shown to increase motivation for completing a home-based exercise program. Therefore, this study will determine whether video-game exercises done in the home are effective in the management of low back pain.
