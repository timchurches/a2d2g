  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness and safety of treatment with the herb ginkgo biloba in preventing or reducing changes in thinking, memory and concentration (cognitive function) experienced by some women during and after treatment with chemotherapy for early breast cancer

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have diagnosed with early invasive breast cancer and you have had or will have surgery for this, and you also plan have chemotherapy as part of your anti-cancer treatment.

What does it involve?
Participants will be divided into two groups.
One group will receive treatment with standardized extracts of the herb ginkgo biloba.
The other group will receive a non-active compound (placebo).
Both groups will take two tablets (240mg) of study treatment each day for a period of 12 months.  Treatment will start about the same time as participants start their chemotherapy treatment.

All participants will have their cognitive function monitored, along with fatigue, quality of life, blood tests, other possible symptoms, both before treatment and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after randomization.  Each assessment will take approximately 90 minutes.

Most women who receive chemotherapy become tired; some complain of memory &amp; concentration problems. Studies have found subtle cognitive impairment  ("chemobrain") that can disturb the return to a normal life and there are no known treatments. Ginkgo biloba has been shown to improve cognition in healthy younger volunteers &amp; improve cognition &amp; mood, without side effects, in elderly people.</summary>
