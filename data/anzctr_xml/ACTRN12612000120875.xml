  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>DAILIES TOTAL1 RegisteredTradeMark by CIBA VISION is one of the new silicone hydrogel daily disposable lenses recently released into the contact lens market. This study intends to provide more information on the clinical performance of DAILIES TOTAL1 RegisteredTradeMark in terms of ocular health, vision and subjective comfort. It will allow for comparisons to previous and future contact lens related studies in the hope that it can contribute to further understanding on what causes cotnact lens related discomfort and dryness. The hypothesis of this study is that the ocular responses and subjective comfort ratings will be dissimilar in participants wearing DAILIES TOTAL1 RegisteredTradeMark and other lens types.</summary>
