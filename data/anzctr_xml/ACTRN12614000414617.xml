    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Primary:
100% of the subjects are expected to tolerate the NC at 6 lpm, it for the duration of the study. 

It is hypothesized that no less than 90% of the participants will be able to tolerate the high-flow non-humidified oxygen for five and ten minutes. 

This gives us a non-inferior margin of 10% to be considered as a clinical relevant difference for comparison between the high-flow vs. the ordinal 6 lpm

Base on simulations, 100 samples will result in a precision level for the targeted non-inferior margin of 10%, given a 100% tolerance to completion rate for the high-flow group. 

Secondary:

Considering a non-inferior margin of 17 mm and using the previously reported minimally clinically significant differences in VAS of greater than or equal to 17 mm we expect that 95% of participants will have a difference of less than 17mm between two repeated measures of patients.

Literature has reported that a 17mm change in VAS rating for pain is a clinically significant difference in pain.  We believe that a change of greater than or equal to 17mm is also a clinically significant difference in discomfort.

Our power calculation assumes a maximal standard deviation of the measured difference between VAS is 20mm. Our sample size simulations show that a sample size of 50 subjects will allow us to measure a non-inferior VAS interval of 3.8mm-10.3mm and a 4%-12% for difference in the tolerability outcome.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: To determine the tolerability and level of discomfort from higher flow, non-humidified oxygen through a normal nasal cannula (NC) in healthy volunteers.
Background
Although high-flow non-humidified nasal oxygen at rates of up to 15 lpm is now recommended as a method to provide apneic oxygenation during intubation, many older sources suggest that flow-rates greater than 6 lpm can cause patient discomfort. ,  ,   To our knowledge, there is no evidence on the ability of subjects to tolerate high-flow NC and this trial will be the first research that evaluates the ability of subjects tolerate high-flow nasal oxygen through a normal NC.

Methods:
This prospective, double blinded, interventional, non-inferiority crossover study will be conducted in the Emergency Department (ED), Middlemore Hospital from December 2013 to June 2014.

Subjects will be randomized and blinded to first receive either low-flow (6 lpm), or high-flow (15 lpm) of oxygen through NC for a maximum of 10-minutes (completion) or until the subject deems it intolerable. After at least a 1-hour washout period, subjects will then trial the alternative flow-rate. 

Populations
The potential subjects include staff members working in Middlemore Hospital. No patients will be enrolled.

The exclusion criteria will be previous participation in study, recent history of nasal trauma, or history of significant respiratory disease.

Results
The primary outcome will be the subjects ability to tolerate each flow-rate at ten minutes. We believe 100% of subjects will tolerate 10-mintues of the low-flow NC and that no less than 90% will tolerate 10-minutes of high-flow NC.

Other outcomes will be the difference in duration that the subject tolerates the NC as measured in seconds before the subject removes the NC. We hypothesize there will be less than one minute of difference between the flow-rates.

Another outcome will be the subjects discomfort as reported on a 100mm visual analog scale at each flow rate. A difference of 17mm will be considered clinically significant.  We believe there will be a clinically significant difference of greater than 17mm between the two flow-rates.
 
Other recorded outcomes will include the vital signs, symptoms of discomfort, and a description of a brief nasal exam on subjects reporting significant symptoms. We believe that there will be minimal differences in these other variables.

Conclusions
We predict that most subjects will be able to tolerate 10-minutes of high-flow nasal oxygen without meaningful discomfort.
