    <concealment>Primary clinicians will alert the research team of patients with suspected crohn’s disease either when first seen in the outpatient clinic or when attending the hospital for endoscopy. The research team will discuss the study with the patient and family at that time and provide study information sheets. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and after at least 72 hours has lapsed from the time the study was discussed with the patient/family, the research team will approach the patient/family of their willingness to participate in the study. 
Randomization will be performed by members of the Clinical Epidemology and Biostatistics Unit (CEBU),Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne and are not involved in the study directly. Members of CEBU will also not be involved in recruiting patients to the study. Allocation concealment is performed using a web based computer generated randomization list.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computerised sequence generation will be used for randomization. Stratification will be performed for disease severity based on PCDAI (Severe: PCDAI &gt; 40; moderate PCDAI equals or less than 40).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Crohns disease is a lifelong condition with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, lethargy, vomiting due to an underlying inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. This is thought to be mediated via elevation of compounds called inflammatory cytokines. There are other health effects not localised to the gut like growth problems and poor bone health (osteoporosis) which may be a consequence of the underlying disease process itself or the use of medication to treat the disease. 

Often potent steroid medication like Prednisolone are used to control the disease. Whilst this is an effective form of treatment, steroids can have a range of side effects. Growth failure leading to significant short stature, poor bone health with cases of fractures with little or no injury and fracture in the spine have been reported in these groups of children. These of course lead to significant morbidity in the growing years.

Statins like atorvastatin have been shown to have a potent effect in lowering cholesterol levels and preventing heart disease from large scale adult studies. Statins have also been used to treat paediatric patients with inherited reason for their high cholesterol. There is some suggestion that statins may have an effect directly at the inflammatory process independent of the level of lowering of cholesterol level. It is thought that statins can lower the level of inflammatory cytokines. As inflammatory cytokine levels are elevated in crohns disease and if statins may lower inflammatory cytokine levels, there maybe a role of statins in the treatment of crohns disease in children. There are already animal studies and some adult trials that show that statins may help in crohns disease and other inflammatory disease like arthritis.

In our study, we aim to recruit 60 children with newly diagnosed crohns disease (30 in each group) aged between 8-17 years, randomly assigned to either receive atorvastatin or Prednisolone (which is the usual form of treatment in our centre).The study is for a period of 8 weeks. The study aims to show that atorvastatin is no worse than Prednisolone as a medication for induction of remission in reducing actue inflammation in newly diagnosed children with crohn's disease.

Patients will attend the study follow-up at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks after diagnosis.  At all of those time points, blood tests will be obtained to assess the inflammatory process, growth factors and bone markers. Faeces will be collected to look at the level of inflammation in the gut. At all those time points, the paediatric crohns disease activity index will be obtained and also a quality of life score specific for this population of children. IMPACT-III. At baseline and 8 weeks,  an assessment of the childs state of development (puberty) will also be done. Children will also be asked to self assess their development (puberty) based on validated forms. 

We hypothesis that statin has an effect on the inflammatory process and will be no worse compared with Prednisolone treatment.</summary>
