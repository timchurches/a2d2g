    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)/11 Subscale Total Score at Week 78 - The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension.
This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced.
The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) Total Score at Week 78 - The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant.
This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. Higher scores indicate better function; a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden at Week 71 - Brain amyloid burden as imaged by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET). The latter is a semi-quantitative measure of the extent of fibrillar amyloid in the brain. PIB PET measurements were made in cortical regions found to have the highest burden of fibrillar amyloid at autopsy in participants diagnosed as having Alzheimer's pathology, and also regions reported to have the highest average retention of PIB signal in previous PET studies enrolling participants with probable AD. This parameter reflects overall brain amyloid deposition as indexed by imaging. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by PIB PET imaging in a subset of participants.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Phospho-tau Levels at Week 71 - Biomarkers CSF phospho-tau is an indicator of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. An elevation in levels of tau, as well as specific p-tau species, is thought to be a marker for progressive cellular degeneration in AD. Accordingly, a reduction from baseline in levels of CSF tau in participants who received bapineuzumab compared with participants who received placebo may be indicative of a reduction in neuronal loss in participants treated with bapineuzumab.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Brain Volume, as Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Boundary Shift Integral (MRI BBSI), at Week 71 - Cerebral atrophy correlates closely with the gradual cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized by MRI. The BBSI technique involves positional matching of serial 3-dimensional MRI brain images, such that brain MRI-image volumes were first registered and then subtracted from each other. Atrophy rates would generally be expected to be lower if the underlying disease was attenuated by effective treatment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Divergence of Effect on the ADAS-Cog/11 Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78 - Treatment differences are estimated using least-squares (LS) means with factor levels weighted according to overall analysis population proportions. ADAS-Cog/11 total score range is 0 (least impairment) to 70 (most impairment); a negative treatment difference (bapineuzumab minus placebo) favors bapineuzumab. Within the MMRMs for ADAS-Cog/11 described for the primary analyses, linear contrasts were formed to test increasing trend of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo from Week 39 (the 9-month visit) through Week 78 (the 18 -month visit) for each variable, which is equivalent to testing a positive slope of the differences between each bapineuzumab dose group and placebo from Week 39 through Week 78. Results are from a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model for MMRM.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Dependence Scale Total Score at Week 78 - The Dependence Scale (DS) is a 13-item, caregiver-rated instrument for determining the amount of support required by a participant with AD.

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (EU Analysis Plan) - Percentage of participants with worsening from baseline to Week 78 in ADAS-Cog/11 total score of =0, =3, and =7 points were reported. In order to calculate time to first median placebo deterioration in ADAS-Cog/11, the median change from baseline to Week 78 among the placebo participants of the mITT analysis population were determined. The median changes were used as the cutpoints for determining "deterioration" for Alzheimer's disease participants in the study. If the median change from baseline to Week 78 in the ADAS-Cog/11 total score among the placebo participants of the mITT Analysis Population is 7 points, then the first median placebo deterioration is the first time where there is a worsening on the ADAS-Cog/11 total score of 7 points or more and the worsening is confirmed by the ADAS-Cog/11 assessment at the next non-missing visit.</outcome>

If the median change from baseline to Week 78 in the DAD total score among the placebo participants of the mITT Analysis Population is 7 points, then the first median placebo deterioration is the first time where there is a worsening on the DAD total score of 7 points or more and the worsening is confirmed by the DAD assessment at the next non-missing visit.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 78 - The CDR-SOB is a global clinical staging instrument that sums 6 clinical ratings: 1) memory, 2) orientation, 3) judgment and problem solving, 4) involvement in community affairs, 5) home and hobbies, and 6) personal care based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) interview. The CDR includes discussions with the participant and caregiver using a structured format. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified global rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant. CDR-SOB total score range is 0 (least impairment) to 18 (most impairment); a negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</outcome>
