      <outcome>Wound infection: all surgical sites will be assessed at 5-10 days and 3-4 week time points postoperatively and graded for signs of infection as per the standardized scoring system adopted from Griego et al.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Graft take: all surgical sites closed with a skin graft will be assessed at 5-10 days and 3-4 week time points postoperatively and graded for percentage graft take. A transparent plastic film with a printed grid 1cm x 1cm will be used to estimate the total size of the graft and the percentage of graft take. Photographs will be taken for re-assessment by another observer.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>To account for the testing of two primary hypotheses, we apply a False Discovery Rate correction (equivalent in this case to a Bonferroni correction) to the nominal 5% significance level against two-sided hypotheses under which statistical inference will be effected in the intended full study. We further posit two reasonable values for expected infection rates under the hypothesis of a beneficial treatment effect, namely reductions from a 7% POWI rate to 3.5% and 2% respectively. We determine the expected study sizes required to achieve 80% power under these two scenarios: 2340 and 987 respectively.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Delayed healing and graft failure secondary to infection contribute to morbidity amongst patients undergoing excision of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. Infection delays healing and leads to more prominent scar formation while graft failure also delays healing and may necessitate further surgery or lead to chronic wounds. Such complications have a flow on effect economically as further nursing resources are occupied, dressings are required for longer and in younger patients a return to work may be delayed.  The adjusted infection rate amongst patients undergoing excision of skin lesions through the Plastic, Reconstructing &amp; Hands department at Middlemore Hospital is approximately 7%.
Studies have previously demonstrated that pre-operative infiltration of antibiotic to the incision site simultaneously with local anaesthetic leads to a reduction in post-operative wound infections1, 2. However, these studies have been performed in private Mohs micrographic surgery centres and the process has yet to be applied in a public setting. To our knowledge, the process has not been tested in patients requiring split thickness and full thickness skin grafts following excision of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.
The approaching calamity of antibiotic resistance adds further impetus to the judicious use of antibiotics. Many surgeons routinely prescribe pre-operative antibiotics and/or a course of antibiotics post-operatively in an attempt to reduce morbidity. Not only does this systemic approach contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance but it certainly confers morbidity in terms of antibiotic side effects to some patients. Here we seek to apply the principle of intra-incisional antibiotics in a high volume public care setting to determine whether this more judicious use of antibiotics can reduce post-operative wound infection and graft failure secondary to infection.
