  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open-label, five- period, cross-over, randomized, single dose, single centre study
      in healthy subjects. This is the second clinical study for the UD-DPI. This study will
      ascertain whether the Pharmacokinetics (PK) systemic exposure [in terms of area under the
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)] of FF
      delivered via the UD-DPI is comparable to the systemic exposure of FF delivered via the
      ELLIPTA Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI). For this reason four treatment doses consisting of three
      dose strengths and 2 percentage blends will be assessed when delivered via the UD-DPI. This
      study is designed to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of various doses and blends of FF
      administered via UD-DPI and relative to FF administered via ELLIPTA DPI. Subjects will be
      screened 28 days prior to study initiation. During each treatment period, subjects will be at
      study site from evening prior to dosing until completion of the 48 hour post-dose PK sample
      collection on Day 3. Minimum 7 days washout will be between treatments after completion of
      all five treatments and the follow-up visit will be conducted 7-14 days post last dose.
      Duration of study is 13 weeks. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the GSK group of
      companies.</summary>
