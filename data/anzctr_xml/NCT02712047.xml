  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For asthmatic subjects, a combination of inhaled corticosteroid (FF) and long-acting beta2
      receptor agonist (VI) is recommended for use (once daily) and fraction of exhaled nitric
      oxide (FeNO) is a non-invasive airway inflammation marker.

      In this randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, crossover repeat dose
      study, the duration of action of fluticasone furoate (FF) will be determined by monitoring
      the return of FeNO levels to baseline, following the treatment with FF/vilanetrol (VI) in
      asthmatic subjects.

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will participate in the following two treatment
      periods: FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily and placebo once-daily. Approximately 28 subjects will
      be enrolled in order to achieve 24 evaluable subjects. A 2-week treatment period will be
      followed by a 21-day monitoring/washout period before crossing over to the next treatment
      period. Total duration of each subject will be a maximum of 21 weeks. FeNO will be monitored
      up to 21 days after treatment with FF/VI together with FEV1 (up to 7 days).</summary>
