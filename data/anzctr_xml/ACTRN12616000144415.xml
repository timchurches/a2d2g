  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant attended three 4-day periods of in-house dietary manipulation. Participants were given ad libitum access to diets containing 10%, 15% and 25% protein over the three 4day periods. Carbohydrate was adjusted to be 60, 55 and 45% energy and dietary fat was kept constant at 30%. Food intake was measured by recording the weight of the food before and after serving, to the nearest gram. Energy intake was calculated using the nutritional information for each recipe. The trial was a randomised crossover-trial, each participant completed each of the three 4-day interventions with at least a one week washout period between interventions.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake (MJ): Participants were given ad libitum access to study food with no access to other foods during each intervention period. Participants were offered 3 main meals at a designated time each day and had free access to additional study snack foods. Participants were asked to leave any uneaten snack foods and/or empty packages in a designated fridge. Food intake was measured by recording the weight of the food before and after serving to the nearest gram. Total energy intake was then calculated using the nutritional information for each recipe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weight of food was measured immediately before and after each main meal for each 4-day treatment period. Snack food was weight at the beginning of each day and was monitored and weighed by the study coordinator every 2 hours from 7.30am until 7.30pm.  Any leftover or empty packages from snacks consumed overnight (7.30pm-7.30am) were weighed at 7.30am the next day. </timepoint>

    <concealment>Each subject was screened to determine eligibility for the study. At this point the trial coordinator was unaware of the sequence of interventions the subject would be allocated.  Once it was determined that the participant was eligible to be included in the trial the trial coordinator would allocate the participant to a group of subjects that were available to complete the trial on the same dates.  When the subjects in each group were finalised the group was then randomly allocated an order of intervention. Allocation of order was concealed by randomly selecting a sequence from an envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>All possible sequences of interventions were printed the same number of times and placed in an envelope prior to the start of the study. The total number of sequences printed exceeded the number of groups that would be required to complete the trial. Once each group was finalised a sequence was randomly selected from the envelope. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The study aimed to recruit 24 lean subjects, comprising equal numbers of men and women. The sample size calculation was based on a previous ad libitum study. From this study it was calculated that in order to detect a difference of 0.5MJ given an SE of 0.41, a sample size of 10 gives 92% power and 9 gives 88% power.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Protein intake has remained relatively stable through the development of the obesity epidemic, yet total energy intake has risen. The protein leverage hypothesis (PLH) proposes that a separate and dominant appetite for protein drives excess energy intake when dietary protein is diluted by fat and carbohydrate. The PLH has been shown in various other species, including non-human primates where excess total energy intake occurs when the percent protein of the diet decreases. Experimental and population-level data also suggest the same may be true in humans (meta-analysis included in the current manuscript). Experimental verification of the protein leverage hypothesis is lacking because it is difficult to separate the role of protein from confounding influences on intake associated with concurrent changes in dietary fat and carbohydrate. The unequivocal test for the PLH is to develop protocols that disguise macronutrient composition of foods offered to subjects under ad libitum feeding conditions. We have recently developed these protocols and in the current study report experiments in which they were applied to confirm the PLH in humans. Here we show that reducing dietary protein by 5% whilst controlling palatability, availability, variety and sensory aspects of the diet resulted in subjects increasing total energy intake by 12%, and this increase was mainly due to increased intake of foods available between meals. We therefore confirm the PLH in humans and show that any change in the nutritional environment that dilutes dietary protein with carbohydrate and fat will promote increased energy intake. Our findings provide a new understanding of a major global health problem, and have considerable implications for the management of obesity.</summary>
