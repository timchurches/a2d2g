  <interventions>
    <interventions>- The duration of the intervention is 3 months. The intervention involves attendance at one 75 minute face-to-face information session covering standard weight control instruction relating to diet, physical activity and behaviour change, focusing on self monitoring, goal setting and social support.
- Self monitoring using online website www.calorieking.com.au, which provides tools and information to help individuals improve their diet and physical activity behaviours, including submission of energy expenditure and intake and online group support.
Participants are provided with individualised feedback sheets weekly for the first month; fortnightly in the second month; and once at the end of the third month. Participants will be instructed to enter daily eating and physical activity diaries each day for the 1st month; for 2 weeks in the 2nd month and for one week in the 3rd month. Participants are encouraged to visit the group forum to elicit social support where questions are answered from the research team and discussions threads are able to be started and answered by participants. There is no mandated use of the group forums (but this will be monitored as part of the process evaluation). Participants will also receive a program handbook.</interventions>
    <comparator>- The comparison group will only be required to attend one 60 minute face-to-face information session covering standard weight control instruction relating to diet, physical activity and behaviour change, focusing on self monitoring, goal setting and social support. They will receive a program handbook but will not receive any additional support after the initial information session.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants undertake a phone eligibility screen and are then sent information letters and consent form. When consents are returned, assessments are booked and then participants are randomised by the research assistant. However, only the research assistant is aware of group allocation. No assessor is aware of group allocation. Participants are handed a sealed opaque envelope when they finish baseline assessment and are instructed to open when they leave. The envelope contains information about group allocation and the time and venue for the information session. That is, participants find out group allocation after they have completed baseline assessment</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two intervention groups using a computer-based random number-producing algorithm. This method ensures an equal chance of allocation to each group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is a major public health issue in Australia with approximately 67% of men and 52% of women overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with a number of life threatening diseases and is an independent risk factor for a range of cardiovascular diseases. Although group programs that involve weekly visits are regarded as the most effective strategy for treating obesity, there is an urgent need for the development of effective weight loss programs that are more widely accessible. The Internet may have considerable potential to deliver weight management programs for individuals who cannot access clinical programs or where frequent face-to-face contact is a substantial barrier. To date, little is known about the efficacy of online weight loss programs. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an Internet-based weight loss program for men that incorporates key behavioural strategies including social support and self monitoring.</summary>
