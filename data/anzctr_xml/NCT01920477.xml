  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare, chronic, debilitating, and potentially life-threatening
      autoimmune disorder that is characterized by mucocutaneous blisters. Ofatumumab is a novel
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds to the human CD20 antigen, which is
      expressed only in B lymphocytes.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of ofatumumab
      injection for subcutaneous use (ofatumumab SC) 20 milligrams (mg) administered once in every
      4 weeks, (with an additional 20 mg loading dose [i.e. 40 mg total] at both Week 0 and Week 4)
      in subjects with PV. It is anticipated that with sustained B-cell depletion in the presence
      of ofatumumab SC, and the resultant reduction of pathogenic anti Dsg (desmoglein)
      autoantibodies in PV, that clinical remission of the disease will result.</summary>
