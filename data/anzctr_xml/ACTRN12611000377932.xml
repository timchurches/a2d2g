  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Intervention condition.  The intervention condition involves participants visiting and posting to an online bulletin board for depression called BlueBoard.  BlueBoard is a free, online supportive bulletin board that has been developed and is provided by researchers at CMHR, ANU.  The board can be accessed 24 hours a day and is monitored by trained moderators between the hours of 7am and 10pm, 7 days a week.  The board is moderated to ensure the appropriateness of posted material and to protect the safety of the members of the board.  Participants allocated to the BlueBoard intervention will nominate a username (not their real name) and password to access the board and will be encouraged to use the board for a period of 6 months.  Participants will receive automatically generated e-mails reminding them to use the board if they have not logged on to the board for 14 days or longer.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: Wait-listed control condition.  In the control condition, participants will be waitlisted to use the online board after a delay of 6 months.</comparator>

    <concealment>Partcipants will be recruited by a variety of means including advertisements and/or press releases on Facebook, on relevant websites, and using flyers to be distributed to and by health and other relevant organisations.  The advertisement will contain brief information about the project and will direct those interested in participating to a website containing further information about the project.

On the project website, potential participants will be provided with information about the project and will be asked to answer some simple screening questions to determine their eligibility for the trial.

If eligible, participants will be directed to an additional webpage containing more detailed information about the project (including issues concerning withdrawal, confidentiality, time involved) and contact information for the researchers and the ANU Human Ethics Research Committee. The information also forms the content of the Participant Information Sheet which is available on all project portal web-pages as a printable pdf. If they agree to continue their enrolment in the trial, on the next web-page the participant must then answer a series of questions as ‘yes’ before they can proceed with their participation.
Ineligible participants will be directed to a webpage containing information about various online services developed by CMHR that might be of interest, including information about BlueBoard.

Eligible participants who provide their consent will be directed to a webpage asking them to enter their e-mail address.  In order to verify their e-mail address, participants will be automatically sent an e-mail containing a unique link that they will be asked to click to verify their e-mail address.  The link directs the participant to a webpage that prompts them to create a username and password which they will use to log in to both the project webportal and BlueBoard.  In order to protect the identity of the participant, the username will require approval by project staff before the participant can proceed.  This step is required to ensure that the username does not contain any identifying information.  Once a username is approved, the participant will be e-mailed a link to the project web portal and asked to log on with their username and password to complete the baseline survey.

Following completion of the baseline survey, participants will be randomised to either the intervention or control condition.  Participants will then be directed to a webpage informing them of their allocated condition and relevant instructions.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be conducted by a researcher (AM) who is not involved in the day to day running of the trial and is physically located in a different institution to where the recruitment of participants is taking place.

Participants will be randomised using automatised compuer software following completion of the baseline survey.  Randomisation is stratified by severity of symptoms.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a randomised controlled trial of an established online bulletin board for depression.  It has been estimated that millions of people worldwide use peer-to-peer bulletin boards, forums or internet support groups (ISGs) for health conditions.  However, little is known about the effectiveness of these groups in terms of symptom reduction or improvement in quality of life.  To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial of the effectiveness of a pre-existing, well-established online bulletin board for depression in the community.

The aims of the project are to determine whether BlueBoard, an established online bulletin board for depression, improves mental health, quality of life, and related outcomes among members of the community with high levels of self-reported psychological distress and previous history or current experience of depression.</summary>
