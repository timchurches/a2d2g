  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with interstitial lung disease (ILD) are frequently prescribed ambulatory oxygen, to
      increase oxygen levels in the blood during daily activities. The best way of delivering this
      type of oxygen has not been established. The aim of this study is to compare two devices for
      delivering oxygen in people with interstitial lung disease - the traditional method using
      portable cylinders and a newer method using a portable concentrator. The investigators
      hypothesise that oxygen levels during exercise will be significantly higher when using a
      portable cylinder, but this difference will be small.</summary>
