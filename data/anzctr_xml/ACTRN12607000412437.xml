    <concealment>Principal investigator will peruse admission list to identify potential participants.Regular contact will be made with treating physiotherapists. Once potential participant is identified, medical clearance will be sought from treating consultant. All potential participants will undergo assessment to ensure suitablility. Once approval gained and participant consented, assessment by a blinded assessor will be arranged. Following assessment, subjects will be randomised. Allocation will be concealed through the use of consecutively numbered opaque sealed envelopes and will be maintained at a central location.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Following stroke few survivors regain full walking ability as impaired balance;
slower walking speed and poor cardiorespiratory fitness are frequently evident by
rehabilitation end. Treadmills have been used to improve walking in acute stroke
patients and fitness in chronic stroke patients. There are no published studies
investigating if treadmill walking can improve walking and fitness simultaneously.
This single-blind randomised controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of a
treadmill-walking program with specific heart rate targets to improve walking
following stroke. If effective this intervention has the potential to improve
independence and mobility following stroke thus reducing the burden of care in the
community. This study will establish effectiveness to support a future larger trial.
The aim of this project is to investigate in people with a stroke who are able to
walk, does participation in a 6-week treadmill walking program with specific target
heart rates:
i. improve gait performance and cardiorespiratory fitness without compromising gait quality?
ii. result in gains that are maintained 3 months later?</summary>
