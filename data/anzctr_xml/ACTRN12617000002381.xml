  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete two inpatient sessions, with admission the afternoon before dosing, followed by 48 hours of observation after dosing. Study staff will administer to participants a single dose of intravenous buprenorphine 300mcg during one inpatient session and a single dose of sublingual (under-the-tongue) buprenoprhine wafer 800 mcg during another session. Study staff will observe the oral cavity to ensure sublingual buprenorphine wafer is dissolved. To block the opioid effects of buprenorphine, 50 mg oral naltrexone will be administered 12 hours and 1 hour pre-dose and 12 hours post-dose. The two inpatient sessions will be separated by a minimum of 7 days. No food will be allowed for 10 hours prior to and four hours following dosing.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the absolute bioavailability of BnoX Trademark sublingual buprenorphine wafer versus intravenous buprenorphine. Standard non-compartmental analysis methods will be used to obtain PK variables for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine for both routes of administration. The bioavailability after sublingual dosing will be estimated by the ratio of dose adjusted area under the plasma concentration-time curve following intravenous and sublingual dosing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A total of 16 blood samples will be collected per participant per occasion (pre-dose and at 10, 20, 30, 45 mins, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48h post dose).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine safety and tolerability of a single dose of BnoX (buprenorphine wafer) administered via sublingual route.  The most common side effects of buprenoprhine are sedation, drowsiness and dizziness. Participants will be administered Naltrexone to block opioid effects. Safety and tolerability will be monitored by collection of electrocardiograms, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and adverse event monitoring.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Electrocardiogram at pre-dose, 1 hour, 24 and 48 hours after dosing.  Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respirations and oxygen saturation reading) pre-dose and at 10, 20, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours. Continuous oxygen saturation monitoring starting prior to dosing and for the first hour after dosing.  Adverse event probes will be conducted at 20 minutes and at 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The sponsor has developed a wafer formulation of buprenorphine to be administered under the tongue. The buprenorphine wafer will be compared to intravenous buprenorphine (marketed in Australia as Temgesic). Healthy volunteers may participate in the study.  Participants will complete two inpatient sessions, with admission the afternoon before dosing, followed by 48 hours of observation after dosing.  Participants will receive a single dose of intravenous buprenorphine 300mcg during one inpatient session and a single dose of sublingual (under-the-tongue) buprenoprhine wafer 800 mcg during another session. Naltrexone is given to block opioid effects. The two inpatient sessions will be separated by a minimum of 7 days. No food will be allowed for 10 hours prior to and four hours following dosing.</summary>
