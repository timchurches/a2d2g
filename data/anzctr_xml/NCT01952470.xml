Once daily, 2.5ml inhaled dornase alpha (evening if able) with inhalational breathing routine (IBR). IBR consists of 4 slow deep breaths followed by 6 relaxed breaths, repeated until nebuliser is complete, coughing when the patient feels the need to expectorate.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lung clearance index (LCI) - change - A measure of ventilation inhomogeneity as measured during multiple breath washout (MBW) of inert tracer gases. It has been shown that this test is a potentially more sensitive measure of peripheral airway obstruction than regular spirometry in short term (4 week) mucolytic interventional studies in paediatric CF(17-18). This test would be performed within the respiratory physiology lung function laboratory on site at all assessment points, by an assessor who is blinded to group allocation for follow up data collection.
Conventionally used primary endpoints in this population, such as regular spirometry(3), may be unable to detect between group differences without large sample sizes and long treatment durations. Based on current evidence from non-lung transplant populations, LCI has been able to show short-term change, whereas regular spirometry has not shown change(17-18).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients who have undergone lung transplantation are at an increased risk of developing chest
      infections due to long-term medication suppressing the immune response. In other chronic lung
      diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis, inhaled, nebulised mucolytic
      medication such as dornase alpha and isotonic saline are often used as part of the management
      of lung disease characterized by increased or retained secretions. These agents act by making
      it easier to clear airway secretions, and are currently being used on a case-by-case basis
      post lung transplantation.

      To the investigators knowledge, these agents have not been evaluated via robust scientific
      investigation when used post lung transplant, yet are widely used in routine practice.
      Patients post lung transplant must be investigated separately as they exhibit differences in
      physiology that make the clearance of sputum potentially more difficult when compared to
      other lung diseases. Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of hospital
      re-admission post lung transplant. Therefore, this highlights the need for a randomized
      controlled trial. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of dornase alpha, compared
      to isotonic saline, in the management of lower respiratory tract infections post lung
      transplant. Investigators hypothesize that dornase alpha will be more effective than isotonic
      saline.

      The effect of a daily dose of dornase alpha and isotonic saline will be compared over a
      treatment period of 1 month. Patients admitted to hospital suffering from chest infections
      characterized by sputum production post lung transplant will be eligible for study inclusion.
      Patients will be followed up through to 3 months in total to analyze short-medium term
      lasting effect. Investigators wish to monitor physiological change within the lung
      non-invasively via lung function analysis whilst assessing patient perceived benefit via
      cough specific quality of life questionnaires. These measures will be taken at study
      inclusion and repeated after 1 month and 3 months. Day to day monitoring will be performed
      via patient symptom diaries, incorporating hospital length of stay and exacerbation rate. The
      outcomes of this study have the potential to guide clinical decision-making and highlight
      safe and efficacious therapies.</summary>
