  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare a synbiotic supplement containing pre- and probiotics, bovine lactoferrin and bovine immunoglobulines with acacia gum on gut bacteria and indices of immunity. The study will provide consumers with evidence based advice on the use of a synbiotic supplement.</summary>
