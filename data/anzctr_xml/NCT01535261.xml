  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ranibizumab 0.5 mg/0.05 ml

Experimental: Ranibizumab arm - Intravitreal injection with standard dose of 0.5 mg/0.05mL PRN


Treatment: drugs: Ranibizumab 0.5 mg/0.05 ml
Patients will receive the first dose at Baseline, as an intravitreal injection with a standard dose of 0.5 mg/0.05 ml. Patients will receive at least 3 study treatments at monthly intervals (Day 1, Month 1 and Month 2). The last mandatory dose during treatment initiation will be administered approximately 60 days after the first study treatment. If there is no improvement in VA over the course of the first 3 injections, continued treatment is not recommended and the patient may receive alternative treatment at the investigator's discretion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 12 Compared to Baseline - Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of ETDRS is 0 to 100 letters. A positive average change from baseline of BCVA indicates improvement</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 24 Compared to Baseline - Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of ETDRS is 0 to 100 letters. A positive average change from baseline of BCVA indicates improvement</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean Average Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA From Baseline Month 12 and Month 24 - Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of ETDRS is 0 to 100 letters. Mean Average Change: for each patient, first average change is calculated as the average of the changes from baseline to Month 1 over Month 12 (or Month 24). Then, mean average change is calculated as the average of average changes across all patients.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Average Change in BCVA From First Treatment Interruption (Due to BCVA Stabilization) to Month 12 and Month 24 - Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of ETDRS is 0 to 100 letters. Stability in visual acuity after treatment interruption indicates longer duration of the drug efficacy</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Patients With a BCVA Improvement of =1, =5, =10, =15, and =30 Letters From Baseline to Month 12 and Month 24 in the Study Eye - BCVA score was based on the number of letters read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart assessed at a starting distance of 4 meters. An increased score indicates improvement in acuity. This outcome assessed the number of participants who had improvement of =1, =5, =10, =15, and =30 letters of visual acuity at month 12 as compared with baseline</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Patients With a BCVA Value of = 73 Letters (Approximate 20/40 Snellen Chart Equivalent) at Month 12 and Month 24 - Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like chart at baseline and month 12 while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of EDTRS is 0 to 100 letters. BCVA above 73 letters at month 12 and month 24 indicates a positive outcome.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change in Central Reading Center (CRC)-Assessed Central Subfield Thickness (CSFT) From Month 12 and Month 24 Compared to Baseline - Retinal thickness was measured using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The images were reviewed by a central reading center to ensure a standardized evaluation</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change in Patient-reported Outcomes in NEI-VFQ-25 Composite and Subscale Scores at Month 12 and Month 24 Compared to Baseline - The survey consists of 25 items representing 11 vision related constructs (general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social functioning, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision, peripheral vision) plus a single-item general health rating question. The score of each individual question ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 which indicates the best possible response. The composite score and score of each of each construct also range from 0 to 100 as they are calculated as total scores divided by the number of questions. The higher the values of total scores represent better outcome. Scores per visit and of the change descriptively by visit.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study provided additional efficacy and safety data for 0.5-mg ranibizumab using
      as needed (PRN) dosing over 24 months in patients with visual impairment due to macular edema
      secondary to Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). Spectral domain high-definition optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) images was analyzed to gain insights into predictive factors for
      disease progression and the possibility of reduced monitoring was assessed in Year 2. The
      results of this open-label study provided long-term safety and efficacy data to further guide
      recommendations on the use of ranibizumab in this indication.</summary>
