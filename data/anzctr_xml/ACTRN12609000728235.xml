  <interventions>
    <interventions>Whole body vibration (WBV) through stimulation of mechanoceptors and muscle spindle endings elicits tonic vibration reflex, thus producing muscular contraction at lower limbs. Subjects were asked to maintain orthostatic position with a knee flexion of 60° on the vibration board. The experimental protocol consisted in 3 sessions of WBV lasting two minute each at frequency of 30, 45 and 55 Hz with 3mm peak to peak amplitude respectively. Each vibrating session was followed by a one minute pause to enable muscular recovery. Electrocardiografic registrations (ECG) were recorded at five different timepoints: 5 minutes before the first WBV session (PRE), during each of the three WBV session at different frequencies and 1 minute after the end of the last WBV session (POST).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Variations in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)components. Data were processed with an analogic/digital converter (micro 1401 CED Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK), recorded on a PC by means of a data acquisition system (Spike2 v.5, CED) with a sampling rate of 3000 Hz. Guidelines (Task force, 1996) were followed for time recordings, sampling rate and HRV analysis of electrocardiograms. Artifacts and noise regions were removed and in case of premature beats they have been manually corrected. Only recordings that contained &lt;1% of premature beats were considered. 
ECGs have been analysed by means of a software called "HRV analysis", which can perform a wide range of measurements of HRV in time and frequency domain, including mean HR measurements</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate autonomic nervous system responses during WBV, in particular regarding cardiovascular system. We tested the hypothesis if WBV is a safe training approach, considering that its application is growing in different health conditions. 
Morover HRV monitoring during a rehabilitation protocol can give precise information about a subjects cardiovascular status. This could permit to create specific individual rehabilitative protocols, reducing at minimal risks and at the same time to monitor the efficacy of the rehabilitative act. In conclusion, this work could be an important starting point in order to set up a rehabilitative technique with a low cardiovascular load in subjects precluded from any other kind of physical activity.</summary>
