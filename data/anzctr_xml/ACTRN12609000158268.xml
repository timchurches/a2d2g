      <outcome>To assess whether administrating a chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients whose tumor is controlled after 4 months of induction chemotherapy (CT) increases survival compared to continue the
same CT. Patient will undergo physical and clinical assessments using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale 
(ECOG PS), blood tests, computer topograhy scans of the abdomen and chest.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is looking at three main questions about the treatment of patients with locally advanced cancer of the pancreas. Firstly, does taking erlotinib tablets in addition to the usual gemcitabine chemotherapy make a difference? Secondly, after 15 weeks of chemotherapy (plus or minus erlotinib), is it better to switch to chemoradiotherapy (radiotherapy plus capecitabine tablets) for 6 weeks, or is it better to continue the same gemcitabine chemotherapy (plus or minus erlotinib) for 6 more weeks? Thirdly, does it make any difference to keep taking erlotinib tablets after the 15 + 6 weeks of treatment have finished?

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have locally advanced cancer of the pancreas which has not spread to distant sites, and is not suitable for surgery. There are some more specific requirements, but your study doctor will discuss these with you.

Trial details. 
All patients will commence treatment with 15 weeks of weekly intravenous gemcitabine. Depending on a random assignment, some patients will also take daily erlotinib tablets during those 15 weeks. If there is no disease progression, some patients will be randomly assigned to continue the same treatment for another 6 weeks, while other patients will be randomly assigned to switch to 6 weeks of chemoradiotherapy (radiotherapy on weekdays plus capecitabine tablets every day). If there is no disease progression, all patients who at either stage were assigned to take erlotinib tablets will then keep taking erlotinib until disease progression, for a minimum 17 months. Patients who were never assinged to take erlotinib tablets will just be followed up for a minimum 17 months.

Participants will be assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale (ECOG PS), blood tests, physical examination and computer topography (CT) scans of the abdomen and chest.</summary>
