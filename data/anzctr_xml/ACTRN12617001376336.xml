  <interventions>
    <interventions>At time 0 an enteral infusion of [U-13C6]-glucose (at a rate calculated to obtain a 30% enrichment of enteral glucose content), [1-13C]-phenylalanine (at a rate calculated to obtain a 30% enrichment of enteral phenylalanine content) and 3-O-methylglucose (infusion 20 mg/kg/h) is added to the ongoing enteral nutrition to measure absorption and enteral utilization of substrates. Simultaneously, a measurement of energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry is started to be continued during the entire protocol. At t 120 minutes, primed intravenous infusions of [ring-2H5]-phenylalanine (bolus 0.5 mg/kg, infusion 0.5 mg/kg/h), [ring-2H4]-Tyrosine (bolus 0.15 mg/kg), [2H2]-Tyrosine (bolus 0.3 mg/kg, infusion 0.3 mg/kg/h), 2H2-glucose (bolus 3 mg/kg, infusion 2.4 mg/kg/h) and 2H2-glycerol (bolus 0.15 mg/kg, infusion 0.33 mg/kg/h) are initiated to measure endogenous substrate turnover. After 150 minutes, plasma samples will be draw from the arterial line four times at 10 minute intervals to determine steady-state concentration of all the tracers. Whole-body protein turnover from phenylalanine kinetics, glucose turnover, intestinal glucose absorption, and lipolysis from glycerol rate of appearance are calculated from these values. The final sample is also analyzed for glucose, triglyceride, free fatty acids, glycerol, amino acid and urea concentrations. 

All aspects of patient care are governed by the attending intensivist, but the rates of enteral and parenteral nutrition are to remain constant 3 hours prior to and during the study period. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nutrition aimed at optimizing the provision of energy and protein during critical illness has been proposed as a potential therapy to improve both long- and short-term outcomes. So far, existing evidence is inconclusive. As ICU patients represent a very heterogenous population, in varying temporal phases of disease and recovery, it can be expected that a one size fits all approach will fail to improve outcomes. It has been hypothesized that in certain patients nutrition will not be able to suppress the endogenous energy and amino acid supply and basically the patent is overfed when eucaloric nutrition is supplied.

Given the lack of improvements in patient-centered outcomes that have resulted from trials of ICU nutrition, a better physiological understanding of macronutrient turnover is an essential step towards designing novel therapeutic approaches. 

We plan to investigate whole-body protein, glucose and lipid turnover in ICU patients in relation to metabolic rate. This initial study is designed as a feasibility and pilot trial of a multi-substrate stable isotope tracer method for critically ill patients fed by the enteral route. </summary>
