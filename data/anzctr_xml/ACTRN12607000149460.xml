  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study aims at comparing 2 methods of bronchodilator challenge in patients with asthma or COPD.
The patients will be challenged with Salbutamol 200-800 mcg via metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer (intervention).                                                                                                              During the latter part each patient will receive an incremental dose of Salbutamol MDI and spacer starting from 200mcg and increasing by further 200mcg each time, up to 800mcg in total. The patients will have spirometry after each dose which will be given 5-10 minutes apart. Airway reversibility will be measured during spirometry and side effects monitored. 
The patients are tested on 2 separate days spending approximately one hour each time. They will be asked to come back within the same week starting from the following day, at approximately the same time of day to control for diurnal variation in respiratory function.</interventions>
    <comparator>The patients will be challenged with Salbutamol 5mg nebules (control).                                                                                                                                                                                      During the latter part each patient will receive an incremental dose of Salbutamol MDI and spacer starting from 200mcg and increasing by further 200mcg each time, up to 800mcg in total. The patients will have spirometry after each dose which will be given 5-10 minutes apart. Airway reversibility will be measured during spirometry and side effects monitored.

      <timepoint>Measured after each intervention. When the patients receive the MDI and spacer, with each dose increment (as above), spirometry will be measured.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1- Establish the equivalent dose of Salbutamol given via MDI and spacer to that of a nebuliser.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This analysis will be performed at the end of the trial after collecting all data. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2- Compare the safety of both methods of delivery.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Side effects such as tachycardia, tremor, sweatiness, respiratory distress or any other discomfort reported by the patient will be monitored immediately after each intervention and in the MDI group after each dose. A routine measurement will be the pulse rate following each dose.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Testing for bronchodilator response (airway reversibility) is an essential part of spirometry. Traditionally respiratory laboratories use nebulised salbutamol to check such response. New data suggest that inhaled salbutamol via metered dose inhaler and spacer is at least as effective as nebulised salbutamol and may be associated with fewer side effects. Comparison between the two methods of inducing bronchodilatation in the laboratory has not been previously tested. We aim to compare the 2 methods of delivery for bronchodilator response. The patients will be monitored for any potential side effects during the study.</summary>
