  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention delivered  in the study will be Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), a group psychological intervention, delivered face-to-face to groups of 10-12 participants in 2-hours long weekly sessions, over a period of eight weeks. MBCT will be delivered by an experienced mindfulness teacher, trained in MBCT and MBSR up to a teacher level and with four years post teacher training experience as well as experience running several previous mindfulness group courses for people with chronic illness.

MBCT is designed to help people who suffer repeated bouts of depression by cultivating mindfulness and learning about habitual thinking patterns that make us vulnerable to depression.. It uses a combination of psycho-education, mindfulness practices of focused attention without judgement and cognitive techniques including meta-cognitive processes to assist with disengaging from maladaptive ways of coping and thinking. .It's proven to be effective in both preventing and treating depression.

Participants will be recruited via the IBD outpatient services at Mater Young Adult Health Centre Brisbane. The MBCT will be conducted at Mater Young Adult Health Centre, an urban tertiary hospital specializing in treatment of young adults aged 16-25 with chronic illness.
. A subset of participants will receive the fMRI scans, and these will be performed at The Centre for Advanced Imaging (CAI) on the St Lucia campus of the University of Queensland. At all other times, participants will be treated as per standard care at Mater South Brisbane.

Following recruitment, participants will be randomly allocated to either treatment as usual (TAU-control group) or an intervention group (INT group) who will receive the MBCT. Participants in the intervention group will attend two hours of weekly group mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and a subset of this group will be asked to undergo MRI scans (16 from the intervention group and 16 from the control group). All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires, and this will be collated with routinely collected clinical data. 
MBCT intervention will be adapted to suit the young age of participants and also their IBD symptoms which could necessitate shorter practices due to pain and other GI symptoms (e.g. urgency to go to the toilet, fatigue etc)... In particular, mindfulness practices will be shortened (e.g. 20 minutes instead of 30 minutes body scan or mindfulness of the breath) while trying to maintain the recommended "daily dose" of mindfulness practices through introducing additional shorter practices and making practices more youth friendly (e.g. youth relevant poetry, use of language and themes)..Psycho-educational component of the course will be expanded to include a module on IBD and its interaction with stress and mood.Intervention adherence or fidelity will be assessed,by participants having a weekly log of mindfulness practice including type of practice,amount of time practiced and any reflections barriers to practice. All weekly group sessions will be video recorded and later assessed by an external, experienced MBCT teacher to ensure adherence to MBCT session conducting guidelines.

    <comparator>Participants will be randomly allocated to either treatment as usual (TAU-control group) or an intervention group (INT group) who will receive the MBCT. Participants in the control group will receive psychosocial treatment via the Young Adult Support Unit (YASU), a multidisciplinary team providing psychosocial services to young adults with mental health concerns  who are current patients at Mater Young Adult Health Centre .The treatment might involve talking therapy, medication or psychological support, depending on the severity and nature of their mental health concerns.Participants in the control group will also get supportive phone calls from the research assistant and handouts or emails providing links to mental health websites (e.g., beyond blue). The research assistant will respond to any questions raised by the participant.s.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on researcher experience, we expect 64 patients to be available to participate in the study, with a drop-out rate of 15%. We expect that around 54 participants will complete the study (n=27 intervention group; n=27 control group). The sample size provides sufficient statistical power to identify large effect changes associated with the identified study hypothesis. All statistical analyses will be conducted by the research statistician. 
The power calculations for the study have factored in the purpose of this RCT study. With a sample size of 27 participants in each group, the first and second hypotheses can be tested at the 5% significance level with 80% power in order to detect large effect sizes (n2=0.05). With these sample sizes the third exploratory hypothesis can be tested for each of the health outcomes at a 1% significance level with 80% power, in order to ensure that any moderate correlations (n&gt;.5) are detected within each group.  Gpower Version 3.1.9.2 has been used for these calculations.

An Analysis of Covariance will be used to address the first hypothesis, comparing the two groups in terms of changes in regard to depression while controlling for disease activity. The second hypothesis will involve a MANOVA analysis for the secondary outcome measures, again controlling for disease activity. A completer analysis and an Intention to Treat analysis approach will be adopted in order to assess the impact of drop-outs. Multiple imputation methodology will be used for the imputation of other missing data.

Multiple health related outcomes are considered in the case of the exploratory third hypothesis; such as, relapse rates, healthcare utilization (MCSI) and QoL (IBD-QoL), so adjustments to significance levels and confidence intervals will be made to compensate for these multiple health outcomes. After an initial analysis of correlations for each of the groups, separate regression models will be fitted for each health outcome, controlling for disease activity and pre-treatment levels. The predictor variables will be entered in a logical staged sequence allowing the impact of each set of predictors to be measured for each of these health-related outcomes and also allowing tests of mediation.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Inflammatory Bowel Disease is an auto-inflammatory disease characterised by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and a chronic, relapsing and remitting course. The incidence and prevalence of IBD are increasing with time and in different regions of the world indicating its emergence as a global disease. The incidence rates of IBD in Australia are among the highest reported in the literature of IBD with 85,000 estimated patients.
Individuals with IBD are significantly more likely to suffer from depressive and other emotional health symptoms than age matched individuals in general population as well as people suffering from other chronic illnesses. Research has shown that individuals with IBD have triple the rate of mental disorders than that of general population. In particular, youth with IBD had higher rates of depressive disorders than youth with other chronic conditions, lower parent- and youth-reported QOL, and lower youth-reported social functioning compared to healthy youth.Research to date identifies that psychological interventions involving IBD cohorts are effective in reducing psychological distress (e.g., anxiety and/or depression), with cognitive behaviour therapy having the most evidential support. More recently, mindfulness based interventions (i.e., promotion of moment-to-moment awareness without judgement), have been found to reduce anxiety and depression and enhance quality of life]. The aim of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) exploring the potential benefit of a group, IBD-focused, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for youth living with IBD and comorbid depression. This randomised trial will also explore the potential benefit of the mindfulness intervention on immune markers associated with IBD activity and functional neuroimaging changes in response to the mindfulness intervention to provide insight in the mechanisms of action of this intervention.
HYPOTHESES 
1.	MBCT (intervention group) will improve depression scores (pre-post);  
2.	Intervention will increase quality of life, mindfulness, medication adherence, perceived health care empowerment, coping and perceived illness perceptions and it will reduce anxiety symptoms (pre-post);
3.	Intervention will change the structural and functional connectivity in default mode and executive control networks; and
4.	Intervention will be associated with decreased inflammatory burden, and improved microbiome.

OBJECTIVES
Using 64 volunteer individuals (aged 16-25) with IBD and depression, the aim of this study is to conduct an RCT exploring the benefits of IBD-focused mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on depressive symptoms in youth living with IBD and comorbid depression. 

Secondary aims of this study are to explore the potential benefits of the MBCT on:
	QoL, medication adherence, health care empowerment, coping patterns, illness perceptions, and anxiety;
	Biological markers of IBD,
	Brain neuroconnectivity </summary>
