  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The incidence of tremor in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has been estimated to affect up to 2/3rds
      of patients. Over half of the tremors involve the upper limb and frequently lead to further
      disability. Medical treatment of MS tremor is generally unrewarding, although carbamazepine,
      clonazepam, glutethimide, hyoscine, isoniazid, ondansetron, primidone, and
      tetrahydrocannabinol have been reported to have some beneficial effect but published evidence
      of effectiveness is very limited. The investigators' experience to date suggests that many of
      the upper limb tremors may potentially be responsive to Botulinum toxin injection therapy.

      Aims:

      1. The investigators aim to determine the efficacy of commonly used doses of BOTOX on the
      patients with symptomatic unilateral or bilateral arm tremor due to MS; and any side effects
      associated with this treatment.</summary>
