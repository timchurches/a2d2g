    <summary>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally.  However, many individuals are unaware of their CVD risk factors.
We systematically review the medical literature to determine the efficacy of existing intervention strategies to increase the uptake of cardiovascular risk factor screening.  A systematic search was conducted through Pubmed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.  Additional articles were located through backward and forward citation search.   The quality of studies was evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.  Data were pooled using random-effects model..</summary>
