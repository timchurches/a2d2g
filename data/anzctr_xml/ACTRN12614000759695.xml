  <interventions>
    <interventions>Once informed consent is obtained and smoking status is confirmed by CO measurement using a PICO+ Bedfont Smokerlyzer (CO &lt;5ppm indicates a non-smoker), participants will be enrolled on the 12 week treatment trial (with nicotine replacement therapy administration) with 3 monthly follow-up for 9 months. The trial stages are as follows:

1. Participants will attend an initial tobacco assessment at Common Ground with a tobacco treatment counsellor who will administer a number of research questionnaires.

2. Participants will return the following week for the first of 12 x Â½ hour, weekly, counselling sessions at Common Ground, with the study counsellor, at which time nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) will be dispensed and motivational intervewing commenced. Participants will commence on 21mg x 24 hour transdermal nicotine patch and/or one of the oral forms of NRT of the participants choice. The starting dose and type of NRT will be determined by an assessment of the patient's nicotine dependency and CO level. The dose of NRT will be titrated up to a maximum of 42mg transdermal nicotine patch in response to symptoms of withdrawal and relapse. Flexible NRT dosing will be provided according to the patient profile and clinician advice, based on the participants severity of dependence and previous experiences in using NRT.

3. At each weekly treatment session participants self-reported smoking level will be assessed and verified by CO measurement, as will NRT use, nicotine withdrawal symptoms and mental health issues. NRT will be dispensed at each weekly treatment session for 12 weeks. Motivational counselling interventions will be used throughout the treatment protocol to enhance motivation and readiness to quit smoking.

4.After 12 weeks of treatment, the provision of free NRT will cease but participants will have the option of obtaining a script for nicotine patches for a further 12 weeks if needed. The script will be provided by their medical practitioner.

5. Face-to-face follow-up interviews will be conducted at 3 monthly intervals for a period of 9 months following termination or treatment completion. Follow-up will include biochemical verification of self-reported smoking status in expired CO measurement, administration of the research questionnaires and a review of participants' medical records. Written consent will be obtained for access to participants medical records.

    <comparator>Once informed consent is obtained and smoking status is confirmed by CO measurement, participants will be enrolled on the 12 week treatment trial, using motivational interviewing counselling interventions only, with 3 monthly follow-up for 9 months. The trial stages are as follows:

1. Participants will attend an initial tobacco assessment with a tobacco treatment specialist who will administer a number of research questionnaires.
2. Participants will return the following week and attend further 12 x 1/2 hour weekly motivational interviewing counselling sessions.
3. At each treatment session, participants' self-reported smoking level will be assessed and verified by CO measurement, as will nicotine withdrawal symptoms, tobacco cravings and mental health.
4. After 12 weeks, participants will cease treatment and follow-up will commence.  Face-to-face follow-up interviews will be conducted at 3 monthly intervals for a period of 9 months following termination or treatment completion. Follow-up will include biochemical verification of self-reported smoking status in expired CO measurement, administration of the research questionnaires and a review of participants' medical records. Written consent will be obtained for access to participants medical records.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will explore the feasibility and treatment effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy and motivational interventions for smokers who have a history of homelessness.  It will evaluate the impact of treatment location on participation, retention and smoking cessation rates.
The trial design involves a treatment period of 12 weeks, with a further 9 months follow-up.  Trial patient will be broken into two groups: (1) Thirty (30) trial participants who smoke and live in a housing facility for homeless people will receive motivationally-based counselling interventions and will commence on 21mg x 24 hour transdermal nicotine patch plus one of the forms of oral nicotine replacement therapy of the participant's choice.  The dose of nicotine patch will be titrated up to a maximum of 42mg in response to withdrawal and relapse.  Treatment will be delivered within the residential facility.  (2) Thirty (30) trial participants attending a hospital-based opioid treatment program at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, who smoke and have a history of homelessness, will receive motivational counselling interventions to help them to stop smoking.  Treatment will be delivered within this outpatient facility.</summary>
