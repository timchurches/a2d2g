  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a randomised within-subjects cross-over design, post-menopausal women will complete three experimental trials (plus an introductory session) at the School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health, The University of Western Australia. A washout period of one week will occur between each of the four sessions. Participants will be supervised for the duration of all sessions and instructed to complete a food diary and abstain from caffeine, alcohol, chocolate and vigorous physical activity in the 24 h prior to the introductory session and to replicate this in the 24 h prior to each experimental session. At each session, women will have 15min to consume one of the following chocolate treatments (2099 kJ each); (a) 84 g of a high concentration cocoa (80%) dark chocolate, (b) 87 g of a lower concentration cocoa (35%) milk chocolate and (c) 85 g of a cocoa butter white chocolate (0% cocoa solids). Measures of perceived appetite, mood and the circulating concentration of appetite-related peptides will be assessed pre- and post-ingestion. In addition, ad libitum energy intake will be assessed 90 minutes following chocolate administration. Each session will be approximately 2 hours in duration.
 </interventions>
    <comparator>The three chocolate conditions will be isocaloric, but contain varied polyphenol content to assess a dose response (80% cocoa 'dark' chocolate (395 mg polyphenols), a 35% cocoa 'milk' chocolate (200 mg polyphenols) and a cocoa butter 'white' chocolate (35 mg polyphenols).  </comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perception of appetite will be assessed using a modified 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Briefly, this will involve answering four questions anchored with words representing opposing extreme states of fullness, hunger, desire to eat and prospective food consumption respectively  (i.e. how hungry do you feel? anchored by not hungry at all and as hungry as I have ever felt). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre (baseline/fasting) and post chocolate consumption (0 min, 30 min and 90 min post-ingestion).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Circulating appetite-related hormones. Venous blood will be sampled from an antecubital vein and immediately combined with 160 microlitres of serine protease inhibitor (Pefabloc SC, Roche Diagnostics, NSW, Australia) before being centrifuged at 4 degrees Celsius, 1000 g for 10 min with the plasma stored at -80 degrees Celsius. Samples will later be analysed in duplicate for a range of appetite-related peptides including active ghrelin, insulin, leptin and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) using a commercially available assay kit (Milliplex Human Gut Hormone Panel, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a Luminex 200 system (Luminex Corp., Austin, Texas, USA).

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mood will be assessed using the profile of mood states  adolescent inventory (POMS-A) questionnaire (Terry et al., 2003). With a response set of How do you feel right now? participants will rate the 24 mood states on a scale from not at all to extremely. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>It is anticipated that a sample size of 14 participants will allow for the detection of a difference in ad libitum energy intake of 400 kJ between trials (power 0.8; p &lt; 005). The effect of the chocolate conditions on ad libitum energy intake will be assessed using one-way (condition) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Area under the curve for perceived appetite (hunger, fullness, desire to eat and prospective food consumption) following chocolate consumption will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule and compared between conditions using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Mood, blood glucose and appetite-related hormones will be compared using two-way (condition x time) repeated measures ANOVA. Post hoc paired t-tests (Least Significant Difference) will be used to determine the specific time-points where differences lay (P = 0.05) </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Polyphenols contained within the cocoa in chocolate are thought to be beneficial to some aspects of health. However, no study has investigated the effect of different types of chocolate (and the associated variation in polyphenol dose) on appetite and energy intake, in postmenopausal women. This research aims to investigate the acute effect of chocolate consumption (80% cocoa [dark] versus 35% cocoa [milk] versus 0% cocoa [white]) on appetite and energy intake in postmenopausal women. The results will have implications for weight management.</summary>
