  <interventions>
    <interventions>patients with type2 diabetes and obesity undergoing gastric sleeve resection and gastric bypass bariatric surgery. This is a prospective study where observation will be made on 2 groups of patients: (1) those scheduled for gastric sleeve resection surgery (2)those scheduled for gastric bypass bariatric surgery.

gastric sleeve resection is carried out by a one off laparoscopic technique of about 90minutes. under general anaethesia.

gastric bypass is also performed laparoscopically which takes about 120-150minutes.  under general anaethesia.

Comparison will be made with control group (patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to look at the effects of weight reduction surgery on gut hormones, in particular how different types of surgery may have different effects on gut hormones.  These differences may therefore be related to how resolution of diabetes occurs after surgery that occurs before any weight loss occurs.  Continuous glucose monitoring during the operation and immediately after may also be related to the changes in gut hormones that we are studying. This would allow more in depth understanding of the mechanism of diabetes resolution after weight reduction surgery.

We would also like to study how risk factors for vascular disease may change after the two different bariatric surgery (gastric sleeve resection and gastric bypass surgery), and this is done by various blood tests as well as scans to look at structure and function of the heart.</summary>
