Reference ranges (90% confidence intervals for the general population) will be determined for each age band within the population sample by a general linear model (ANOVA).  Initial analysis will be carried out on a non-transformed scale however if a highly skew distribution is found analyses will be done on the log transformed scale.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Levels of POSTN (a protein-coding gene, also known as osteoblast specific factor) expression and periostin have been measured in a number of tissues and disease states but as a reference range of periostin level for a normal population does not exist it is difficult to determine the clinical significance of these measurements. This study endeavours to provide a reference range for serum periostin level to allow comparison to be made of periostin levels in certain disease states against those of a healthy population.
