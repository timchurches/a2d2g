  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will carry out aquatic or non-aquatic physiotherapy treatment. They will perform physiotherapy treatment two days per week for 12 weeks, 60 minutes each session supervised by a physiotherapist. They will be divided into three small groups according to their own schedule preferences. Aquatic physiotherapy training consist about stretching exercise, aerobic exercise as anterior, posterior and lateral walking. After that, participants will perform different ludic exercises to muscle strength and balance with balls, pool bars, aqua noodles, kick boards and floats. Patient lying supine on a pool bar or aqua noodles, legs  alternate into flexion and extension, adduction and abduction. Session will finish with a cool-down period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Non-aquatic physiotherapy treatment will be control arm in this field. The participants will also perform non-aquatic physiotherapy treatment two days per week for 12 weeks, 60 minutes each session supervised by a physiotherapist. They will be divided into three small groups according to their own schedule preferences.  Each non-aquatic physiotherapy session will consist of stretching exercises, 4 ankle and knee muscle strengthening exercises at an intensity of 60-70% of 1 repetition maximum (2 sets of 10 repetitions ) and balance training. Static balance training will be performed through simple and double-tasks at stand on one leg, their heels and their tiptoes and tandem position. Dynamic balance training will be performed through lower support base walking. It will be included ludic activities looking for great adherence. Each session will be accompanied by music.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is compare the efficacy of aquatic exercise and non-aquatic physiotherapy treatment among elderly women suffering osteoporosis. The study hypothesis consists that women that take part in the aquatic physiotherapy treatment may improve postural control as non-aquatic physiotherapy treatment;however,  aquatic treatment has significantly less adverse effects compared to non-aquatic treatment, as risk of falls.
