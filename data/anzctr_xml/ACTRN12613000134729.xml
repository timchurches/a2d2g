    <summary>This study will assess the effectiveness and feasiblity of a newly developed brief intervention for young persons with cancer termed Mindfulness-Based Music Therapy (MBMT). 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a cancer survivor aged 14 to 25 years old, or are actively attending treatment at metro Adelaide hospitals. Participants must be fluent in English. 

Trial details
All participants in the study will undergo at least two sessions with the music therapist. During meetings with the music therapist, participants will learn some attention focusing techniques ("mindfulness") and music therapy techniques. Participants will also be provided with some pre-recorded songs and voice recordings to practice the exercises at home on a regular basis. 

Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline, 2 weeks and 8 weeks after the intervention completion in order to evaluate psychological wellbeing across the cancer journey. The intervention is expected to decrease psychological distress, and improve quality of life, mindfulness and self compassion.
