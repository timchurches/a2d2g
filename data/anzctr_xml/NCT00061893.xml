Experimental: Combination chemotherapy - Metastatic Ewing Sarcoma - 14-cycle study building on conventional tx (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, ifosfamide, etoposide) and adding two antiangiogenic agents: the vinca alkaloid vinblastine and the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Refer to the Interventions section for dosages, method of delivery and frequency of administration.


Treatment: drugs: celecoxib
Given orally, Celecoxib 250 mg/m2 PO BID (500mg/m2/day) from Day 1 of Cycle 1 through Day 21 of Cycle 14. The dose should be rounded off to the nearest 100 mg. If PK studies are being done, Celecoxib should be given 24 hours prior to the other drugs for Cycle 1 only. [Celecoxib may be interrupted for up to 7 days around the time of surgical procedures.] .

Treatment: drugs: cyclophosphamide
Given IV, 1200 mg/m2 IV infusion over 1 hour with MESNA uroprotection, on Day 1. For children &lt; 1 year treat with 50% doses calculated on a m2 basis. If tolerated (no delay in administration of the next cycle due to delayed count recovery or delayed resolution of other toxicities and no serious toxicities), consider increasing to 75% and then to 100% of the calculated full dose.

Treatment: drugs: doxorubicin hydrochloride
Given IV, Doxorubicin 75 mg/ m2 /course continuous IV infusion over 48 hours, beginning Day 1. Note: The total doxorubicin dose per cycle is 75 mg/ m2, which will be given as 37.5 mg/m2/day x 2 days. Doxorubicin may be given as a continuous infusion or brief infusion.

Treatment: drugs: etoposide
Given IV, Vincristine 2 mg/m2 IV push, on Day 1. Maximum dose 2 mg. For children &lt; 1 year treat with 50% doses calculated on a m2 basis. If tolerated (no delay in administration of the next cycle due to delayed count recovery or delayed resolution of other toxicities and no serious toxicities), consider increasing to 75% and then to 100% of the calculated full dose.

Treatment: drugs: ifosfamide
Given IV,Ifosfamide 1800 mg/m2 /day IV infusion over 1 hour, Days 1-5 of each cycle. (9,000 mg/m2 max total dose per cycle). Prehydrate for 6 hours, 1,000 ml/m2 total volume (165 ml/m2/hour for 6 hours). For children &lt; 1 year treat with 50% doses calculated on a m2 basis. If tolerated (no delay in administration of the next cycle due to delayed count recovery or delayed resolution of other toxicities and no serious toxicities), consider increasing to 75% and then to 100% of the calculated full dose.

Treatment: drugs: vinblastine sulfate
Given IV, Vinblastine 1 mg/m2/d IV push three times per week beginning Day 1 of Cycle 1 and continuing through Day 21 of Cycle 14. In weeks during which vincristine is given, hold one dose of vinblastine and administer only 2 doses of vinblastine during that week. If vinblastine is due the same day as vincristine, hold that dose of vinblastine. [Vinblastine may be interrupted for up to 7 days around the time of surgical procedures.]

Treatment: drugs: vincristine sulfate
Given IV, Vincristine 2 mg/m2 IV push, on Day 1. Maximum dose 2 mg. For children &lt; 1 year treat with 50% doses calculated on a m2 basis. If tolerated (no delay in administration of the next cycle due to delayed count recovery or delayed resolution of other toxicities and no serious toxicities), consider increasing to 75% and then to 100% of the calculated full dose.

Treatment: surgery: conventional surgery
Patients who respond to induction chemotherapy undergo surgery on week 13. Patients who have inadequate margins after surgery undergo radiotherapy beginning on week 15. (see Detailed Description for frequency of administration and groups evaluated)

Treatment: other: radiation therapy
Patients with unresectable lesions undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6 weeks beginning on week 13. (see Detailed Description for frequency of administration and groups evaluated)

Treatment: drugs: MESNA
The total daily MESNA dose is equal to at least 60% of the daily cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide dose, or by continuous infusion of the 60% dose. MESNA continuous infusion should be started at the same time as the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide and be completed no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide infusion. The oral dose of MESNA is 2x the IV dose. Patients able to tolerate oral MESNA may receive the final dose by mouth at 40% of the oxazaphosphorine (cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide) dose. The dose should be given two hours earlier than the IV dose would be given. Additionally, if the patient vomits within two hours after the oral dose, the dose should be repeated or IV MESNA given.

Treatment: drugs: Filgrastim
G-CSF (Filgrastim) 5 micrograms/kg/day subcutaneously beginning 24 to 48 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy, and continuing until the absolute neutrophil count is 2,000/ÂµL or greater after nadir.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence of Severe Toxicity - An incidence of severe toxicity is defined to be the occurrence of grade 3 or higher infection or grade 3 or higher sensory neuropathy during cycles 1-2 of protocol therapy. If 12 or more patients experience grade 3 or higher infection or five or more patients experience grade 3 or higher sensory neuropathy during cycles 1-2 of protocol therapy, the regimen will be flagged as being associated with an excessive rate of severe toxicity.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinblastine, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Celecoxib may stop the growth of
      Ewing's sarcoma by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Combining more than one chemotherapy
      drug with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining low-dose vinblastine and
      celecoxib with standard regimens of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have
      newly-diagnosed metastatic Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors.</summary>
