  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients given Lenalidomide as oral capsules, 25mg, daily on days 1 to 21 followed by a 7-day rest in a 28-day cycle and Dexamethasone as oral 4mg tablets, at a dose of 40mg (20mg for patients age &gt;75 years) on days 1,8,15 and 22. Those patients not achieving partial response after 4 weeks of treatment, or very good partial response after 6 weeks of treatment or complete response after 9 weeks of treatment will be given Durvalumab at a dose of 1500mg IV on day 1 of the 28-day cycle. The IV infusion for subjects will be approximately 1 hour in duration.
Treatment will be given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.
All dosing is recorded by hospital staff. Drug accountability logs will be used by the hospital staff.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to assess whether the addition of durvalumab to patients who have achieved less than partial response to 4 cycles of lenalidomide and dexamethasone will cause an improvement in disease progression free survival.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 years or over, have been newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma and are not a candidate for high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant.
Study details
Eligible participants will all receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment in 28 day cycles, with those patients failing to adequately respond receiving durvalumab in addition. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patients otherwise coming off study.  Participants will be required to have blood samples taken at the beginning of each cycle along with a medical examination to monitor treatment safety and whether it is effectively treating the myeloma. It is hoped that the findings of this trial will establish the benefits of durvalumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients early in the course of their disease.
