  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain is the primary outcome. Measured with a 4 day diary of subjective pain scoring on a provided visual analogue scale (VAS). Patient is asked to rate their pain each day on the scale from the day of treatment (Day 1) till the day of follow-up (Day 4)</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 days after the date first seen in emergency and enrolled which will be the day of treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ear canal oedema. Assessing clinician will rate the degree of oedema with 3 grades. 1) Severe (complete/near complete canal closure) 2) Moderate (some canal patency but TM not well visualised) 3) Mild (patent canal with good TM visibility)</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 days after the date first seen in emergency and enrolled which will be the day of treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>aural fullness / blockage. Patients are asked to rate the degree of aural fullness/blockage on a numerical scale on each day on a provided diary containing a visual analogue scale (in similar fashion to the pain measurement)</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruited from patients presenting to emergency department for primary treatment of acute otitis externa
After obtaining informed consent, participants are given either placebo or treatment medication in a randomised fashion blind to the prescriber and dispenser. Each patient will receive a standardised local treatment which is the usual typical commonly practiced treatment that involves aural toileting, placement of a wick sponge into the ear and antibiotic/steroid ear drops. He/she is then given a separate 'trial script'. The trial script will be reviewed by a pharmacist and assigned a trial number which will be recorded with the patient detail in the data base. This trial number will be randomly picked but will be assigned to either placebo drug or steroid. Prescribing doctor and receiving participants will be blind to this allocation and drug choice.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random allocation of trial number given to each participants. This number will identify the specific medication given (placebo vs. steroid) and will be revealed to the researcher at the conclusion of the trial. This number will be generated using a standard computerised sequence generation software employed by our pharmacy department.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Otitis externa is a common ear condition. Also known as a swimmers ear, it often causes painful swelling of the external ear canal and may lead to sensation of blockage as well as hearing loss. It is primarily an inflammatory disease with infective component which can be bacterial or fungal in nature. Risk factors include compulsive scratching of the ear, swimming, hearing aid use and use of cotton buds. Otitis externa is typically treated with antibiotic/steroid ear drops but it is common for patients to experience symptoms of otitis externa such as pain for many days. Given that otitis externa is primarily inflammatory in nature, we propose that if patients are given a 3 day course of oral steroid tablets (anti-inflammtory drugs commonly used in many medical conditions) in addition to ear drops, it may speed up the recovery and reduce the total number of days during which patients would experience symptoms especially pain. This study would be a double-blinded and randomised-control trial in nature, meaning that both treating doctors and participating patients will not know which treatment has been given (i.e. treatment drug vs. placebo), thereby increasing the validity of the trial outcome.</summary>
