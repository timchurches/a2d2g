  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: An exercise-based injury prevention program completed two times per week for an eight-week period. Each session will last approximately 20 minutes and be conducted at the beginning of a normal cricket training session, in place of a usual warm-up. All sessions will be held at the participants regular training venue.

The sessions will begin with a dynamic warm-up which will involve a series of running drills. Players will then undertake a number of exercises to improve; shoulder muscle strength (external shoulder rotation with theraband), trunk extensor endurance (static trunk extension holds), hip adductor strength (theraband hip adduction), hamstring strength (hamstring lowering) and dynamic neuromuscular control (single leg balance and jumping/landing drills). 

The eight-week intervention period will be divided into three stages; stage 1 (weeks 1-2), stage 2 (weeks 3-5), and stage 3 (weeks 6-8). The exercises will become more challenging (addition of repetitions, increase in theraband resistance, and more dynamic exercise positions) as the stages progress. Expected session RPE for each stage is as follows; stage 1  RPE 5-6/10, stage 2  RPE 6-7/10, stage 3  RPE 7-8/10. 

Adherence will be monitored for each exercise session and a score appointed to each participant after each session. A score of 3 will be award if all exercises are completed, 2 if all but one of the exercises are completed, 1 if more than 2 exercises are not completed and, 0 if no exercises are completed. 

All exercise sessions will be supervised by an Accredited Exercise Scientist.

    <statisticalmethods>Cohens f effect sizes were calculated for each of the primary dependent variables in the study. The smallest identified Cohens f effect size, which was calculated by using the smallest detectable difference for the Star Excursion Balance Test and the average standard deviations for this test when performed by cricketers, was then input into GPower (3.1.9.2). With a error probability set at 0.05, beta error probability set at 0.80 and a Cohens F effect size of  0.247, a sample size of n=36 was estimated. The clustering effect was then accounted for using an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.05 from a previous study and this increased the required sample size to n=64. A further 12 subjects where then added to account for an attrition rate of approximately 20%, resulting in an estimated sample size of n=76

A linear mixed model will be utilised to compare between the two groups with statistical significance set at p&lt;0.05.  A linear mixed model will be utilised to enable the model to acount for the clustering due to the block randomisation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sporting injuries cost the Australian community approximately $1.65 billion annually and are the most common form of injury sustained by adolescent individuals. Severe sporting injuries can have serious health repercussions for young people and lead to the development of osteoarthritis and low back pain (LBP) later in life. Injury in the adolescent years may also discourage future sports participation and lead to physical inactivity, a major risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and various forms of cancer. Sporting injuries can also increase the risk of future sports-related injury, decrease individual/team performance and negatively impact psychology.

In the sport of cricket, fast bowlers sustain the most injuries, some of which can be severe and result in a large loss of playing time. Various risk factors for injury have been identified in cricket pace bowlers however, limited research has attempted to examine if these risk factors can be modified. This study will therefore attempt to employ an exercise-based intervention to modify known risk factors for injury in cricket pace bowlers.

Hypothesis: It is hypothesised that the exercised-based injury prevention program utilised in this study will successfully modify a range of risk factors for injury in adolescent pace bowlers. The control group may show pre/post-test changes however, these changes are expected to be significantly smaller to those seen in the intervention group</summary>
