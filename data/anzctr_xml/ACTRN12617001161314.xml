  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients presenting with pathologies of the shoulder or knee and treated by specialist orthopaedic surgeon. 
Follow-up protocols will be unchanged from the surgeons usual clinical practice for the procedures being monitored. That is, no special treatment will be assigned to the participating patient. At the time of surgery, operative details will be added to the database. The database allows the extraction of patient information that allows research to be conducted. Baseline clinical measurements and outcomes scores (identified in this trial) will be collected up to the time periods identified below.

1. Patients diagnosed with either a recent shoulder dislocation or clinically defined glenohumeral instability: Treated with non-operative management or surgical stabilisation. Followed for a duration of 2 years.

2. Patients diagnosed with rotator cuff pathology (tendinopathy; tear): Treated with non-operative management or surgical repair. Followed for a duration of 5 years.

3. Patients diagnosed with glenohumeral arthritis of any aetiology: Treated with non-operative management, arthroscopic surgery or total shoulder arthroplasty. Followed for a duration of 4 years.

4. Patients diagnosed with acute fracture of the humerus (including associated glenohumeral dislocation): Treated with non-operative management, internal fixation or total shoulder arthroplasty. Followed for a duration of 2 years.

5. Patients diagnosed with knee arthritis of any aetiology: Treated surgically (total joint arthroplasty). Followed for a duration of 5 years.

6. Patients diagnosed with either a recent ACL Rupture or clinically defined knee instability: Treated with surgical reconstruction. Followed for a duration of 5 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of patients that are deemed a "failure to cure" following definitive treatment 

Insufficient improvement in patient reported outcome measures (function or pain) - Based on secondary outcomes identified and matched to the specific cohort. eg. A CS score with a MCID of 10.4 for rotator cuff repair; 
adverse findings on post-treatment medical imaging - determined by the reviewing surgeon based on imaging secondary outcomes identified; 
positive signs of instability, weakness or other primary pathology during clinical follow-up - as determined by the reviewing surgeon based on strength and instability tests identified as secondary outcomes;
failure to improve shoulder or knee range of motion - as determined by the reviewing surgeon based on range of motion tests identified as secondary outcomes.</outcome>
