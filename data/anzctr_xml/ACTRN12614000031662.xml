  <interventions>
    <interventions>The detection of health problems before they become severe will enable intervention and support to be provided at an early stage. The Brief Intervention (BI), based on Motivational Interviewing (MI) principles, will be designed to encourage and motivate study participants to seek and obtain further assistance for their psychological needs which may improve health and prevent further deterioration. The MI intervention is designed to be pragmatic in that the MI will be necessarily tailored to each participants individual circumstances. Following recruitment, all participants will be provided with 'standard care' (i.e. usual care from their ED admittance). Those participants who have been randomised into the intervention group,  the BI will be delivered by telephone interview 48-96 hours after the participants ED attendance, with a booster MI of three telephone calls during the two week period following the initial BI. The initial MI and the three subsequent MIs are each expected to be 60 minutes in length. (approx 4 hours total for each study participant)

Follow up of all participants will occur at one, three, six and twelve months by telephone contact. Pre and post-intervention measures will be used to assess mental health and well-being, subjective quality of life (SQOL); and intervention based outcomes including motivation and confidence, healthcare-seeking behaviour and appropriate health service utilisation.  

Motivational interviewing (MI) is client-centred, directed therapy, which prepares individuals to become more receptive to change by exploring dissonance in the perceived benefits and costs of behaviours. Its central principal is that motivation to change should be elicited from people, not somehow imposed on them. MI is non-confrontational, assumes equity in the client counselor relationship, emphasises the clients right to define their own problems and to choose how to deal with them. The counselor uses empathetic listening to minimise resistance and increase motivation for change. Motivation is viewed as a state of readiness to change which fluctuates and can be influenced by others. The stages of change model have proved useful for the understanding and conduct of a motivational interviewing session. MI is particularly useful for working with clients who are ambivalent, resistant or reluctant to change. All change is preceded by some degree of ambivalence. 

When using an interview technique these components are applied by: exploration of the persons thoughts about the issue e.g. feeling depressed or stressed; use of reflective listening; showing respect and willingness to understand; giving relevant and accurate health information and providing explanations; helping to clarify personal goals or role in the community; avoiding argument; and helping people to look at their behaviour and how it impacts on others.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will have usual care, i.e. the necessary treatment from their emergency department attendance and no study intervention of motivational interviewing

For all participants, follow up will occur at one, three, six and twelve months by telephone contact. Pre and post-intervention measures will be used to assess mental health and well-being, subjective quality of life (SQOL); and intervention based outcomes including motivation and confidence, healthcare-seeking behaviour and appropriate health service utilisation.  </comparator>

      <outcome>Reduced use of acute services, such as emergency departments. This will be measured at the follow up time points. Questions will be based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics national health surveys: health related actions from the National Health Survey; and health care utilisation from the National Health and Well Being surveys 2007.</outcome>

    <concealment>All adult patients presenting to the ED during specified data collection periods will be screened to participate in the study. Those that meet the screening criteria will be allocated to the relevant study arm (see below), which includes a control group. Based on psychological distress assessment, consenting ED patients will be categorised into 3 initial groups; those with: I) Mild and moderate psychological distress II) Low psychological distress. Subsequently, group I will be randomly allocated to receive either the MI or usual care (usual care does not involve BI or MI). A randomised sample will be selected from group II, and will represent a ‘non-stress’ population control group. Thus, there will be three arms to the study: Group IX. Mild/moderate psychological distress score BI plus usual care Group IO. Mild/moderate psychological distress score Usual care Group IIO.Low psychological distress score Usual care Allocation concealment: Simple randomisation with an experimental to control ratio of 1:1. Sealed opaque envelopes will be used rather than a remote service to simplify procedures in a busy setting. Envelopes will be prepared in advance by an independent team using random number tables which will be generated by an independent random number generator. Participants randomly select an envelope, the contents of which indicate their assigned condition (standard care, or intervention). It is not possible to blind the study participants or those administering the intervention to group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Methods used to randomise participants into treatment and control groups will be done using opaque envelopes.

    <statisticalmethods>sample size: There is a limited amount of published data regarding the ideal size for pilot studies and it has been commented that it seems that sample calculations may not be required for this type of study. An audit of the registered trails found that the median sample size per arm for pilot studies was 30 (range from 8 to 114). Based on this evidence we will recruit the median sample of 30 participants per arm, n=90.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mental health (MH) problems are a major public health concern. Because the prevalence of MH issues is higher in the Emergency Department (ED) than the general population norm, the ED is a potentially effective (but neglected) setting to target these issues. Detection of mental health problems before they become severe will enable intervention and support to be provided at an early stage, which may improve health and prevent further deterioration. The proposed study focuses primarily on participants with mild and moderate levels of psychological distress as identified by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scales and will exclude those with severe levels of psychological distress as this may indicate an existing mental disorder. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that, compared to patients who receive standard care i.e. no BI, patients who receive early BI (MI and MI follow-up) will report: 1) reduced levels of depression, anxiety and stress; 2) higher levels of motivation to self-manage health needs; 3) increased (appropriate) healthcare-seeking behaviours; and 4) improved quality of life.</summary>
