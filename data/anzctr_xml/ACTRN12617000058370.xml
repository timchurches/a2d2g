  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a seven-week training program where participants train at the lab three days per week (twenty sessions; 45 minute duration each). Exercises performed are three sets of bicep curls (50% 1 RM) performed by the dominant arm followed by four sets of bilateral knee flexion and leg extension exercises (30% 1 RM). The leg exercises are performed with pressurised cuffs applied to the most proximal portion of the upper legs to restrict blood-flow to the working muscles. These cuffs are inflated to a pressure equal to 60% of the pressure required to completely occlude blood-flow through the legs.
Participants are supervised/monitored throughout all training sessions by an exercise physiologist to ensure safety and adherence to the protocol.
Attendance is registered for all training sessions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study comprises part of a PhD project.
It aims to investigate whether light-load blood-flow restriction training in the legs can improve the muscle size of an active arm. This will be compared with the non-active arm of these participants that perform blood-flow restriction in the legs as well as either arm of participants who performed traditional light-load strength training. The purpose is to investigate whether muscle size adaptations are transferable between limbs. This will be investigated in a seven week strength training study in participants that perform either blood-flow restriction or traditional strength training in the legs.</summary>
