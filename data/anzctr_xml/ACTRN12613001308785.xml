  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: the experimental group receives instructions to perform at "home" oral hygiene twice a day, for 2 weeks, using a toothbrush associated with a new instrument "the digital brush"(consisting on a gauze soaked with chlorhexidine and rolled up on the finger). Oral 
hygiene conditions of participants will be evaluted after 2 weeks.
Details: The gauze contains 0,12% chlorhexidine; a) participants rolled up the gauze on the index finger, using rotative mouvements from gums to teeth; the gauze was used only once; b) duration of 30 sec.; c) adherence is improved with 1-instructions made to the participants; 2-explanatory demonstration of its use during the first appointment; 3-daily patient diary.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Arm: the control group receives instructions to perform at "home" oral hygiene twice a day, using a toothbrush associated with a  chlorhexidine mouthwash (used after toothbrushing for rinsing the mouth). Oral hygiene conditions of participants will be evaluted after 2 weeks.
Details: 1.Participants of the control group use 5ml of 0,12% chlorhexidine mouthrinse; 2) for 20 sec.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The main outcome was the difference across groups between the mean change in plaque score from baseline to the end of the follow-up. According to a previous study (Overholser et al., J Clin Periodontol 1990), the expected reduction was 2.5+- 1, in
both groups. However,the expected mean score at the end of the follow-up will be 0.5+-0.6 for mouthrinse group and 1.0+-0.6 for experimental gauze group. Using an unpaired t-test,
and assuming an a-error alpha of 0.05, and an expected withdrawal/dropout rate of 5%, a minimum of 26 subjects per
group were requested to achieve an 80% statistical power.</statisticalmethods>
