  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm One: Cloth or material mask
In this trial, participants will be asked to wear the mask continuously on every shift (around 8 hours) for a four week period. They are to remove the mask when: they exit the department/ward or when they enter the tea room for a break

Arm two: Surgical mask 
Surgical masks-are loose-fitting facial coverings that are designed to prevent wound contamination in the patient from the cough or exhaled secretions of the physician, nurse or other healthcare worker. 
In this trial, participants will be asked to wear the mask continuously on every shift (around 8 hours) for a four week period. They are to remove the mask when: they exit the department/ward or when they enter the tea room for a break</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm three: Control
Participants will continue to use the infection control methods including the use of masks, that are standard in the ward/department. Detailed information will be collected regarding the use of personal protective equipment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Two symptoms, systemic (fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache) or respiratory (cough, sore throat, sneezing, rinorrhoea, shortness of breath), at least one of which must be a respiratory symptom. A standard list of symptoms will be used to assess the outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed (by interviewing the participant) on a daily basis over a five week period. Time to development of outcome will be measured.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>Laboratory confirmed bacterial respiratory infection (any). The testing will be done only if the budget allows</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compliance with mask use</outcome>
      <timepoint>A diary card with tick boxes for the mask use will be given to each subject, which they will carry with them during the day. They will tick the responses after each shift. Adherence to wearing the mask will be monitored by use of diary cards which will be returned to researchers on a weekly basis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence,  relationship of compliance to risk perception and barriers to compliance in HCWs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be surveyed at the end of the four week period to gain further insights into adherence and other issues around the use of masks including adverse effects.  We will specifically ask about pain, discomfort, skin necrosis, difficulty breathing, headaches, adherence to infection control protocol associated with face mask use (hand hygiene, face touching etc) and perceptions about patient communication issues associated with mask wearing. A random sample of subjects will be selected for in-depth qualitative interviews.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A prospective, three-armed cluster randomized trial of mask use in health care workers (HCWs) to determine the effectiveness/efficacy of two different kinds of face masks (cloth masks and surgical masks) during the influenza season on the transmission of seasonal influenza and other respiratory infectious agents. Other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses etc are also associated with outbreaks of acute respiratory disease. Health care workers (HCWs) from the emergency departments, respiratory wards, pediatric wards and infectious disease wards of 15 major hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam will be recruited. These wards are selected because they are a setting in which repeated and multiple exposures to viral respiratory infections are present for staff. Wards/departments will be allocated to one of the three study arms. Participants from the two mask arms will be provided with one of two types of masks(depending on the arm to which the ward/department they work in has been randomised) to be worn for four weeks when working on the ward. Participants in the third arm will continue to carry out there standard practice. All participants will be followed up for five weeks (the four weeks of wearing the masks and an extra week of non-mask wearing)</summary>
