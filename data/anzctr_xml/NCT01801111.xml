  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter phase I/II study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of RO5424802 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have ALK mutation and
      failed crizotinib treatment. In Part 1, cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of
      RO5424802 orally twice daily. In Part 2, patients will receive the recommended phase II dose
      of RO5424802 as determined in Part 1. Treatment will continue in Part 1 and Part 2 on the
      same dose until disease progression. In Part 3, following disease progression, patients
      without EGFR mutation will be offered continued treatment with RO5424802, patients with EGFR
      mutations will be offered a combination of RO5424802 and Tarceva (erlotinib).</summary>
