  <interventions>
    <interventions>MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY (MRS)
This is an MRI scan, where the patient lies flat on a platform which is moved through the MRI tunnel. The procedure takes approximately 30 minutes and is carried out by the radiographer. The test is performed at baseline, and follow-up MRS is performed at 1 year after bariatric surgery. Patients will be seen in clinic prior to their scans to arrange a suitable time. Attendance will be checked by the study investigator and rescheduled if required. 

TRANSIENT ELASTOGRAPHY/FIBROSCAN
This test looks at liver stiffness. Patients are scheduled for 3 scans during their year long follow-up (baseline, 3 and 12 months after bariatric surgery). The scan is performed in an outpatient clinic, with a probe on the right upper abdomen, similar to an ultrasound. The procedure takes approximately 10 minutes. It is not painful and there are no risks. The procedure is performed by trained Gastroenterologists. Attendance will be checked by the study investigator and rescheduled if required.

SERUM BIOMARKERS
Blood tests are taken from the patient at 0, 1, 3 and 12 months after bariatric surgery at their scheduled outpatient appointments. Approximately 20-30ml of blood will be taken at each time point. Tests of interest include routine blood tests, as well as the novel biomarker TNFSF14 (LIGHT) and other circulating cytokines. 

BARIATRIC SURGERY
Surgery will occur as planned by their treating team. </interventions>
    <comparator>LIVER BIOPSY - INTRAOPERATIVE
Patients who are already undergoing elective bariatric surgery will be invited to participate. They will undergo bariatric surgery regardless of participation in this study. The liver biopsy will be taken during bariatric surgery under vision by their treating surgeon. Core biopsies as well as a small wedge biopsy will be taken. This amounts to a total of less than 1cm^3 of liver tissue. A liver biopsy is usually only performed during bariatric surgery if there are (1) pre-operative indications of liver disease or (2) intraoperative suspicion of liver disease. Not all patients would normally have routine liver biopsies. 
The liver biopsies will be used for standard histopathology reporting (quantification of steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation), as well as processed to look specifically for immune cell infiltrates characterised by markers such as CD4, CD8 and LIGHT. 

LIVER BIOPSY - PERCUTANEOUS
Patients with &gt;33% steatosis, any inflammation or any fibrosis will be offered a follow-up liver biopsy at 12 months. They will be seen prior to this to reconsent for the procedure. 
This will be performed under local anaesthetic in the Radiology Department by an experienced radiologist under ultrasound guidance. Two to three core biopsies will be taken.  They will be sent for routine histopathology. 

FAT BIOPSY
Visceral and subcutaneous fat will be taken during the operation from the omentum around the area of surgery, and from the incisions in the abdomen. This will be for analysis of inflammatory/immune mediators and cytokines. 
Approximately 1cm cube of tissue will be taken from each of the adipose regions (visceral and subcutaneous). </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective cohort study for patients undergoing bariatric surgery who have risk factors for NAFLD, to investigate efficacy of non-invasive tests in diagnosing and monitoring NAFLD.  
Patients who are already scheduled for bariatric surgery who fit criteria for likely NAFLD will be recruited  to undergo an intraoperative liver and adipose tissue biopsy. Each participant will be required to attend regular follow-up appointments (0, 1, 3, and 12 months), blood tests (0, 1, 3 and 12 months), FibroScan (0, 3 and 12 months) and MRS (0 and 12 months) over a 12-month study period. Patients with significant liver disease on initial biopsy (NAFLD activity score (NAS) greater than 4, any fibrosis, any inflammation or greater than 33% steatosis) will be offered a follow-up liver biopsy at 12-months post-operatively. 
Liver tissues and serum will be investigated for markers that may indicate disease presence and prognosis.</summary>
