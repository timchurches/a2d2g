  <interventions>
    <interventions>All the patients enrolled in the study must be intermittently self catheterising using the conventional female length silicone catheter.

This study is going to compare the use of a redesigned surgical stainless steel catheter to the conventional silicone catheter for intermittent self catheterising.

The patients enrolled in the study will use the surgical stainless steel catheter for 12 weeks.

The surgical stainless steel catheter will be used at the same frequency as the standard silicone catheter for self catheterising. 

The surgical stainless steel catheter is a multiple use. The same catheter will be used during the 12 week trial. Patients clean the surgical stainless steel catheter with tepid water following use. No sterilising equipment is needed. The surgical stainless steel catheter has been assessed by microbiology. The assessment involed contaminating the catheter with infected urine. A swab was taken and confirmed the microbe. The catheter was cleaned with tepid tap water and the catheter was swabbed again. This swab was negative and confirmed no growth following cleaning of the catheter with tepid tap water. 

The conventional silicone catheter is also multiple use. If a patient does not have a urinary tract infection, the catheter is replaced daily. If the patient has a urinary tract infection the catheter is replaced after every use.

There is one treatment group and the patients act as their own controls due to the small sample size</interventions>
    <comparator>No control due to small sample size. The incidence of urinary tract infection over a 12 week period using the surgical stainless steel catheter will be compared to incidence of urinary tract infection during a retrospective 12 week period using the conventional silicone catheter.

The incidence of infection would have been documented for the retrospective 12 week period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of urinary tract infection. 

If a patient is symptomatic during the 12 week study period, a urine sample is obtained for microscopy and culture to confirm the infection, then treated accordingly</outcome>
      <timepoint>At any point during the 12 week study period if the patient is symptomatic</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the potential cost reduction in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections during the 12 week trial period.

Cost:
1. Antibiotics - cost of the antibiotic will be determined retrospectively at the end of the study period. The type of antibiotic used and duration will be obtained from patient diaries, general practitioner records, continence clinic records. The hospital pharmacy will then be contacted and asked to provide the total cost of the patients antibiotic treatment.
2. Mid stream urine analysis and culture. The number of mid stream urines will be calculated at the end of the 12 week study period and the labs will be contact to provide a total cost for the mid stream urine analysis
3. General Practitioner visit as required. The number of General Practitioner visits will be calculated at the end of the 12 week study period. The patients medical centre will be contacted and ask to provide a information of the total cost of the general practitioner visits during the 12 week study period.
4. 3x Continence clinic visit. Free of charge to the patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of 12 week study period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparing the cost of the Silicone Catheters compared to the Surgical Stainless Steel Catheter and the relative ancillary costs.

Costs:
1. Cost of silicone catheter is $0.36 per catheter
 - $672.00 per year if self catheterising 4 times per day
2. One off charge for the stainless steel catheter $150

For this study the patient will be asked to keep a diary and document how many times they replaced their silicone catheters during the 12 week study period. The total cost will be calculated at the end of the 12 week study period</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of 12 week study period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the ease of use and potential change in quality of life using the SF 36 quality of life questionnaire and one-on-one patient interviews</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and end of 12 week study period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the ease of cleaning and storage of the catheter and associated equipment. This will be assessed using the SF 36 quality of life questionaire and one-on-one patient interviews.

The catheter has been sujected to microbiology testing following routine washing with tepid water. No other agent is required. 

Storage in a zip lock plastic bag is advised.</outcome>

    <summary>This study aims to investigate the incidence of urinary tract infection in people who have a neurogenic bladder with a post void residual volume of greater than 100mls who have to self catheterise to empty their bladder properly. This study will compare the incidence of urinary tract infection using the redesigned surgical stainless steel catheter to the conventional silicone catheter. It will also assess the potential improvement in quality of life and ease of use and storage.</summary>
