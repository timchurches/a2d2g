Treatment: drugs: Bevacizumab
Participants will be administered bevacizumab at a dose of 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) every 14 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for a maximum of 52 cycles, whichever occurs first.

Treatment: drugs: Folinic acid
Participants will receive folinic acid 400 mg/m^2 IV infusion over 2 hours on Day 1 of every cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or at the maximum of 52 cycles, whichever occurs first.

Treatment: drugs: MEGF0444A
Participants will be administered MEGF0444A at a fixed dose of 400 milligrams (mg) IV on Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed by subsequent doses of 400 mg every 14 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for a maximum of 52 cycles, whichever occurs first.

Treatment: drugs: Oxaliplatin
Participants will receive oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 IV infusion over 90 minutes on Day 1 of every cycle for a maximum of 8 cycles.
