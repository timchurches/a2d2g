  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Twice daily oral amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (22.5 mg/kg/dose) for 11 days 
Arm 2: Twice daily oral amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (22.5 mg/kg/dose) for 3 days  followed by oral placebo for 8 days

These treatments are administered after 48-72 hours of IV penicillin/ampicillin, the children are afebrile, with improved respiratory symptoms and signs, SpO2 &gt;92% in air and are ready to be switched to oral antibiotics</interventions>
    <comparator>All children receives at least 5 days of antibiotics (at least 2 days of IV plus 3 days oral). The control group receives placebo for the duration on the intervention period (8 days) whilst the active group continues on amoxycillin-clavulanic acid for the intervention period. Both medications for the study are in suspension form and the placebo has been specifically manufactured by the Institute of Drug Therapy (Melbourne, Australia) which has the same taste, appearance and smell.</comparator>
