    <concealment>Donors will be screened at interview to ensure suitable for study and consented. They must be eligible to donate whole blood. After consent donor will proceed to give samples for estimation of  Hameoglobin,sTfR (soluble transferrin receptor) and serum ferritin levels. Allocation of treatment is by central randomization by computer off site</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be carried out by Trident Clinical Research Pty Ltd. The sequence of allocation of carbonyl iron or placebo to donors will be assertained via a computerised randomisation program. Donors will be assigned a numbered packet sequentially on enrolment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objectives of this trial are to determine whether a post donation 8 week course of 45 mg elemental carbonyl iron in females aged 18 -45:
-is effective in replacing iron lost as a consequence of blood donation,
- improves the donors eligibility to donate at their subsequent 3 monthly visit as determined by their capillary haemoglobin level,
and is well tolerated</summary>
