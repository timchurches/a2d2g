  <interventions>
    <interventions>A COPD self-treatment approach for COPD patients with multiple diseases. The intervention group patients will learn to treat their COPD exacerbations and/or flare-ups of comorbidities with the help of an action plan linked to a daily symptom diary, which they will be asked to complete for a 12-month period. The self-treatment training starts after inclusion and consists of 4 sessions which are guided by the trial nurses: two 2.5-hour group sessions at week 1 and 3 and two individual 1.5-hour sessions at week 2 and 4. Besides self-treatment, the program will be aimed at knowledge about COPD and comorbidities, immunisations, inhaler techniques, physical fitness, relaxation and breathing exercises. One, four, and eight months after completion of the training, the trial nurse will contact the patient by phone, to reinforce self-management skills. Trial nurse act as case-managers throughout the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control patients will receive two 30-minute group meetings held on two consecutive weeks (week 1 and 2) during which they will be trained in diary use. Control patients will be asked to complete the daily symptoms diaries for the whole study-period (12 months), to mail the completed diaries back to the study office, and to continue with their usual care providers when they need assistance for any worsening of their respiratory or other symptoms. In lieu of the self-management sessions and follow-up phone calls provided to the intervention group, these control subjects will receive five phone calls that will only provide questions and feedback regarding the diaries: in week 3, 4, 8, 20 and 36.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of COPD exacerbation days measured by daily symptom diary.

The start of the exacerbation will be defined as a clear negative change from baseline in at least two major symptoms (sputum color, sputum production, breathlessness) or one major and one minor symptom (coughing, wheezing, fever) from baseline, for at least two consecutive days. The day that the exacerbation is resolved will be defined as the first day of: 1) three successive days that the patient has returned to his normal health state; or 2) seven consecutive days on which patients continuously report no or only a slight increase in
symptoms compared to baseline, with no fever or change in sputum colour.</outcome>

      <outcome>Health care utilisations for COPD, all cause respiratory, cardiac and diabetes: GP visits, specialist consultations and other services, number of hospitalizations, number of in-hospital days, number of emergency hospital presentations, number of days spent in intensive care facility.

Australia: data on the frequency and duration of hospital emergency department, in-patient admissions and out-patient activity will be obtained from medical records, and PBS and MBS utilisation data will be sought from Medicare to evaluate cost-effectiveness (following patient or proxy consent).

Netherlands: For economic analysis, data regarding health care resource use (e.g. out-patient visits, hospitalisations and GP visits) will be retrospectively collected for all patients using the hospital and  GP databases. Medication details for all patients will be retrospectively collected from the pharmacists.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>COPD is a leading cause of death in Australia and its prevalence is increasing globally. The majority of disease burden and costs in COPD are due to treatment of exacerbations, with hospitalisations being the major component. Almost all comorbidities exist more frequently in COPD patients compared to matched elderly populations. One third of COPD patients admitted to hospital have at least four coded comorbidities, and these add to the length of hospital stay. In selected populations of COPD patients, training in the use of COPD action plans reduces COPD exacerbation severity, emergency department visits, hospitalisations and health costs and improves health status. However, overlap in symptoms of COPD and comorbidities complicate the use of COPD action plans in the large group of patients with comorbidities. For example, in a COPD patient with comorbid cardiovascular disease, worsening of his dyspnoea can relate to either disease. Use of only a COPD action plan could lead to incorrect actions and/or delay of proper treatment. We have developed self-treatment training with ongoing nurse support for complex COPD patients. Feedback to patients from nurses is vital to optimize use of action plans. We will enrol 300 COPD patients (150 in each of Australia and the Netherlands) with at least one of the following comorbidity: ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, or anxiety/depression. All patients will complete daily symptom diaries for 12 months. Control patients will receive usual care and training in diary completion. Intervention patients will be trained in the use of individualized action plans. We hypothesize that this novel self-treatment strategy will reduce exacerbation severity, hospitalisation stay and costs, and improve quality of life.</summary>
