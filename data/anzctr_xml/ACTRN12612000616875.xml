  <interventions>
    <interventions>To compare the effect of music to the effect of a reading group on disruptive behaviours. The intervention activities are, i) participants were engaged in a group music making activity through singing, instrumental performance and where appropriate, movement or ii) engaged in a group reading activity conducted in a separate room to where the music program. Both activities occurred three times a week for 40 minutes for eight weeks. On completion, participants were exposed to the opposite activity for another eight weeks. A five-week washout period was included between cross-over to reduce potential carryover effects.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study investigated the effect that participation in a 40-minute live music program, three times a week for eight weeks, had on agitation, emotions and quality of life in older people with dementia. A randomized cross-over design, with music and reading control groups, was employed.</summary>
