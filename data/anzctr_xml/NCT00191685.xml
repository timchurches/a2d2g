  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal treatment strategy for MDD patients
      with melancholic features who do not respond to a standard daily dose. This study will allow
      investigators to mimic standard clinical practice. During the first 2 weeks of treatment,
      clinical evaluation of individual patient tolerability and efficacy will enable the dose of
      duloxetine to be adjusted. Patients allocated to the Flex group may have their daily dose of
      duloxetine adjusted in the attempt to elicit a clinical response.</summary>
