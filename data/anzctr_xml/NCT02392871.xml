Experimental: Radiotherapy - Palliative radiotherapy in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib Eligible subjects are patients who have been on dabrafenib and trametinib for more than 2 weeks, as the current standard management for advanced stage melanoma.
Palliative RT will be delivered to symptomatic or bulky (&gt;2cm) soft tissue, nodal or bony metastases concurrently with dabrafenib and trametinib. Up to 3 areas of disease can be irradiated at the same time.
Following RT, dabrafenib and trametinib alone will be continued until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.


Treatment: other: Palliative radiotherapy


Treatment: drugs: Dabrafenib and trametinib (combination)
Patients should be taking dabrafenib and trametinib for at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment into the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the side effects and safety, and effectiveness of
      combining dabrafenib and trametinib with radiotherapy.

      Previous and ongoing clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of
      combining both dabrafenib and trametinib compared with dabrafenib alone. This has led to the
      approval for the use of both drugs in combination in people with metastatic melanoma with the
      BRAF mutation. Melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may also benefit from
      radiotherapy to help reduce symptoms from melanoma. Previous studies have shown that melanoma
      may be sensitive to radiotherapy and that it can help to improve quality of life.

      The intention of the CombiRT study is to establish if dabrafenib, trametinib and radiotherapy
      combined is a safe and effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.</summary>
