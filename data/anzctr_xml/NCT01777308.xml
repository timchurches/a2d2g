Experimental: Menitorix Group - Subjects who were primed with Menitorix (Hib-MenC-TT) + Priorix (MMR) vaccines in the primary study HIB-MENC-TT-016 (NCT00326118) received one dose of Nimenrix (MenACWY-TT) booster vaccine at Month 72 post primary vaccination (booster visit 1).
The MenACWY-TT vaccine was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.

Experimental: Meningitec + Hiberix Group - Subjects who were primed with Meningitec (MCC) + Hiberix (Hib) + Priorix (MMR) vaccine in the primary study HIB-MENC-TT-016 (NCT00326118) received one dose of Nimenrix (MenACWY-TT) booster vaccine at Month 72 post primary vaccination (booster visit 1).
The MenACWY-TT vaccine was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.


Other interventions: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine GSK134612

             during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone =
             0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period
             starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after the study vaccine dose, with the
             exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine which can be administered at any
             time during the study according to the local recommendations.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine, and history of serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) following the

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including GBS. History of a simple,
             single febrile seizure is permitted.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature = 37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or
                  = 38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this
                  study will be oral.

               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
                  infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the study vaccination or planned administration during the booster
             vaccination phase of the study (i.e. between Visit 1 and Visit 2) and within 3 months
             preceding the blood sampling at Visit 3.

        The following criteria should be checked for the long-term persistence phase at two years
        after booster vaccination (Visit 3):

        In case an exclusion criterion becomes applicable, the subject will not enter the long-term
        follow-up and the reason will be documented.

          -  Previous administration of a meningococcal vaccine with the exception of the
             meningococcal vaccination given in the primary study and the booster vaccination in
             this particular study.

          -  History of meningococcal disease.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of a
      booster dose of GSK Biologicals' MenACWY-TT vaccine administered at 6 years post-primary
      vaccination with either GSK Biologicals' Hib-MenC-TT vaccine (Menitorix) or Hiberix and
      Meningitec, in healthy subjects aged 12-18 months at primary vaccination and to evaluate the
      long-term antibody persistence at 2 years after MenACWY-TT booster vaccination.

      This is an extension study of the Hib-MenC-TT-016 study (NCT number: NCT00326118).</summary>
