  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  The patient has a history of ECH according to the International Classification of
             Headache Disorders - 3 beta criteria (Headache Classification Committee of the IHS

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) whose male partners are potentially fertile
             (ie, no vasectomy) must use highly effective birth control methods for the duration of

          -  If a patient is receiving Botox, it should be in a stable dose regimen, considered as
             having =2 cycles of Botox prior to screening. The patient should not receive Botox
             during the run-in period up to the evaluation period (4 weeks) where the primary
             endpoint is evaluated.

             monoclonal antibodies, it has to be confirmed that the patient received placebo in
             order to be eligible for this study.

          -  The patient is an employee of the sponsor/participating study center who is directly
