  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women allocated to the intervention condition receive the 'Beating the Blues before Birth' treatment package, which consists of eight individual cognitive-behavioural therapy sessions with a psychologist (the woman's partner is invited to attend one of the sessions). Sessions are delivered weekly over 8 weeks and are an hour in length.

All women who participate (regardless of allocated condition) receive a clinical assessment with a specialist psychologist, help linking in with appropriate health professionals and support services, a 'community connections' pamphlet that we developed which encourages the use of community supports and includes a list of contacts for appropriate servcies, and an 'Emotional health during pregnancy and early parenthood' booklet from beyondblue.</interventions>
    <comparator>Women allocated to the control condition receive routine primary care in which they will be case managed by their midwife or General Practitioner (GP) over the 8-week period.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression during pregnancy (antenatal depression) is a clinical condition in its own right, which has been under-recognised and is in urgent need of an evidence-based treatment.  This study will evaluate our Beating the Blues before Birth (BBB) program as a treatment for antenatal depression.  It is hypothesised that women receiving the BBB program will report less depression and anxiety at post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up than women in the routine care condition.</summary>
