Treatment: drugs - Antidiabetic background therapy

Experimental: Lixisenatide - Lixisenatide 10 mcg once daily (QD) for 2 weeks, then at a maintenance dose of 20 mcg QD up to Week 24. If the maintenance dose of 20 mcg was not tolerated, dose could be reduced to 10 mcg.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Placebo (matched to lixisenatide) QD for 24 Weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Lixisenatide (AVE0010)
Pharmaceutical form: Solution for injection in pre-filled pen administered 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast in the morning
Route of administration: Subcutaneous injection

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Pharmaceutical form: Solution for injection in pre-filled pen administered 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast in the morning
Route of administration: Subcutaneous injection

Treatment: drugs: Antidiabetic background therapy
Participants received a stable regimen of anti-diabetic background therapy for at least 3 months prior to screening, during the placebo run-in period and the 24 week treatment period. Allowed background antidiabetic therapy included metformin, sulfonylurea (except glibenclamide &gt;10 mg, gliclazide &gt;160 mg), meglitinides (except repaglinide &gt;6 mg), pioglitazone and basal insulin. Insulin glargine, neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin, detemir, lente and ultralente were considered as basal insulin.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change in HbA1c From Baseline to Week 24 - Change in HbA1c was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 24 value. Missing data was imputed using last on-treatment observation carried forward (LOCF). On-treatment period for this efficacy variable was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug up to 14 days after the last dose of study drug. Here, number of participants analyzed=participants with baseline and at least one post-baseline HbA1c assessment during on-treatment period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 24</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in 2-Hour PPG From Baseline to Week 24 - The 2-hour PPG test measured blood glucose 2 hours after eating a liquid standardized breakfast meal. Change in PPG was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 24 value. Missing data was imputed using LOCF.

      <outcome>Change in Average 7-point SMPG Profiles From Baseline to Week 24 - Participants recorded a 7-point plasma glucose profile measured before and 2 hours after each meal and at bedtime three times in a week before baseline, before visit Week 12 and before visit week 26 and the average value across the profiles performed in the week a visit for the 7-time points was calculated. Change in average 7-point SMPG was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 24 value. Missing data was imputed using LOCF.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Requiring Rescue Therapy During 24 Week Treatment Period - Routine fasting SMPG and central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication. If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) were performed. Threshold values - from baseline to Week 8: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L), from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 24: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;9%.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Plasma Glucose Excursions From Baseline to Week 24 - Plasma glucose excursion = 2-hour PPG minus plasma glucose 30 minutes prior to the liquid standardized breakfast meal test, before study drug administration.

Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the participant required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</outcome>

    <summary>Primary objective:

      - To evaluate the effect of lixisenatide versus placebo over a period of 24 weeks on glycemic
      control, as evaluated by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction, in older type 2 diabetes
      participants (T2DM) who are inadequately controlled with their current anti-diabetic
      treatment regimen.

      Main secondary objective:

      - To assess the safety and tolerability of lixisenatide compared to placebo in older T2DM
      participants (including occurrence of documented (Plasma Glucose PG &lt; 60 mg/dL) symptomatic
      hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal side effects).

      Other secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of lixisenatide compared to placebo after 24-week treatment on:

             -  Fasting plasma glucose (FPG);

             -  During liquid standardized breakfast meal challenge test : 2 hour- Postprandial
                Plasma Glucose (PPG) and Plasma Glucose Excursion;

             -  7-point Self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) profile;

             -  Body weight;

             -  Change in total daily dose of basal insulin (if taken);

             -  Percentage of participants requiring rescue therapy

             -  Safety and tolerability;

        -  To assess lixisenatide pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  To assess anti-lixisenatide antibody development.</summary>
