  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major Adverse Event - Composite Major Adverse Event includes hemorrhage, perforation, pulmonary embolism, procedure-related or device-related death, occlusion, significant migration and filter fracture.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful Retrieval - Retrieval attempt describes a procedure in which a physician tried to remove a filter from a patient. A decision to remove a filter was made after determining that the patient no longer required the filter. Retrieval attempts were either successful (i.e., the filter was removed) or unsuccessful (i.e., the filter could not be removed and remained in the patient as a permanent device).</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Time to Retrieval Attempt - Mean time to retrieval describes the average time filters were in place in the study group before a retrieval attempt was made.
