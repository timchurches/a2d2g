  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clearance of AK - The primary response criterion is the clinical and histological clearance of AK at Day 57. Clinical Clearance will be measured by counting AKs, and histological clearance will be by performing a biopsy (result reported as AK or not AK).</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complete clearance of AKs in the Selected Treatment Area - Efficacy in terms of complete clearance of AKs in the STA and histological clearance of pre-identified lesion. AK clearance will be determined by AK count. Clearance of the pre-identified lesion will be assessed by a histopatholgist from a biopsy sample and reported as AK or not AK.</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks</timepoint>
