    <statisticalmethods>Baseline data:
Baseline measures of age, years since onset of menopause, menopausal symptoms, hormone levels, BMI, years of education and scores on the ACE-III and other potentially confounding variables may be added as covariates if they are significantly correlated with the outcome measures.
Pre-supplementation data obtained at the screening/baseline visit 1 and 2 will be used in regression analysis to evaluate the associations between outcome measures. The correlations may include the relationships between cerebrovascular function (arterial stiffness, basal hemodynamics and CVR to hypercapnia, cognitive and photic stimuli) and cognitive performance, clinic BP and AC, 24-ABP, adiposity, physical function, mood, menopausal symptoms, pain, overall wellbeing, cardiometabolic biomarkers, hormonal and plasma resveratrol levels.
Treatment effects:
The primary outcome will be the intra-individual effect of treatment on cognitive performance (sum of Z-scores from all cognitive tests), analysed by ANCOVA (generalized linear model, linear regression with main predictor treatment, and baseline, order of treatment and time since onset of menopause, hormonal levels as covariates, and other covariates as appropriate). False discovery rate estimations will be made to determine the significance of the following secondary outcomes: effect of treatment on CVR to hypercapnia, cognitive and photic stimuli, basal cerebral hemodynamics, performance on individual cognitive tests, bone mineral density, adiposity, clinic BP and AC, 24-ABP, physical function assessments, mood, assessments of menopausal symptoms, pain, quality of life and sleep quality, cardiovascular biomarkers, hormonal and plasma resveratrol levels. The efficacy of resveratrol supplementation on outcome measures will also analysed by ANCOVA in early (&lt;10 years since onset of menopause) and late postmenopausal women.
Changes in cerebrovascular function will be correlated with changes in cognitive and physical functions, mood states, quality of life, menopausal symptoms, sleep quality and pain reduction. Relationships between changes in circulatory and cognitive, anthropometric and mood parameters will be analysed by linear regression with false discovery rate estimations.
Subject Population(s) for Analysis:
Data collected from participants who completed all study time points will be used for per-protocol analysis. An interim analysis using ANCOVA will be performed at the end of the first stage of the crossover (after 12 months) to determine the within-individual treatment changes (post-pre supplementation) between the placebo and resveratrol arm.
Two of the major challenges to any long-term study are the recruitment and retention of eligible volunteers for the duration of the study. A 12-month crossover dietary intervention in overweight adults to assess the effects of a high diary intake had a 49% attrition rate. In our pilot study (H-2015-0002), we failed to detect an acoustic temporal window for TCD assessments in 32% of our cohort. Taken together, we will recruit 170 postmenopausal women for this study. This will provide 80% power at alpha = 0.05, based on the effect size differences of 0.43 to 0.44 in the cognitive and cerebrovascular function outcomes in our pilot study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The decline in estrogen production at menopause heightens a womans risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, hypertension, stroke and dementia. We have now identified postmenopausal women as another vulnerable population at risk of dementia who may also benefit from resveratrol supplementation  a strategy that can be easily incorporated into the daily diet. We aim to gather evidence for the efficacy of vasoactive nutrients in maintaining optimal circulatory function to reduce the risk of developing dementia. Given that resveratrol supplements are available over-the-counter to consumers in Australia, the anticipated outcomes will offer a non-pharmaceutical approach for managing menopause-related symptoms and counteracting accelerated cognitive and physical decline and loss of bone mineral density in women post-menopausally, which can be readily implemented by clinicians and the public. 
We will recruit 170 post-menopausal women aged between 45 and 85 years old. A 24 month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover dietary intervention trial will be conducted at the University of Newcastle. A crossover intervention means that all participants will receive the resveratrol treatment.
The primary objective of the study is to determine in postmenopausal women the ability of resveratrol supplementation for 12 months to improve cognitive function. 
The secondary objectives are:
To determine whether improvements in cognition, mood, overall well-being (sleep quality, menopausal symptoms and pain) and physical function are accompanied by improvements in cerebrovascular responsiveness to cognitive demands, photic stimulation and/or to hypercapnia. 
To determine whether resveratrol supplementation can attenuate global cognitive decline.
To determine whether resveratrol supplementation can change body bone mineral density and body composition. 
To determine the effects of resveratrol supplementation on clinic blood pressure and arterial compliance. 
To determine whether the improvements in the outcomes are related to changes in biomarkers of cardiovascular and bone health, hormone levels and plasma resveratrol concentration.</summary>
