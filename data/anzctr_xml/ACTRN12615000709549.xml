    <interventions>Ambrisentan, endothelin receptor antagonist, oral tablet, 10mg daily

Patients randomised to the ambrisentan arm will be given 10mg of ambrisentan along with standard medical therapy immediately after randomisation. Further doses of ambrisentan will be administered if the standard dosing interval (24 hours) is exceeded between the preceding dose and planned PCI. The total dose of medications given to the patients will be dictated by the number of days between patients' initial presentation and their PCI procedure. There is no set maximum of total dose. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the peri-procedural change in index of microvascular resistance (IMR) as measured by thermodiluation curves. 

Measurement of IMR will be carried out before and after PCI. Before commencement of PCI, patients will receive an intracoronary injection of 200 mcg of glyceryl trinitrate and intra-venous adenosine infusion (140mcg/kg/min) to induce hyperaemia. This is a necessary condition for the accurate measurement of IMR and other physiological parameters as described. 

A Pressurewire-Certus 4 (Radi medical systems) guide-wire will be advanced down the target coronary artery so that the microsensor (3 centimetres from the tip) is well beyond the culprit stenosis and in the distal third of the target artery.   Pressures at the guide catheter tip (Pa) and distal artery (Pd) will be recorded, and three thermodilution curves will be performed to measure the thermodilution-derived mean transit time (Tmn).  These measurements will be used to calculate the index of microvascular resistance (IMR).  The principles of IMR calculation are described below.  The stenting procedure will then proceed as per usual practice. During the first balloon inflation, the coronary wedge pressure (Pw) will be recorded.

Calculation of the IMR requires the use of pressure wire technology which allows the measurement of both flow and temperature in the distal coronary artery.  Pressures are measured in both the proximal (Pa) and distal (Pd) artery through the guide catheter and pressure wire respectively.  Thermodilution techniques are used to determine the thermodilution-derived mean transit time (Tmn), which is an inverse correlate of coronary blood flow.  The IMR is adjusted for the presence of collateral flow using the coronary wedge pressure (Pw) which is the pressure in the distal vessel during balloon inflation proximal to the microsensor.  The index of microcirculatory resistance is calculated using the following equation:

			
IMR =  Pa x Tmn x (Pd-Pw)/(Pa-Pw)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurement of IMR will be carried out immediately before and 5 minutes after the end of procedure. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in myocardial strain. 
Myocardial strain will be measured echocardiographically and analysed offline with Philips QLAB software version 10.  
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The strain measurement will be made at the time of randomisation, immediately (&lt;2 hours) after the procedure and within 1 day following the end of the procedure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in neutrophil function

Myeloperoxidase and elastase activity will be used as measures of neutrophil function. 

Plasma will be collected and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. The analyses will be performed in batch to ensure consistency. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients' bloods will be collected peripherally and from the culprit coronary artery immediately before and after the PCI, transported in ice to the laboratory, centrifuged at 4 degrees Celsius, and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in platelet function

Platelet aggregation will be measured using Multiplate (Registered Trademark) Impedance aggregometry. Platelet activation and platelet-derived microparticle formation will be measured using flow cytometry and XACT, a phospholipid specific procoagulant test.

Plasma will be collected and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. The analyses will be performed in batch to ensure consistency. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients' bloods will be collected  peripherally and from the culprit coronary artery immediately before and after the PCI, transported and centrifuged (double spun) at room temperature and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. </timepoint>

    <concealment>The principle investigators will review all new cardiology admissions on a daily basis to identify potential participants for this study. The patients will then be screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and consented for the study if they fulfil the requirement. Patients with pre-existing therapeutic relationships with a principle investigator will be screened and consented by an alternate principle investigator to maintain neutrality of the recruitment process. 

The participant will be enrolled into the study after the informed consent process has been completed and the participant has met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  The participant will receive a study enrolment number and this will be documented in the participantâ€™s medical record and on all study documents.

Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral doses of ambrisentan or placebo at time of recruitment, with minimisation based on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) subtypes and history of diabetes. This will take place during the index hospital admission using the MINIM randomisation software and performed by a neutral research co-ordinator who will not be involved in any aspects of the research project. Participants will be assigned a randomisation number, which will correspond to the treatment allocated. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Peri-procedural changes in IMR (delta IMR) has not been extensively studied to date. A recent study observed an overall increase in IMR by 20.6 +/- 6.0% following PCI for patients with NSTEMI (Akdeniz et al, EuroIntervension 2013), with a greater delta IMR observed (86.8 +/- 110.5%) in those with PMI than those without (-5 +/- 21%). A less dramatic trend has been observed in another study looking at patients with stable coronary artery disease, reporting a delta IMR of 22.1% following PCI in the PMI group as compared with 3.2% in patients who did not suffer PMI (absolute difference of 19.0%)(Layland et al, Heart, 2012). No studies have been performed to investigate the effect on Ambrisentan on IMR, although with every 20% incremental increase in IMR, there appears to be an adverse correlation with infarct size, myocardial haemorrhage, microvasular obstruction on cardiac MRI in the acute setting following primary PCI for STEMI, and infarct size and left ventricular function and remodelling in the intermediate term(Payne et al, JAHA, 2012). 


The primary endpoint is the difference in the peri-procedural change in IMR (ie post-PCI IMR - pre-PCI IMR, or delta IMR), between patients who receive Ambrisentan and placebo. Assuming normal distribution, sample size was calculated based on a hypothesized absolute difference of 20% between the two study arms, with an estimated standard deviation of 25%. With an overall sample size of 52 patients, the study will be able to achieve a power of 80% at a significance level of 5%. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Coronary artery disease affects around 1.4 million Australians, and represents one of the most significant causes of death and disability in Australia and worldwide. Over the last two decades the focus in the treatment of coronary artery disease has primarily been on blood vessels of large calibre. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that small vessels within the heart muscles, which are the main determinant of blood supply to the heart, may in fact have an equally important, if not more dominant role to play in patients with heart attacks or angina. It has also been suggested that small vessel problems may also be responsible for injury to the heart muscle during a stenting procedure, a potentially serious problem which remains a common issue despite recent technological advancement. Currently the understanding of these small vessels and treatment options are limited. This project aims to investigate the role of these small vessels in heart muscle injury during a stenting procedure and elucidate the possible mechanisms which predispose to or cause dysfunction within these small vessels. I also hope to find a treatment strategy which may benefit patients with small vessel problems and thus improve their overall outcome. If successful, I believe the results will have a wide reaching effect in patients with heart attacks, as well as in an emerging group of patients with angina secondary to small vessel dysfunction, which is resistant to conventional therapies.</summary>
