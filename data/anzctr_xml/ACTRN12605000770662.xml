  <interventions>
    <interventions>Induction cycle (1) Vincristine, Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone (VAD).
Good responders will continue with two more cycles of VAD.
Poor responders will have two cycles of bortezomib, Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone (VcAD).
Patient will proceed to peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation and transplant.
Patients who are not in remission after transplant will receive 2 cycles of single agent bortezomib treatment.
All patients will receive prednisolone maintenance for one year post transplant.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To examine the tolerability of bortezomib and its ability to increase the CCR rate when used as part of induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, who have a &lt;50% response to the first cycle of VAD chemotherapy and by virtue of the poor initial response are thought to have a poor prognosis. </outcome>
      <timepoint>at the end of 3 induction cycles</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. To examine the tolerability and efficacy of bortezomib to induce CCR in patients who are not in CCR following high dose therapy (HDT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). </outcome>
      <timepoint>at the end of 2  re-induction cycles</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. To examine the feasibility of harvesting sufficient PBSC for two autologous PBSCT, ie 6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg BW, following high dose cyclophosphamide and G-CSF in patient whose induction therapy included bortezomib.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on completion of stem cell mobilisation and harvest</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To compare the response of initial poor responders treated with bortezomib with a historical group of patients treated with standard chemotherapy and with those in this study who had initially good response to VAD and completed VAD induction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of 3 induction cycles</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. To examine the overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) of patients treated with bortezomib as part of pre-transplant induction, as post-tansplant reinduction, or during both phases of therapy compared with a historical group of patients treated with standard chemotherapy (VAD/Cyclophosphamide/melphalan200 PBSCT) and with reports in the literature of  patients treated with tandem HDT and PBSCT.</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 months post transplant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. To examine OS and EFS within the study population of patients who did or did not receive bortezomib.</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 months post transplant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. To examine engraftment kinetics of PBSC harvested after bortezomib therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>post transplant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5. To assess the difference in outcomes between patients treated with or without bortezomib to enable an estimate of the sample size that may be required for a randomised study with a similar structure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 months post transplant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
