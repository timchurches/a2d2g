  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is an alveolar recruitment maneuver, which involves a brief period of increased airway pressures with the aim of re-inflating collapsed lung units. The specific alveolar recruitment protocol will be performed with pressure controlled ventilation, for a duration of 60 seconds, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, inspiratory:expiratory ratio of 1:1,  peak airway pressures of 30cmH2O and PEEP of 10cmH2O during the maneuver.
Recruitment will be performed at two time-points during surgery:
1) After onset of lung isolation, to the dependent lung
2) After completion of surgery, to both the dependent and operative lung in a sequential manner.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate whether maneuvres to re-inflate collapsed areas of lung during surgery for lung cancer help to improve post-operative oxygen levels.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are 18 years or above and are scheduled to undergo surgical resection of your lung cancer with one lung ventilation.

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will undergo what is called an alveolar recruitment manoeuvre once during and once following surgery. This involves a brief period of increased airway pressures with the aim of re-inflating collapsed lung units. Participants in the other group will undergo standard treatment with a protective one-lung ventilation strategy. Participants will not know to which group they have been assigned.

Participants will be assessed peri-operatively to compare respiratory outcomes between these two manoeuvres.</summary>
