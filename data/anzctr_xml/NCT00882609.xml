    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Bone Scan: F18-Fluoride PET/CT or TC-MDP

Active Comparator: TC-MDP Bone Scan - Patients without known bone metastases who are newly diagnosed with = stage 3 breast cancer, = stage 3 lung cancer, or = stage 2 prostate cancer (and/or PSA &gt;10 micrograms/L), including patient with recurrent breast, lung or prostate cancer; Patient is scheduled to undergo a conventional bone scan

Experimental: F18-Fluoride PET/CT - Patients without known bone metastases who are newly diagnosed with = stage 3 breast cancer, = stage 3 lung cancer, or = stage 2 prostate cancer (and/or PSA &gt;10 micrograms/L), including patient with recurrent breast, lung or prostate cancer; Patient is scheduled to undergo a conventional bone scan


Treatment: devices: Bone Scan: F18-Fluoride PET/CT or TC-MDP
Each patient will be randomized into one of two groups with one group receiving Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection and the other receiving the control agent, 99mTc-MDPSodium Fluoride F18 Injection Dosing and Administration. The dose will be tailored for the specific patient for whom the dose was ordered. The dose of Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection administered will range from 5-10 mCi/patient.Each patient randomized to the control group will be administered 99mTc-MDP as a single intravenous bolus dose. The administered radioactivity will be determined based on the sites routine clinical practice for conventional bone imaging.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Analysis of the diagnostic performance of [18F]NaF fluoride PET/CT scanning - The primary endpoint will be an analysis of the diagnostic performance of [18F]NaF fluoride PET/CT scanning to that of conventional bone scanning for detecting cancer that has spread to the bone (bone metastasis). The hypothesis is that PET/CT is superior to conventional bone scanning for detecting bone metastases. The primary metrics used for comparison will be the relative areas under the ROC curves generated by blinded core lab interpretations of the scans.</outcome>
