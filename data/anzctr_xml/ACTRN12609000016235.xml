    <studytitle>A randomised cross over pilot study of inhaled tobramycin as a treatment option for hospitalised patients with cystic fibrosis versus standard treatment of intravenous tobramycin</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Is inhaled tobramycin as effective as intravenous tobramycin and potentially less toxic for treating acute exacerbations of lung infection in those patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are chronically colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will receive either IV tobramycin at the dose they received on their last admisson (usually 7-10mg/kg) once daily for 14 days or they will receive inhaled tobramycin at a dose of 300mg twice a day for 14 days. Once thier treatment has been completed they will cease these medications and will receive the other arm of the study on their next admission. Their admissions must be a minimum of 6 weeks apart.</interventions>
    <comparator>Intravenous tobramycin will be given for 14 days at the same dose as their previous admission. Therapeutic drug monitoring will be carried out to ensure adequate levels are being achieved without increasing the risk of toxicity. On their next admisson they will receive inhaled tobramycin</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in lung function which will be measured using spirometry. Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) expressed as % predicted will be compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-treatment (either in clinic before they are admitted or on their first day of admission), on the last day of their treatment, next clinic appointment (usually 6 weeks after the end of treatment)</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time until need next admission needed by the patient for treatment of an exacerbation of their lung infection</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time until their next admission will be recorded in weeks until they are re-admitted for an exacerbation of their lung infection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Alteration in renal function will be measured using urine beta2-microglobulin and serum creatinine (which will also be used to measure creatinine clearance by using equations)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Bloods will be taken before they receive their first dose of antibiotics on day 1 of their admission, bloods will also be taken on day 8 of their admission. Urine samples will be taken on the first day of their admission and on day 14 of their admission and then at their next clinic appointment (usually 6 weeks after the end of treatment)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight</outcome>
      <timepoint>They will be weighed on day one and day 14 of their admission and then again at their next clinic appointment (usually 6 weeks after the end of treatment)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients perception of how they are feeling using a quality of life questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be administered on day 1 and day 14 of their treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or changes in antibiotic resistance patterns to Pseudomonas aeruginosa by sending sputum samples to microbiology were they will test the cultures for sensitivities</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day 1 of their admission(unless a sample was collected in clinic before they were admitted), on day 14 of their treatment and at their next clinic appointment (usually 6 weeks after the end of treatment)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study hopes to show that when tobramycin is given via inhalation in those patients with cystic fibrosis who are sick enough to need intravenous (into a vein) antibiotics, the levels in the lung are adequate for effective bacteria killing and that they recover from the acute infection.  The study will be undertaken in all eligible patients who are admitted to the hospital for treatment of an exacerbation of their lung infection.</summary>
