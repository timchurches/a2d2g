  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of a natural medicine formulation on antioxidant and immune cell function.  The study hypothesises that the oral administration of the study medication over 4 weeks will result in a statistically significant lowering of fasting laboratory values of immune cell function, compared with baseline levels.</summary>
