  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing radical esophagectomy were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. In group I (n=20), patients received total intravenous general anesthesia (Group TIVA); in group II (n=20), patients received total intravenous general anesthesia combined with thoracic epidural anesthesia (Group TIVA+TEA). Each test solution was prepared in a syringe by the first investigator, who was also responsible for subject grouping. Under sterile conditions, a thoracic epidural catheter was placed via the T78 interspace and was advanced 34 cm cephalad by the first investigator. A test dose of 1% lidocaine 5 mL, alone, was then given by the first investigator via the thoracic epidural catheter, followed by 0.375% ropivacaine 5 mL, to produce a bilateral segmental sensory block to pinprick between the T6 and L4 dermatomes, or given 10mL normal saline. Then neuraxial block was maintained with 0.375% ropivacaine 5 mL/h or normal saline 5 mL/h throughout the surgical procedure by the second anaesthesiologist. Entropy index was used to maintain the depth of anesthesia to a certain level. Plasma levels of stress hormones and cytokines were assessed before surgery and as well as 1 and 3 hours after the beginning of surgery. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With exposure to severe food safety issues especially in China, the global incidence of cancer has risen dramatically, although survival rate of cancer patients is improving due to the modern medical technology, cancer is the second most common cause of death, exceeded only by heart disease and accounting for one in every four deaths. Although surgery remains the most effective treatment of potentially curable solid tumors, anesthesiologists shoulder the responsibility to minimize worsen fragile immune function of cancer patients in perioperative period. The trial which investigated whether different anesthesia techniques could affect intraoperative stress-induced immunosuppression in patients undergoing radical esophagectomy has significant clinical practical significance
and this trial is fully in line with the Declaration of Helsinki human trials, so the ethics committee unanimously supported the trial adoption.</summary>
