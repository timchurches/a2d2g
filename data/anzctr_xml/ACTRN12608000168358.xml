  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an international, multicentre study of Glypromate® administered at 1mg/kg/hr for 4 hours as a continuous intravenous infusion to patients undergoing CABG surgery and/or valve replacement/repair with CPB. Eligible patients will be assigned to one of two groups (active treatment or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.
Glypromate® or placebo will be given to the patient at the end of the surgery as this is the time at which the drug is thought to be most effective.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate if Glypromate® can reduce changes in brain functioning which may occur following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. Glypromate® is a synthetic (man-made) drug derived from a naturally occuring human protein.
Two previous human studies have been performed to look for side effects of the medicine, but this is the first study to see if Glypromate® can limit the changes in brain functioning following open heart surgery.
Approximately 672 people from the United States, Australia and New Zealand will participate in this study.
Neuropsychological tests (to measure brain functioning), and questionnaires designed to examine normal daily activities, mood and intelligence will be done before and after surgery (at 4-6 weeks and 12-14 weeks).</summary>
