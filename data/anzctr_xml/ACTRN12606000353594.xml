  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether Oxytocin facilitates extinction of conditioned fear. On day 1, participants 2 pictures are conditioned to the shock such that upon presentation of these pictures, participants respond with a fear response as indicated by skin conductance and expectancy measures. One picture is never paired with shock is a referred to as the safe cue. The next day (day 2) participants receive either OT or Placebo and return 45 minutes later. All three pictures are presented in the same way, except one of the pictures that was paird with shock originally is no longer paird with shock. This is called an extinction procedure. Participants then return the following day and are presented with the three pictures. We are assessing their fear response to the pictures with the hypothesis being that those who had the Oxytocin will respond with less of a fear response to the extinguished cue, as measured by skin conductance and expectancy measures, in comparison to those who received the placebo.</summary>
