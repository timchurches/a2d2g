  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two components to this trial:

1. Observational: A population of children with poorly controlled asthma despite optimal treatment (prescription of an inhaled corticosteroid at a dose of Flixotide 500 ug/day or equivalent AND either a long acting beta agonist or Montelukast, typically Seretide 500ug per day) will be studied. This will include measuring adherence with preventive medication using an electronic monitoring device. A number of questionnaires will also be used to explore a number of treatment, psychological and demographic variables. The observational period will be for one month.

2. A RCT investigating whether using an electronic monitoring device with a reminder function and reporting adherence data back to the patient improves adherence. During the second month of the trial half the subjects will have the reminder function turned on and will receive feedback on their adherence with their preventive medication. A direct coparison of adherence will occur for one month. The control group will continue to receive standard care during the second month. In the third month the control group will be exposed to the intervention. Adherence will be measured using an electronic monitoring device attached to the patient's preventive medication. All doses taken during the study will be recorded. Thus in summary, the intervention group will have one month of being monitored and two months of intervention. The control group will have two months of monitoring followed by one month of intervention.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is adherence with preventive asthma medication. This will be based upon data from the electronic monitoring device (EMD), the Smartinhaler, attached to the patient's preventive medication. The EMD records a time stamp each time a dose is taken and these data can be downloaded at a subsequent review. All subjects will be prescribed the same medication (Seretide 125/25ug two puffs twice daily). "Dose adherence" refers to the percentage of doses taken within the allotted time period (ie two doses recorded either between midnight and midday for the morning dose and midday and midnight for the evening dose).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adherence will be measured in all subjects during the first month of the study and all subjects will receive the same management. 

During the second month half the subjects will be exposed to the intervention and the other half will act as a control group. Adherence will be measured and compared between the two groups during the second month. 

During the third month the control group will be exposed to the intervention. This is not a true cross over trial as during the third month the intervention group may continue to be exposed to the intervention if this has proved to be helpful to them.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Asthma control (ACT or C-ACT control questionnaires, scores of &lt;19 will be used to indicate sub-optimal control)</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month (second month of the trial). The score will be assessed at the second visit (this questionnaire asks about asthma symtoms over the previous 4 weeks)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life (Juniper's self reports asthma quality of life scale)</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month (second month of the trial). This questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at the end of the second month. A comparison will be made between the two groups and also a comparison between the baseline and subsequent scores.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lung function (FEV1 and bronchodilator response)</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month (second month of the trial). Lung function testing will occur at each visit. A comparison will be made between the two groups and also a comparison between the baseline and subsequent values.</timepoint>

Following providing informed consent subjects will be provided with a study pack that will contain a study number in a sealed opaque envelope.
