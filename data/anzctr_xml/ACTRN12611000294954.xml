  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aims of the study are to identify eating &amp; appetite behaviours which characterise people who may be susceptible to over-consumption, weight gain and obesity, by: (i) the use of eating behaviour questionnaires &amp; (ii) investigating individuals responses to a range of dietary challenges which vary in energy, fat, carbohydrate &amp; protein content.
There will be 5 visits to the Human Nutrition Unit appetite centre. One brief screening visit [Phase 1] (approx 40 min) plus 4 x 1 day study visits [Phase 2].

Visit 1 = Phase 1 characterization visit. This is a screening visit where volunteers will be consented and registered. At this visit subjects will complete a collection of screening questionnaires to complete the characterization phase of the study.  
Visits 2-5 = Phase 2 intervention study visits. Once volunteers have completed the first phase of the study, they will come into the Human Nutrition Unit appetite centre fasted (=nothing to eat) on 4 additional separate days, arriving in the early morning (8am) and staying until the early afternoon (13:30pm). 
The trial design will be a 4 treatment cross-over, single day intervention study comprising 100 healthy lean, overweight &amp; obese male &amp; female subjects (aged 18-60 years). Participants will be given either a high fat, low fat, high energy or low energy test breakfast followed by an ad libitum lunch meal 3.5 hours later. There will be a minimum washout period of 7 days in between treatments.
Each participant will complete all study arms of phase 2 in a randomized order according to a Latin square design. 
The 4 interventions are:
A.High fat breakfast (2.5MJ; 50%en fat), followed by an ad libitum lunch meal.
B.Low fat breakfast (2.5MJ; 25%en fat), followed by an ad libitum lunch meal
C.High energy (2.5MJ; 37.5%en fat) breakfast, followed by an ad libitum lunch meal
D.Low energy (0.5.MJ; 37.5%enfat ) breakfast, followed by an ad libitum lunch meal
[MJ = mega joules; %en fat = the percent of the treatments energy contributed by fat]

The breakfast meals will comprise typical breakfast food items consumed in New Zealand including toast with butter &amp; jam &amp; scrambled eggs. All breakfast items provided must be consumed by participants.

The ad libitum lunch will comprise of a lamb casserole &amp; rice. The lunch meal will provide items served in moderate excess and participants will be instructed to eat as much of all food items available until they feel comfortably full.</interventions>

    <concealment>This is a randomised, cross-over trial. Randomisation is carried out using a Latin square design which is stratified to match the high fat &amp; low fat breakfasts (treatments A &amp; B) and the high energy &amp; low energy breakfasts (treatments C &amp; D) together. The order in which eligible participants are enrolled will determine the order in which they will complete the treatment arms. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation will be stratified to ensure that treatments (A)/(B) &amp; (C)/(D) are completed as 2 x 2 pairs in the latin square design to maximise outcome considering potential drop out</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Appetite regulation, which encompasses the physiological control of sensations of hunger and fullness as well as the regulation of food intake, is key to the prevention and treatment of obesity (Blundell et al, 1993; Uay &amp; Diaz 2005; Abete et al. 2007)

It is clear that groups of individuals within the population have greater susceptibility to obesity than their lean counterparts, despite comparable environmental pressure encouraging overconsumption and sedentary behaviour, and that these individuals preferentially gain body weight (adiposity) and hence are overweight and/or obese (Blundell &amp; Cooling 1999;  Blundell et al 2002, 2005).

It is likely that appetite-related behaviours which characterise an increased susceptibility to obesity can be identified through a combination of: 
a) administration of questionnaires investigating eating behaviour
[characterization] and 
b) identification of responses to acute dietary interventions designed to assess feelings of hunger, fullness &amp; associated appetitive sensations and measure eating behaviour (i.e. food intake) [intervention]</summary>
