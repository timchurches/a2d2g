  <interventions>
    <interventions>A semi-standardised treatment will be administered, this will allow for each participant to have a customized treatment within a standardized theory-driven framework.  Participants will receive five points administered at each session (LI4, ST36, REN4, SP6, LI11). Participants will undergo a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis prior to the first treatments session. The diagnosis and treatment will follow an agreed algorithm and will take 60-90 minutes. The diagnosis will guide the customised acupuncture treatment.Additional points may be selected from the following list: SP9, GV14, SiShenCong, Du20, Lu7, Ht6, UB23, UB20, Liv3, P6, GB34, UB62, SI3. This first session will last 60-90 minutes.

The needles will be retained in situ for a minimum of 20 minutes, with the duration of each treatment lasting 45 minutes.    Single-use disposable stainless steel Serin needles (0.25 x 40mm and 0.22 x 25mm) will be used. All participants will receive the de qi sensation (a needling sensation of soreness, numbness or heaviness) following initial insertion and once more during treatment. Reinforcing or reducing stimulation will be given according to the TCM diagnoses. Needles will be inserted to depths according to standard texts. 

Participants will be offered 10 treatments with treatments commencing week one (one treatment), week two and three (twice weekly), week four to eight (once weekly). Treatment visits will be recorded to monitor adherence to the treatment protocol.

This group receives both acupuncture and treatment as usual.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual: is based on a clinical guideline describing the management of CRF  This guideline describes education about fatigue, physician and nurse advice during routine consultation on general strategies that help manage fatigue, and advice to initiate and maintain levels of exercise. Existing information brochures from the Cancer Council and NBCF will be made available to participants in this group. Invitation to and voluntary participation in recruiting hospital programmes such as Living Well after Breast Cancer offered by Liverpool Cancer Support Centre will continue as normal for women. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is effective and feasible to treat post cancer related fatigue (CRF) using acupuncture. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 or over with ongoing cancer related fatigue and have been diagnosed with stage I, II or III breast cancer for which you have received breast surgery, adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and/or adjuvant radiotherapy between one month and two years previously with no recurrent disease since diagnosis. Study details Participants enrolled in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either standard care as per usual or an eight week course of ten acupuncture sessions. The first session will include a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis and will take approximately 60-90 minutes in total. All remaining sessions will take approximately 45 minutes, using a minimum of five needle points at specified locations, and with a selection of pre-specified additional needle locations to use at the discretion of the acupuncture therapist based on the TCM diagnosis. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire prior to the first session and following the final treatment session to assess the severity of their CRF. Researchers will also use recruitment rates to assess whether it is feasible to conduct a larger study in the future. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide greater understanding of the potential benefits of acupuncture for the treatment of CRF, and provide a foundation on which a larger study can be conducted. </summary>
