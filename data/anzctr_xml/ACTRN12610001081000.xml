  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) Guided Self Help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Clinical Perfectionism. The book titled Overcoming Perfectionism: A self help guide using Cognitive Behavioural Techniques" by Shafran, Egan and Wade (2010) will be given to the participants in this group. They will be required to read a designated chapter each week and complete various homework tasks, such as behavioural experiments and thought diaries. The chapters and homework tasks will be completed when it is convenient for the participant in their own home. This will occur for 8 weeks. Each week the Clinical Psychologist Trainee will call each participant to see how they are going with the readings and the assigned homework tasks. Each phone call will be a maximum of 15 minutes. 

2) Guided Self Help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Anxiety and Depression. The conditions for this group will be identical to the first experimental group, however a different text will be used. The book titled Mind Over Mood: Change how you feel by changing the way you think by Greenberg and Padesky (1995) will be given to the participants in this group. They will be required to read a designated chapter each week and complete various homework tasks, such as behavioural experiments and thought diaries. The chapters and homework tasks will be completed when it is convenient for the participant in their own home. This will occur for 8 weeks. Each week the Clinical Psychologist Trainee will call each participant to see how they are going with the readings and the assigned homework tasks. Each phone call will be a maximum of 15 minutes.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Based on previous studies reported in the literature (Riley et al., 2007; Steele &amp; Wade, 2008) we propose that a treatment that targets clinical perfectionism will be as effective as a treatment that targets anxiety and depression.  Due to only a small number of trials to date, with relatively small sample sizes, our study is required to effectively test this hypothesis in a Randomised Control Trial with an adequate sample size.</summary>
