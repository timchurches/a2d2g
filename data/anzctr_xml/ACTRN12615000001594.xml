  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be women of reproductive age who are already scheduled to undergo laparoscopy and endometrial biopsy as part of the investigation of their pain. We will take two endometrial biopsies (curettings + endometrial biopsy with endosampler) and do immunostaining with PGP9.5, we will look for the presence of fine nerve fibres in the endometrium in all participants. Both specimens will be taken on a single occaison during the scheduled laparoscopy.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be women undergoing laparoscopy who are confirmed NOT to have endometriosis after examination of the pelvis and biopsy of any suspicious lesions. The control group will also have nerve fibre assessment performed on their endometrial samples.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or absence of fine nerve fibres in the endometrium. The specimens will be immunostained with PGP9.5. A pathologist, blinded to the subject's endometriosis status will examine the slides using microscopic analysis and determine them to be Positive (nerve fibres present) or Negative (nerve fibres absent). </outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome is measured in the laboratory after specimen collection. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>As a composite secondary outcome the concentration of nerve fibres in all the positive specimens will be calculated with microscopic analysis and individual nerve fibre counting. A comparison will be made between nerve fibre density and the patients level of pain, as measured on a visual analog scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Nerve fibre counts will be performed after immunostaining, by two pathologists blinded to the subject's endometriosis status. The patient's pain scores will be obtained on the day of surgery, prior to laparoscopy and expressed as a VAS for dysmenorrhoea, non cyclic pelvic pain and dyspareunia.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study. No sample size calculation has been performed as it is unknown if endometrial biopsy is able to diagnose endometriosis. We based our sample size on two previously published papers that used 20 patients in each arm. (20 with endometriosis, 20 without endometriosis) and did nerve fibre staining on the whole group's endometrium.
. Frequency tables will be constructed and the association examined using a chi-square test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for both curettings and biopsy. Quality of curettage and biopsy specimens will be cross-tabulated with number of fibres and the association examined using the gamma statistic. The relationship between number of fibres and pain scores will be examined using scatter plots and correlation co-efficients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently no non invasive way to diagnose endometriosis. The gold standard is laparoscopy plus directed biopsy. Previous studies have suggested that endometrial nerve fibre detection may function as a less invasive outpatient test of endometriosis. This work suggested that if fine nerve fibres (C type unmyelinated) are present in the functional layer of the endometrium then the patient has endometriosis and if the fibres are not present the patient does not have endometriosis. We wish to recruit women with pelvic pain as we wonder if the nerve fibres relate to the painful condition rather than to endometriosis. We will perform endometrial  nerve fibre detection in 20 women with pain and no endometriosis and 20 women with pain who  have endometriosis.

Our hypothesis is that fine nerve fibres will be found in the functional layer of the endometrium in women both with and without endometriosis who also have pelvic pain. Thus endometrial nerve fibre detection is not a useful way to diagnose endometriosis.</summary>
