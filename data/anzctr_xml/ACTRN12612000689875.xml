  <interventions>
    <interventions>Impairment of the vestibulo-ocular reflex following the administration of Gentamicin. This will be monitored daily, ideally pre-treatment, during the course of all IV treated patients with ANY dose of Gentamicin and at 7 days following completion of treatment.  Recovery of any defecit will be monitored for up to 6 months in patients who show signs of impaired vestibular function.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To detect the incidence of vestibulotoxicity of Gentamicin. This will be done by measuring the VOR velocity gain on the head impulse test with video oculograpy. This involves bedside testing with motion sensing goggles that measure eye velocity and head velocity during head rotation. This test involves the examiner rotating the patients head while they attempt to fixate on a point on the wall. This test takes approximately 3 minutes with 12 minutes of set up. A gain less than that establised in normative data of 0.76 will be regarded as abnormal.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily during the course of treatment with Gentamicin, and continuing daily until 1 week after the termination of the course of Gentamicin therapy.  Gentamicin toxicity will be measured by a decrease in the VOR gain on the head impulse test with video oculograpy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the recovery of the VOR gain in affected patients who demonstrate vestibular toxicity up to and including one week post cessation of treatment. Through testing as described above in primary outcome 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weekly - biweekly for one month following the end of the course of Gentamicin, and once monthly subsequently, for up to 6 months or when the VOR shows complete recovery</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gentamicin can have toxic effects on the inner ear which lessen an individuals sense of spatial orientation and balance. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of this form of toxicity, and to investigate to what extent recovery is possible. This is done by recording eye movements, which have characteristic properties when movement sensors in the inner ear are non-functional.
This study will use video-oculography to enable an objective serial recording of the eye movement abnormality. In selected patients, the eye movements will be recorded over 6 months to observe recovery. This will provide information on how quickly the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) function recovers.</summary>
