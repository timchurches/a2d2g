  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dexmedetomidine Transdermal System (DMTS):  
The DMTS is a patch that contains 7.32 mg of dexemedetomidine. Based on the non-clinical data, the expected delivered dose is 1.44 mg at an average rate of 20 mcg/h over three days.


The patch will be checked for integrity at 6, 12, 24, 48 hours after application, and immediately prior to patch removal.

There will be a minimum washout period of 2 days. 


</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is a 24 hour infusion of Precedex (dexmedetomidine hydrocholoride).  

It will be administered as a single continuous IV infusion at a rate of 10 mcg/hr for 24 hours.  A total of 240 mcg will of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride will be given.

Time of infusion of start/stop and infusion rate will be documented in clinic notes to monitor dose delivered.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the bioavailability profile of dexmedetomidine following a single 3-day application of the DMTS compared with a 24-hour IV infusion of Precedex by determining the blood level of dexmedetomidine. </outcome>
      <timepoint>While on patch treatment, blood levels will be evaluated at:
pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after application; before patch removal, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours after patch removal.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine following a single 3-day application of the DMTS compared with a 24-hour IV infusion of Precedex by determining  pharmacokinetic parameters (Tmax, Cmax, AUC, and half-life) with blood samples</outcome>
      <timepoint>When on IV Precedex treatment, blood levels will be evaluated at:
predose, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 minutes; 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the start of infusion; 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the end of the infusion.   
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety and tolerability of the DMTS, including assessment of skin irritation, clinical laboratory tests, physical exams, vital signs, ECGs, cardiac telemetry,  and concomitant medications, and adverse events.

Precedex is approved for us in the intensive care or operating room setting.  The use of Precedex by continuous infusion is limited to 24 hours.  Known side effects of Precedex include:  
Bradycardia (slower than average heart beat)
Sinus arrest
Decreased secretion of tears to lubricate eyes
Decreased blood pressure and/or heart rate
Withdrawal symptoms

As the DMTS patch is using the same active ingredient, just administered in a different way, it can be assumed that both products will have similar side effect profiles.  
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Vital signs:  daily
Clinical laboratory tests: pre-dose, day 6; end of study*  
Physical exams:  pre-dose; end of study*
ECG:  Pre-dose, end of study*
Cardiac telemetry: Day 1-2 if on IV treatment; Day 1-4 if on DMTS treatment
Skin irritation:  During patch treatment, 1 hour and 24 hour after patch removal
Concomitant medications:  daily
Adverse events:  daily
*End of Study for participants on the patch will be study day 12 and for participants on IV infusion, it will be study day 10.  End of Study may also refer to any early discontinuation. 
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adhesion of the DMTS by assessing the percentage of the patch area adheres

This will be visually assessed by the study staff.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>During patch treatment, 6, 12, 24, 48 h after application and immediately prior to its removal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sedation effect of dexmedetomidine as assessed by the original Wilson sedation scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During patch treatment:  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 26, 28, 30, 30, 32, 36, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 60, 72, 96, and 120 hours after patch application.

During IV treatment:  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours after the start of the infusion.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is an open-label study whereby the study staff (including the study doctor), pharmacist, study monitor, and participant will be aware of the assigned treatment.  The randomisation list maintained and used by the study staff for treatment allocation.   Treatment allocation is not concealed.

Once the participant is deemed eligible for study entry by a study doctor, the participant will be allocated the next treatment available on the randomisation list by study staff.  Once allocated, the study doctor will confirm study entry by signing off on the treatment order.  

Each eligible participant will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, as per the randomisation list,  to one of the two treatment sequences:

Sequence A:  Precedex treatment first then a DMTS treatment
Sequence B:  DMTS treatment first then Precedex treatment

All participants who receive study treatment will be included in the summaries and listings of safety data.

This is a pilot study and the first study of DMTS. The sample size was determined based on our past clinical experience in developing transdermal products.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a first in human study for the DMTS. 

This study is evaluating a different formulation of dexmedetomidine by determining the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine following a single 3-day application of the DMTS compared with a 24 hour IV infusion of Precedex and assessing the safety and tolerability.   

This is an open-label, randomized, two-period, cross-over study.
