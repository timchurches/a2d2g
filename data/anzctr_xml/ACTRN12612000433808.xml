  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this trial Australian adults with symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder will be randomly allocated to one of four groups. Two of the four groups will receive access to an 8 week internet-delivered treatment course specifically for generalised anxiety disorder (disorder-specific treatment course). The other two groups will receive access to an 8 week internet-delivered treatment course for symptoms of anxiety and depression (trans-diagnostic treatment course).

Over the 8 weeks, all participants will be directed to read 5 online lessons about management of symptoms. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to read. Participants will also have access to summaries and homework assignments for each lesson, and will read stories about people with similar symptoms, taking a further 20 minutes per week.

The four groups are:
Group 1: Self-guided - disorder-specific course. Participants in this group will complete the disorder-specific generalised anxiety disorder treatment course in a self-guided format, that is, without support from a therapist.
Group 2: Self-guided - trans-diagnostic. Participants in this group will complete the trans-diagnostic treatment course in a self-guided format, that is, without support from a therapist.
Group 3: Guided - disorder-specific. Participants in this group will complete the disorder-specific generalised anxiety disorder treatment course in a guided format, that is, with weekly telephone or email support from a therapist.
Group 4: Guided - trans-diagnostic. Participants in this group will complete the trans-diagnostic treatment course in a guided format, that is, with weekly telephone or email support from a therapist.

Participants in all groups will also receive twice weekly automatic emails providing reminders about the course and encouragement to continue.

Study questionnaires will be administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6, 12, and 24 months post-treatment. These will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. Participants will also complete brief measures of mood and anxiety before each lesson. The treatment materials include cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) skills.</interventions>
    <comparator>This 2 (self-guided vs. guided) X 2 (trans-diagnostic vs. disorder-specific) RCT does not have a formal control group, as it compares active treatments. However, data from historical controls will be obtained and compared from similar studies conducted by this research team over the period 2007-2012. These studies include:

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is part of a research program funded by the NHMRC (No. 630560) to develop and evaluate Internet based transdiagnostic education and treatment programs for people with anxiety and depression. This project examines the relative efficacy of a disorder-specific internet-delivered treatment for generalised anxiety disorder vs. trans-diagnostic internet-delivered treatment for both anxiety and depression. Both interventions will be tested in guided and self-guided formats.

We expect that the guided interventions will result in superior outcomes to the unguided interventions. We do not expect differences between the two guided interventions at post-treatment, but expect that the trans-diagnostic treatment will result in superior outcomes at follow-ups.</summary>
