  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three injections each of 5ml stromal vascular fraction containing adipose-derived stem cells two months apart. Time-points for injections: 1) initial injection, 2) two months following initial injection and 3) four months following initial injection. This results in a total treatment duration of five months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Three injections each of 2ml (16 mg) of Hylan G-F 20 two months apart. Time-points for injections: 1) initial injection, 2) two months following initial injection and 3) four months following initial injection. This results in a total treatment duration of five months.</comparator>

      <outcome>Pain measured using 100mm Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, daily for the first two weeks, weekly for the subsequent two weeks and four and eight weeks, and six and 12 months, following the final injection</timepoint>

      <outcome>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, four and eight weeks, and six and 12 months, following the final injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum single leg hop for distance. Participant hops as far as possible and the distance (in cm) from the toe in starting position to heel in landing position is measured by the researcher using a tape measure.  The best of three hops is recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, four and eight weeks, and six and 12 months, following the final injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum number of knee bends performed in 30 seconds. Participant bends the knee without bending forward from the hip (until they cannot see a line along the toes, equivalent to about 30 degrees of knee flexion) as many times as possible in 30 seconds. Time is recorded using a stopwatch and number of bends are counted by the researcher.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, four and eight weeks, and six and 12 months, following the final injection</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degenerative condition of articular cartilage and subchondral bone that leads to significant physical and psychological disability, and adversely affects daily function and quality of life. Current treatment of knee OA is associated with limitations and side effects that restrict their ability to effectively treat the symptoms of the condition and stop its progression. 

Recent research has demonstrated that Human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are safe for use in Humans and can differentiate into cartilage and bone, suggesting a potential treatment in osteoarthritis. This study aims to assess the changes in pain, cartilage and bone appearance, activity levels and lower extremity functional ability of patients with knee OA following intra-articular ADSC injection compared to usual treatment of Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc [Registered Trademark]).</summary>
