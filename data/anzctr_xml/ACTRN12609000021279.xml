    <interventions>Skin closure technique for ileostomy reversal, purse string closure. This intervention is used once on each participant in this arm of the study. The intervention involves the technique used for skin closure during the elective operation to reverse the participants ileostomy. This intervention is definitive method of closure of the skin after reversal of the participants ileostomy, it is a permanent procedure. The follow up period for detection of surgical site infection (the primary outcome measure) is 30 days post surgery. Patients will be followed up for as much as a further 2 years to assess the secondary outcome measure, cosmetic result. "Purse string closure" differs from the comparator treatment "linear closure" in terms of the technique use for closure of the skin following the reversal of ileostomy. "Purse string closure" involves a suturing technique that draws the skin together in a circular fashion, in contrast to "linear closure" which abuts the edges of the skin defect, and sutures them closed in a traditional linear fashion.</interventions>

      <outcome>Surgical site infection as defined by the Ceters for Disease Control (CDC).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infection occurring with in 30 days of completion of surgery. Participants will be assessed for the presence of surgical site infection, on days 1,2, and 3 post surgery, on the day they are discharged from hospital and at the time of their follow up appointment with their treating surgeon. All assessments will be made by an independent surgeon train observer.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cosmetic result. Assessment made by independent expert panel, using a visual analogue scale assessment tool.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Scar assessed with in 12 to 24 months of surgery. The timing of this assessment will be determined by the timing of follow up visits with the treating surgeon. Assessment will co-ordinate with these visits. (N.B the 30 day time frame for assessment of the presence of surgical site infection dose not relate to the time frame for this outcome measure).</timepoint>

    <concealment>Subjects enrolled at time of scheduling of elective reversal of ileostomy, allocation to treatment group was achieved by the use of sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>All randomisation envelopes required for the trial were filled, sealed prior to the commencement of the trial. These envelopes were then randomly assigned to participants, and opened by the surgeon at the time of surgery. Simple randomisation was achieved by creation of equal numbers of active and control envelopes, which were then sealed, shuffled and sequentially assigned to study participants by blinded assistant.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares two methods of skin closure following the reversal of ileostomy, purse string and linear closure. The study seeks to determine the incidence of surgical site infection following surgery when these two techniques are used. There is a high incidence of surgical site infection following reversal of ileostomy, and so determining if the use of different skin closure technique can reduce this incidence is important.</summary>
