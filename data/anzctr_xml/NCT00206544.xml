    <summary>OBJECTIVE:

      To test the use of two adjunctive hormonal agents in a 28 day three-arm, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in the treatment of acute mania/hypomania.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      That women receiving adjunctive Tamoxifen or Progesterone will demonstrate a more rapid and
      more substantial decrease in manic symptoms over the course of the study than women receiving
      adjunctive placebo.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Sixty females with a current diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder or Schizoaffective
      disorder - Manic Phase, according to the operationalised criteria of the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) of the American Psychiatric Association.

      STUDY MEDICATION:

      Tamoxifen. One third of patients (twenty) will be randomized to receive adjunctive Tamoxifen
      at 40 mg/day for 28 days. The Tamoxifen will be administered within a plain capsule to
      maintain "blinding" of treatment arm.

      Progesterone. One third of patients (twenty) will be randomized to receive adjunctive oral
      Provera (progesterone) at 20 mg/day. The Progesterone will be administered within a plain
      capsule identical to that used with Tamoxifen.

      Placebo. The remaining one third of patients will be randomized to receive adjunctive placebo
      (inert substance). The placebo substance will be administered within a plain capsule
      identical to that used with Tamoxifen and Progesterone.

      STUDY EVALUATIONS:

      Data will be collected over a 28-day period for each patient. Visits will be performed at
      baseline, and then at weekly intervals. A total of five visits will be completed for each
      patient. The following evaluations will be performed:

        -  Psychiatric evaluation to determine diagnosis. (Baseline visit only)

        -  General clinical evaluation including medical history, current conditions and a
           non-invasive physical examination, body weight, vital signs. (Baseline visit only)

        -  Medication history (baseline and evaluation visits).

        -  Demographics (baseline visits only).

        -  Completion of clinical rating scales; CARS-M, PANSS, MADRS, AIMS, Barnes Akathisia scale
           (BA), and Simpson-Angus scale (SA) (baseline and evaluation visits). A Menstrual Cycle
           Interview and a cognitive assessment (RBANS) will be performed at baseline and endpoint
           (day 28) visit.

        -  Laboratory tests including; Serum levels of mood stabilizer, luteinizing hormone (LH),
           follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), Estrogen, Progesterone, Prolactin,
           dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), Testosterone and protein kinase C(PKC) (baseline and
           evaluation visits).

        -  Inclusion/exclusion checklist (baseline visit only).

        -  Informed consent (baseline visit only).</summary>
