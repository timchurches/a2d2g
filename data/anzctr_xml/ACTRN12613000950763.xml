  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention will consist of a group-based physiotherapy intervention program designed to target motor co-ordination, balance, postural stability and behaviour. The program will be led by a physiotherapist and will include 6 structured physiotherapy sessions that occur on a weekly basis for 6 weeks. Sessions will be progressed in terms of complexity and will be tailored to each child's specific needs. Each session will be 1-1.5 hours in duration. Parents and children will be given a weekly home exercise program and this will be progressed in association with the intervention program. Parents will be encouraged to spend 20-30 minutes on the home exercise program per day for the 6 weeks. If parents prefer, they are advised that the 20-30 minute home program may be undertaken in smaller blocks of time tather than doing the exercises in one continuous block of time. On the weekly home exercise program handout, there is a table for parents to record (with involvement of the child) of the the exercises that have been completed each dayThere will be 3-4 children per intervention group. Upon completion of the program, parents will be provided with a booklet of general age-appropriate activities to continue with their child. Email/telephone contact will be made with families every 2 months, at which time parents will be asked questions about their child's activities and will be provided with an opportunity to highlight any concerns that they may have about their child. the 2 monthly email/telephone contact will continue for 12 months post baseline assessment</interventions>
    <comparator>The control children will receive 'usual care', although the parents will be provided with a booklet of age-appropriate activities. 'Usual care' for able-bodied extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight children translates to minimal if any support services for these children who have mild neurodevelopmental impairments. However, children in both the control and intervention groups may be referred for and receive other therapies by other health professional as deemed appropriate. The content of these therapies (if any0 will be recorded.Email/telephone contact will be made with the families every 2 months at which time parents will be asked questions about their child's activities and will be provided with an opportunity to highlight any concerns that they may have about their child.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The participants will have been born less than 1000g or less than 28 weeks gestational age and will have been managed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Mater Mothers' Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Children will be aged 4-4.5 years corrected for prematurity when commencing involvement in the study and will not have started their preparatory (prep) year of schooling.
Included children will have attended their 4 year (corrected age) Growth and Development Clinic follow-up assessment and will have a score from the Neurosensory Motor Developmental Assessment (NSMDA) of 9 to &lt;13 and an IQ of &gt;70 on the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales. Children will also live within one hour of travel time to the Mater Hospitals.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Children with significant congenital anomalies, diagnosed neurological impairments including cerebral palsy, a visual impairment not corrected by wearing corrective lenses or a hearing impairment not corrected by aids will be excluded from the study. Additionally, children will not participate if their parents/carers do not speak English, as delivery of the program including follow-up telephone calls would not be practical. Children of families who identify that they would not be able to commit to attending a 6 week physiotherapy program and returning for follow-up assessments will also be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Children will be assessed for eligibility to participate in the study after they have completed their 4 year (corrected age) assessment at the Growth and Development Clinic. Eligibility to participate in the study will be determined by physiotherapy and psychology staff at the Growth and Development Clinic prior to enrollment. Parents of eligible children will be contacted by telephone to determine whether or not they wish to receive by mail the "Participant Information Sheet' and 'Consent Form' detailing the trial. Once consent has been obtained, children will be stratified according to their cognitive abilities.
Randomisation to either the intervention or control group will be concealed by using sealed opaque envelopes, identified by stratification group and consecutively numbered. These envelopes will be assigned to participants based on the order in which they are booked in for baseline assessment. Following baseline assessment, the physiotherapist providing the intervention will notify parents/carers by telephone to which group their child has been randomised.  The physiotherapist leading the intervention will not have reviewed baseline assessment results of the children when advising parents/carers to which group their child has been randomised.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random order for the allocation of children into either the intervention or the control group will be performed using the computerised randomisation service provided by the Mater Mothers' Research Centre. Twins will be randomised to the same group due to the nature of the intervention.
Stratification will occur according to the child's cognitive abilities obtained from the Stanford Binet Intelligence scales at their 4 year (corrected age) assessment at the Growth and Development Clinic, with an IQ &lt; or = to 85 / &gt;85.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of a physiotherapy intervention program with able-bodied 4 year old children born extremely preterm or with extremely low birth weight on their motor co-ordination, postural stability and functional performance compared to no intervention. Also the study will examine the impact of the intervention on behaviour.
OBJECTIVES
1. To evaluate the movement benefits of a specifically developed 6 week small group physiotherapy intervention program for children aged 4-4.5 years.
2. To compare the motor development of children with and without intervention.
3. To evaluate the impact of intervention compared to no intervention on general abilities, activity levels and behaviour 12 months post baseline assessment.
HYPOTHESES
It is hypothesised that a physiotherapy intervention program will improve motor co-ordination, postural stability and functional performance in 4 year old children born extremely preterm or with extremely low birth weight. It is hypothesised that improvements in motor abilities amongst this group of children will have a positive effect on activity levels and behaviour compared to children who receive no intervention. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that there is a close link between motor performance and the ability to cope with social interactions and that early improvement will continue to impact on the child's motor development, attention and behaviour, not just in the short term but will have long term effects.</summary>
