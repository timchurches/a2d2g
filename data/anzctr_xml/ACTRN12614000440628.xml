    <interventions>This study is an intervention study as half the participants will be randomized to complete a brief (10-15 minute), visual, psychoeducation intervention shown to patients on a computer tablet. The intervention will be shown to patients who are randomised to the intervention condition, after the have completed their baseline questionaire. The intervention will be personalized into one of two levels, dependent on the severity of the patients heart attack as estimated primarily from their troponin levels (Mild: up to 200 micrograms per litre, or moderate to severe: up to and above 2000 micrograms per litre). The patients troponin levels are measured in the bloods taken from patients when they are admitted to hospital. After patients are recruited for the study, their notes will be consulted to obtain their troponin peak level. This will then be used to determine whether the patient fits into the mild or moderate to severe group and which images of approximate damage they will be shown. Patients will also be shown visual representations of how the heart works, how a blood clot forms, an approximation of the damage they have received and what they can now to keep their heart healthy, including animations depicting how their medications of statin and aspirin work and other healthy behaviours. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients who are not randomised into the intervention condition will receive standard care as usual. For the purposes of our study, standard care as usual is the care and treatment that all patients receive while in the coronary care unit. Therefore those who are randomised into the intervention group receive the intervention which is treatment in addition to this standard care. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Illness perceptions - Illness perceptions will be measured using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Broadbent, Petrie, Main, &amp; Weinman, 2006) as well as assessing patient's drawings of their perceptions of their heart following their acute coronary event (as used in Broadbent, Petrie, Ellis, Ying, &amp; Gamble, 2004). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-Intervention - participants complete post-intervention assessment between 24 hours and 1 week following the completion of their baseline questionnaire. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence to medication - Adherence to medication will be measured using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS; Thompson, Kulkami, &amp; Sergejew, 2000). </outcome>
      <timepoint>7-week follow up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Return to work - return to work as patient's return to any work they took part in prior to their heart attack (e.g. full time, part time, volunteer work)</outcome>
      <timepoint>7-week follow up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychological distress/anxiety - Psychological distress and anxiety are measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001) and the Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire (Eifert et al., 2000). </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>ACS patients will be recruited from the coronary care unit at Auckland City Hospital for involvement within our study. All patients who express interest in taking part in the study will then complete a baseline questionnaire. After this is completed, an envelope is opened which has been randomly allocated by someone independent to the study using a random number list, which either says that the patient is in the control or intervention condition. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation procedure used was simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software. The randomisation was completed by another student who was not involved within our study. They generated a random number sequence and allocated participants to either control or intervention based on numbers being odd or even. They then placed these allocations into 70 different envelopes (one for each participant) numbered from 1 to 70. The student researcher then opens the corresponding envelope for each participant after they have completed baseline. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Illness perceptions have been found to predict functional outcomes across many illness populations. A new method of measuring illness perceptions, patients drawings of their illness, has been validated as an alternative means of assessment. One patient group for whom illness perception drawings have been found to relate to outcomes such as depression and poor illness behaviours are heart patients. Heart patients have also been found to have inaccurate cardiac risk perceptions (Broadbent et al., 2006) and often their mental imagery of what is wrong with their heart is inaccurate (Broadbent et al., 2004). The proposed study will therefore investigate whether a brief, psychoeducational intervention to correct patients mental imagery of damage to the heart and how their medication works, can facilitate their recovery through outcomes including return to normal activity, adherence and psychological wellbeing. 
This study hyothesises that the intervention will improve patients illness perceptions as represented through their drawings, and in turn improve their recovery as revealed in functional outcomes such as decreased return to work times and improved adherence. The possible impact of this study clinically, is that if the intervention is proven effective, it could be administered to cardiac patients to help improve their recovery and wellbeing.
