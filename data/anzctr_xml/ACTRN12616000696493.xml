    <interventions>First Arm: Post-Operative Management according to one pathway which facilitates patient recovery after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) through a mixture of pre surgical teaching and post surgical physiotherapy. It will involve heath professionals including orthopedics surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Specific details have been omitted to preserve study blinding; these have been provided to the ANZCTR staff (via the Private notes) and will be published here once the trial has been completed.

    <comparator>Second Arm: Post-Operative Management according to a second pathway which facilitates patient recovery after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) through a mixture of pre surgical teaching and post surgical physiotherapy. It will involve heath professionals including orthopedics surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. This is different to the previous Intervention pathway, as there is some difference between the timing of certain elements of care provided. </comparator>

      <timepoint>Length of hospital stay between the two arms of the study.  The length of stay is from the end of the procedure to the hospital discharge. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Additional post operative complications, The post operative outcomes that we will be assessing are as follows. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
Superficial incisional surgical site infection
Prosthetic joint infection
Other Health Care Associated Infection
Clostridium difficile infection
Blood stream infection (BSI) including central-line associated BSI

    <statisticalmethods>The primary statistical analysis will be an intent-to-treat analysis on the entire sample. There will also be additional statistical tests to determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and to evaluate the success of the blinding of the intervention
The sample size estimate for this trial is 35 participants per study arm (total n =70 participants) based on the following parameters: average length of stay of 5.5 days (standard deviation 2.5) drawn from the St Vincent's Arthroplasty Outcomes Registry Data (SMART Registry); an estimated 2.3 day reduction in LOS based on the lower limit of the 95% confidence rate reported by Larsen et al (2008) a comparable randomized controlled trial, power of 80%; an alpha value of 5%. To allow for a loss to follow up rate of 10% this trial will recruit 80 participants in total.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prosthetic joint replacement is a high cost and high volume procedure in Australia. In 2015, it is expected that over 100,000 joint replacements will be performed. The aim of the STEP Study is to compare two different clinical care pathways to see which pathway is best at helping patients recover from their surgery. At present it is unknown if one of these clinical care pathways is better than the other or whether they are both equally effective. 
The study will compare length of stay and the costs associated with the care pathways, along with patient reported outcomes (in the form of questionnaires), health economic analysis and adverse event assessment. 
This is a single centre, parallel design, pragmatic randomised controlled trial.</summary>
