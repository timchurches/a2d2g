  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will be loaned a mobile dermatoscope to conduct their skin self-examination. This is a magnifying device that attaches to a mobile phone with polarised light to aid skin examinations, which can store and send photos of skin moles to a dermatologist via an app.
Participants will be provided with an information booklet and video on how to set up the mobile dermatoscope and use the associated mobile application, known as "Handyscope."  Participants will be conducting three skin self-examinations using mobile dermoscopy: at baseline, 1-month and 2-month timepoints. Participants will be asked to send photos of any skin lesions they believe are suspicious to the consultant dermatologist via the Handyscope application. Participants will be reminded to conduct their skin self-examinations via SMS or email.


</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: skin self-examinations conducted by the naked eye.
Participants will be conducting three naked-eye skin self-examinations at baseline, 1-month and 2-month timepoints.

The reference standard is a clinical skin examination conducted by a dermatologist. The clinical skin examination will be conducted at the follow-up visit, which will take place after the final 2-month skin self-examination. This follow-up visit will take approximately 1 hour and will be conducted by our consultant dermatologist (Professor H. Peter Soyer). During this visit, the dermatologist will conduct a clinical skin examination using dermoscopy, and diagnosing each suspicious lesion and determining the likelihood of malignancy and recommend a course of action.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is test whether mobile dermatoscopes can help assist consumers conduct home skin examinations to detect potentially cancerous skin spots or moles.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 or over, are considered high risk for skin cancer, own an iPhone 5 or above and have a partner/relative/friend willing to assist you with skin examinations.

Study details:
Participants will be randomly allocated (by chance) to either the usual care naked-eye skin self-examination group or the intervention teledermoscopy group. The teledermoscopy group will receive a magnifying device which attaches to their smartphone to assist with skin self-examinations. All participants will be asked to complete two questionnaires (baseline and 2-month), conduct three skin examinations at home (baseline, 1-month and 2-month) and have a whole-body clinical skin examination with one of our study dermatologists at a study clinic after the 2-month skin self-examination. Intervention group will be asked to use a mobile dermatoscope to conduct their home skin examinations.

It is hoped that this trial will provide information on whether mobile teledermoscopy may be accurate and cost-effective for assisting high risk individuals with skin self-examinations.</summary>
