  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is composed of sleeping apnea and hypopnea. It also accompanied with fatigue, daytime sleepiness and poor concentration and memory in such patients. It was known that OSAS is associated with higher occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In traditional Chinese medicine aspect, OSAS has three major subtypes and has corresponding treatment. In this study we will observe on their TCM constitution and their cardiovascular complications in patients with OSAS.</summary>
