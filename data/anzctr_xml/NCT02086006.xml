  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This prospective, consecutive enrolment, single-arm study will enroll up to 15 patients with
      single de novo, Type A lesions &lt; 10 mm in length and located in a native coronary artery with
      a reference vessel diameter of 2.75 mm - 3.0 mm as measured by both offline QCA and IVUS. All
      patients will receive a 3.0 x 14mm DESolve Stent loaded with approximately 40 mcg of
      Myolimus.

        -  Angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) will be completed for all patients at
           baseline and at 6 months.

        -  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will will be completed for all patients at baseline
           and at 6 months.

        -  Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) will be conducted on all patients enrolled at 12
           and 24 months.</summary>
