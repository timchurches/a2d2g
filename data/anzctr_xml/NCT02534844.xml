    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - VTS-270
Treatment: drugs - Sham Procedure Control

Experimental: VTS-270 - Part A: Three (3) different VTS-270 lumbar intrathecal doses (900 mg, 1200 mg, and 1800 mg) administered IT every 2 weeks for 8 weeks in 9 subjects; 3 subjects will receive sham treatment. Dose for Part B to be selected for the remainder of the study.
Part B: Approximately 51 subjects, including 12 from Part A, will receive lumbar intrathecal infusions of VTS-270 or sham (randomized 2:1) every 2 weeks for a total of 52 weeks.
Part C: Open-label extension with IT treatment every 2 weeks.
All subjects (sham and drug-treated) with clinically defined worsening following &gt; 6 months of treatment in Part B will be eligible to enter Part C.
All subjects who complete Part B will be eligible to enter Part C.

Sham Comparator: Sham Procedure Control - Sixteen (16) subjects, including 3 from Part A.


Treatment: drugs: VTS-270
Lumber intrathecal infusion of VTS-270 (dose to be selected after Part A)

Treatment: drugs: Sham Procedure Control

    <summary>This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 2-hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (VTS-270) in
      patients with neurologic manifestations of Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) Disease. Approximately
      two-thirds of patients will receive the study drug, 2-hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (HP-ß-CD),
      while the remaining study participants will receive sham control.</summary>
