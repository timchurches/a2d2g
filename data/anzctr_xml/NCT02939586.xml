  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective sleep quality - The objective sleep quality will be measured by Polysomnography (PSG). PSG is comprised of 4 channels: Electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), electro-oculography (EOG) and electrocardiography (ECG). It monitors many body functions including brain (EEG), eye movements (EOG), muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation (EMG) and heart rhythm (ECG) during sleep. The following data will be reported via a PSG for assessment of sleep apnoea: total sleep time, sleep efficiency, types of sleep (% of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM)), arousal (episodes/hr), apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI), and oxygen saturation. The AHI score will be used to determine the severity of sleep apnoea.</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective sleep quality - The subjective sleep quality will be measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is an effective tool to measure the quality and patterns of sleep, and to differentiate "poor" from "good" sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month period. A global sum of 5 or greater indicates "poor" sleep.</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall quality of life - Overall quality of life will be measured by Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument (KDQOL-36). This tool examines 20 variables which include renal specific measurements. The domains examined include physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, physical pain, mental health, vitality, general health perceptions plus the burden of kidney disease, and symptoms/problems commonly associated with kidney disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The different concentration of inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, ÃŸ2M, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8) during HDF period vs HD period, and the correlation to AHI, and overall sleep quality and quality of life. - Blood samples will be collected from eligible participants in stage 2, and analysed for inflammatory biomarkers concentration using Elisa kit.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep disturbance is a significant issue in people undergoing dialysis. More than 80% of
      haemodialysis patients complain of difficulty sleeping. Inadequate sleep can cause poor
      daytime function and increased risk of motor vehicle incidents.

      One of the common reasons for sleep disturbance in dialysis patients is sleep apnoea. Sleep
      apnoea involves pauses in breathing that occur during sleep. Each pause can last only a few
      seconds or minutes. Severe sleep apnoea reduces oxygen supply and increases risk of heart
      attack and stroke, which are the leading causes of death in dialysis patients.

      In this project, the investigators will examine how a change of dialysis treatment might
      improve sleep. This project will first identify patients at risk of sleep disturbance using
      surveys and a subsequent sleep study. The investigators will then test different dialysis
      models to see the effect of dialysis treatment on sleep apnoea. The aim is to find a dialysis
      model that works better for patients with sleep apnoea.</summary>
