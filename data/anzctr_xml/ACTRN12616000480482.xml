    <interventions>This study is the first large-scale trial of Functional Imagery Training (FIT). FIT aims to enhance the effectiveness of existing best treatment for alcohol use, Motivational lnterviewing (MI), by harnessing the motivational power of mental imagery. This study examines the additive effect of embedding FIT techniques within MI when
treating Alcohol Use Disorder. There are three treatment arms:

Motivational Interviewing (MI) - delivered by phone in two 1 hour calls over 1 week. Participants discuss the advantages and feasibility of reducing drinking, and therapists elicit emotional reactions and dissonance between core values and current behaviour.

Motivational Interviewing plus Support (MI+S)  delivered by phone in 8 calls over 25 weeks (two 1 hour calls in Week 1 and six 15 minute calls in Weeks 2, 3, 5, 7, 13 and 19). Treatment contact time totals 3.5 hours. MI+S has the same initial sessions as MI. Later calls offer non-specific support and social reinforcement for progress and encourage brief relaxation practice, but do not shape new coping strategies unless a lapse occurs. A smartphone app developed for this study assists practice of progressive muscular relaxation, including an audio file to guide practice and photos of peaceful nature scenes. Participants can use the app and relaxation as often or as little as they choose.

Functional Imagery Training (FIT)  delivered by phone in 8 calls over 25 weeks (two 1 hour calls in Week 1 and six 15 minute calls in Weeks 2, 3, 5, 7, 13 and 19). Treatment contact time totals 3.5 hours. Is based on MI+S but uses imagery throughout the sessions. During sessions, participants generate multisensory images about positive outcomes from controlling drinking, past success with self-control, and strategies to control drinking. Later sessions elicit achievements, outcomes and effective strategies, rehearsing imagery and making it routine by linking it to daily tasks. Mindfulness is practised instead of relaxation. A smartphone app developed for this study assists practice of imagery, including an audio file to guide practice and the ability to take photos to facilitate practice. Participants can use the app and imagery/mindfulness as often or as little as they choose.

The treatments are manualised but are semi-structured, allowing some degree of personalisation according to the needs and circumstances of particular individuals. Therapy is delivered by postgraduate-qualified clinical psychologists and therapists receive supervision from senior clinicians throughout the trial. All sessions are audio-recorded and a random sample are rated for fidelity by appropriately qualified consultants who are independent of the trial and not involved in treatment or supervision. </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be aged 18 years or over and report consuming &gt;40 gm of ethanol (4 standard drinks)/day on average in the past 4 weeks. They will fulfil criteria for current DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder and deny intravenous drug use or &gt;twice-weekly cannabis use in the last month. They will not be in concurrent psychological treatment for substance use, and if on naltrexone or acamprosate, will have been on a stable dose for &gt;4 weeks. If highly dependent on alcohol or drinking &gt;700 gm ethanol/week, they will obtain a medical assessment and agree to any medical treatment that is needed, including a medically supervised detoxification if required. They must have access to a smartphone to be able to use the treatment app.</inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is powered for the primary outcome of weekly alcohol use. Using pilot data to obtain estimates of variance and intraclass correlation, the intention-to-treat sample of 480 provides Power &gt; .90 (alpha = .05) to detect the expected difference between FIT and MI (beta = .21), based on our pilot studies and previous research. A sample of 480 will detect a beta = .14 difference at Power .90, which is smaller than differences commonly reported in comparisons of active psychological treatments. Missing data will be handled using Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation, which gives less biased treatment effect estimates than complete case analysis.

Primary analyses use intention-to-treat. Multi-level modelling (3 Conditions x 4 Occasions - 0, 3, 6, 12 months) tests effects on drinks per week, drinks/drinking day, days abstinent, health-related quality of life, craving and motivation to control drinking. 

Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with each intervention are calculated by multiplying AQoL utility scores by the duration in that health state. The incremental cost utility ratio is calculated as the difference in total costs (health care utilisation + treatment costs) between groups divided by the difference in QALYs. Uncertainty is estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping and Monte Carlo simulations.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>This study is the first large-scale trial of Functional Imagery Training (FIT). FIT aims to enhance the effectiveness of existing best treatment for alcohol use, Motivational lnterviewing (MI), by harnessing the motivational power of mental imagery. Alcohol misuse is a high prevalence problem with substantial health and social impacts. This study examines the additive effect of embedding FIT techniques within MI when treating Alcohol Use Disorder.

A total of 480 participants who are drinking &gt;4 standard drinks per day on  average and who meet criteria for DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of the following three treatment
groups:

1. Motivational Interviewing (MI)  delivered by phone in 2 calls over 1 week. Treatment contact time totals 2 hours. Participants discuss the advantages and feasibility of reducing drinking, and therapists elicit emotional reactions and dissonance between core values and current behaviour.

2. Motivational Interviewing plus Support (MI+S)  delivered by phone in 8 calls over 25 weeks. Treatment contact time totals 3.5 hours. MI+S has the same initial sessions as MI. Later calls offer non-specific support and social reinforcement for progress and encourage brief relaxation practice, but do not shape new coping strategies unless a lapse occurs. A smartphone app assists practice of progressive muscular relaxation, including an audio file to guide practice and photos of peaceful nature scenes.

Participants complete assessments at Baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-Baseline. Follow-up assessors are blind to treatment condition.</summary>
