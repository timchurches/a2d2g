  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this within-subject crossover study, healthy subjects will consume two different diets with varying food insulin index (FII) on two separate occasions. The washout period in between the low FII and high FII diets will be at least 7 days. Each test diet will comprise breakfast, morning snack and lunch, which will be carefully designed to be healthy western diet reflecting adherence to the average adult energy requirement in Australia (energy percentage for carbohydrate 50%, protein 20%, fat 30%).  The high FII diet will comprise white bread, yogurt and eggs for breakfast, cookie and Mars bar for morning snack and whole-meal bread, cheese and baked beans for lunch. The low FII diet will comprise grain bread, milk and All-bran cereal for breakfast, walnuts and raisins for morning snack, corn, roast chicken and tortillas for lunch. Both diets will be matched for macronutrient composition, glycemic index and fiber content, but two-fold difference in FII values.

On each occasion, breakfast, snack meal and lunch will be consumed by subjects at 0800, 1100 and 1300 during the 8-hour test session. Finger-prick blood samples will be collected before meal (0 min) and every 30 mins after starting eating the meals and assayed for glucose and insulin.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this within-subject crossover study conducted in healthy subjects, we investigate the effect of two diets with high and low insulin demand, as predicted by food insulin index (FII) of the component foods, on day-long profiles of blood glucose and insulin. Two diets will be consumed on two separate occasions and both diets will be matched for macronutrients, fiber and glycemic index. 

On each occasion, participants will consume breakfast meal, morning snack and lunch over 8-h testing period. Finger-prick blood sample will be collected every 30 min after starting eating the meal and assayed for glucose and insulin. We hypothesize that the diet with high insulin demand will produce significantly higher insulin profile compared with the diet with low insulin demand even though two diets have the same macronutrient compositions.</summary>
