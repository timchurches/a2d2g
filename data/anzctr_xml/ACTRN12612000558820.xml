  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study intervention is the application of the screening tool by a CHF nurse clinician. The screening tool assesses physical, cognitive and emotional functioning as key determinants of CHF self-care. For each of the three domains the patients level of functioning is quantified as low, medium or high. In this manner, low functioning indicates the individual is at greater risk of inadequate self-care ability and will require more intensive strategies than an individual with high functioning. The screening tool is administered to each participant once only and is administered by the CHF nurse at their first home visit following recruitment to the study. The screening tool takes approximately10 minutes to administer. The screening tool provides the nurse clinician with recommendations on the frequency of contact, symptom monitoring and most appropriate educational and counselling approaches to adopt in promoting and supporting patient self-care. For example, if a patient is screened as low self-care ability on the cognitive domain it is recommended that the CHF nurse has weekly contact with the patient via home visits or telephone support. The overall duration of the intervention is 3 months.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be 18 years of age or older and have a confirmed diagnosis of CHF. Confirmation of the diagnosis will be from: 1) symptoms and clinical features of congestion that occur at rest or on minimal effort (dyspnoea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, fatigue, palpitations, elevated jugular venous pressure, cardiomegaly, lung crepitations, hepatomegaly, oedema); 2) either objective evidence of underlying structural cardiac dysfunction that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood or an elevated plasma level of B-type natriuretic Peptide (BNP), &gt;200 pg/mL. Participants will have been referred and enrolled into the CHFMP which is conducted across Eastern health.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>All patients who meet the study criteria and are enrolled into a CHF management program (CHFMP) across Eastern Health will be approached and recruited over a 16 month time period. A research associate (RA) working closely with the CHF nurses will screen and recruit participants.  Once participants have consented to the study a detailed history will be collected by the RA and pre-test assessments conducted. Each CHFMP program (Box Hill, Maroondah and Angliss) has been randomly assigned to a group and sequence of testing as outlined below (other design features). Participants are allocated to the respective study group according to the location of the CHFMP (Box Hill, Maroondah or Angliss hospitals). The RA will notify the respective CHF nurses of participants recruited. The CHF nurses at the Angliss and BoxHill hospitals will administer the screening tool during their first home visit and use the recommendations to develop an individualised nursing care plan. Participants who are recruited into the Maroondah CHFMP will have the self-care screening tool administered by the RA. In this manner, the Maroondah nurse clinicians are concealed of their patients screening and level of functioning.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The provision of education, counselling and support directed at enhancing patient self-care skills is an important aspect in the longterm management of chronic heart failure (CHF). This study builds upon CIA Cameron's PhD program of research that identified factors that predicted CHF self-care [1-3]. 
The proposed study will evaluate a unique screening tool that complements the existing nursing assessment, helping to identify an individuals level of CHF self-care ability according to three domains: physical, emotional and cognitive functioning, and patient clinical characteristics. The implementation of this screening tool will guide health care professionals in determining if the patient is at low, medium or high risk of inadequate CHF self-care, thereby permitting sophisticated monitoring and serving as a basis for developing individualised plans of care, including educational and behavioural strategies directed at promoting self-care. In this manner, tailoring education and follow-up strategies to individual need and ability may further enhance the clinical status of patients, ensuring that these vulnerable patients remain in their community for longer periods.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical application of the CHF self-care assessment tool. 
The research will be conducted at the Eastern Health sites that conduct a CHF management program (Box Hill, Maroondah and Angliss hospitals). Recruitment to the study will be conducted over a 16 month period. A research associate from Eastern Healths Cardiology Research Department will recruit approximately 240 patients from the three CHF management programs within Eastern Health.</summary>
