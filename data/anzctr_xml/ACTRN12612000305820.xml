  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with continuous propofol infusion has been successfully used for liver transplantation (LT). In these reports, a significant increase in propofol plasma concentration was observed in the anhepatic phase; it may lead to over dosage of propofol and compromise the intraoperative hemodynamics. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) device allow anesthesiologists to provide excellent anesthesia by controlling the theoretical concentration of the drug. Wu et al., had demonstrated that the Marsh pharmacokinetic model of TCI is not suitable for LT patients, and suggested that anesthesiologists should use an effective parameter, such as the bispectral index (BIS), spectral entropy or auditory evoked potential (AEP) monitoring, as another guide of propofol to control the TCI pump during LT. In addition, regarding the propofol pharmacokinetics during the anhepatic phase, a case series advocates the usefulness of BIS monitoring to titrate propofol infusion when using TCI anesthesia. 
The composite A-line autoregressive index (AAI) of the AEP monitoring has been studied as an adequate method to monitor anesthetic depth.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate the influence of perioperative anesthetic management and postoperative recovery of TIVA with propofol anesthesia compared to inhalation anesthesia with desflurane during LT.</summary>
