  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, biologic activity, and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral SD 101 injections
      in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma or
      recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      Phase 1 of this trial is a modified 3+3 dose escalation study evaluating escalating or
      intermediate dose levels of SD-101 given with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab in patients with
      metastatic melanoma.

      Phase 2 of this study will consist of 4 expansion cohorts to further evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of SD-101 given in combination with pembrolizumab in specific melanoma and HNSCC
      populations: For each of the indications in melanoma and HNSCC 2 separate cohorts will be
      recruited, those who are anti-programmed death receptor-1/ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/L1) therapy
      naïve and those who have progressive disease (PD) while receiving anti-PD-1/L1 therapy.</summary>
