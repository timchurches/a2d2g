  <interventions>
    <interventions>Laparoscopic surgery which involves puncture of the abdomen at 4 sites, inflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxode, a review  of the structures and disease and excision of the disease in the surgical arm. In the placebo surgery arm control group, scoring of disease and infusion saline fluid is used post-surgery in the placebo surgery arm.  The surgery is then repeated again 6 months after the 1st surgery (crossover) with scoring and excision of disease in both groups.  Therefore there is a 6 month washout period.  Patients are then followed up for 1 year with interview and questionnaire.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will have surgery - 4 puncture laparoscopy with visualisation and scoring of endometriosis at the index surgery. Infusion with normal saline a drain placed in the abdomen and sent to recover as per the surgery arm.  Six months later all patients undergo a second surgery, and any disease is scored and excised in the control group, as per the active surgery group.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Women who met the inclusion criteria were assessed in the outpatient department of a large district general hospital. Either the consultant or research fellow conducting the clinic discussed the various options for treatment with patients. If the patient requested surgical intervention, then they were informed of the research study. Further information regarding the study was given to them by the primary researcher and included the following:
1)	The format of the study, which required two surgical procedures.
2)	The fact that one of their surgical procedures would be a diagnostic procedure and may not provide them with any direct medical benefit.
3)	That participation in the trial was voluntary and their medical care would not be affected in any way if they did not participate.
4)	That their treating doctor would be unable to give any information to them, their family, or their general practitioner until the completion of the trial period.
5)	That they would not be able to see their treating doctor or ask any questions about the procedure until after the completion of the trial period.
6)	That a doctor whom they had not met and was not participating in their surgical management would care for them in the post-operative setting.
7)	That they would have the same drain, catheter, intravenous fluid lines and analgesia machines at each surgical intervention.
8)	That they would be able to request removal of their lines and discharge themselves, pending medical suitability.
9)	That they would be given written information regarding the study (see appendix B) and could discuss their participation with their partner, family or medical practitioner.
10)	That they could discuss any aspect of the study with their general practitioner or other medical professional not involved with the study.
11)	That at the end of the study period, they would meet the principal researcher (JA) after completing a final questionnaire and would have a full physical examination. At this time, any questions relating to the study would be addressed and the order of procedures explained to the participant. 
12)	A letter to the general practitioner would be sent at the conclusion of the study outlining the order of procedures, with a copy of the operation reports sent at this time. 
Having met the entry criteria, women who consented to participate in the study were asked to complete an initial questionnaire providing demographic data, parity, gynaecologic and menstrual history, medical and surgical history, analgesia usage, previous treatments for suspected or confirmed endometriosis, and infertility treatments. Allocation upon randomisation was concealed by sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was by computer generated randomisation blocks, with the entry number concealed in an opaque envelope. The number was then entered into a computer database, with the randomisation group being exposed after patient details were entered. Patients were listed for surgery as soon as possible after allocation. Patients were advised that they could withdraw from the study at any time without their medical care being affected.</sequence>

    <summary>Aim: To assess the role of laparoscopic excision of endometriosis in women who have confirmed disease, and assess pain and quality of life (QoL) outcomes at 6 and 12 months following surgery. 

Methods: A double blind randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Women were randomised to an immediate or a delayed group. In the immediate group, women received laparoscopic excision of endometriosis at the time of first surgery and then a second look laparoscopy, with or without excision of additional disease 6 months later. In the delayed surgery group, women received a staging laparoscopy without excision at the time of first surgery, followed by laparoscopic excision of endometriosis 6 months later. Pain was assessed by dichotomous and continuous variables and QoL was assessed using the EuroQOL, SF-12 and sexual activity questionnaires.

Patients: 52 women with suspected endometriosis were randomised in the study. 

Results: Three women withdrew before surgery owing to pregnancy; three without reason and seven were excluded following surgery when endometriosis was not confirmed. The remaining 39 women were operated on and the results analyses by intention to treat. At 6 months following surgery 1, 6/19 women (32%) in the delayed surgery group reported an improvement in symptoms, and 13/19 (68%) reported no improvement in symptoms. In the immediate surgery group, 16/20 (80%) reported an improvement in symptoms, and 4/20 (20%) reported no improvement in symptoms. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.002). There was a significant improvement in many aspects of quality of life for women in the immediate surgery group compared to baseline, but no significant improvement for women in the delayed surgery group. Three women in the immediate surgery group became pregnant following their first surgery and did not have surgery 2. At 6 months following surgery 2, 15/18 women (83%) in the delayed surgery group reported an improvement in symptoms, and 3/18 (17%) reported no improvement in symptoms. The other woman in this group required treatment at surgery 1 due to severe disease. In the immediate surgery group, 8/15 (53%) of women reported a change in symptoms at 6 months following surgery 2, and 7/15 women (47%) reported no improvement in symptoms. There were 3 women pregnant in this group, one withdrawal following surgery, but before final follow-up and one women who had a complication at surgery 1 and did not have second surgery. There were significant improvements in all aspects of quality of life in both groups at the end of the study compared to baseline. 

Conclusion: Laparoscopic excision of endometriosis for women appears to be effective in reducing pain symptoms and improving quality of life compared to placebo. Surgery is associated with a 30% placebo response rate that is not dependent on severity of disease. Approximately 20% of women do not report an improvement following surgery for endometriosis. There is a significant improvement in many aspects of quality of life following surgery for endometriosis compared to placebo.</summary>
