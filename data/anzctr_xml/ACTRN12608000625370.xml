  <interventions>
    <interventions>Music Therapy is a treatment that the patient uses music, sounds, voice and musical instruments in a therapeutic process to develop his capacities and his difficulties. The treatment is focused in the relation between patient- music therapist. Thus, music, sounds, voice and musical instruments are the way to promote health benefits for the patient. In this study, each patient will receive 20 sessions of treatment. Each session lasts 30 minutes and happens once a week. Before starting the consultations, all patients will be assessed by Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). In the next moment, it will be executed the randomization and division of patients into two groups (experimental group and control group). After, patients in the experimental group will receive the treatment. Then, the participants in the experimental group and control group will be evaluated again by CARS. Finally, the control group will receive treatment the same way that the experimental group.</interventions>
    <comparator>Hospital Care Activities (consultations, examinations, nutritional guidance, for example). The Hospital Care Activities will happen two or three times a month. These activities will run for 20 weeks ( the same length of the music therapeutic process for the experimental group). The control group will receive music therapy soon after the end of the sessions in the experimental group.</comparator>

    <concealment>The research subjects are  members of the population of children with Austism Spectrum Disorder in the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Program(PROTID) in Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Subjects will be chosen by the  simple random sampling criteria, using a table of random numbers. Thus, only 24 subjects will be selected among all the subjects of the population who are framed in the inclusion criteria.The randomization will be implemented by a health professional who is not involved in the research. This person organizing the names of patients in alphabetical order. In the  next moment, he will provide a number for each patient. The numbers are from 1 to 24. After, the health professional will put these 24 issues in the Pepi 4.0, making the randomization of the 24 participants into two groups(both with 12 participants). Then, he will organize a list of  patients in the experimental group and a list for patients in the control group. The list  of 12 patients in the experimental group will be delivered to the two music therapists that will make the attendances.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aimed to investigate the effects of psychodynamic music therapy in verbal, nonverbal and social communication skills of children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to compare individuals treated with psychodynamic music therapy and standard treatment (routine procedures including medical examinations and consultations). The three outcomes were assessed, before and after interventions, with the Brazilian version of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS-BR). Although as a whole the results did not show statistically significant differences between the groups, the stratified analysis of ASD type showed a positive influence of psychodynamic music therapy in patients with autistic disorder, when compared to patients with the same diagnostics who received standard treatment. The findings on the influence of psychodynamic music therapy in communication skills of autistic patients are not conclusive, but this study confirmed previously reported RCT showing possible benefits of music therapy on nonverbal communication skills of children with autistic disorder.</summary>
