  <interventions>
    <interventions>The LEAD project has a mixed-method, observational cohort design. The quantitative arm comprises a patient survey, a review of general practice records, and a case-note analysis of hospital records to collect data relevant to the four time intervals. The qualitative arm comprises interviews with lung cancer patients, general practitioners (GPs) and hospital specialists. Data will be collected once only at the time of data collection and the period of observation in each participant will be from the patient noticing symptoms to the commencement of first treatment</interventions>
    <comparator>The study will compare  the differences between CALD and Anglo-Australian patients in the four time intervals along the lung cancer diagnostic and pre-treatment pathway.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The first primary outcome variable is the length of the appraisal interval along the cancer diagnostic and pre-treatment pathway. The definition and measurement of this interval are guided by the Models of Pathway to Treatment (Walter et al., 2012). This time interval will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and will be compared between the two patient groups using a log-rank test. Data will be collected through the patient survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once only at the time of data collection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second primary outcome variable is the length of the help-seeking interval along the cancer diagnostic and pre-treatment pathway. The definition and measurement of this interval are guided by the Models of Pathway to Treatment (Walter et al., 2012). This time interval will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and will be compared between the two patient groups using a log-rank test. Data will be collected through the patient survey and the GP review.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once only at the time of data collection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The third outcome variable is the length of the diagnostic and the pre-treatment intervals along the cancer diagnostic and pre-treatment pathway. The definition and measurement of these intervals are guided by the Models of Pathway to Treatment (Walter et al., 2012). These time intervals will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and will be compared between the two patient groups using a log-rank test. Data will be collected through the GP review and the case-note analysis of hospital medical records. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Once only at the time of data collection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The first group of secondary outcome is patients' cancer and demographic variables. These include type and staging of cancer, patients' attitudes and beliefs, English proficiency, education levels, etc. Data will be collected through the patient survey, the case-note analysis, and the patient interview.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once only at the time of data collection.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second group of secondary outcome is heath care provider related variables. These include  GP demographics and billing practices, types of specialists seen, etc. Data will be collected through the GP review, the case-note analysis and interviews with GPs and specialists.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once only at the time of data collection.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The third group of secondary outcome is health system related variables . These include involvement of a multidisciplinary team, types and places of investigations undertaken, etc.Data will be collected through the case-note analysis and interviews with GPs and specialists. </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The patients need to meet two inclusion criterion: (1) be diagnosed with primary lung cancer at the study sites within the past month or during the recruitment phase, and (2) be CALD or Anglo-Australian patients. CALD patients are those who speak one of the following five languages at home or listing these languages as their preferred language: Greek, Italian, Vietnamese, Arabic and Chinese (including Cantonese and Mandarin). Anglo-Australian patients are those (1) being born in Australia or other major English-speaking countries (Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the US), and (2) listing English as their preferred language. </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Quantitative arm: Data from the patient survey, the GP review and the case-note analysis will be entered into separate databases. For patients who return the survey and provide consent for access to their hospital and general practice medical records, a unique participant ID will be created, which will be used to link data from the three databases. For those who do not provide consent, no data linkage will be performed. The four time intervals will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and will be compared between the two patient groups using a log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model will be performed to examine any associations between the time intervals and patient, healthcare provider, and health systems factors. Chi-square tests will be used to compare categorical variables between the two groups. Exploratory analyses may be performed by adjusting for patients characteristics using logistic regression. These analyses will be conducted using SPSS 24.
Quantitative arm: All interviews will be audio-taped, and transcription, translation, coding, and analysis will occur concurrently with data collection. Thematic analysis will be conducted using a constant comparative method to identify similarities and differences in the content (Ryan &amp; Bernard, 2003). Data will be analysed inductively and deductively. The interviews will then be incorporated into NVivo ver.10 for more structured coding and analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the diagnostic and treatment pathways between Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) and Anglo-Australian lung cancer patients.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and be diagnosed with primary lung cancer at the study sites within the past month or during the recruitment phase.
Study details
You will be asked to complete a patient survey and/or have a face-to-face interview with the researcher. We will also ask whether we can access your hospital medical records and contact your GP for medical information related to your cancer diagnosis.
Study significance
This study will provide important information about the barriers existing along the lung cancer pathway from symptom appraisal to treatment in CALD populations and is essential to any future intervention to improve early diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer.</summary>
