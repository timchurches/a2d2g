  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three groups of participants with 5 in each will be recruited over period of 12 months to confirm the efficacy in this pilot study. A fourth group will receive sham granules. 
The participants will need to take 6g of herbal/sham granules twice/day for 14 consecutive days at the participant's home. Herbal granules will be taken orally. Compliance will be recorded using a sleep diary with an intervention compliance tick box.
For the intervention arms participants will be randomised to take one of the following formulas (herbal groups): 
1. Chai Hu (Radix Bupleuri), Xiang Fu (Cyperus Tuber), Bai Shao (Paeonia lactiflora Pall) , Zhi Ke (Fructus Citri Aurantii), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum striatum), and Gan Cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch), 
2. Chai Hu (Radix Bupleuri), Bai Shao (Paeonia lactiflora Pall), Sheng Di (Radix Rehmanniae) , Du Zhong (Cortex Eucommiae), Fu Shen (Sclerotum Poriae Cocos Paradicis), Suan Zao Ren (Semen Zizyphi Spinosae), Ye Jiao Teng (Caulis Polygoni Multiflori), Dan Sheng (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), Yu Jin (Radix Curcumae) 
3. Ye Jiao Teng (Caulis Polygoni Multiflori) and Suan Zao Ren (Semen Zizyphi Spinosae) </interventions>
    <comparator>The control arm will be sham herbal granules which contain only 10% of the dosage of the intervention granules and 90% starch. This is not a placebo and the 10% dosage serves to reinforce blinding of participants and believed to be a non therapeutic dosage.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Insomnia is a very common sleep disorder, which is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early awakening, and interrupted or non-restorative sleep. Additionally, there is clinically significant impairment in daytime function, including poor concentration, memory, and work efficacy. Stress is a strong predict factor and thus closely associated with the onset of chronic insomnia, and its related anxiety forms a vicious cycle to further affect sleep quality and daytime efficiency.
While 85% of the general population reports a complaint of difficulty falling and/or staying asleep, about 10% present chronic insomnia and seek medical help. The common side effects of sleeping aids or sleeping medication prescribed by the GP or provided by the pharmacist are drowsiness and headache during the day, which significantly affects daily time performance of tasks. This side effect prevents the patients from continuing such treatment, if no dependence has been developed. Abuse can happen by using such medications.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) uses different theoretical system explantion and thus has a different approach to address insomnia due to stress. It is considered to be due to heat in the heart, liver and kidney, which causes restless nerves. Additional symptoms recognised by the TCM diagnosis include uneasy dreams, waking up between 1 -3am, and not feeling refreshed in the morning.
According to the herbal practice by our team members, we have developed three new herbal concoctions which aim to calm the body and nerves. The concoctions were developed based on the characteristics of the individual herbs as well as the ancient concoction recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. In addition, a TGA listed concoction for stress management will also be used, which can improve sleep quality in patients with stress. We want to know which one works most effectively to carry out a large scale clinical trial on it.</summary>
