  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of the trial was to determine whether Dose Administration Aids improve veteran outcomes and to characterise which veterans will benefit most from using a DAA. A randomised controlled trial with one year's follow-up was conducted involving Australian war veterans and war widow/ers from selected rural and urban areas of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. Veterans were randomly allocated to have thier medication packed in a DAA by thier community pharmacy (intervention arm) or to recieve thier medication in the original packaging (control). Due to the nature of the intervention it was not possible to blind participants to the study conditions.  The main outcomes were change in severity of illness and adherence.</summary>
