  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>We are evaluating healthy women with macromastia that will be submitted to mammary reduction</healthcondition>
    <healthcondition>All patients have macromastia and are in level I of American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification.</healthcondition>
    <healthcondition>Macromastia has an impact on orthopedic problems. We will evaluate the impact  of macromastia and mammary reduction over respiratory system.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The measuring of compliance and oxygenation were carried out in four stages.  After 10 minutes of mechanical ventilation, before the start of surgery, static compliance was measured and hemogasometry was carried out. Immediately after the first stage, a recruitment maneuver was applied and 10 minutes later static compliance was measured and hemogasometry was carried out to complete the second stage. At the end of the surgery, static compliance was measured and hemogasometry was carried out again. Then a new recruitment maneuver was applied to complete the third stage. Ten minutes later, static compliance was measured and hemogasometry was carried out to complete the fourth stage. The mammary reduction was made by bilateral resection of the breast - super-medial,  pediculo's technique which is used normally to reduce the breast symmetrically. The lung and the chest have a impedance which  can be measured by the compliance and resistence. The reduction of the breast was measured by the weight  and the respiratory system impedance was measured with a inspiratory pause at the respirator. Every surgery had a mean of 270 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Not applicable as this is a single group study.

All patients are a self control comparison. The measuring will be compared at the beginning, half and the end of the surgery.</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: surgery</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The respiratory system impedance were assessed by the respirator with a inspiratory pause in volume-controlled ventilation mode by a physical therapist. The partial pressure of O2 and Co2 were assessed by the gas analyzers</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measure of respiratory system impedance and partial pressure of O2 and Co2 
1- After the intubation 
2- After 60 minutes of surgery
3- After 120 minutes of surgery
4- At the end of surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life. We evaluated the quality of life with SF-36 questionnaire before and after the surgery. The questionnaire was applied by the researcher.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The questionnaire was applied before the surgery at the first consult and 3 months after the surgery.</timepoint>

    <summary>Patients with macromastia were submitted to mammary reduction and we assessed the impact of this procedure in respiratory system impedance. We hypothesized that this reduction could improve the respiratory system impedance. All patients were recruited in Brazil.</summary>
