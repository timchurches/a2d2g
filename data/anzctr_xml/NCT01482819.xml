  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Corneal Swelling - measured in microns using the Optical Low Coherence Reflectometry (OLCR) Pachymeter. This pachymeter gives corneal thickness measurements to the accuracy of 1 micron (Âµm)</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 8 hours of lens wear</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Limbal Redness - grade scale of 0 to 4, where 0=None, 1=Trace, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe; reported as an average grade.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 8 hours of lens wear</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Endothelia Blebs - 0 to 100% of area; measured as a percentage of corneal area with blebs.</outcome>
