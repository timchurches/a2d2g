  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This was a double-blinded, randomized, vehicle-controlled study in sporadic superficial BCC
      (sBCC) and nodular BCC (nBCC) patients which consisted of a 21-day screening period, a
      treatment period of 6 weeks (topical 0.75% LDE225 cream application b.i.d) ending with post
      treatment biopsies, as safety visit one week after final study drug administration (Day 50),
      a visit on Day 83 for excision of the treated BCC, and an end of study evaluation (Day 90).</summary>
