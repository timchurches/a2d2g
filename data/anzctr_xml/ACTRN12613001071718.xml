  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Elevation of serum levels of myocardial enzymes is considered to be a specific finding for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, many other conditions have been proposed to affect the level of these enzymes. This study was designed to determine the changes in the levels of LDH, SGOT, CPK and CK-MB in patients who undergo urological surgery with no medical history of myocardial disease.   </summary>
