  <interventions>
    <interventions>Inhaled Salmeterol/fluticasone (all groups);
This study will compare four brief asthma management strategies for delivery by general practitioners (GPs) during normal consultations.</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control group GPs will deliver usual care.  The GPs will provide a written asthma action plan for each patient at baseline and review the patient's level of asthma control and the written asthma action plan with the patient at week 4.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>GPs:
Access to a computer and email in the practice.
Patients:
Exclusion criteria:
(a) asthma exacerbation (oral corticosteroids (OCS), emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalisation) in the last month
(b) other major respiratory disease e.g. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), or serious uncontrolled medical condition
(c) Symbicort Single inhaler Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (SMART) therapy
(d) shift work with a variable roster
(e) pregnancy* or lactation
(f) clinically-important visual or auditory impairment
*The management of females who become pregnant during the study should be according to clinical need.  Due to the possibility that treatment may need to be changed, patients becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. However, since all participants will already be using ICS/LABA, no pregnancy test is required at study start.</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a 6-month cluster randomized controlled trial. GPs will be individually randomised, with each GP's patients representing one cluster. 
GPs:
GPs will be recruited by letter of invitation from their Division of General Practice. Treatment allocation will be by a computer-generated random code. GPs will be advised that the study is comparing four different management strategies, but to avoid unblinding, they will only be given information about the strategies for their own randomisation group. 
Patients:
Patients will be recruited by reception staff of participating GPs in order to minimise bias. The GP will check patients’ eligibility criteria and obtain written informed consent. Patients will be allocated their treatment on the basis of their GP’s randomisation. The GP will provide the patient with the Participant Information Statement, which to avoid unblinding will only contain information relevant to their own randomisation group.

The person who will determine if a GP is eligible for inclusion in the trial will be unaware, when this decision is made, to which group the GP will be allocated. 

Allocation of GPs will be by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>GPs will be individually randomised, with each GP's patients representing one cluster. Randomisation of GPs will be by a computer-generated random code, with a minimisation algorithm to ensure (1) a balance of GP locations by socio-economic area and (2) a balance of previous asthma/COPD management training in the past 12 months (3) a balance of second language spoken (English or other). GPs will be randomised separately to active and control groups for the two interventions, using a 2x2 factorial design.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main goal of asthma treatment is to achieve good asthma control. This cluster randomised trial will test the effectiveness of two brief asthma management interventions, delivered by GPs, for improving asthma control in primary care. The effect of both interventions separately and their interaction will be tested by multiple linear regression.</summary>
