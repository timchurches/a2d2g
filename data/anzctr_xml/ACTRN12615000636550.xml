    <interventions>Group I:   " Wound catheter continuous infusion group (CWCs) 30 patient":
 wound catheter was inserted before closure of wound.
Technique:
  Two multi-orifice catheters were implanted by the surgeon  into the subcutaneous layer on both sides of the surgical incision.  The catheters were embedded into the wound to a length of approximately 6 - 10 cm and secured to the skin. A loading dose  10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine  was infused through each  catheter just before closure of the incisional site.  Analgesia was maintained by  infusing 0.25% bupivacaine at a rate of 4 mL/h through two catheters (2 mL/hour per catheter) through electric infusion pump for 48 hours. 
Group II: "Rectus Sheath Catheters group (RSCs) 30 patient":                                                                                   Rectus sheath catheters were inserted bilaterally by the aid of ultrasonography  at the end of surgery.
Technique:
   The upper abdomen was prepared with 2% betadine, then the rectus muscle is imaged with a sheathed ultrasound probe in a longitudinal orientation above the level of the umbilicus. The probe  was broadband (5-12MHz), 50 mm foot-print ,  linear array with an imaging depth of 4-6 cm.  At first ultra-sonography probe identified the lina alba, then it was moved laterally to demonstrate the main body of the rectus abdominis muscle and the posterior rectus sheath, then 18G Tuohy needle was introduced few millimeters from the probe using an in plane technique  at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the skin just below the costal margin. The ultrasound  allowed identification of the rectus muscle and posterior rectus sheath and fascia transversalis (two hyperechoic railway-like lines deep to it ).  The needle tip was advanced to the desired position between the rectus muscle and the underlying posterior rectus sheath then 20 mL bupivacaine 0.25% (loading dose) were injected creating a space for the rectus sheath catheter  to be introduced, causing hydro-dissection of the rectus muscle away from the posterior rectus sheath, and 4-8 cm of catheter was left in this space. The catheter depth at the skin is usually 12-15cm. To avoid interference with the surgical field the rest of the catheter was tunneled laterally.  The same was repeated on the other side. Analgesia was maintained by injecting 10 ml bupivacaine 0.25% on each side every 6 h in the first 24 h postoperatively then every 12 h in the second 24 h to maintain analgesia. The catheters were removed after 48 hours post-operative.

    <statisticalmethods>    The sample size calculation was found to be N &gt; 27 for each study group based on the following criteria; 95% confidence limit, 80% power of the study, ratio of cases to control is 1:1, expected outcome ranging between 70-95%.  
     The data were analyzed using SPSS (version 20); quantitative data were expressed as mean +/- SD (age, weight, duration of anesthesia, HR and MAP) and analyzed using independent-t-test for comparison between the two groups. F Test was used for comparison within the same group and Tukey's test is used as post hoc test. The non-parametric data (the VAS at rest, VAS at movement and patient satisfaction) which did not follow the normal distribution were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test for comparison between the two groups and Kruskal Willis H test for comparison within the same group. While, the sex, number of patients who needed supplemental injection, and complications were expressed as (number %). P&lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>
