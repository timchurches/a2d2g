  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the role of Magnesium supplementation in depression that is resistant to standard treatment. 10 participants who have a confirmed history of treatment non-response while on Medication  will be recruited into this small pilot study. 

participants will take a 1600mg a day divided Magnesium dose in addition to standard medication treatment for a maximum of 8 weeks following a standard protocol in which participants will be subject to pre and post clinical symptom measures. 

this study aims to provide a preliminary investigation of the value of Magnesium supplement adjuvant treatment for resistant depression. </summary>
