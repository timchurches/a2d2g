  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will self-collect a vaginal sample following the supplied instruction sheet and using a supplied  dry flocked swab, followed by a healthcare practitioner collecting a cervical sample using a cervical collection device (brush/broom) of the practitioner's choice and placing that device in a vial of collection media (PreservCyt). Both samples wil be collected within the same clinic visit before being be tested for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) nucleic acid. There is no intervention, this study is simply about quatifying the relative sensitivity of self-collected samples compared with best practice practitioner collected samples</interventions>
    <comparator>Each women will supply two samples, one that was self-collected and the other which was practitioner collected. The practitioner collected specimen is the standard practice for collection of a cervical sample for HPV nucleic acid testing and will be used as the control sample</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare self-collected versus practitioner collected samples for HPV-based cervical cancer screening.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or above, and are attending an appointment for a colposcopic procedure.

Study details
All participants in this study will attend a single clinical appointment, during which time they will self-collect a vaginal sample using a dry flocked swab. Following this, a healthcare practitioner will collect a cervical sample using a cervical collection device (brush/broom). Both samples will be tested for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) nucleic acid, and the results compared. The study will also examine the rate of invalid HPV results for both the self-collected and practitioner-collected samples.

This study will contribute information on the sensitivity of a self collected sample for HPV-based cervical screening and may contribute to this method being adopted as part of the new HPV-based national cervical screening program due to begin in late 2017.
