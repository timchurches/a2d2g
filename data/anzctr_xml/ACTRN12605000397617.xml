    <studytitle>Towards better assessment and treatment of exercise induced wheeze</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Comprehensive assessment of patients with exercise induced wheeze using pulmonary function testing, bronchial challenge testing (methacholine and Mannitol) and exhaled nitric oxide.  A comparison of either inhaled steroids or a cross-over study of cromoglycate, montelukast and formoterol</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following comprehensive assessment, patients with exercise induced symptoms will be divided into two groups according to their baseline exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO). Those with a high FeNO (&gt;35ppb) will receive inhaled fluticasone for 6 weeks. </interventions>
    <comparator>Those with a low FeNO (&lt;35ppb) will enter a random-order, placebo-controlled cross-over study of montelukast, cromoglycate and formoterol (2 weeks each with a 1 week wash out between treatments).</comparator>

    <interventioncode>None</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Each treatment will be deemed a success if, compared to baseline: 1. There is a &gt;50% attenuation of any fall in FEV1 following exertion. 2. there is a 1 point improvement in the patient's Borg breathlessness scale. 3. There is a 0.5% improvement in a patient's asthma control questionnaire score.  Baseline measurements will be compared with measurements taken at the conclusion of each treatment period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at the conclusion of each treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The predictive accuracy of each of the baseline measurements will be computed for each of the three primary outcome measures, this time measured as continuous variables. Positive and negative predictive values will be derived from ROC curve analyses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Comparisons will be made between baseline data and data collected at the end of each treatment period.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise induced symptoms are common especially in patients with asthma.  There are several possible treatments for exercise induced wheeze.  This study aims to provide further evidence to help GPs decide on which treatment is best for an individual patient</summary>
