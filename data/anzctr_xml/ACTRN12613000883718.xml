  <interventions>
    <interventions>Aim: To determine if a personalized future body shape image can increase motivation to adhere to a diet and exercise regimen. Objective: To conduct a randomized controlled trial with the Future Me application. Method: 1.In this randomized controlled trial participants must provide Informed consent 2.The participants will be randomized in to two arms to receive the images immediately or after 8 weeks. Images will be generated on an ipad mini device and printed on a colour printer for the participant. 3.All participants will receive photo of their body shape as it might appear at 4,8,12, 26 and 52 weeks in the future. They will receive dietary advice from a 15 minute consultation with a general practitioner or counsellor at the weight watchers group as per : National Health and Medical Research Council (2013) Clinical practice guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in adults, adolescents and children in Australia. The images provided will show the whole body as it might appear if the participant adhered to a diet and exercise program. 4.The participants will be weighed at weekly intervals for 16 weeks after recruitment. This will be the proxy measure of compliance with the diet and exercise program. The participants will also be encouraged to maintain a food diary and document their exercise program. 
5. At the 16 week mark, half of the participants will be randomly selected to receive a new photo image, while the remaining subjects will carry on with their original images. the participants will be followed up for a further 8 weeks.
6.A small number of participants will be invited to join a focus group 6.The effect of the intervention will be assessed by analyzing quantitative data and interview transcripts</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Eligible participants are people with BMI greater than 25 (overweight) and seeking advise about weight loss. 
They should be able to provide informed consent.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>People attending a session at the Weight Watchers Federation WA or at the general practice clinic at Murray Medical Center, Woodvale park or clients at the Mandurah Recreation Centre or staff and students at Curtin University who are seeking weight loss advice will be eligible to participate. The interested participants will be provided with Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form. Total of 150 participants will be enrolled in the study and they will be randomized into two arms with 75 participants in each arm: a. One arm will receive the intervention immediately or b. One arm will receive the intervention after 8 weeks. At 16 weeks both arms will be randomised and one group will receive the intervention again. Allocation will be concealed as the participants will be centrally randomised by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>The study will be randomized using a randomized table created by computer software (i.e. computer sequence generation)

The total of 80 participants enrolled in the study will be randomized using this computer software into two arms.
