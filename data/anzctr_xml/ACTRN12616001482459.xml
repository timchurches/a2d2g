    <interventions>Cross sectional, observational, non-randomised pilot study where all subjects wear the Firefly Monitoring Device (TIP3) overnight for 6 consecutive nights at home. The Firefly Monitoring Device is a noninvasive logging device designed to detect symptoms of hypoglycaemia utilising multiple sensors. It consists of a wrist band and parameters monitored include physiological tremor, temperature, and coarse limb movements.
With increasing hypoglycaemia the parameters monitored by the device are integrated and processed by a computational algorithm in this observational study.

Firefly is currently recruiting and conducting this study in Adelaide through CMAX (a division of IDT Australia Ltd).  The study is being conducted over 7 days in children and teenagers, with the Friefly device worn overnight for 6 nights.   The Firefly device is worn just prior to bedtime and worn overnight until the participant wakes up in the morning.  When the Firefly device is not connected to the participant's wrist, it is connected to the tablet which has been given to the participant to charge the device and also upload data from the device, this also confirms the device was working properly on the previous night.   

On Day 1, commencement of the study, a medical staff member undertakes the screening process to confirm eligibility and consent, demonstrates the instructions for use of the Firefly Device and also fits the participant with the continous glucose monitor (CGM) on the abdomen of the pariticipant.  A diary is given to the parent/carer of the participant which is required to track daily activities, adherence of Firefly device being worn overnight and also timing of blood glucose level (BGL) readings per day.  First BGL is taken 1 hour after the participant is fitted with the CGM and before the participant goes home to continue the study.   At least 4 BGL readings are required per day before meals and bedtime for calibration of the CGM.  The CGM is important in this study to assess the effectiveness  of the Firefly device in monitoring signs of hypoglycaemia and to assist with the refinement of the algorithm within the device that generates the alerts.  On Day 3 the parents/carers of the participants receive a call from a CMAX staff member to confirm adherence to the study protocol and ensure no difficulties with the devices, no adverse events and to provide any assistance if necessary.  On Day 7, completion of the study, the CGM sensor is removed from a medical staff member and all diaries and devices are collected and data uploaded by the clinical staff member onto the study computer,  A questionnaire is also handed by the clinical staff member to the parent/carer of the participant with regards to comfort and 'ease of use' of the Firefly device and any adverse events.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to obtain overnight exploratory data using the Firefly Monitoring device to determine the relationship of defined parameters (tremor and temperature) with hypoglycaemia  using glucose levels as measured by a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) in a real-world setting in children and adolescents (5-18 years inclusive) with type 1 diabetes. This will assist with the refinement of a hypoglycaemia detection monitoring system.</outcome>
