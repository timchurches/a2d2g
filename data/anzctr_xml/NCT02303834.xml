  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation (CPAP)

No Intervention: Control - The control group will not be fitted with CPAP.

Experimental: CPAP group - The group will wear a CPAP device throughout the night. The mask fits comfortably over the nose and delivers a steady stream of air under slight pressure (auto-set).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maternal Blood Pressure - Maternal blood pressure will be measured hourly for 48 hours during the 2 days of the study. This will be used to compare average nocturnal and daytime blood pressures between the first and 2nd (intervention) night in the 2 groups.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fetal movements - Fetal movements will be measured throughout the night for 2 consecutive nights (night 1 and night 2-intervention). This will be used to calculate average fetal movements per hour in each of the 2 groups.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study design:

      Single blinded randomised control trial

      Planned sample size:

      30 (women randomized 2:1 to receive either CPAP or no CPAP)

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: Assess the effects of nasal CPAP on sleep physiology, 24 blood pressures
      and fetal movements in pregnant women (24-37 weeks gestation) with preeclampsia.

      Secondary objective: Assess baseline sleep physiology, blood pressure control and fetal
      well-being in pregnant women (24-37 weeks gestation) with preeclampsia by completing sleep
      studies, 24 hour blood pressure monitors, CO2 monitors, and nocturnal fetal movement and HR
      monitors.

      Study Procedure:

      Participants will be recruited from the antenatal ward or high-risk antenatal clinic.
      Following informed consent participants will be randomly assigned to receive either CPAP or
      no CPAP for one night, following an initial baseline overnight sleep study.

      Baseline- Night 1

        1. Sleep study with fetal movement and HR monitor

        2. 24 hour BP monitor

        3. CO2 monitor

      Intervention- Night 2 (Nasal CPAP device or no CPAP)

        1. Sleep study with fetal movement and HR monitor

        2. 24 hour BP monitor

        3. CO2 monitor

      Post-partum questionnaire A brief questionnaire to be completed within the first 6 weeks
      post-partum related to the participant's personal health, their child's birth details and
      health.</summary>
