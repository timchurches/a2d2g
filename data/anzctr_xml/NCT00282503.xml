    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Methoxsalen+ECP, Methylprednisolone
Treatment: surgery - Ecp

Active Comparator: methylprednisolone equivalent. - 2mg/kg daily will be administered initially and may be tapered according to a tapering schedule provided in the protocol.

Experimental: Uvadex+ECP - Those patients randomized to the ECP Treatment arm will receive ECP treatments by the following regimen:
Weeks 1 through Week 3 - 3 times within each week. (Treatments do not have to be performed on consecutive days but should be completed within the 7-day period),
Weeks 4 through 12 - 2 times each week. (It is preferable that patients receive ECP treatments on consecutive days

Those patients randomized to the ECP Treatment arm will receive ECP treatments by the following regimen:
Weeks 1 through Week 3 - 3 times within each week. (Treatments do not have to be performed on consecutive days but should be completed within the 7-day period),
Weeks 4 through 12 - 2 times each week. (It is preferable that patients receive ECP treatments on consecutive days within a week, but there should never be &gt; 4 days between the ECP treatments within a week.)
Methylprednisolone will be started at 2mg/kg daily dose and may be tapered by reducing dose each week at the following reductions:
Daily Dose (mg/kg)
1 1.5 2 1.0 3 0.70 4 0.50 5 0.40 6 0.30 7 0.20 8 0.10

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the safety and efficacy of ECP treatment combined with high dose corticosteroids versus high dose corticosteroids alone, in patients with newly diagnosed acute GvHD (Grades II to III) that developed within 100 days following an allo HPCT. - The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the primary endpoint. The primary efficacy variable in this study is complete resolution of acute GvHD, defined as less than Grade I acute GvHD, according to the Glucksberg-Seattle criteria.</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to conducting any study procedure.

          2. Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old and weigh greater than or equal
             to 40 kg (88 lb).

          3. Patients must have received an allogeneic hematopoietic BMT or PBSCT with
             myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning and have a new onset of acute GvHD,
             Grades II to III, which includes the skin and developed within 100 days following an
             allo-HPCT.

          4. Patients must have received an allogeneic hematopoietic BMT or PBSCT from a related or
             unrelated donor that is matched at a minimum at the HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci (i.e., at
             least a 6 out of 6 match). HLA-A and -B match should be determined by serologic
             testing, and HLA-DR should be matched by molecular methods.

          5. Patients must be receiving only a calcineurin inhibitor at study entry as part of
             their acute GvHD prophylactic regimen. Patients may have received additional
             immunosuppressants for acute GvHD prophylaxis prior to study entry.

          6. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance greater than or equal to 50.

          7. Patients must be able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

          8. Patients must receive, or must have received, the first corticosteroid dose of
             approximately 2.0 mg/kg/day but no more than 2.5 mg/kg/day (methylprednisolone
             equivalent) within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis of Grade II to III acute GvHD.
             (Up to 2.5 mg/kg/day is allowed for inadvertent dosing fluctuations for reasons other
             than lack of response.)

          9. Female patients must be one of the following: postmenopausal, surgically incapable of
             bearing children, practicing an acceptable method of birth control (acceptable methods
             include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, and spermicide and barrier).
             Abstinence or partner/spouse sterility may also qualify at the Investigator's
             discretion. If a female patient is of childbearing potential, she must have a negative
             urine pregnancy test at screening. Male patients must also commit to using adequate
             contraceptive precautions (condoms). All patients (both males and females of
             childbearing potential) must commit to using adequate contraceptive precautions
             throughout their participation in the study and for at least 3 months following their
             last ECP treatment.</inclusivecriteria>

             disease, severe asthma, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatorenal
             syndrome.

         10. Female patients whose hemoglobin (Hgb) is &lt; 8.5 g/dL or male patients whose Hgb is &lt;

         11. Patients who have a poor tolerability of venipuncture or a lack of adequate venous
             access for required treatments and blood sampling.

         13. Patients who have a known hypersensitivity or allergy to both heparin and citrate
             products.

         14. Female patients who are pregnant and/or lactating.

             coagulation disorders.</exclusivecriteria>
