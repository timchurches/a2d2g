          -  Children, male or female between, and including, 6 and 35 months of age at the time of
             first study vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject.

          -  Subjects who are likely to reside in the vicinity of the study centre for the duration
             of the study. In studies using the home-based model for vaccination and follow-up,
             subjects who are likely to remain in the vicinity of the area where they were

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine(s)
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the
             study period.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the first vaccine dose.

          -  Planned administration of any vaccine 30 days prior and 21 days after any study
             vaccine administration.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccines such as egg protein or thiomersal.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             prior to the enrolment in this study, or planned administration during the study
             period.
