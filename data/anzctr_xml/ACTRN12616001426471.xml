  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be an open-label, 12 week, clinical trial in males aged 18 to 45 with the aim:
To compare genetic expression patterns after 12 weeks treatment of temulawak extract in male adults.  
To evaluate safety parameters of the active compound.
A total of 32 participants will be enrolled into the study in order to allow for 24 participants to complete the study. Participants will be asked to attend the clinic at Screening, Day 1 (Visit 1), Day 7 (Visit 2), Day 40 (visit 3) and Day 81 (visit 4) the end of study visit. The study will last approximately 4 months in total for each participant from screening to last visit. Participants will need to attend the clinical unit 5 times for around three hours at each visit.
