  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Written informed consent prior to any testing under this protocol

          -  Must be between 18 and 75 years of age

          -  Have a diagnosis of CIDP as determined by a board-certified or board-eligible
             neurologist, or equivalent, for at least 6 months, including fulfilling modified INCAT
             neurophysiological criteria for CIDP,CIDP motor deficit responsive to IVIg and
             alternative EP data that justifies subject inclusion, and/or supportive pathologic or
             laboratory data that supports the diagnosis of CIDP

          -  Documentation in the medical record prior to screening that the CIDP had been
             associated with loss of muscle strength, such that the MRC sum score was less than or
             equal to 58.

          -  Documentation in the medical record that the patient benefited fom IVIg treatment
             (patient had a 2-point change or equivalent in 60-point MRC sum score)

          -  Tested for IgM monoclonal gammopathy and found to have tested negative for IgM
             monoclonal gammopathy or if positive for IgM monoclonal gammopathy, then are MAG
             antibody-negative and proven to be IVI g responsive per protocol.

          -  Must have been clinically stable while on a constant regimen of IVIg (every 2-weeks,
             3-weeks, 4-weeks or 5-weeks) in the 3 months prior to screening.</inclusivecriteria>

             preclude the administration if IFN-beta or participation in this study.

          -  Subjects with diabetes mellitus will not be eligible, unless they satisfy both of the
             following requirements: a) their diabetes is well-controlled, with no retinopathy or

             sural nerve on at least one side of the body identified during electrophysiology (EP)
             testing documented in their medical record.

             significant

          -  History of a seizure disorder prior to baseline (Visit 1, Week 0).

          -  History of suicidal ideation within 3 months prior to Baseline Visit (Week 0) or an
             episode of severe depression within 3 months prior to Baseline Visit (Week 0).

          -  Serious local infection or systemic infection within the 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  Use of IFN-beta at any time, use of plasma exchange, plasmapheresis, or any other
             immunosuppressant (with the exception of oral or non-systemic corticosteroids) within

          -  History of intolerance to acetaminophen (paracetamol), ibuprofen, naproxen, and/or
             aspirin that would preclude use of at least one of these during the study.

             practice effective contraception, as defined by the Investigator, during the study.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether AVONEX (Interferon Beta-1a), when compared
      to placebo, reduces the total dose of IVIg that is administered after Visit 5 and through
      Visit 9 (Week 32, End of Study).</summary>
