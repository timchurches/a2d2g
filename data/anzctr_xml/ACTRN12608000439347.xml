  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 3 groups of subjects receiving the interventions; ice pack, water pack and no treatment given. The group receiving water pack be was called 'placebo' and the group receiving ice pack was called experimental group. We apply packs in perineum for twenty minutes in each one. The ice pack and placebo are given to the subjects between 2 until 48 hours after delivery.</interventions>
    <comparator>In  control group or Standard treatment nothing was apply in perineum.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>decreased perineal pain. We will use a Number scale from 0 to 10 for measured the pain</outcome>
      <timepoint>The level of pain was measures at baseline, time = zero (before applied pack), after 20 minutes of applied pack.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>decreased perineal pain. We will use a Number scale from 0 to 10 for measured the pain and calculate the percentage of improvement</outcome>
      <timepoint>The level of pain was measures at baseline, time = zero (before applied pack) and after 40 minutes of applied pack.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Randomized controlled trial study carried out at the Normal Birth Center of Amparo Maternal, a public maternity located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The women were divided in three groups: Experimental Group  ice pack applied to the perineum; Placebo Group  environmental temperature water pack applied to the perineum and Control Group  did not receive pack. The pack was applied during twenty minutes, and in the three groups perineum temperature was controlled before (T0= first moment) and after (T20=after 20 minutes) this intervention. A digital Minipa (registered trade mark) model MT 405 thermometer was used to monitore the perineum temperature. The temperatures of maternity room, packs (ice and water) and women body were also controlled. Pain magnitude was evaluated by the numeric scale represented by a horizontal line with numerical marks from zero to ten; the zero value denoted no pain and the ten value denoted the worst imaginable pain. The women were allocated to the experimental, placebo or control groups according to a computer generated randomisation list. Prior to her inclusion in the study, each woman received a detailed explanation of the purpose and the methods of the study. A signed consent was obtained from all voluntary participants, who were assured the right to withdraw from the study at any time.</summary>
