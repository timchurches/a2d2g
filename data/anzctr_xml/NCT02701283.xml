    <summary>The study objective is to demonstrate that the safety and effectiveness of the Medtronic TAVR
      system as measured by rates of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at two years is
      noninferior to SAVR in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in subjects who have a low
      predicted risk of operative mortality for SAVR.</summary>
