  <interventions>
    <interventions>Premature baby with corrected gestational age (CGA) between 27 to 35 weeks period of gestation (POG). CGA is calculated as POG plus current age of baby in weeks. 

Subject will be exposed to recording of their mothers voice for 10 minutes every day for 2 weeks. 

Their mother will be given a recorder prior to the study, she will be asked to record her voice in any form i.e. singing, talking,rhyming, reading for 10minutes. 

The same recording will be played to their babies daily for 2 weeks. 

The recording will be played during daytime, after feeding was given.

The volume of the sound will be kept at 50-55dB as recommended by American Academy of Paediatrics.

Their biophysical parameter (Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, SPO2) and neurobehavioral score will be monitored pre, during and post intervention daily.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control treatment will have biophysical profile monitored but not receiving their mothers voice.
Infants in control group will only be exposed to standard NICU noises/sounds</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on previous study by (Alipour et al., 2013), the sample size to achieve a power of 0.8, alpha level of 0.05, and the mean difference of 5 with standard deviation of 9.57 for physiological responses was 58 per group is needed. Therefore, total sample size of 140 is needed with 20% drop out.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Premature infants usually will need to stay in NICU and underwent multiple treatment and procedure till they reach certain age and weight before being discharge home. This will lead to separations from mother and multiple interventions leads to stress related behaviour. 
Previous research had proved that some intervention as kangaroo care, swaddling and non nutritive sucking can be used for premature infants to significantly manage pain and stress related behaviors.Studies also have shown that preterm infants who were exposed to an audio recording of their mothers voice achieved full oral feed quicker and showed meaningful changes in heart rate compared to preterm infants receiving routine care. 
This study objective is to look at effect of mothers voice on premature infants heart rate, breathing, stress related behaviour and weight gain.
The study involve exposing premature infant to recorded maternal voice for 10 min everyday for 2 weeks duration.
It is interesting to see if this maternal voice recording can be used to temporarily replaced mothers who are not able to room in or visit their premature infants in NICU due to various reason.</summary>
