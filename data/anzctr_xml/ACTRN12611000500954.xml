Treatment allocation determined by off site investigator who performs the allocation process.
Treatment (placebo and active ) in identical containers.
Crossover trial structure, so patients will take both placebo and active treatment at different stages in the trial.
All patients will still be taking their usual background phosphate lowering medications (although no dose modifications of these will be permitted for the duration of the trial).</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients allocated to either placebo treatment first or active treatment first in blocks (sealed envelopes). Aiming to recruit 32 patients total, based on acheiving power of 80% to detect a change in serum phosphate of 30%.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Power calculation for sample size: 
Based on the data from previous studies, we postulated that an effect size of 0.3mmol/L reduction in serum phosphate over 8 weeks was appropriate. Based on data from our unit on the inter-patient variability of serum phosphate over time, our estimated SD was 0.55mmol/L. Thus, to achieve 80% power at the 5% significance level, we required 27 patients. We assumed a drop-out rate of 20% and recruited 33 patients.

2. Paired T test.
3. Anova (one-way variance).
4. McNemar's test with Yates' correction for continuity.
5. Fisher's exact test</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of low doses of slow release nicotinic acid as a phosphate binder in haemodialysis patients with persistently high serum phosphate levels.
Phosphate accumulates in patients with renal failure. A high phosphate level has been associated with higher mortality. Patients with end stage renal failure on dialysis often need to take medications to reduce serum phosphate. Unfortunately, these medications have complex dosing regimes, often cause side effects and are expensive. This leads to poor compliance and poor correction of serum phosphate. 
Nicotinic acid has been shown to have phosphate lowering effects. 
We propose to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a low dose of a once daily novel sustained release preparation of nicotinic acid (Slo niacin) in patients with end stage renal failure on haemodialysis who have problems with high phosphate levels.</summary>
