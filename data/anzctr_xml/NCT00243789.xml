  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Pentoxifylline

Active Comparator: 1 - Pentoxifylline

No Intervention: 2 - Placebo


Treatment: drugs: Pentoxifylline
Participants will be randomized to receive either pentoxifylline or placebo in addition to their stable steroid therapy. Active drug and placebo preparations will be supplied as gel capsules of identical size, appearance and taste. Active drug capsules will contain one 400 mg time-release pentoxifylline tablet and inert filler. Placebo capsules will contain inert filler.
Based on weight at screening, &lt;30 mg will receive 1 400 capsule/day; 30-49 kg will receive two 400 capsules/day; 50 kg or greater will receive three 400 mg capsules/day.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see if male children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
      have changes in strength when given the drug Pentoxifylline as a rescue treatment. A total of
      64 subjects are expected to participate through all other centers of the Cooperative
      International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) worldwide.

      The primary purpose of this study is to see whether the addition of pentoxifylline to a
      steroid regimen is effective in treating deteriorating muscle strength by comparing the
      muscle strength of PTX treated subjects and placebo treated subjects.</summary>
