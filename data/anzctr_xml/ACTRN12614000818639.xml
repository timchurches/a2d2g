  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects were cited in the laboratory 2 weeks before starting the experimental protocol and performed 2 sessions of 2 hours, to collect personal and familiarization with the exercises information.

The exercise group (EG) exercised in Physiotherapy Clinic, two times per week for a 12-week period. EG was monitored by the same specialist (qualified personnel), who led each training session. At least one trained monitor was always present to verify the correct application of the methodology. Each therapy session ranged from 45 to 60 min depending on the phase. A warm-up of 6-7 min of mild cardiovascular exercise followed by 3-4 min of stretching was always performed prior to the training sessions. A cool-down of 1 min of mild cardiovascular exercise followed by 4 min of stretching was always performed after the training sessions.  

The subjects were instructed in the different exercise techniques and in controlling exercise intensity through the combined use of a targeted number of repetitions and perception of effort during two sessions before beginning the training program. The criteria of body position, ranges of motion and movement speed described.

The load (resistance) for each exercise was determined according to the rating of perceived exertion in active muscles by using the OMNI resistance exercise scale for active muscles. 

The control of neutral lordosis for seat pull and row exercises was determined with the pressure changes on biofeedback meter. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects were recruited from the patients regularly referred to Outpatient Physiotherapy Services. A physician reviewed their medical records and clinical status and confirmed the diagnosis according inclusion-exclusion criteria. The method of allocation concealment used in this trial was central randomization by phone.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random order for the allocation of subjects into different groups was a simple randomization using a randomization table rested by computes software.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Because the intervention requires a lot of control and supervision, the number of participating subjects (experimental group) was conditioned by number of supervisors. Was determined not to exceed more than 5 subjects for supervisor. This limited to 15 subjects for the experimental group and 15 for control.

Data were analyzed via a general linear model with repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the data were not normally distributed, the Friedman ANOVA followed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. Effect size was estimated with Cohen's d.</statisticalmethods>
