  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GAND-emesis is a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a neurokinin1 receptor antagonist
      (fosaprepitant dimeglumine) in combination with an antiemetic (anti-nausea-and-vomiting)
      control regimen (palonosetron and dexamethasone) in patients with a gynaecological cancer
      diagnosis, who are scheduled to receive radiotherapy and weekly chemotherapy.

      The study aims at investigating if a three-drug antiemetic regimen is superior to a two-drug
      regimen (standard treatment) in preventing nausea and vomiting in patients receiving
      radiotherapy and weekly chemotherapy. A pilot study demonstrated that approximately 50% of
      patients will experience nausea and vomiting when offered a two-drug antiemetic regimen, and
      it is expected that addition of a third drug (a neurokinin1 receptor antagonist) can increase
      the proportion of patients with no vomiting in the course of combined chemo-radiotherapy.</summary>
