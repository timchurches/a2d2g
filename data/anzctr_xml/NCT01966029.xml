  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety Analysis - The analyses of safety will include all patients who receive any study drug. All safety data will be summarized descriptively. All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence of AEs will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC), Preferred Term (PT), relationship to study drug, and severity. Patient listings will be provided for SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, or study withdrawals. All AE summaries will include only treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported during the study period (AEs that occur after the first study drug infusion). Infusion-associated AEs will be summarized by SOC, PT and severity.
The following safety measures will be summarized descriptively: concomitant medications, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs, immunogenicity results, analgesic medication use, results from routine physical examinations (including standard neurologic examinations), and cervical spine imaging.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The study period during which all non-serious AEs and SAEs will be reported begins after informed consent is obtained and through 30 days after the last study visit or 30 days after the last drug infusion, whichever comes first.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy Analysis - Efficacy assessments and procedures are the duplicate endurance testing (6MW and 3MSC tests) at Baseline and at week 25 and 49. Samples for urine KS and urine creatinine will be collected at Baseline and every 24 weeks.
Anthropometric measurements, including standing height, length, sitting height, knee height (as clinically indicated), head circumference and weight, will be taken at Baseline and every 24 weeks.
Respiratory function tests (RFTs) for assessment of forced expiratory volume for 1 second (FEV1), forced inspiratory vital capacity (FIVC), forced vital capacity (FVC), and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) will be performed at Baseline and Weeks 25 and 49. APPT (pain assessment tool), and the PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) or SF-36Â® (QOL questionnaire for adult patients) will be done at Baseline, Week 25, and Week 49. The Sleep Apnea Test will be done at Baseline, Week 25 and Week 49, if applicable.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 25, Week 49 or Early Termination Visit</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy Analysis (recommended) - The efficacy assessments as mentioned in Efficacy Analysis 2 above are all recommended in the Extension Phase per the protocol amendment dated 17Mar 2014</outcome>
      <timepoint>by Week 24, Week 52 and Early Termination Visit during Extension Phase</timepoint>

          5. Is pregnant or breastfeeding at Baseline, or planning to become pregnant (self
             orpartner) at any time during the study. Patients who become pregnant during the study
             will be discontinued from the study.

          6. Has used any investigational product, or investigational medical device, within 30
             days prior to Baseline; or is required to use any investigational agent prior to
             completion of all scheduled study assessments.

          7. Has a concurrent disease or condition, including but not limited to, symptomatic
             cervical spine instability, clinically significant and/or progressive spinal cord
             compression, or severe cardiac disease that would interfere with study participation,
             or pose a safety risk, as determined by the Investigator.

          8. Has any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at high
             risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently no treatment for MPS IVA other than supportive care for the clinical
      manifestations of the disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with BMN 110 to replace the
      deficient GALNS is a potential new treatment option for MPS IVA patients. BMN 110, containing
      recombinant human GALNS (rhGALNS) developed by BioMarin is expected to reduce the
      progressive, pathologic accumulation of KS, and improve signs and symptoms of the disease.

      The objective of this Phase 3B open label study (110-502) will be to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of 2.0 mg/kg/week (qw) of BMN 110 in Australian patients with MPS IVA. In
      addition, a number of secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints will also be investigated.
      The dose and regimen of BMN 110 have been selected on the basis of data from a Phase 1/2
      clinical study with BMN 110, nonclinical and in vitro studies with BMN 110, and clinical and
      nonclinical data from other enzyme replacement therapies.

      Extension Phase is included per amendment dated 10Mar 2014: To provide patients enrolled in
      the Initial Phase access to BMN 110 until commercial product becomes available in Australia
      and continue to assess long-term safety</summary>
