    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patient will be provided with the approved version of Patient information sheet (by local Ethics Committee) and a written consent to be obtained prior to any study procedure commencement. Patients will go through the screening tests as per protocol and then randomised after a run in period of 4 to 6 weeks when eligibility is confirmed. Randomisation will be sequential using the Drug kit numbers allocated to each individual centre. Allocation has been concealed through the allocation of numbered medication packs.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be stratified by centres(3 locations) with an equal allocation of patients within centres to each group using a random permuted block. Computed-generated randomisation numbers will generate a drug kit code that is assigned as patient identification numbers at each sites.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchiectasis is a neglected health problem in New Zealand, particularly amongst Maori and Pacific peoples. It is a debilitating disease characterised by repeated respiratory infections. Azithromycin is a unique antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties that has been shown to be effective as prophylaxis in cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of long term azithromycin in adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. It will be the first randomised, controlled trial in this important patient group and will provide data on clinically relevant outcome measures. The benefits to patients are expected to include improved quality of life, prevention or delay in decline of lung function and reduced acute healthcare utilisation and costs. Importantly, these benefits will also have a substantial impact on the health of Maori and Pacific peoples. We have a rare and unparalleled opportunity to undertake this study because of the high prevalence of bronchiectasis in NZ.</summary>
