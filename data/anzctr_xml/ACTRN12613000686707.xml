  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants of the intervention will be required to wear a piece of duct tape over the verruca for up to 12 weeks, which is to be removed only for showering or bathing. Participants will be instructed to cut a piece of duct tape large enough to cover the entire surface of the wart. The wart would initially be debrided with a scalpel until pinpoint bleeding was visible. The piece of duct tape would then be placed over the affected area, and secured with fixomull.</interventions>
    <comparator>The standard treatment as a control is cryotherapy. Participants in the control group will be treated with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy every two weeks, as required over a 12-week period. The wart and surrounding skin would be disinfected with an alcohol wipe prior to the procedure. If the wart is particularly painful, or if the participant is likely to experience excessive discomfort from the procedure, local anaesthetic would be administered.

The wart would initially be debrided with a scalpel until pinpoint bleeding is visible. A cotton bud saturated with liquid nitrogen would be applied for five seconds, or until the area blanches. The frozen tissue would then be allowed to thaw for 30 seconds before the process is repeated once more. A cutiplast dressing would then be applied to the lesion.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resolution/regression of the verruca pedis. Such resolution and regression would be measured by comparing the original dimensions (length by width) of the verruca to the final dimensions of the verruca at the conclusion of 12 weeks following initial treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resolution/regression of the verruca pedis. Such resolution and regression would be measured by comparing the original dimensions (length by width) of the verruca with the dimensions of the verruca of the following fortnight. The verruca would be assessed either a total of six times (initial and five more follow up appointments) or until there is resolution of the verruca, within the twelve-week timeframe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every fortnight.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is to determine the efficacy of duct tape in treating verruca pedis compared to cryotherapy. Current literature consists of low-quality studies on the use of duct tape for treating verrucae revealing inconsistent results. 

Thus, this study will assess the efficacy of duct tape in comparison to cryotherapy according to the criteria of total resolution, dimensions, resolution of surrounding warts, pain, adverse effects, participant satisfaction and cost effectiveness.</summary>
