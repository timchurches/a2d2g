  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients of at least 18 years old with histologically documented non-gastric marginal
             zone lymphoma.

          -  Disease limited to stages I and II after adequate staging (see Appendix II), patients
             with stage IV with extranodal disease confined to paired organs (e.g. salivary glands)
             and including any local extension of this disease into adjacent tissues. Patients with
             involved lymph nodes on the same side of the diaphragm in addition to paired organ
             involvement are also eligible, provided all involved tumour sites, nodal and
             extranodal, can be irradiated to 30 Gy within the tolerance of the relevant normal
             tissues. If paired organ involvement was regarded as a single extranodal site (rather
             than 2 separate sites and hence stage IV), eligible patients would then be regarded as
             having stage IE or IIE disease. Patients with wider dissemination (bone marrow, liver
             etc) are ineligible.

          -  Anticipated life expectancy &gt; 2 years

          -  Given written informed consent

          -  Been assessed by a radiation oncologist

          -  Agree to undergo breath testing for H. pylori and/or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to
             exclude active infection with helicobacter pylori

          -  Must be available for long-term follow up</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Splenic marginal zone lymphoma

          -  Received previous locoregional radiotherapy

          -  A medical contraindication to radiotherapy

          -  Any previous or concurrent malignancy other than curatively treated non-melanoma skin
             cancer, level 1 malignant melanoma, or in situ cervical cancer, unless disease and
             treatment-free for 5 years

          -  Such extensive involvement of the thorax that treatment with radiotherapy alone would
             be hazardous because of excessive lung irradiation, even if a shrinking field
             technique were employed

          -  Suspected or confirmed pregnancy

          -  Transformation to large cell lymphoma or other aggressive histology

          -  Disease that is widely disseminated (bone marrow, liver etc)</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This prospective study will test the following hypotheses in patients with stage I-II low
      grade marginal zone (MZ) lymphoma:

        -  Involved Field Radiotherapy will produce a complete response rate of &gt; 90%

        -  Radiotherapy will be associated with a locoregional progression of &lt; 20% after 10 years

        -  Death from MZ lymphoma will occur in &lt; 40% of patients within 10 years of radiotherapy

      This study secondary objectives are:

        -  To collect information on the prevalence of H. pylori in non-gastric MALT lymphoma

        -  To estimate rates of acute and late toxicity of radiotherapy</summary>
