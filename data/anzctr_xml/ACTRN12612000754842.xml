  <interventions>
    <interventions>Stroke volume variation guided fluid administration. Bedside staff will utilise a protocol to guide fluid administration. If the clinician suspects the patient to have a known or suspected inadequate cardiac output (i.e. the cardiac index is &lt; 2.5L/min/m2; poor perfusion;poor urine output) and the stroke voume is &gt;13 then they will be instructed to administer a fluid bolus of 250mls.  This will continue until the patient is extubated or they reach 24 hours post-operative.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard fluid administration - fluid boluses administered by the treating clinician based on blood pressure, central venous pressure etc. These boluses are usually 250 - 500mls per bolus and depend on the treating clinician.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Following cardiac surgery, patients receive large amounts of fluid in the intensive care unit. This may cause problems with wound healing and delay hospital discharge. A planned randomised controlled trial of a restrictive fluid regime as compared to a more liberal approach utilising advance hemodynamic monitoring, aims to reduce the amount of fluid patients receive and reduce hospital length of stay. This feasibility study aims to determine whether this nurse-led protocol is practicable and feasible and will help answer the research question. It will also aim to evaluate how fluid is administered in other cardiac intensive care centres in New Zealand. This study is simple and inexpensive and if it demonstrates a decreased length of hospital stay then this will represent a significant benefit for both individual patients and the health system</summary>
