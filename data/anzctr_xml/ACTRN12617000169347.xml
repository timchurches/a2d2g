  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive usual care  and will also be provided access to the Eating4Two smartphone application at no cost. Women in the intervention group will enter their weight into the App on a weekly basis and be weighed by maternity caregivers at approximately 38 weeks gestation and the commencement of labour (or prior to elective caesarean section). 

The Eating4Two App  provides women with advice on how to eat for two by increasing nutrient density rather than energy.  Women are provided with information about food safety, nutrients, and their value in pregnancy, the nutrients provided in various foods and recommended daily serves. Sample meal plans demonstrate ways that nutrient needs in pregnancy can be met. In addition, the App provides information on managing common pregnancy related symptoms such as heartburn.  The App calculates womens BMI and prompts them to enter their weight weekly. The weight tracker graphs their weight gain, showing the weight gain range recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for their BMI category. When weight gain is above or below the recommended range, women are prompted to discuss the issue with their maternity caregiver so that individual advice can be provided. The App also sends regular messages to the participant (specific to their gestation) with information about their babys growth, development and nutritional needs, motivational messages, tips on weight management and physical activity in pregnancy and reminders to discuss weight gain with their maternity caregivers. These are sent approximately weekly. These messages are tailored to the womans BMI and gestation. The aim of the App is to augment usual care by providing timely and tailored information, motivation, encouraging lifestyle changes and discussions with caregivers. Women will have access to the App from enrolment in the study to birth. The only requirement is for women to use the weight tracker weekly and they may access other parts of the App as desired. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual antenatal maternity care with the addition of a written nutrition and weight gain booklet: Good nutrition in pregnancy, published by the ACT Government (modified with local contacts for other sites).   Usual care for women includes attendance at antenatal appointments in accordance with the following schedule; 12-14 weeks (booking visit), 16, 20, 26, 30, 33, 36, 38, 40, 41 weeks. Women choosing a shared care model receive alternate visits with their GP and with hospital clinic staff. While womens BMI is calculated at their first hospital-booking visit, weighing is not routinely attended at subsequent antenatal clinic appointments or at labour commencement. Advice on weight gain is ad hoc and diet advice focuses on food safety in pregnancy. Women with a BMI &gt; 35kg/m2 are referred to a community dietitian. Their usual maternity care provider will weigh women in the control group at approximately 38 weeks gestation. A maternity staff member will also weigh women in this group at the commencement of labour (or prior to elective caesarean section). </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size: This trial is designed to detect a clinically significant decrease in the proportion of women who have excessive GWG (according to current IOM recommendations) from 38% to 30%. A recent prospective study in Australia with 664 participants (of all BMI categories) found that 38% of the cohort experienced excessive GWG according to IOM recommendations (de Jersey, Nicholson, Callaway &amp; Daniels, 2012). This is less than the proportion found in the control group of the LIMIT trial (42%) though this trial included only overweight and obese women (Dodd et al., 2014) who are known to be more at risk of excessive weight gain.  A total sample size of 1156 (578 in each group) will allow detection of statistical significance with 80% power and two-sided 5% significance level (Dean, Sullivan &amp; Soe, 2015). The follow-up period is short in studies focusing on GWG as the primary outcome, as the end point is delivery. However there is wide variation in reported attrition, which ranges from 3% to 20% (Bogaerts et al., 2013; Dodd et al., 2014). These are comprised largely of women experiencing miscarriage, fetal loss and moving out of area. Taking a conservative approach we have allowed for 15% attrition, which gives a total recruitment target of 1330 women. 
Data Analysis: An intention to treat analysis will be conducted including withdrawals and losses to follow up. Even distribution of baseline characteristics between the intervention and the control groups is assumed by randomisation and will be further assessed by Chi squared test and Student t-test for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Descriptive statistics for the primary and secondary outcome variables will be calculated. Continuous outcome variables will be evaluated for normality and transformations will be applied as necessary. Regression analysis with adjustments for confounding variables (pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking, IRSAD, parity, age) will be used to evaluate the primary outcome and relative risk and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The multiple imputation method will be used to generate possible values for missing values. This is considered gold standard for dealing with missing data. Significance will be set at 0.05. Data will be analysed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). All qualitative data will be combined for the purposes of analysis. Qualitative data analysis will follow a simple qualitative descriptive approach. Qualitative descriptive analysis is a low inference analysis that uses an inductive approach to develop descriptive themes.  All transcripts will be coded by first attaching a descriptive label to each meaning unit (a sentence or group of sentences conveying a message or concept relevant to the study).  Descriptive labels will be examined and grouped with other labels conveying a similar idea to create descriptive themes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is one of the most significant health issues of our time. Regardless of pre-pregnancy BMI, the amount of weight gained during pregnancy [gestational weight gain (GWG)] has the potential to impact the health and wellbeing of the childbearing woman and her baby in the short, medium and long term. Women who gain excessive weight in pregnancy are more likely to retain weight in the short, medium and long term, progressing from normal weight to obese over their childbearing years.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) offers the most robust guidance, recommending specific GWG target ranges for women who are underweight, normal, overweight and obese according to defined Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Only 36% of Australian women have optimal GWG.  Interventions targeting GWG have focused on overweight and obese women, been resource intensive and have had limited success. Behavioural change interventions have also been criticised for increasing the socio-economic gradient of obesity. There is a critical need to reduce the burden of maternal obesity and excessive GWG with programs that are effective, accessible and scalable for delivery at a population level and to understand how socio-economic factors impact on GWG and uptake of interventions. This project addresses these two key issues by examining the efficacy of the Eating4Two Smartphone application in a population of pregnant women of all BMI categories. We hypothesise that use of the Eating4Two smartphone App will reduce rates of excessive gestational weight gain.</summary>
