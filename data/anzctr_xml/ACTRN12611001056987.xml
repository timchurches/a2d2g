  <interventions>
    <interventions>50mg/m2 of intramuscular methotrexate on day 1 of treatment PLUS 250mg of oral gefitinib daily for seven days (day 1 to day 7 of treatment) PLUS/MINUS additional doses of 50mg/m2 IM methotrexate on day 7 if serum hCG has not fallen &gt;15% between days 4 and 7 PLUS/MINUS additional dose of 50mg/m2 IM methotrexate on day 14 if serum hCG has not fallen &gt;15% between days 11 and 14</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a single-arm study as there is no obvious/ethical comparator or control treatment. Methotrexate alone is known not to be an effective treatment of larger ectopic pregnancies, and surgical management is known to be highly effective but removes the affected Fallopian tube and is a different form of treatment intervention. We consider it unethical to provide proven sub-standard treatment or placebo for this potentially life-threatening condition.</comparator>

(as assessed by serum hCG decline and time to cure in days - see Timepoint below for details)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood will be drawn from participants on days 1, 4, 7, 11 and weekly thereafter until hCG is normalised (&lt;5IU/L), to determine treatment efficacy and ensure cure. Mean time to resolution of ectopic pregnancy with current medical treatment is approximately 35 days.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily clinical review as inpatients and outpatient clinical review on days 4, 7, 11 and weekly thereafter (i.e. ongoing) until cured. Biochemical (haematological, renal and hepatic function) measurement on days 4, 7, 11 and weekly until cured.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through the Emergency Departments and outpatient clinics at Monash Medical Centre and Dandenong Hospital in Melbourne, Australia and The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Scotland. Potential participants at all sites will have been diagnosed with a haemodynamically stable ectopic pregnancy by the on-call gynaecological team. A trial investigator will approach potential participants and provide information about the study and their treatment options. If they agree to participate, informed consent will be obtained.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial builds on a phase I (ACTRN12610000684022) study of toxicity in investigating a new combination treatment of gefitinib and methotrexate for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy. This study will recruit 40 women diagnosed with a haemodynamically stable ectopic pregnancy with any pre-treatment serum hCG level. As methotrexate is clinically indicated for women with ectopic pregnancies with a starting serum beta hCG of less then 3000IU/L, this study will seek to show that combination treatment with gefitinib is more efficacious and enables more women to avoid surgery for managment of their ectopic pregnancy.</summary>
