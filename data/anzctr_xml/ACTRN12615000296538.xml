  <interventions>
    <interventions>Once a client is enrolled to the research, he/she will be going through three independent assessments (which might take place over a period of 1-3 weeks, depending on the client's and the clinic's schedules):
1. A clinical assessment done by a consultant, either a Paediatrician or a Child Psychiatrist (up to 45 minutes)
2. A full TEA-Ch assessment (which is a pen and paper psychological assessment tool, done by a qualified psychologist, trained in administering the TEA-Ch)- up to 1.5 hours
3. A full EfA assessment: the EfA System is a computer software which assesses functions of the brain related to ADHD. It is relatively short (duration of 25-35 min) assessment, comprised of 7 mini-games.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control for this research will be a double-active one. 
The Software (i.e. The EfA System) will be compared to both the TEA-Ch (=a validated psychological assessment tool) and to a clinical review done by a physician (as required by the current up-to-date literature and guidelines). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sensitivity of the EfA system will be calculated by statistical formula. See detailed formula in this link: http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/6/221.full</outcome>

      <outcome>Specificity of the EfA system will be calculated by statistical formula. See detailed formula in this link: http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/6/221.full</outcome>
      <timepoint>One year after the research has been initiated</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy of the EfA system in comparison to the other diagnostic methods in the research. Efficacy is the capacity for beneficial change of a given intervention. We will compare resources invested, time consumption and overall sensitivity and specificity of each one of the 3 assessments. The assessment that would yield the best sensitivity/specificity, with the least amount of resource consumption, would be considered to have the highest efficacy. </outcome>
      <timepoint>One year after the research has been initiated</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the cost and burden in terms of time, money and human resources, of the three different methods of assessments: clinician, psychology and the software. 
We will quantify each and every assessment in terms of time and money spent on completion, mounting to a total and average amount of resources for each and every test. Those figures will then be compared to each other. </outcome>

    <concealment>* The participants will be chosen from both CAMHS and Paediatric community clinics, ages 6-18 years and who were referred to either of the clinics query ADHD. 
* The research is designed to be a national one, hence the CAMHS and Paediatric clinics will be chosen from various DHBs across New Zealand, who will choose to participate in the research. We will initially start in the Taranaki region in order to make sure that the software and database/servers are running smoothly. Then we will gradually incorporate more and more DHBs. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We will be using several comparative tests and tools in order to assess both the macro-level (i.e. the actual diagnosis) and the micro-level (i.e. comparison of sub-tests). Calculating the size of the sample needed for our study requires the prespecification of statistical power and the level of significance of the statistical test . The level of significance is the probability of obtaining a statistically significant test result, even when there is no real difference. This is conventionally taken as 2.5% for one-tailed tests. 
Unfortunately - I cannot provide any exact or more detailed formula at the moment, as we are required to have several active participants so we can test our figures and statistical system. Once that will be done (after ethical approval has been granted) we could proceed and calculate a more precise number of clients/participants needed for our trial. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study's aim is to evaluate a novel software, called "the EfA system" which is designed to be incorporated in the process of diagnosing ADHD. In this study we will compare the EfA System's results to two known assessments (i.e.: Clinical evaluation done by a trained physician, and a Psychological pen-and-paper test, called TEA-Ch). We assume that the EfA system will be at least as sensitive and specific as the other two approaches, in identifying children and adolescent who may suffer from ADHD. We also assume that by using the EfA system, we will be able to provide a more efficient assessment method (both time and cost wise) than the TEA-Ch (both complement the clinical assessment). 
Hence - it is our intention to recruit children and adolescents (age 6-18) from CAMHS and Paediatrics outpatient clinics, assess them by all 3 approaches/tools and eventually compare the various results, costs, etc. </summary>
