  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Patients Who Had Therapeutic Response at 6 Months - A therapeutic response was defined as a reduction of at least 75% from baseline (Visit 1) in serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) excess (difference between measured level and midpoint to the normal range) or normalization of SAP at the end of six months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relative Change in Serum Alkaline Phosphatase in U/L at Day 28 - The percent change in serum alkaline phosphatase from baseline to Day 28 was measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 28 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relative Change in Serum C-telopeptide (CTx) in ng/mL at Day 10 - The percent change in serum C-telopeptide from baseline to Day 10 was measured.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relative Change in Urine a-CTx in ug/mmol at Day 10 - The percent change in urine a-CTx from baseline to Day 10 was measured.</outcome>

    <summary>The primary objective of this core study was to show non-inferiority of zoledronic acid to
      risedronate, with respect to the proportion of patients who achieved therapeutic response.
      The extended observation period included participants of the core study who responded to
      treatment.</summary>
