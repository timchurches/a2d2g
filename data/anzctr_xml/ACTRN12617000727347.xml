  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised Controlled Trial whereby the study participants are randomised to one of two groups. Randomisation will occur at patient level at Bentley Hospital site. The experimental group will be provided with the use of the Coloplast PERISTEEN Registered trademark anal plug in addition to usual care and the comparison control group will receive the usual rehabilitation FI care provided by the rehabilitation unit (excluding the use of the anal plug). The  sample population are stroke survivor patients who are receiving care in a rehabilitation unit. The sample population have intractable faecal incontinence (IFI). The anal plug will be inserted with assistance on day one  from the nurse. The nurse will assist the primary caregiver in the use of the anal plug at that point in time. Nursing shifts are 12 hour  shifts. The staff member responsible for the patient will check the plug at the commencement of each shift (two) per day and will complete the Bristol Stool chart (BSC) for that patient at each shift. BSC data will be collected over a two week period (14 days ). 
The Peristeen Anal Plug is inserted like a suppository due to compression of the foam by outer film which then dissolves once inside the rectum. The anal plug I easily removed after a maximum of 12 hours using the gauze string attached to the plug. For this study, the plugs will be inserted twice in 24 hour period ( 1 per 12 hours) for 14 days. </interventions>
    <comparator>Usual standard care is defined as assistance provided to maintain continence by ward nursing staff (but not use of the plug) with referral to a continence nurse if felt to be clinically indicated.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of the study is to determine the proportion of days free from FI from commencement of trial following the four day introduction period to use of Coloplast PERISTEEN. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary endpoint will be assessed 14 days after commencement of trial. Baseline data collection will occur on the initial day when the anal plug is introduced. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction with management of FI by both groups pre intervention and post intervention. 
Measurement: The satisfaction survey  is designed specifically for this study by the research team with a separate questionnaire for  the patient and the primary caregiver. To be completed by both patients and carers. 

Initial day of anal plug usage and again 14 days hence.

Measurement: The Health in Aging Caregiver Self-assessment questionnaire, This questionnaire was originally developed and tested by the American Medical Association copyright 2015 Health in Aging Foundation. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of instances of pseudo-continence (continence only whilst wearing plug = intervention group). 
Measurements:
Revised Faecal Incontinence Score (RFIS) counts the episodes of continence whilst wearing the plug and will also be documented in the Bristol Stool Chart. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>We will be measuring from day 1 baseline and for each day up until and including Day 14 .</timepoint>

      <outcome>Quality of life of patient
Measurement:
The Faecal Incontinence quality of life scale (Wexner Scale) </outcome>
      <timepoint> The Wexner scale will be administered at baseline (Day 1) and again on Day 14. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibillity of use of anal plug using the Wexner scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>We will assess feasibility by recording recruitment rates (proportion of screened) and proportion of recruited patients / carer dyads.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will examine the feasibility, usefulness and acceptability of using the anal plug Coloplast PERISTEEN amongst stroke survivors with persistent Intractable Faecal Incontinence (IFI) during the rehabilitation phase. Patients from Bentley rehabilitation hospital will be recruited to the study and their primary carer over a period twelve months. The use of the anal plug will be compared to the usual care during this phase using a number of validated tools. In addition, both patients and carers will be asked to participate by completing a pre and post satisfaction survey which will also include a quality of life measure. </summary>
