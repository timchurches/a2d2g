    <studytitle>Coronary Angiography, Transcranial Doppler and Cognitive Health (CATCH) Study</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>The prospective observational CATCH study will test whether the microembolic count during Left Heart Catheterisation (LHC) for either Coronary Angiography (CA) or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is associated with cognitive change following the procedure and assess the time course of these changes over a 3 month period.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>To test whether microembolic count during left heart catheterisation (LHC) for coronary angiography (CA) or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is associated with cognitive change following the procedure. Patients will complete a battery of conventional and computerised neuropsychological tests preoperatively. The tests take about 1 hour to complete. The computerised battery of tests will then be administered one week, six weeks and 3 months post procedure to identify changes in cognitive function. Quality of Life (QoL), mood, Acitivities of Daily Living (ADL) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) will be assessed preoperatively and 3 months post procedure. Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring will be performed for a 15 minute epoch immediately before angiography. The signal will be recorded on audio tape for later review. Monitoring will be continuous during the angiogram. The total number of microemboli for the whole angiogram will be used for the analysis.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Injecting dye into the heart is a common investigation that helps diagnose coronary artery disease. Although it is known that small bubbles of air are often injected during this procedure and may enter the brain, they have been generally thought to be harmless. We plan to measure cognitive function before and after the heart is studied to see if these small bubbles alter brain function.</summary>
