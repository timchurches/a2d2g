  <interventions>
    <interventions>Validated Standardised Operation-Specific Instructional Tool
Both tools (Total Hip Replacement and Operative Laparoscopy) are multimedia based, linear in format, and require about 15 minutes to view on a computer. They require simple user interaction (mouse click) to progress through, and allow users to review previously received information, but not to skip forward.
Participants only view the tool relevant to their surgery once during the trial.
The timing of the use of these tools was not regulated during the trial. Participants were recruited in surgeons rooms, outpatient clinics, and pre-admission clinics, and the information was delivered when participants were available.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment (standard practice)
All participating surgeons educated their patients in their usual way. No effort was made to catalogue the various methods, though a verbal discussion is the standard way of disclosing such information. Some surgeons also provide college endorsed brochures to augment this discussion.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently all patients about to undergo elective surgery in common law countries are required to give their informed consent to proceed. However, the literature suggests that many participants are not well informed when they give their consent. The aim of this study is to assess baseline knoweldge of elective procedures. The secondary aim is to see if baseline knowledge can then be improved through the use of an operation-specific instructional tool</summary>
