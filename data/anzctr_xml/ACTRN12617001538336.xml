  <interventions>
    <interventions>The internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Program comprises 6 lessons completed over 10 weeks. It comprises psychoeducation about depression and anxeity as well as CBT techniques including thought challenging, behavioural activation, graded exposure and relapse prevention. One lesson will be released every 7 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 5 days between lessons), with each participant taking between one and two weeks to each lesson (10 weeks in total). Each lesson will take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. Participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, homework exercises, extra resources, for each lesson. Participants are advised to spend at least 3-4 hours per week working through the lesson material, revisiting the content and homework tasks/ practicing the skills. Clinician guidance will be provided in the form of email or phone contact from the clinician (registered clinical psychologist) after completion of the first two lessons, then as required. The participant is able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations, the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email. This mode of contact is dependent on what is clinically indicated in terms of the participant's distress score and or what the participant may have communicated (in the form of phone or email contact) to the clinician. The mode of contact (email or phone or both) therefore is dependent on the clinician's clinical judgement of the situation in hand.
Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practicing skills.</interventions>
    <comparator>The internet-delivered Mindfulness Skills Program comprises 6 lessons completed over 10 weeks. It comprises formal and informal mindfulness exercises (including guided mindfulness meditations (provided on a CD, or downloadable audio file) and written instruction for using mindfulness in daily life). One lesson will be released every 7 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 5 days between lessons), with each participant taking between one and two weeks to each lesson (10 weeks in total).
