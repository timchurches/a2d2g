    <interventions>Intervention Arms:

Participants will be asked to consume two 150ml serves of Milk per day for 24 weeks. Each of the following constitutes an active intervention arm:
1) Micronutrient enriched milk: fortified with Vitamin D (2.5 mcg/serve), Vitamin A (150mcg/serve), calcium (280mg/serve), zinc (3mg/serve); and iron (4mg/serve).

2) Milk Lipids + Micronutrient enriched milk: fortified with Vitamin D (2.5 mcg/serve), Vitamin A (150mcg/serve), calcium (280mg/serve), zinc (3mg/serve); iron (4mg/serve); and 150mg/serve milk phospholipids


Participants will present to the CSIRO Clinic at baseline and 24 weeks to donate a blood sample and undergo cognitive and physical activity testing. In addition, prior to presenting to the clinic at the nominated time points, caregivers of the participants will complete a variety of questionnaires.

Adherence will be monitored via a fortnightly survey completed online by the primary caregivers. Information collected in this survey includes serves per day of the intervention product in order to estimate compliance. Research team members will follow-up participants who are at risk of not meeting adequate compliance levels.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Verbal Learning &amp; Memory:

The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test is a measure of a variety of verbal memory related functions including short-term auditory memory, rate of learning and memory retention. The RVLT consists of 15 monosyllabic words that are presented to participants in a fixed sequence at the rate of one word every two seconds. After presentation, participants free-recall as many words as they can. The encoding-recall procedure is repeated five times. The maximum and total number of correctly repeated words are recorded.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Working Memory:

The Digit Span task is a common psychometric measure used to assess WM capacity. In the forward-span version of this task, numbers are read aurally by the examiner at a rate of one-per-second. List sizes range from two numbers (e.g., 3  5) up to ten numbers. Participants repeat the number list in the same order as presented. Backwards digit span is identical to forward in presentation but participants are required to recall the numbers in reverse order (e.g., 3  5  8 would be recalled as 8  5  3). This test takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. Performance is assessed for forward and backward span, as well as combined Working Memory score.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Attention:

The Childrens Color Trails Test 1 &amp; 2 (CCTT) is an individually administered, orthographic (paper and pencil), neuropsychological instrument designed to provide an objectively scored measure of sustained visual attention, sequencing, psychomotor speed, and cognitive flexibility. In CCTT1, the participant is required to connect a series of randomly arrange numbers in ascending order from 1 through 15. In CCTT2, the participant alternates between sequencing number and colours. Performance on both tasks is combined to reflect overall sustained attention, and an interference score is calculated as the difference between the two tasks-</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Global Cognitive Function: 

The Ravens Coloured Progressive Matrices is a nonverbal reasoning test measuring performance IQ and general cognitive function. In this test, 36 items consisting of incomplete puzzles are presented to participants, who select the missing piece for the solution from a set of answer options presented. This test is completed under a 15-minute time limit. Scores are expressed in raw form and percentile form based on normative data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to test the impact of micronutrient enhance or micronutrient + milk lipid enhanced milk beverages on cognitive function in primary school aged children. The intervention products have been formulated on the basis of growing research suggesting a beneficial role of milk lipids for supporting brain health and, by extension, cognitive function.

As part of this study, children aged between 7 and 9-years + 4-months at trial commencement will be randomly allocated to an active intervention arm (micronutrient enhanced OR micronutrient + milk lipid enhanced) or placebo arm (standard milk). Participants will consume two 150ml serves of the study product daily for 24 weeks.

On the basis of previous research results on both micronutrient and milk lipids, the following hypotheses are made:
1) Consumption of two serves of micronutrient + milk lipid enhance beverages daily for six months will lead to improved cognitive function compared to micronutrient and control groups. 
2) Consumption of two serves of micronutrient enhanced beverages daily for six months will lead to improved cognitive function compared to the control group.
