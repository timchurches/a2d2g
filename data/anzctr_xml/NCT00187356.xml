  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Radial Artery and Saphenous Vein Grafts Randomized to either right coronary or left circumflex coronary artery territories

Experimental: Surgical Conduit - The surgical arm will be composed of the experimental arm (the use of the radial artery) versus an active comparator (the use of the saphenous vein graft).


Treatment: surgery: Radial Artery and Saphenous Vein Grafts Randomized to either right coronary or left circumflex coronary artery territories
Each patient will receive both study grafts (Radial artery and Study Saphenous vein graft). The within-patient randomization scheme will dictate whether the radial goes to the right or circumflex territory. The saphenous vein graft will go to the opposing territory.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bypass surgery is often required to treat severe coronary heart disease. Either arteries or
      veins can be used as bypass grafts. We wish to compare the long-term durability of the
      saphenous vein from the leg to that of the radial artery from the fore-arm when used as
      bypass grafts. We are examining how many of these grafts are still functioning beyond 5 years
      after bypass surgery by performing a coronary angiogram. After 1-year, we found that radial
      arteries were more likely to be functioning than saphenous veins. We hypothesize that radial
      arteries will continue to be superior beyond 5 years.</summary>
