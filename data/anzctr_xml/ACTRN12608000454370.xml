  <interventions>
    <interventions>The phonics treatment trained letter recognition, parsing, letter-sound rules, and blending. Sight-word treatment trained children to associate written irregular words (i.e., those that do not follow the letter-sound rules) with the appropriate pronunciations. These skills were trained using software programs. Children trained at home for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for 8 weeks.

There were three treatment groups. Group 1 did no treatment (8 weeks) followed by phonics treatment (8 weeks) followed by sight-word treatment (8 weeks). Group 2 did no treatment (8 weeks) followed by sight-word treatment (8 weeks) followed by phonics treatment (8 weeks). Group 3 did no treatment (8 weeks) followed by a mix of phonics and sight-word treatment (8 weeks) followed by the same mix of phonics and sight-word treatment (8 weeks). Trainees rested for one week between 8-week training periods.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study used a double-baseline control. At the start of the study, each child in each group completed the outcomes measures (Time 1). After 8 weeks of *no* treatment, they redid the same tests (Time 2). We subtracted their scores at Time 1 from Time 2 to reveal "non-training" effects (e.g., test-retest effects, regression to the mean effects, maturation effects) on each test. In our analyses, we compared gains over each treatment periods to these non-training effects. Gains were only considered to be valid treatment effects if they were statistically significantly larger than the non-training effects.</comparator>

    <concealment>Children with nonword or irregular word reading accuracy below the average range (i.e., below the 16th percentile) were allocated to Group 1, 2, or 3 using a quasi-randomised procedure based on time of enrolment (i.e., months 1 to 6 for Group 1, months 7 to 12 for Group 2 , and months 13 to 18 for Group 3).

If a child was deemed eligible for the study, the lead research assistant would allocate them to the appropriate group, which was stored in a centralised database. Subsequent testing of each child was done by another research assistants who were unaware of group allocation. No child was tested twice by the same research assistant.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>To determine if there was a reliable difference between 8 weeks of phonics and sight word training, we used a between-group ANCOVA (controlling for each groups corresponding non-training gains) to compare Time 1-Time 3 gains for each group. To determine if different orders of training had different effects on each outcome, we used a between-groups ANCOVA (controlling for non-training gains) to compare Time 1-Time 4 gains for each group. 

Size of groups was determined based on outcomes of previous group studies of case studies suggesting that phonics training would have large effects on reading skills that depended heavily on phonics skills (d =0.8) and sight word training would have large effects on reading skills that depended on recognising whole words from memory (d = 0.8). With a power of 0.8, this equates to at least 26 children per group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study tested potential treatments for Australian children who have severe problems learning to read. Some of poor readers find it hard to read via the letter-sound rules (phonics), some find it hard to read whole words by sight (sight-word reading), and many have both of these problems.

In this study, one group of poor readers (N = 36) did 8 weeks of phonics training and then 8 weeks of sight word training; one group did the reverse (N = 36); and one group did phonics and sight word training simultaneously for two 8-week periods (N = 32). Sight word training lead to significant gains in sight word reading measures that were larger than gains made from phonics training; phonics training lead to statistically significant gains in a phonics reading measure that were larger than gains made from sight word training; and both types of training lead to significant gains in general reading that were similar in size. Training phonics before sight words had a slight advantage over the reverse order.

These findings demonstrate the reliability of both phonics and sight word training in treating poor readers. This will aid Australias efforts to counteract the effects of poor reading in children by revealing how different treatments should be tailored to children with different types of reading impairment.
