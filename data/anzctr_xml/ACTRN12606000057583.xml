  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will compare 4 anticoagulation treatments in infants during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass:

2) anticoagulation with intravenous heparin 3 mg/kg plus 20 ppm nitric oxide (NO) gas added to the oxygenator
3) anticoagulation with intravenous heparin 3 mg/kg plus intravenous infusion of prostacyclin 2 ng/kg/min
4) anticoagulation with intravenous heparin 3 mg/kg plus combination of 20 ppm NO gas added to oxygenator and intravenous infusion of prostacyclin 2 ng/kg/min</interventions>
    <comparator>1) standard anticoagulation with intravenous heparin 3 mg/kg</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>None</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if supplementation of standard heparin anticoagulation with NO gas and/or prostacyclin in infants reduces activation of platelets and the coagulation cascade</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, and preserves platelet function, measured 6 and 24 hours after the end of bypass.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if supplementation of standard heparin anticoagulation with NO gas and/or prostacyclin in infants during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces postoperative blood loss.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured 6 and 24 hours after the end of bypass, or requirement for blood or blood products in Intensive Care and in the period between the end of surgery and hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Infants of either sex and less than one year of age having open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and who have no pre-existing haemostatic abnormality or platelet dysfunction, will be eligible for the study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria> Infants will be excluded if 1) cardiac output is greater than 1.5 litres/min; 2) body weight is less than 3 kg; 3) they have a known abnormality of platelet function or are on anti-platelet therapy; 4) they are receiving inhaled nitric oxide gas or any nitric oxide-donor therapy; 5) they have a known blood coagulation abnormality or are on anticoagulation therapy.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>At the start of surgery, the perfusionist performing cardiopulmonary bypass will open sealed envelope containing information on treatment group allocation</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Subjects will be blinded.  For reasons of patient safety, operating theatre staff will not be blinded to type of treatment.  However, staff performing laboratory tests for primary outcome and clinical data collection for secondary outcomes will be blinded to treatment type.</designfeatures>
