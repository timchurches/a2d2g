  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Indacaterol 150 µg
Treatment: drugs - Indacaterol 300 µg
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to indacaterol

Experimental: Indacaterol 150 µg - Patients inhaled indacaterol 150 µg via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) once daily (od) in the morning (between 8:00 and 11:00 AM) for 26 weeks. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting ß2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.

Experimental: Indacaterol 300 µg - Patients inhaled indacaterol 300 µg via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) once daily (od) in the morning (between 8:00 and 11:00 AM) for 26 weeks. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting ß2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo to indacaterol - Patients inhaled placebo to indacaterol via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) once daily (od) in the morning (between 8:00 and 11:00 AM) for 26 weeks. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting ß2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.


Treatment: drugs: Indacaterol 150 µg
Indacaterol was supplied in powder-filled capsules with a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI).

Treatment: drugs: Indacaterol 300 µg
Indacaterol was supplied in powder-filled capsules with a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI).

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to indacaterol
Placebo to indacaterol was supplied in powder-filled capsules with a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12 + 1 Day, Day 85 - FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose at the end of treatment. The analysis included baseline FEV1 and FEV1 pre-dose and 10-15 minutes post-dose of salbutamol/albuterol during screening as covariates.</outcome>
