  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be randomly allocated to receive a single dose of each of the following five treatments in a balanced five-way crossover sequence:
Treatment A: Intravenous administration of paracetamol 1000 mg + ibuprofen 300 mg/100mL infusion - as a 15 minutes infusion
Treatment B:     Intravenous paracetamol 1000 mg/100mL infusion - as a15 minutes infusion
Treatment C:     Intravenous ibuprofen 300 mg/100mL infusion- as a15 minutes infusion
Treatment D:   Intravenous paracetamol 500 mg + ibuprofen 150 mg/100 ml infusion - as 15 minutes infusion 
Treatment E:    Two tablets of a fixed dose combination product containing paracetamol 500 mg + ibuprofen 150 mg/tablet -oral administration with a full glass of water
Washout period between treatments - 7 days
Dose frequency - single dose
All participants complete all five periods (treatments A-E) in  a cross-over fashion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC(0-t), AUC(0-8), Tmax and t1/2) of paracetamol and ibuprofen</outcome>
      <timepoint>Single dose study measuring plasma concentrations measured at the completion of the intravenous infusion at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30,45 minutes and at 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2,3,4,6,8,10 and 12 hours.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will be evaluated during each study period, and for 7 days following last dose of study drug administration. 
An acute safety evaluation will be performed during each study period by recording spontaneously reported AEs and by clinical assessments.
At the end of each study period an additional blood sample will be taken for haematology and biochemistry assessment.
Known NSAID adverse effects (i.e. GI ulceration, indigestion/stomach pain, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, water retention, renal failure, skin reactions and thromboembolic events), known paracetamol adverse effects (i.e. clinical evidence of hepatotoxicity) and known IV administration adverse effects (pain at injection site) will be summarized by treatment groups)
Adverse events will continue to be assessed up to 7 days after the last dose of the study medication by spontaneous reporting and a final follow-up call.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Single dose study measuring plasma concentrations over 5, 10, 15, 20, 45 minutes and at 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours.
Safety will be evaluated during each study period and for 7 days following study administration</timepoint>
