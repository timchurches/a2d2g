  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Bacillus of Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
Treatment: drugs - Mitomycin C (MMC)

Experimental: Treatment (Arm B):Intravesical BCG + MMC - Induction (weekly x 9); and followed by Maintenance (monthly x 9) beginning 3 months after randomisation.
Dosage of Bacillus of Calmette-Guerin (BCG) dependent on preferred brand of BCG by participating institution. Either 2-8 x 10^8 CFU for OncoTICE or, 81mg for ImmuCYST and TheraCys. Prior to treatment commencement, investigators should nominate which BCG brand will be used. The same brand of BCG must be used for all treatment administered to an individual participant throughout the study.
Dosage of Mitomycin (MMC) fixed at 40mg per instillation.

Other: Treatment (Arm A): Intravesical BCG - Induction (weekly x 6); and followed by Maintenance (monthly x 10) beginning 3 months after randomisation.
Dosage of Bacillus of Calmette-Guerin (BCG) dependent on preferred brand of BCG by participating institution. Either 2-8 x 10^8 CFU for OncoTICE or, 81mg for ImmuCYST and TheraCys. Prior to treatment commencement, investigators should nominate which BCG brand will be used. The same brand of BCG must be used for all treatment administered to an individual participant throughout the study.


Other interventions: Bacillus of Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
A strain of tubercle bacillus which modifies biologic response.

Treatment: drugs: Mitomycin C (MMC)
An antibiotic produced by a soil actinomycete which inhibits DNA synthesis.
