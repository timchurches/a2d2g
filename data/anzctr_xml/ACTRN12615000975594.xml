  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational only. Cross-sectional survey of cancer patients and cancer care staff. 
The aim of this study is to identify the degree to which smoking cessation care delivery is provided and describe opportunities for and barriers to improving care. 
Cancer patients receiving treatment in medical, radiation or surgical oncology units will be recruited. Similarly, staff providing care in these units will complete the staff survey. Allied health staff that are involved in the care of cancer patients will also be recruited.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the current smoking cessation care provided to cancer patients in New South Wales (NSW) and identify opportunities and barriers to achieving routine clinician delivery of smoking cessation care. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with any form of cancer in the past 12 months and attend a medical, radiation or surgical oncology clinic at one of the recruiting hospitals in NSW. 

Study details 
All participants in this study will complete one survey. Patients will answer a survey with questions regarding the smoking cessation care they have been offered, while staff will be asked questions regarding the smoking cessation care offer to cancer patients. 
Results from the surveys will be reviewed and used to evaluate the current smoking cessation care provided, and identify opportunities for implementing routine care across NSW. It is hoped that information gained as part of this study will provide information on the current care provided to cancer patients who smoke, and provide the first step towards achieving a system-wide smoking cessation protocol for these patients.</summary>
