  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible IBD patients will be randomly allocated to receive either 100mg or 50mg of allopurinol orally in 1:1 using computer generated list. Patients will continue to take their usual azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine at reduced doses as determined by the study doctor. The study duration for each individual patient is 24 weeks. Allopurinol will be taken once dail and frequency for usual azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine treatments remains regular.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Adult inflammatory bowel disease patients (both Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis) taking thiopurine immunomodulators  (azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine) and fulfilling all 3 of the following criteria will be eligible:

A) Patient is not in a corticosteroid-free remission. Remission is defined as a Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) = 4 for Crohn's Disease (CD) and a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) = 2 for Ulcerative Colitis (UC). 

B) Patient is metabolizing thiopurines preferentially to produce 6-MMP instead of 6-TGN, with 6-MMP &gt; 5,000 pmol/8 x 108 Red Blood Count (RBC) and 6-TGN &lt; 235 pmol/8 x 108 Red Blood Count (RBC).

C) Patient has an adequate initial white blood cell count (WBC) to tolerate the anticipated White Blood Count (WBC) reduction after the addition of allopurinol: White Blood Count(WBC) = 4.5 x109/L.

Additionally, patients or their legal guardians must be willing and able to sign the written, informed consent document.

(Patients will be eligible for screening as soon as their metabolite profile identifies them to be shunting towards 6-MMP production, meaning a full 12 week trial of thiopurine therapy is not required prior to screening).</inclusivecriteria>

2. Concomitant therapy with the following immune modified and biologic agents will not be allowed within the following time intervals from the screening visit:
a. Cyclosporine- 4 weeks
b. Infliximab- 4 weeks
c. Any investigational study drug - 4 weeks.

3. Patients, or legal guardians, unable to give informed consent.
4. Pregnant and breast-feeding patients

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is understood that the body metabolizes azathioprine (AZA) to produce two chemical end-products: 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP). 6-TGN is the chemical that makes these drugs work, while 6-MMP  causes side-effects. Our research group has previously shown that by adding another drug, allopurinol, patients who otherwise made 6-MMP switched to instead produce 6-TGN, thereby increasing their response to these drugs. Our proposal is for a clinical trial that aims to confirm the safety and efficacy of this clinical maneuver.</summary>
