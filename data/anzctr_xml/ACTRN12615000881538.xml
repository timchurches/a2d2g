  <interventions>
    <interventions>Approximately 40 participants will be treated with a daily dosage regimen of Oraxol 205 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2, and 3 every week (i.e. a total Oraxol dose of 615mg/m2 over three days of dosing), or as adjusted in KX-ORAX-002 to achieve bioequivalence to IV paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour. Oraxol will be administered once daily for 3 consecutive days on a weekly basis as 15 mg oral HM30181AK-US tablet plus oral paclitaxel capsules. Oral paclitaxel is administered one hour after the HM30181AK-US tablet. Participants must fast for 8 hours prior to administration of Oraxol and for four hours afterwards. Participants will be asked to return their daily Oraxol dose cards to check for compliance. Doses during the PK sampling week (Week 4 or later) will be administered at the study site.
Participants may enter this study after completion of a previous study involving Oraxol (KX-ORAX-002). The study procedures are the same regardless of whether a participant was in the previous study or not; however some data (e.g. medical history) collected for the previous study would not need to be collected again for this study. The dose and administartion of Oraxol to be used in this study will be the same as the dose in the previous study that is confirmed to be equivalent to the administration of IV Paclitaxel at 80mg/m2.
Participants may continue to receive treatment in this study until any of the following occur: death, successful completion of the course of treatment prescribed by the investigator, progression of disease, AEs not associated with progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, termination of the study by the Sponsor, or other specified reason.  
If needed at any time, treatment may be delayed for up to 2 weeks to allow a participant to recover to less than or equal to Grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) toxicity from prior chemotherapy.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability as assessed by the incidence of adverse events. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as those AEs with an onset after dosing and those pre-existing AEs that worsen during the study.  
AEs will include those reported by participants as well as those observed by the clinical team, or clinically significant changes in lab tests, vital signs and ECGs. Possible AEs may include gastrointestinal effects and abdominal pain but as this is an early phase clinical trial and the likely AE profile is not yet known.</outcome>

      <timepoint>From pre-dose until 8 hours post-dose on Day 3. This time period is shorter to the time period used in the KX-ORAX-002 study, where PK blood samples are being collected until 144 hours post-dose on Day 3. PK samples will be collected during dosing for Week 4; or may be done during a later dosing week at the investigator's discretion and/or at the participant's convenience. </timepoint>

      <outcome>Safety as assessed by vital signs. Vital signs include pulse rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Vital signs are measured at Screening/Baseline, before dosing on Day 1 of every 3rd week (Weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, etc), and before dosing during the inpatient dosing week and at the Final Visit (within 28 days after the last dose of study drug was taken, and preferably before the participant receives any additional chemotherapy).</timepoint>

Complete PEs will be performed at Screening/Baseline and at the Final Visit.  All other physical examinations do not require complete examinations but will be targeted to the signs and symptoms related to Adverse Event Reporting.  Additional examinations will be performed as clinically indicated to assess adverse events.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary endpoints: Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as those AEs with an onset after dosing and those pre-existing AEs that worsen during the study.  Verbatim terms on the CRFs will be mapped to preferred terms (PTs) and system organ classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 16.1 or later).  The CTCAE criteria (version 4.03 or later) will be used to grade the severity of the AEs.  Participant incidence of AEs will be displayed by SOC.  Adverse events will also be summarized by severity and relationship to the study drug.  Participant incidence of SAEs will also be displayed. Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each subsequent time-point.  Changes from baseline will also be summarized.  In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal-high at baseline versus low-normal-high at follow-up in a 3-by-3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory values from baseline to follow-up. 
Secondary endpoints: Oraxol PK data from this study will be compared with Oraxol PK data from study KX-ORAX-002.
Using the PK samples collected at designated timepoints, a population PK analysis will be explored and then used to estimate individual AUCs or clearance (CL) of paclitaxel.  The effect of patient factors on paclitaxel PK will be explored that may explain interpatient variability in PK parameters.  Both inter- and intra-patient variability in paclitaxel AUC will also be assessed.  Paclitaxel AUC, as well as Cmax, will then be tested for association changes with toxicity endpoints, such as neutropenia or incidence of neuropathy.  If an observable trend exists among changes in any of these AEs, a PK/PD model will be developed to evaluate the exposure-response relationship between the time course of paclitaxel plasma exposure (eg, AUC, Cmax) in relation to changes in neutropenia and/or neuropathy.  Demographic and clinical data (ie, ethnicity, age, BSA, ECOG status, etc.) will be utilized to assess inter-patient variability in the model.
The results of other safety assessments (concomitant medications, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, and ECOG performance status) will also be evaluated.
Safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (eg, n, mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for categorical variables).  
A sample size of 40 patients is based on practical considerations, participant safety, and the goal of assessing the safety and tolerability of Oraxol. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oraxol is a combination of an oral tablet, HM30181 methanesulfonate, and capsules that contain paclitaxel.  HM30181 is a drug that helps the body absorb paclitaxel, a drug used to treat cancer. Initially this study is intended as an extension study of KX-Orax-002 pharmacokinetic study for patients who wish to continue Oraxol treatment and who are eligible to participate. Once the dose of Oraxol has been confirmed in the KX-ORAX-002 study, then enrolment of patients who have not participated in the KX-ORAX-002 study will be allowed.  The purpose of this study is to check the safety and tolerability of Oraxol when it is administered on a weekly basis and to confirm that the blood levels of paclitaxel after several doses of Oraxol are similar to the levels expected. </summary>
