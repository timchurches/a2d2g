Standard preparation as described for intravitreal injections.

Treatment: drugs: Intravitreal Methotrexate 400 µg
Intravitreal Methotrexate 400 µg injection procedures should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions which include the use of sterile gloves and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide such as betadine, applied to the periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface are required prior to the injection.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent change in central subfield thickness from the baseline OCT measurement - The primary outcome is the percent change in central subfield thickness from the baseline OCT measurement at the 12-week visit. The assessment of OCT outcomes will be performed by masked readers. The 12-week visit was chosen as the time to assess the primary outcome because the ranibizumab treatment arm specifies injections at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks in all participants, and because the peak benefit for the dexamethasone pellet appears to be at the 8 to 12 weeks.</outcome>

    <summary>The Macular Edema Ranibizumab v. Intravitreal anti-inflammatory Therapy (MERIT) Trial will
      compare the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal methotrexate, intravitreal
      ranibizumab, and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant for the treatment of uveitic macular
      edema persisting or reoccurring after an intravitreal corticosteroid injection. MERIT is a
      parallel design (1:1:1), randomized comparative trial with an anniversary close-out at the 6
      month clinic visit. The primary outcome is percent change in central subfield thickness from
      the baseline OCT measurement to the 12 week visit.</summary>
