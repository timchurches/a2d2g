  <interventions>
    <interventions>The run-in period of this study will involve participants taking 200ug/day budesonide (Pulmicort Turbuhaler) for 4 weeks.
This will be followed by a two arm interventional study period which involves administration of budesonide modified into either small or large aerosols, for the treatment of asthma.
For both arm 1 (small aerosols ~1um) and arm 2 (large aerosols ~5um) participants will take 800ug/day of the study drug for a period of 12 weeks.

Adherence throughout the run-in period and the study period will be monitored with daily peak flow diaries to record lung function, daily asthma control questionnaires, and fortnightly phone calls from the research team.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthma affects approximately 1:10 adults and 1:5 children. Although most subjects attained good control of their asthma with conventional treatment, there is a significant proportion who are resistant to conventional treatment and remain uncontrolled. Although there are several mechanisms that may explain incomplete asthma control, one important factor which is potentially easy to address, is the presence of severe small airways disease that is not effectively improved by inhaled corticosteroid treatment.

The small airways are an important determinant of asthma control and severity. They are airways with an internal diameter of 2 mm or less and because of the branching nature of the airway tree, occupy a very large surface area compared to the larger and more proximal airways. We have recently shown that small airway function improves with high dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment in parallel with improving asthma control. Furthermore, asthma control and severity are strongly related to small airways function.

It therefore follows that persisting small airways disease is an important determinant of severe asthma and that better treatment of the small airways will improve the treatment of severe asthma. The obvious problem with treating small airways that are severely affected by inflammation and tissue remodelling, is that it is difficult to deposit therapeutic aerosols there. This is because ventilation to those airways is poor, because of severe airway narrowing and closure. Therapeutic aerosols require ventilation to carry them to the target sites and so the worst affected airways receive less of the inhaled aerosols. 

There is a theoretical advantage of using fine particle aerosols, because they are more likely to be carried to areas where ventilation is poor. Particles greater than 3  5 um deposit in the medium to large airways, while smaller particles will be carried into smaller and narrowed airways. Therefore, we propose that small particle aerosols will be more effective in uncontrolled asthma than larger particle aerosols.</summary>
