    <interventions>Intervention: Flurbiprofen spray formulation, containing flurbiprofen 8.75 mg /540 microlitres (3 sprays aimed towards the back of the mouth equal 1 dose). Eligible participants will receive their first dose of randomised treatment in the clinic. They should not take their second dose until 6 hours later. Subsequent doses should be taken every 3-6 hours; up to a maximum of 5 doses per day. Participants will continue to take trial medication until their sore throat resolves or the end of Day 3 of study treatment, whichever occurs first.

Rescue Medication: paracetamol 500 mg tablets. Only if required, one to two tablets orally every four hours (to a maximum of eight tablets in 24 hours). Not to be take for more than three days.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be recruited directly by presenting to their general practitioner (GP) when seeking treatment for their sore throat. Patients will also be recruited into the trial by referrals from pharmacies local to the GP practices and by responding directly to advertising.
Patients who consent to take part in the study will be allocated a unique subject number in numerical sequence. Issue of the study drug in this sequence will ensure randomisation.
After screening, eligible patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised to 1 of 2 blinded treatments, flurbiprofen spray or placebo spray.
Reckitt Benckiser (RB Investigational Material Supply Unit (IMSU) will hold the master code for the randomisation schedule and will supply the Investigator with the randomisation code for each patient as a sealed envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>Matching drug supplies will be randomised by RB IMSU, according to a computer-produced randomisation schedule. 

The randomisation schedule will be checked by a statistician not involved in the analysis of the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a flurbiprofen spray formulation, over a period of three days, in relieving the symptoms of sore throat due to an upper respiratory tract infection. Flurbiprofen lozenges are approved by the Australian governments health authority, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for the relief of pain, swelling and inflammation due to severe sore throat. In this study, a spray formulation of flurbiprofen will be tested to determine if it too is effective in the relief of sore throat.</summary>
