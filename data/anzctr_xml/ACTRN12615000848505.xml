  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Participants taking osteoporosis (OP) medication will stand on low intensity whole body vibration (LWBV) device (30Hz) for 10 min/day, 5 day/week (for first 12 months) and receive no vibration treatment for the second 12 months. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored through a diary provided to the participants to record their treatment. 

Arm 2:  Participants not taking OP medication will stand on LWBV device for 10 min/day, 5 day/week (for first 12 months) and receive no vibration treatment for the second 12 months. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored through a diary provided to the participants to record their treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Note: Active devices will provide a 30 Hz, 0.4 g vertical mechanical perturbation. The active and sham devices are almost indistinguishable when operating as the LWBV stimulus is virtually imperceptible and both devices emit the same audible hum. 

Arm 3: Participants taking OP medication will stand on sham LWBV device for 10 min/day, 5 day/week (for first 12 months) and receive no vibration treatment for the second 12 months. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored through a diary provided to the participants to record their treatment.

Arm 4: Participants not taking OP medication will stand on sham LWBV device for 10 min/day, 5 day/week (for first 12 months) and receive no vibration treatment for the second 12 months.

At 12 months, separate analyses of the two primary hypotheses (with and without OP meds) will be performed. Femoral neck BMD loss is defined as [12 month femoral neck BMD] minus [0 month femoral neck BMD] = 0. To compare proportions of participants gaining or maintaining femoral neck BMD by treatment groups in both primary and secondary hypotheses, logistic regression models will be used, with adjustments for age, baseline values, BMI, physical activity, calcium consumption and serum 25(OH)D. The coefficient of variation of repeat measures of femoral neck BMD in our lab is 1.5% with a small root mean square error of 0.002 g/cm2. BMD measurement error will be appropriately addressed by adjusting the estimated odds ratios obtained from logistic regression models following standard statistical techniques71. Repeated measures comparisons of mean change in femoral neck BMD (gm/cm2) and secondary outcomes will also be conducted using univariate analyses, controlling for initial values, calcium, vitamin D and compliance. Separate analyses on adherence to medication will be conducted using treatment log diaries and information obtained during study visits and monthly meetings. The change in QoL scores over time will be compared between study groups using appropriate parametric and non-parametric techniques. Further exploratory analyses will include examination of secondary hypotheses and possible associations of anthropometric and compliance factors on the study outcomes. At 24 months, repeat analyses will be conducted to examine whether any treatment effect has been maintained.

In the absence of published data indicating the minimum percent improvement in the proportion of women losing bone over the course of a year required for public health benefit, we based our power calculations on a conservative estimate of 20%. Thus, from a two-sample difference of proportions test for 80% power with type 1 error of 5%, a sample size of 186 is required to detect hip BMD maintenance or gain in 50% of the LWBV group (30%+20%).  As a 2-year, home-based study could potentially experience greater attrition, we will over-recruit by 15% to power our exploratory analyses. Thus, to test primary hypothesis 1, we will recruit 214 participants (186 + 28). 

Similarly, no published data are available on which to base an estimate of the proportion of women on established OP meds who will gain BMD at the femoral neck over the course of a year. The single available study reporting related data cites a figure of roughly 88%49. Those data, however, represent the response to novel anti-resorptive therapy and are derived from a per protocol analysis. It is reasonable to assume the proportion of OP med participants observed gaining femoral neck BMD in the current study will be considerably less than 88%, given our intention-to-treat analysis, and their established drug treatment regime. Therefore, under the same assumption that a minimum 20% improvement in the proportion of participants gaining hip BMD is necessary for public health benefit to be achieved, and estimating 50% of participants on medications will gain hip BMD, to observe hip BMD gain in 70% (50%+20%) of the LWBV + OP meds group (with 80% power and 5% type 1 error), a sample size of 186 is again required. Including 15% over-recruitment to power exploratory analyses increases the number required to test primary hypothesis 2 to 214. Thus, to independently test both primary hypotheses, a total study n of 214 + 214 = 428 participants is required.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For the many individuals with established osteoporosis who will not, or cannot take medication there are currently no recommended therapeutic alternatives. Exercise, calcium and vitamin D are vital but insufficient therapies and are similarly limited by poor patient compliance. Whole body vibration (WBV) can be anabolic to the musculoskeletal system.   Early research has shown that WBV is a simple, passive therapy with much greater appeal to the target population than exercise or drugs. This trial will be the first to use rigorous methods to examine the effects of WBV alone, and in combination with drug therapy, to improve risk factors for hip fracture (bone density, balance and muscle strength). </summary>
