  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention in this study is the ward-level provision of Non Slip Socks (NSS) to admitted patients, as pragmatically implemented by ward nursing staff. The most common strategy for NSS provision across other hospital sites in Queensland surveyed prior to the project development is to provide NSS to all admitted patients. This provide-all approach is likely to be the most potent/efficacious and least costly strategy as it would not require any additional assessment. 

In the week prior to the intervention phase, a 15-minute education session (made available twice a day at nursing handover) will be delivered by one of the research team providing information on the NSS and the trial. It will be up to nursing staff to make decisions regarding the provision of NSS, but our education will suggest to provide all patients with non-slip socks and to advise patients that NSS are to be worn if not wearing well fitting enclosed shoes. We anticipate that on transitioning to the intervention phase, all current patients will be provided with NSS and after that, individual wards will determine processes to ensure NSS are provided on admission, with the ability to provide a new pair to all patients when soiled beyond wear. The approaches adopted by each ward (process as prescribed by ward leadership and as carried out by clinicians) and overall usage will be monitored through periodic contact between the study project officer and ward nursing managers and other senior nursing staff.


The trial will be undertaken over 6 months. In line with the stepped wedge cluster RCT design all sites will commence as control wards a with individual wards moving into an intervention state (in random order) at the starts of month 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  This will yield 15 months of control state data and 15 months of intervention state data.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care, where patients will be encouraged by clinical staff to use well-fitting closed footwear where available to mobilise (current best practice as per National Fall Prevention Guidelines and stated position of the Queensland Stay on Your Feet program). If patients are in possession of non-slip socks already, allowance/discouragement of their use will be dealt with as a clinical decision with advice from the West Moreton HHS fall prevention program staff (no specific guidance from this trial will be applied).

Due to the stepped wedge cluster RCT design of the present trial, control data will be collected from study wards prior to transition to the intervention state (where non-slip socks are provided).

Fall data will be captured by reviewing clinical incident reports completed after falls in trial wards and periodic contact with ward managers to identify falls that might not have been reported. A list of medical records for which in-hospital falls have been coded, will also be extracted at the completion of the trial, and records without corresponding clinical incident reports will be manually searched.

To compute the falls rate, monthly bed occupancy data will be secured from the clinical coding service. </outcome>

    <concealment>In the stepped wedge design, all participants (wards) will commence as control sites, but will transition to be intervention sites one ward at a time, at one-month intervals. The order of transition will be randomised, with the timing of transition concealed from staff in hospital wards until 2 weeks prior to transition. Hospital staff will not be blinded to group allocation (after allocation as occurred) as they will know at all times whether they are currently in the intervention or control phase (based on their access to non-slip socks).

 The implementation sequence will be computer-generated by an off-site statistician not involved in the conduct of the trial (but will be involved in analysis). The research assistant monitoring adherence and conducting focus groups will also not be blind to group allocation.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>A stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used, where wards are the cluster level. In a stepped wedge cluster RCT, all clusters (wards) start in the control phase and transition to the intervention phase at fixed intervals but in random order until all wards are receiving the intervention. Between-ward variability in other factors will therefore be controlled for through the stepped-wedge design. 

Due to the pragmatic nature of the trial individual patient-level consent was deemed to be not required by the approving HREC.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. The rate of falls (falls per 1000 patient bed days) and proportion of fallers between intervention and control time periods will be compared using multi-level mixed-effect negative binomial regression modelling. A patients fall(s) will be nested within the patient, while patients will be nested within wards. The effect of the socks will be considered a fixed effect, while patients and wards will be considered random effects. A covariate will be entered to adjust for seasonality in falls rates computed on the basis of twelve months of incident report data from each of the wards involved. Adherence data will be evaluated as a secondary analysis, with relative risk of falls between wards with high and low NSS compared.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Accidental falls due to slips and trips are among the most commonly reported hospital adverse events, accounting for between 20 and 40% of all incidents. Older inpatients are especially predisposed to falls due to multiple risk factors, including gait and mobility problems. Consequently, ensuring safe patient mobilisation is a central priority for inpatient fall prevention programs. 

Current fall prevention guidelines and best practice evidence promote the use of well-fitting closed footwear among older inpatients. Unfortunately, in acute settings, many patients do not have access to suitable footwear, due to factors such as unplanned admissions, patient oversight, or foot pathology. Due to the short average length of acute hospital stays, it can be challenging for wards to resolve patient footwear needs in a timely fashion.

As a result, many Australian facilities have begun adopting the practice of providing non-slip socks (NSS) to all older admitted inpatients; yet, the value of this practice is unclear. NSS are otherwise similar to conventional socks but provide various forms of rubberised tread on the sole. Commercial providers of NSS have advanced claims of reduced fall rates after implementing an NSS strategy although reliable, controlled studies have not been undertaken. 

Despite a continuing lack of evidence on the effect on falls rates, usage of NSS in the state of Queensland has escalated from one facility in 2008, to &gt;10 in 2014. Ipswich Hospital is among the few facilities where NSS are not routinely used. It is possible that NSS could be effective in reducing inpatient falls due to factors such as lower slip resistance than no or alternate footwear, acting as an alert for high risk patients and reminder to staff about falls prevention, however the diffusion of practice despite the lack of effectiveness data is a cause for increasing concern.  In order to provide clear guidance to facilities on the use of NSS, reliable data is required. 

The primary aim of the proposed research is to investigate the effect of a pragmatic, ward-level implementation of NSS on rates of falls and fallers in an inpatient population at a regional hospital in Ipswich, Australia and understand the implementation of the intervention. The secondary aim is to evaluate the likely cost-effectiveness of this approach.
