  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Internet Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (ICDSMP) is a pilot study of our
      existing, previous approved, Chronic Disease Self-Management Program Online. The online
      programme will be offered to 300 people with chronic disease in South Australia and evaluated
      for effectiveness, as well as satisfaction of both the South Australian peer facilitators and
      the participants with chronic disease. All participants will be recruited by the State of
      South Australia, after which they will complete informed consent and a questionnaire on a
      secure website housed at Stanford. They will take a 6-week online self-management program in
      groups of 20-25, and they fill our additional online questionnaires at 6 month and one year.</summary>
