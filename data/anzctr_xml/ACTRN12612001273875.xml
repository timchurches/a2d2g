  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Capio suturing device will be used to place the sacrospinous suture in the operation.  The Capio suturing device is a single use instrument used to placed the sacrospinous suture.  (The Miya Hook is a reusable instrument)  Two sutures will be placed through the sacrospinous ligament and the apex of the vagina during each operation.  The operation usually takes between 30 and 40minutes.  There is some suggestion in the literature that the Capio device requires less tissue dissection than the Miya Hook and may therefore result in shorter operation and less blood loss.</interventions>
    <comparator>The outcomes of surgery will be compared to already published outcomes using the Miya Hook.
Using the outcome of no vaginal prolapse beyond halfway in the vagina, the objective success rate of  sacrospinous colpopexy using the Miya Hook has been published as 67% and the subjective success rate, 94%( Maher CF, Murray CJ, Carey MP, Dwyer PL, Ugoni AM.  Iliococcygeus or Sacrospinous Fixation for Vaginal Vault Prolapse. Obstet Gynecol 2001;98:40-4.)</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse the data. For categorical outcomes (eg successful fixations) we will use frequency counts and for continuous data (eg operative time, estimated blood loss), means and standard deviations will be calculated.  Where continuous data is not normally distributed, we will use medians and range for the analysis.
When we are analysis the pre and postoperative questionnaires a paired sample t test will be used to calculate differences in mean scores between the pre and postperative scores on the ePAQ questionnaire. Differences in categorical items will be calculated using the Chi squared statistic.
