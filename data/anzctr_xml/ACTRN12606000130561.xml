The first group will apply ice to the affected ankle for 20 minutes every 2 hours while awake, for at least 48 hours, in keeping with standard discharge advice.                                                         The second group will wear a booty (containing cooling gel polymer) on the affected ankle for 20 minutes every 2 hours while awake, for at least 48 hours.                                                                     The third group will wear the gel polymer booty on the affected ankle continuously throughout the day, for at least 48 hours.

      <outcome>Ankle joint function will be assessed using the Karlsson scoring system (see Boyce 2005). This is a validated composite of eight weighted variables (eg. pain, swelling, stiffness etc). A score of 90 indicates no ankle problem and the lower the score, the worse the ankle.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The standard treatment regimen for uncomplicated ankle sprains comprises RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation). Assuming the patient is compliant then rest, compression and elevation can be applied with some consistency. Anecdotally, however, the application of ice to the affected area is more variable. This results from the availability of ice itself and the variability in which it is applied. Large ice blocks, chipped ice and frozen peas could be expected to have differing levels of effectiveness. Furthermore, the areas of the affected part actually in contact with this ice may vary considerably, depending upon the technique. Frozen gel packs have been used as an alternative to ice. However, these can be too cold and have been known to induce skin and subcutaneous tissue damage. They also lack compliance when frozen and may be difficult to wrap around the injured area effectively.
Recently, a polymer gel has been developed that has the properties of gentle and sustained extraction of heat from the environment (convection) and contacting surfaces (conduction). This gel can be modified to continue heat extraction until its own temperature reaches a pre-determined level of 6oC. This polymer gel can be fashioned into small or large plates that can be inserted into a variety of cloth garments for application to a range of body parts. It has been successfully employed in cooling vests to avoid heat stress and improve the performance of elite athletes. 
Does treatment with a gel polymer cooling regimen result in better function and reduced pain compared to traditional ice in the acute management of uncomplicated ankle sprains? This study will be a non-blinded randomised controlled trial comparing the use of standard ice with a cloth booty containing cooling gel polymer as an adjunct for treating sprained ankles. 135 patients will be randomised to one of three groups: episodic ankle cooling with ice, episodic cooling with gel polymer booty and continuous daytime cooling with the gel polymer booty. Each cooling regimen will last for at least 48 hours and all other treatments provided will be follow usual guidelines. Outcome measures of pain and ankle function will be sought at 5 and 15 days post-injury by telephone follow up. The findings of this study will inform best practice management of this common injury.</summary>
