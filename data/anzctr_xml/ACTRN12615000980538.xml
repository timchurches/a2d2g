  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA) which is also known as male patern baldness is a common form of hair loss in both men and women. Samumed Company is developing SM04554 for the treatment of AGA. SM04554 is a small molecule which activates  proteins involved in maintaining hair growth
The purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety and activity of a SM04554. This study drug is a solution to be rubbed onto the scalp once every day for 14 days. To obtain information on the how the body absorbs distributes and removes the drug form the body (pharmacokinetics), blood samples will be taken to measure the concentration of the study drug over the 14 days of application. This study will also check safety by measuring heart, liver and kidney function, number of blood cells, vital signs and scalp assessments.</summary>
