  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention Group: Participants will be posted feedback on their baseline assessment along with program materials (detailed workbook, set of digital scales, measuring tape, pedometer, kilojoule/calorie counter book and self-monitoring diary), which will be referred to over the 12-month intervention. Intervention participants will also be posted the same newsletters that the usual care participants receive (see below). They will receive up to 22 telephone calls from a Lifestyle Coach (Accredited Practising Dietitian with additional study-specific training in exercise promotion) over 12-months. The intervention is divided into 2 phases; an initial intensive 6-month phase (6 x weekly calls followed by 10 x fortnightly calls) followed by a 6-month maintenance-enhancement phase (6 x monthly calls). Each call will usually take around 30 minutes and will focus on increasing physical activity, improving eating habits (reducing energy intake) and reducing sitting time as well as developing behaviour change skills. Participants may choose to receive supplementary text messages (SMS) to give additional support for behaviour change. Participants will be encouraged to aim for weight loss of between 5-10% of their baseline body weight.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the usual care group will continue to receive their standard medical care. In addition, these participants will be posted written materials after each of their study assessments (baseline, 6-months, 12-months, 18-months). These written materials will include brief feedback from their study assessment, a Breast Cancer Network of Australia newsletter and a study newsletter.</comparator>

    <concealment>This study will use a two-stage consent process. Potentially eligible women will be identified through six hospitals within the greater Brisbane area – Mater Adult Hospital, Mater Private Hospital, Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Redcliffe Hospital, Greenslopes Private Hospital, North West Private Hospital. Nursing staff (e.g., Breast Care Nurse, Cancer Care Coordinator) will give a brief overview of the study and a study information pack (containing a study information brochure, consent to contact form and reply paid envelope) to patients.  Women who are interested in finding out more about the study are encouraged to complete the consent to contact form and post it back to the research team. Women who consent to being contacted by the research team will be mailed a participant information sheet and consent form and then will receive a telephone call to screen for eligibility, answer any questions and gain informed consent to participate in the study. The signed consent form will be returned to the researchers. Consenting participants will complete a baseline assessment. Following completion of the baseline assessment, a staff member who does not work on the study will allocate participants to the intervention or usual care group using a computer generated randomisation sequence.</concealment>
    <sequence>A staff member who does not work on the study will create a computer-generated randomisation plan using uneven block sizes (www.randomization.com). This randomisation plan will be used to allocate all participants to either the usual care group or the intervention group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a 12-month telephone-delivered weight loss program, as compared to usual care, for women who have recently completed primary treatment for breast cancer. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a woman aged between 18 and 75 years who has been diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer for which you have finished primary treatment (i.e. surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). You should also have a Body Mass Index between 25 and 45 kg/m2, indicating overweight/obesity and be able to travel to Brisbane to complete study assessments. 

Trial details: Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive a telephone-delivered weight loss intervention which involves up to 22 telephone calls from a Lifestyle Coach over a 12 month period. They will also receive program materials, including a detailed workbook, set of digital scales, measuring tape, pedometer, kilojoule/calorie counter book and self-monitoring diary. Participants in the other group will continue to receive their standard medical care plus 6 monthly feedback and newsletters. 

The program will be evaluated on its ability to achieve weight loss, and improve body composition, physical activity, dietary intake, clinical biomarkers of metabolic health, genomic and DNA methylation-based biomarkers, blood pressure and patient-reported outcomes (quality of life, body image, fatigue, menopausal symptoms).</summary>
