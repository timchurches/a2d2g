    <studytitle>Patterns of treatment resistance and switching strategies in unipolar affective disorder</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients with unipolar affective disorder who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of an antidepressant, is a switching strategy (from Citalopram to Despiramine or from Desipramine to Citalopram) more effective than a non-switching strategy in terms of response and remission rates?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>patients not responding to one or more previous antidepressant treatment are randomly allocated to:
CITALOPRAM (CITA) 40-60 mg oral tablet once daily for 4 weeks vs DESIPRAMINE (DESI) 150-200 mg oral tablet twice daily for 4 weeks trials.
The non-responder patients after 4 weeks will be immediately divided in 4 arms with no wash out including 
- 2 arms for continuation of the same antidepressant (AD) ('CITA' - 'CITA' and 
'DESI' - 'DESI') at the same dose for 4 weeks.
- 2 arms for swiching from 'CITA' to 'DESI' and 'DESI' to 'CITA' for 4 weeks.

Flexible doses are allowed according to tolerance and efficacy:

- DESI: In some cases the maximum tolerated dose can be less than 200 mg, but must be at least 150 mg. 
- The period to reach 150 mg or 200 mg of DESI can be adapted in function of tolerability. The dose can be reached slowly (but no more than 1 month in total), but it is mandatory to have at least 2 weeks of minimal dose (more than 150 mg). This means that some patients will be treated for 5 or 6 weeks. The same flexibility can be applied to citalopram for which the minimal dose is 40 mg.
- For patients &gt; 65 years, the maximum doses are 200 mg/day for DESI and 40 mg/day for CITA.

-The highest dose administered will be maintained until the end of the study whenever possible. However, at any time after visit 2, the investigator may reduce a patient's dose to improve tolerance.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although more and more effective treatment strategies are available to manage depression, 20 to 30 % of depressed patients still remain unhelped (Treatment Resistant Depression - TRD). The importance of this problem must also be considered in regard to numerous documented treatment algorithms and strategies in the literature, including drug combinations and potentiations. This study will address the issue of the antidepressant switching strategies for TRD.
Objective:
To compare switching strategies of specific Noradrenergic and Serotoninergic treatments for depressed inpatients and outpatients who are not responding to an adequate therapeutic trial of antidepressant.</summary>
