  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a 2-arm randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial to determine which
      of two strategies at birth are best to optimally aerate the lung of preterm infants.
      Specifically we will determine in 600 infants of 23-26 weeks gestational age (GA) requiring
      respiratory support at birth which of two lung opening strategies - either a standard
      PEEP/CPAP of 5-7 cm H2O in the delivery room (DR), as compared to early lung recruitment
      using Sustained Inflation (SI) in the DR, will result in a lower rate of the combined
      endpoint of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks gestational age.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Early lung recruitment with SI superimposed upon standard PEEP/CPAP in the DR will
           reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in the first seven days of life, and reduce
           need for surfactant use; and

        2. A policy of DR SI on standard PEEP/CPAP recruitment will confer better outcomes at 36
           weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) than standard PEEP/CPAP</summary>
