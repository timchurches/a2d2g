  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean blood loss (ml) .	The quantity of blood loss (mL) during C.S will be measure as follow= (weight of the used surgical towels  minus weight of the towels prior to the surgery) + the volume sucked in the suction bottle after placental delivery in mL.
	Blood loss during transfer of the patient to the postoperative care will be measured by using calibrated plastic drape put under the patients intraoperative.  
	In addition blood loss after the operation will be calculated separately (within 2Hour postpartum) by using a calibrated plastic drape put under the patients, So the patients can use one or two calibrated plastic drape.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood loss will be collected during and for two hours after operation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1-Blood loss 500 ml or more ( blood loss will be measured  for two hours after operation using  a caliberated plastic drape put under the patient).</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the two hours after operation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2-Blood loss 1000 ml or more (blood loss will be measured using a calibrated plastic drape put under the patient for two hours after operation).</outcome>
      <timepoint>During two hours after operation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3-use of additional medical intervention to control postpartum    hemorrhage. The files of patients will be checked for additional medications to control PPH , for example oxytocin, methyl ergometrin, prostaglandins.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the two hours postoperative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4- Use of additional surgical intervention to control PPH. The files of the patients will be checked for added surgical interventions , like compresssion sutures, ligation of uterine artery , ligation of hypogastric artery, hysterectomy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the two hours postoperative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5-Mild side effects such as (nausea, vomiting, headache, skin reaction). The files will be checked for any reported side effects or medications given to treat these side effects. For example antiemetics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the first 24 hours after operation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>6-Serious adverse events as:Thromboembolic event. This willl be diagnosed clinically or using Doppler ultrasound.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During postoperative period till discharge from hospital</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bleeding after delivery is still the leading cause of maternal deaths especially in low resourced countries. Rates of delivery by cesarean section are increasing.One in three to four women are delivered by cesarean section.This trial is looking for new strategies to reduce blood loss after delivery by cesarean section.Tranexamic acid is a drug which prevents or delays lysis of blood clots after its formation .The formation of blood clot at the site of placental separation inside the uterus is an important mechanism to prevent bleeding after placental separation.This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid given to women at cesarean section.</summary>
