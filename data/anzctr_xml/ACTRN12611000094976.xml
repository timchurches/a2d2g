  <interventions>
    <interventions>The current study includes three treatment arms and one control arm. Participants were instructed to consume the supplements daily over a 4 month period. To implement the high and low dose fish oil conditions, the fish oil capsules were separated in morning and evening containers. 

1) High dose fish oil and active multivitamin  - Participants were instructed to consume 1 multivitamin capsule and 6 grams of fish oil daily. 


2) Low dose fish oil and active multivitamin - Participants were instructed to consume 1 multivitamin and 6 grams of oil consisting of 3 grams of fish oil and 3 grams of sunola oil daily. 

  
3) High dose fish oil and placebo multivitamin - Participants were instructed to consume 1 placebo multivitamin and 6 grams of fish oil daily.


Composition of active fish oil and multivitamin.

Active fish oil: Wild salmon Fish oil.
The high dose fish oil condition contained 6 grams of fish oil equating to 600 mg of EPA and 600 mg of DHA daily.
The low dose fish oil condition contained 3 grams of non active fish oil (sunola oil) and 3 grams of fish oil, equating to 300 mg of EPA and 300 mg of DHA daily.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Australia, the population is ageing due to lower birth rates and increased life expectancy. The implication of this changing demographic means that the age group with the greatest needs will be the elderly.  Research in this area includes studies assessing the efficacy of fish oils and multivitamins to improve memory and cognitive function in the elderly.  Research is also focussing on the potential neuroprotective effects of these supplements to protect the elderly from more insidious cognitive decline, such as Alzeimers disease. The primary aim of the current study is to investigate whether supplementing diets with fish oils and multivitmains improve cognitive function in a healthy cohort of women and men aged 50 to 70 years of age. This research could potentially have significant bearing on the cognitive health of the elderly as well as the predicted economic burden in decades to come.  Based on previous research, it is hypothesised that diets supplemented with a high dose of fish oil will improve cogntive performance namely spatial working memory performance and attentional processes.  It is also anticipated that a high dose of fish oil compliemented with a multivitamin will provide additional benefits to cognitive performance as the multivitamins will limit oxidation of the Omega-3's once they have been ingested.</summary>
