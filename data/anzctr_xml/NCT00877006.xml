    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) at End of Treatment Period - CR=complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms, if present pretherapy; protocol-specified positron emission tomography (PET) scan assessment criteria; (if the spleen and/or liver were enlarged on the basis of physical examination and/or anatomic imaging before treatment) the liver and/or spleen were considered normal size on physical examination and by anatomic imaging after therapy, with disappearance of all nodules related to lymphoma; (if the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment) the infiltrate must have cleared on subsequent bone marrow biopsies.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Overall Response at End of Treatment Period - Overall Response=participants with Complete Remission (CR) + those with Partial Remission (PR). CR=see Outcome Measure 1 for details. PR= at least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the greatest diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes/masses; at least a 50% decrease in the SPD of hepatic and splenic nodules in their greatest transverse diameter; no increase in the size of the liver, spleen, and other nodes; no measurable disease in organs other than the liver or spleen; no new sites of disease; protocol-specified PET scan and bone marrow criteria.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Deaths and Discontinuations Due to AEs at End of Treatment Period - AE=any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity after dispensation of the study drug and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under study (or any concurrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug. AEs were graded as 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), 4 (life-threatening), 5 (death). SAE=an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of one's ability to conduct normal life functions), a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or other important medical event.</outcome>

EORTC QLQ-C30 includes functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and other (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea, and financial difficulties).
