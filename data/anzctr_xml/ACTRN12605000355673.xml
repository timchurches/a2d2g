    <interventions>IBCSG 22-00 is co-ordinated internationally by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG).  The trial is conducted in Australia and New Zealand by the Australian New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group.
This protocol is designed to determine if maintenance chemotherapy with low dose cyclophosphamide and methotrexate given for 12 months following 3 to 6 months of induction cytotoxic chemotherapy improves outcome compared with induction chemotherapy alone. The maintenance chemotherapy (CM) regimen has demonstrated activity in metastatic breast cancer and an interference with angiogenic serum factors.  It is hypothesized that this regimen will delay tumor recurrence. 

IBCSG 22-00 is an international, multicentre, clinical trial of 900 patients who have had histologically or cytologically confirmed, receptor-negative primary breast cancer.
 
Women will be randomised in a 2-arm design to receive one of the following:

a. Induction Chemotherapy
b. Induction Chemotherapy followed by 12 months maintenance chemotherapy

Patients randomised to the chemotherapy maintenance arm will receive oral low dose chemotherapy consisting of 50mg cyclophosphamide daily for one year and 2.5mg methotrexate twice a day, days 1 and 2 every week for one year.</interventions>
    <comparator>Induction Chemotherapy. Induction Chemotherapy regimens approved by the IBCSG, will be administered at the physicians discretion.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the efficacy of a low-dose chemotherapy regimen, hypothesized to have anti-angiogenic activity, administered following a standard chemotherapy program in patients whose tumors are not endocrine therapy-responsive.  Two interim and one final analysis are planned, with an accrual rate of 180 evaluable patients per year, 3.5 years of accrual and 5 years of additional follow-up is considered sufficient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two interim and one final analyses will be performed during the conduct of the study. A total of 256 events is required to detect an improvement in five year disease-free survival so interim analyses will be planned after 102 and 179 events have been observed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival - defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two interim analyses are planned prior to reaching five years of median follow-up.  the target number of events for the study is 256, so interim analyses will be planned after 102 and 179 events have been observed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systemic disease-free survival - defined as the time from randomisation to systemic relapse, appearance of second (non-breast) primary tumour, or death, whichever occurs first.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two interim analyses are planned prior to reaching five years of median follow-up.  the target number of events for the study is 256, so interim analyses will be planned after 102 and 179 events have been observed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity - will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two interim analyses are planned prior to reaching five years of median follow-up.  the target number of events for the study is 256, so interim analyses will be planned after 102 and 179 events have been observed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life (QoL) will be assessed using a questionnaire completed by the patient at each scheduled QoL follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Quality of Life (QoL) will be assessed at months 9, 12, 18 and 24 using the date induction chemotherapy began as day 0; thereafter, QoL will be followed at months 36, 48, 60 and 72</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systemic relapse - defined as any recurrent or metastatic disease in sites other than the local mastectomy scar/chest wall/skin, the ipsilateral breast in case of breast conservation, or the contralateral breast.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter and two interim analyses are planned prior to reaching five years of median follow-up.  the target number of events for the study is 256, so interim analyses will be planned after 102 and 179 events have been observed.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sites of first recurrence  - including local, regional, contralateral breast and distant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter and two interim analyses are planned prior to reaching five years of median follow-up.  the target number of events for the study is 256, so interim analyses will be planned after 102 and 179 events have been observed.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of second (non-breast) malignancies - determined as the time of first appearance of a suspicious lesion, later proven to be a definitive recurrence or metastasis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter and two interim analyses are planned prior to reaching five years of median follow-up.  the target number of events for the study is 256, so interim analyses will be planned after 102 and 179 events have been observed.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Causes of death without relapse of breast cancer - determined as any death related to causes other than breast cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter and two interim analyses are planned prior to reaching five years of median follow-up.  the target number of events for the study is 256, so interim analyses will be planned after 102 and 179 events have been observed.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance chemotherapy in women with hormone non-responsive breast cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible join this study if you are a woman with receptor-negative primary breast cancer and are in adequate health to begin or continue with induction chemotherapy.

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will undergo induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy. Maintenance chemotherapy involves taking one 50mg cyclophosphamide tablet daily for one year and two 2.5mg methotrexate tablets twice a day on days 1 and 2 of every week for one year. Participants in the other group will undergo induction chemotherapy only. This will be administered at the doctor's discretion.

Participants will be regularly assessed over the duration of the trial to determine whether maintenance chemotherapy delays tumor recurrence and prolongs survival.</summary>
