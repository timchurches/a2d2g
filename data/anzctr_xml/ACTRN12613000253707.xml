    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint will be reported as the proportion of patients undergoing BCS who have experienced a LR, together with the 90% confidence interval. Time-to-event outcomes
will be described using Kaplan Meier curves as appropriate. Exploratory analyses (both univariate and multivariate) will be performed using appropriate statistical methods (chisquared
test, logistic, linear and proportional hazards regression). No adjustment will be made for multiple comparisons and the significance level for comparisons will be set at a nominal 5% level. 

Responses to all patient-reported QoL outcome measures will be scored as per each instruments standard scoring algorithm and analysed with linear mixed models, which account for  correlation across repeated measures. These models will be used to describe the time course of impacts and to assess whether the time course differs between groups (BCS or mastectomy) by testing the group by time interaction.

Costs will be measured from a health system perspective. In addition to documenting the costs of the MRI and PET-CT scans used to determine operability, the consequences of the
imaging results on patient management will be recorded and costed including the number and type of additional test, procedures, consultations and treatments received or avoided as a direct consequence of the imaging findings.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether breast MRI and a PET-CT scan can accurately predict which women with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) treated by initial Primary Systemic Treatment (PST), can undergo Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS), without compromising local control or Disease Free Survival. 

You may be eligible to join this study if you are over 18 years old, female, with Clinical Stage III (non-inflammatory) unilateral breast cancer. 

All patients receive PST as per local practice before operability is then assessed. MRI and PET-CT scan will be taken up to four times during the study; 1/pre-treatment,  2/between 4 and 5 weeks from start of PST, 3/between 3 and 5 weeks after PST is completed and 4/between 10 and12 weeks after radiotherapy treatment (for participants that are inoperable).  Each MRI scan will take 20-40 minutes to complete. Each PET-CT takes 60-90 minutes to complete. 
   * If LABC becomes operable, either mastectomy or BSC is performed as well as Sentinal Node Biopsy (SNB) and axillary node dissection. All patients receive radiotherapy 6-8 weeks post-operatively.
   * If LABC remains inoperable, radiotherapy is given to the breast and nodes. 5-7 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and the patient is re-assessed. If disease has become operable, mastectomy and axillary node dissection is performed. 
   * All patients with a hormone sensitive tumour commence hormonal therapy 14 days after the completion of treatment to the breast and nodes. 

This study aims to find out if women with LABC can have BCS instead of mastectomy with a low chance of the cancer returning.</summary>
