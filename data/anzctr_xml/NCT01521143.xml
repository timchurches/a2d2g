Experimental: Part A - Cvac - Participants received intradermal injections of Cvac given at 4-week intervals for the first 3 doses, and then every 12 weeks for 3 additional doses, for a total of 6 doses over 44 weeks. Each injection had an approximate concentration of 60 × 10^6 viable dendritic cells/mL.

Placebo Comparator: Part A - Placebo - Participants received intradermal injections of placebo given at 4-week intervals for the first 3 doses, and then every 12 weeks for 3 additional doses, for a total of 6 doses over 44 weeks.

Experimental: Part B - Cvac - Participants received intradermal injections of Cvac given at 4-week intervals for the first 3 doses, and then every 12 weeks for 3 additional doses, for a total of 6 doses over 44 weeks. Each injection had an approximate concentration of 60 × 10^6 viable dendritic cells/mL.

No Intervention: Part B - Observational standard of care - Participants in this group did not receive any treatment during the study.


Other interventions: Cvac
Injections were done at 4 anatomical sites, 1 injection in each of the upper portions of both arms and both thighs.

Other interventions: Placebo
Injections were done at 4 anatomical sites, 1 injection in each of the upper portions of both arms and both thighs.
Placebo consisted of the Cvac formulation buffer (5% HSA, 10% DMSO) with 0.9% simethicone provided in 1 mL vials that had been cryopreserved and stored at the manufacturing facility.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As &lt; 10% of the necessary patients required by the protocol were recruited and the data were
      not intended to support a labeling claim, it was determined that the abbreviated clinical
      study report (CSR) was the appropriate reporting format. No efficacy analyses were performed
      as the trial was terminated early with incomplete enrollment of &lt; 10%.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if an investigational cell therapy called Cvac can
      help epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) from returning when administered to patients who are in
      complete remission after surgical removal of their tumor followed by standard first-line
      (Part A) or second-line (Part B) chemotherapy. Following remission, patients will undergo
      leukapheresis for the manufacture of the study agent. After completion of chemotherapy and
      confirmation of remission, patients will enter the treatment phase of the study.</summary>
