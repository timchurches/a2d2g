  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a coordinated regional approach to healthy
      skin programs in six remote Aboriginal communities can demonstrate, not only a reduction in
      the burden of scabies and streptococcal skin sores, but also broad health benefits, including
      primary prevention of some chronic diseases that occur at particularly high rates in
      Australian Aboriginal communities.

      The primary objectives of the Program are:

        -  Demonstrate a reduction in scabies and skin sores on a regional basis

        -  Demonstrate the broader public health effects of Healthy Skin Programs, particularly
           those relating to chronic diseases such as rheumatic fever and renal diseases

        -  Build on the existing Indigenous capacity by assisting in the development of new
           knowledge and skills to improve the health and well being of Indigenous communities

        -  Establish the feasibility of incorporating Healthy Skin Programs into existing health
           service delivery</summary>
