  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weighted Mean Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Measured Over 24 Hours at Day 14 of Each Treatment Period - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 was measured using site equipment (KoKo Pneumotach Spirometer). Weighted mean FEV1 was calculated using the Day 14 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements taken at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 hours post-dose (measured in the evening of Day 15). At each time point, the highest of three technically acceptable measurements was recorded. FEV1 weighted mean was analyzed using a mixed effects analysis of a covariance model with fixed effect terms for treatment and period, participant Baseline, period Baseline, gender, and age as covariates, and participant as a random effect.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 hours post-PM dose on Day 14 of each treatment period (up to Study Day 105)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pre-treatment AM and PM Trough FEV1 on Day 14 of Each Treatment Period - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 was measured using site equipment (KoKo Pneumotach Spirometer). FEV1 PM trough FEV1 values were the values taken pre-treatment on Day 14, and AM trough FEV1 values were the values taken pre-treatment on Day 15 in each treatment period; thus, there is only one value (pre-treatment record) per period for AM and PM trough.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 14 of each treatment period (up to Study Day 105)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) - An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs were collected from the start of dosing with investigational product and until follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) - PEF is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. AM and PM pre-treatment PEF was measured throughout the study for the purposes of monitoring participants' asthma stability, and was measured from the start of the Run-in Period until completion of Treatment Period 3 (including during the washout periods), prior to study medication and/or any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use. The data collected were only assessed by the Investigator on an individual basis during the study and were not formally summarized or statistically analyzed; consequently, data are not reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects with a documented history of persistent asthma, with the exclusion of other
             significant pulmonary diseases (pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary
             fibrotic disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, or other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma).

          -  Male or female between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is:

          -  Of non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
             tubal ligation or hysterectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status
             is in doubt will be required to use contraception method, if they wish to continue
             their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation
             of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2
             to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method.

          -  Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening and serum or urine hCG test prior to
             dosing and agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of
             time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing
             to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must
             agree to use contraception until completion of the follow up visit or has only
             same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

          -  All subjects must either be clinically stable on a low to mid dose inhaled
             corticosteroid (ICS) (with or without a short acting beta-2 receptor agonist [SABA])
             such as Fluticasone Propionate (FP) 100 to250 mcg twice-daily (total daily dose 200 to
             500 mcg) or equivalent, for at least 4 weeks preceding the screening visit or be
             clinically stable on a low dose ICS/ long acting beta-2 receptor agonist (LABA)
             combination, such as SERETIDE/ADVAIR 100/50 twice- daily or equivalent (administered
             either in combination or from separate inhalers), for at least 4 weeks preceding the
             screening visit. Higher ICS/LABA doses (i.e. equivalent to SERETIDE/ADVAIR 250/50 or
             500/50) would not be acceptable. Subjects must refrain from using their LABA for at
             least 24 hour (h) prior to the screening visit

          -  Subjects with a screening pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &gt;= 60 percent of predicted.
             Predicted values will be based upon National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
             (NHANES III).

          -  During the screening visit, subjects must demonstrate the presence of reversible
             airway disease, defined as an increase in FEV1 of &gt;= 12.0 percent over baseline and an
             absolute change of &gt;= 200 mL within 60 minutes following 4 inhalations of
             albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or equivalent nebulized treatment with
             albuterol/salbutamol solution).

          -  All subjects must be able to replace all their current asthma treatments with
             albuterol/salbutamol aerosol inhaler at screening for use as needed for the run-in
             period and throughout the duration of the study. Subjects on LABAs must also withhold
             this for at least 24 h prior to the screening visit. Subjects will therefore be on
             SABA alone for the duration of the study, and on SABA and FF during the FF treatment
             periods. Subjects must be able to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 h prior
             to screening and study visits.

          -  Subjects who are current non-smokers and who have a pack history of &lt;= 10 pack years.
             A subject may not have used inhaled tobacco products within the past 3 months (i.e.,

             Bundle Branch Block.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2x Upper limit
             of normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;= 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35 percent).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Able to satisfactorily use the DPI

    <summary>This study will investigate the effects of altering the time of day of dosing (morning or
      evening) with Fluticasone Furoate 100 (FF 100) micrograms (mcg) once daily administered via a
      dry powder inhaler (DPI) in subjects with persistent bronchial asthma. This is a repeat-dose,
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study to compare the effect
      of morning (AM) and evening (PM) dosing with FF 100 on lung function. Twenty-four male and
      female subjects with persistent bronchial asthma will be enrolled to ensure twenty evaluable
      subjects. The three treatments will be FF 100 AM (with placebo PM), FF 100 PM (with placebo
      AM) and matching placebo (AM and PM). All treatments will be administered for 14 (+/-2) days
      with 14 day run-in and 14 to 21 day washout periods. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 13 to18 weeks for each subject.</summary>
