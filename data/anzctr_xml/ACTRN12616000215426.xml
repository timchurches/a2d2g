  <interventions>
    <interventions>Six months of daily oral levofloxacin (dosing: 12.00-24.99kg: 250mg once daily; 25.00-49.99kg: 500mg once daily, 50kg and above: 750mg once daily).
Compliance monitoring is based on pill count and self-report
Screening for incident disease is performed for 30 months after enrollment, at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months. Screening includes clinical assessment and chest radiography. Additional telephone-based symptom screening will be performed at 9, 15, 21 and 27 months, with clinical evaluation if symptoms are present (including new cough or sputum production for 2 weeks or more) .
No maximum duration of therapy. Patients will continue to receive treatment beyond 180 days, if they have not completed the requisite number of doses by that time.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence ratio, that is, the ratio of the incidence rate of bacteriologically-confirmed TB among subjects in the active levofloxacin group to the incidence rate in the placebo control group.

In adults, aged 15 and above, bacteriologically-confirmed TB is defined as a positive identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by culture, Xpert or another PCR-based diagnostic test in a contact with clinical or radiological evidence of disease. 

In adults, aged 15 and above, a result will be considered positive if: (a) at least one sample of sputum, or other body fluid or tissue is positive by culture, Xpert or another PCR-based diagnostic test; or (b) at least 2 samples of sputum or other body fluid or tissue are positive by smear)
* AFB-positive TB alone on a single smear (that is not positive on culture, Xpert or another PCR-based diagnostic test) would not be considered bacteriologically confirmed.
* If available cultures are contaminated or negative, then two samples that are both AFB-positive will satisfy the definition of bacteriologically confirmed.
* Extrapulmonary TB will be considered bacteriologically confirmed if based upon either: additional investigations seeking microbiological confirmation (e.g. lymph node aspirate, CSF) with either a positive culture, Xpert or another PCR-based diagnostic test; OR two or more samples that are AFB positive on smear.

Bacteriologically confirmed TB should be classified as pulmonary, extra-pulmonary or both.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 30 months of randomization</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence ratio of all forms of TB (bacteriologically confirmed or clinically probable) in the active levofloxacin group compared to that of the placebo group

The definition of bacteriological confirmation is given above. 
Probable clinical TB:  Known exposure to TB plus Well-defined clinical evidence AND supportive radiological or laboratory evidence of pulmonary or extra-pulmonary disease in a contact that is not bacteriologically-confirmed.

The End Point Review Panel will reach a conclusion about the diagnosis of clinically probable TB on the basis of the following, in adults:

* Well-defined clinical evidence of clinically probable TB would include any TB-related symptoms of over 14 days duration that was not improving (e.g. cough, fever, night sweats, lethargy) or sign (documented weight loss, moderate or severe malnutrition, neck swelling or other clinical features of EPTB). 

* In contacts with no clinical evidence, chest radiography is consistent with intrathoracic disease due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In contacts with no clinical evidence, radiological evidence to support probable pulmonary TB would only include marked abnormality on CXR.

* AFB-positive alone on smear that is not culture or Xpert positive would be considered as supportive laboratory evidence.

* Probable EPTB will be based upon either additional investigations seeking microbiological confirmation (e.g. lymph node aspirate, CSF) or supportive clinical/radiological findings from laboratory investigation or imaging (e.g. pleural aspirate or ascitic tap, X-ray)

* Any form of EPTB with supportive evidence (see above) that is not also bacteriologically confirmed would be considered as Clinically Probable TB.   

Clinical TB should be classified as pulmonary, extra-pulmonary or both.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 30 months of randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence ratio of all forms of TB (bacteriologically confirmed or clinically probable) in the active levofloxacin group compared to that of the placebo group among subjects who completed therapy

The definitions of bacteriologically confirmed and clinically probable TB are given in the previous secondary outcome.

A contact will be defined to have completed the study therapy if they complete 80% or more of the total prescribed doses within a total period of 30 weeks after randomization. This will be confirmed by unused tablet return.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 30 months of randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence ratio of bacteriologically confirmed TB in the active levofloxacin group, compared to that of the placebo group, among contacts of MDR-TB patients with fluoroquinolone susceptible disease.

Bacteriologically confirmed TB is defined above.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 30 months of randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of participants in each group discontinuing treatment owing to adverse events

This will be assessed by participant self-report, either by telephone or in person.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During treatment with levofloxacin or placebo.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of participants in each group completing six months (180 doses) of preventive therapy

Adherence will be assessed at the end of each month of treatment with pill counts. Standardized questionnaires developed for this study will also be used to assess compliance. Contacts will be considered non-adherent if they fail to complete 80% of the total prescribed doses (i.e. fail to complete 36 doses or more) within 270 days after commencing therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>270 days after randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The ratio of the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the active levofloxacin group, compared to that of the placebo group.

These adverse events are classified as follows:
Grade 3	Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living. (for example, for QT prolongation, QTc &gt;= 501 ms on at least two separate ECGs)
Grade 4	Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. (for example, for QT prolongation QTc &gt;= 501 or &gt;60 ms change from baseline and Torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs / symptoms of serious arrhythmia).
Grade 5	Death related to the adverse event.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During treatment with levofloxacin or placebo</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Death from any cause (except for violent (e.g. homicide) or accidental (e.g. motor vehicle accident) causes) among the levofloxacin group compared to placebo</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of contacts with incident TB with acquired fluoroquinolone resistance in comparison to bacterial isolates of the index patient, the levofloxacin group compared to the placebo group.

M. tuberculosis isolated from index patients will be archived at central laboratories to enable subsequent molecular comparison with the isolates from contacts. We will study isolates from contacts who develop culture positive TB, at baseline or after treatment, to determine whether acquired drug resistance has developed, based upon concordant phenotypic DST and whether they have matching Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit - 24 loci (MIRU-24) patterns. For greater resolution, we will also apply Whole Genome Sequencing to index-contact pairs, with samples to be tested in a facility with appropriate quality assurance, meeting international standards.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The difference in specific biomarkers (including microRNAs) between treatment initiation and treatment completion for compliant participants allocated to levofloxacin compared to the placebo group;

Biomarkers will be assessed based on a serum assay. Biomarker panels will be derived from published studies, including a microRNA profile. Further work is required to develop the precise biomarker panel.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During treatment with levofloxacin or placebo (no more than 30 months after randomization)

Biomarkers will be measured at baseline, then 6 months post-randomization (at the completion of treatment).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimate:
The intra-class correlation coefficients are 1.04 at the district level and 1.07 at the level of the household, with 2.1 contacts recruited per patient (data from the ACT2 contact screening study, previously conducted in VIetnam). An average of 21 index patients will be recruited per district (based on reported PMDT data). Hence, the overall design effect is 1.1. The prevalence of LTBI in household contacts of MDR-TB patients is expected to be at least 60%, and the incidence of TB among untreated MDR-TB contacts over a 2-year follow-up period will be 3.0%. We estimate levofloxacin will reduce incidence by 70% in the treatment group, based upon a mid-range estimate of the effectiveness of isoniazid treatment for LTBI in drug-susceptible disease. The prevalence of fluroquinolone resistance among MDR-TB patients in Vietnam was measured in the 4th National Drug Resistance Survey to be 16.7%. Hence we will increase the sample size to allow for a sub-group analysis of those contacts of patients with MDR-TB that is susceptible to fluroquinolones. We will allow for a 10% drop-out rate. We assume alpha = 0.05 and the power to detect superiority is 80%. Hence, we will randomize 2,006 infected contacts

Analytic methods:
Analysis will be by intention to treat. We plan to use a marginal Poisson regression model estimated via a generalised estimating equation (GEE) to test the effect of treatment group allocation on the incidence ratio of TB. </statisticalmethods>
