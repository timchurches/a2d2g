  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the safety and tolerability of the drug lenalidomide in combination with 5-azacitidine when used as maintenance therapy for patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) who are in complete remission. Who is it for? You can join this study if you are an Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) patient who is in complete remission (CR), or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi). Trial details Participants will be split into one of 7 cohorts (treatment groups) for this trial, with each cohort receiving varying doses of subcutaneous injections of Azacitidine on days 1-5, followed by oral tablets of Lenalidomide from days 5-25 of each treatment cycle. Participants will be assessed at regular intervals to determine their response to treatment. The aim of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of these combination doses.</summary>
