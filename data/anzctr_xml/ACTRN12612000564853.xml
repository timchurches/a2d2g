  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are reasons to believe that medical grade-honey applied directly to skin may be an effective treatment for cold sores. In this study 15 adults with recurrent cold sores will take part in a cross-over study comparing medical grade honey and topical aciclovir for the treatment of cold sores

When participants develop a cold sore they will start using the first allocated treatment on it for the duration of the lesion (maximum 2 weeks) and complete a subject diary. When participants develop a second cold sore they will use the second allocated treatment for the duration of the lesion (maximum 2 weeks) and complete a subject diary.

The sequesnce of honey then aciclovir or aciclovir then honey will be allocated randomly. 

This trial will provide useful information on the practicalities of topical honey as a treatment for eczema. It will also give an initial signal as to whether honey may be effective.</summary>
