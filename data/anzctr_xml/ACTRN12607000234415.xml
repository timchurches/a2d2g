  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention Group 1.
Programme of mentoring alone. Weekly contact initially and then determined by participants preference. Goal-setting, motivational interviewing, role modelling are the tools to improve self-efficacy.

Intervention Group 2.
Programme of mentoring as Intervention arm 1, but with an IT tool to allow self-monitoring. The IT tool will either be a modified mobile phone or a desk top computer. Participants record their breathlessness, cough, sputum volume, general well-being on the phone and relate these symptoms to when they are well. A 0-10 visual analogue scale is used. They are also texted a rolling series of questions once a week to assess adherence with medication and airway clearance techniques.

The intervention arms go for six months and there is a six month washout period and self-efficacy is then re-assessed by questionnaire.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients (and their parents) will be sent an invitation to participate in the study by mail. The invitation contains an outline of the study but no specific details. To register willingness to participate, the patient and parent will return a signed form expressing their desire to continue. Potential participants will then be approached during CF clinics at either the Gold Coast Hospital or Royal Children's in Brisbane and the study discussed in greater detail. Following written informed consent, participants will be randomised to usual care, a mentor alone or a mentor plus IT tool. This will be undertaken using a computer generated random number programme. Concealment of randomisation will be achieved by doing this electronically on a web site that is not accessible by the individual confirming suitability. Randomisation will be undertaken in Hobart on a secure server. The research assistants will be blinded to the intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>Stratified randomisation will be undertaken by a computer generated random number software programme. Using stratified randomisation, we will ensure that an equal distribution of participants depending on whether they are recruited from an outreach clinic or a large central CF Centre clinic occurs and also that there will be an equal gender distribution.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The research assistants administer the questionnaires, but they are not involved in the mentoring process or clinical care of patients. The research assistants will be unaware of treatment allocation of the patients at the commencement of the study, but at follow up meetings for repeat questioonaires, it will become impossible to maintain blinding during the interview with participants.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Life expectancy has improved dramatically in CF over the past three decades, mainly due to advances in paediatric care. The number of adults with CF may soon exceed that of the paediatric population but their needs are different and earlier gains may be lost because of reduced adherence to treatment regimes. The primary purpose of this Project is to improve self-efficacy of adolescents and adults with CF through a system of mentorship assisted by innovative Information Technology tools that allow patients to follow their own progress and get feedback on how their own management decisions affect outcomes, such as avoidance of an exacerbation. The mentorship system facilitates self-management and empowers the individual with CF. This sort of intervention may prove particularly effective during the transition period from childhood to adulthood.</summary>
