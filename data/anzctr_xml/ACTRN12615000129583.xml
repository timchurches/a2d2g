  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical cessation of seizure activity five minutes following the completion of the infusion of the study medication. This outcome will be assessed clinically by the treating team. This is a pragmatic end-point and represents real life clinical practice as EEGs are not routinely available in emergency departments. The assessment of this outcome will be video recorded to allow for blinded confirmation of primary outcome by a panel of paediatric emergency physicians and paediatric neurologists blinded to treatment allocation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>As study medications have different optimal infusion rates this will be 10 minutes after starting study infusions in the case of levetiracetam and 25 minutes after starting study infusions in the case of phenytoin. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical cessation of seizure activity without the need for further seizure management after the initial agent (levetiracetam or phenytoin).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two hours following the commencement of the study infusions. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical cessation of seizure activity without the need for RSI or further seizure management (comparison of LP versus PL regimens) .</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serious adverse events to be assessed clinically by treating team. Defined as: 1) Death; 2) Serious airway complications in the first 24 hours. Serious airway complications are defined as the unexpected use of an endotracheal tube; LMA; and surgical or needle cricothyrotomy. Unexpected is defined as the use of these interventions when it was not part of a planned RSI following failure of medical management, nor airway support required by a patient who develops a compromised airway secondary to seizure activity or first line CSE medications e.g. benzodiazepines; 3) Cardiovascular instability (cardiac arrest and arrhythmia requiring electrical cardioversion); 4) Any other event not mentioned above that is life-threatening event or jeopardises the patient or requires medical or surgical intervention.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.Children aged between 3 months and 16 years; 
2.CSE. 
CSE is defined clinically as a child who is unresponsive with continuing abnormality of movement (increased tone or jerking) of greater than five minutes duration, or two or more recurrent convulsions without recovery of conscious between convulsions, or three or more convulsions within the proceeding hour, and currently experiencing a convulsion. This definition encompasses the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) seizure types of generalised tonic-clonic convulsions, secondarily generalised tonic-clonic convulsions, and complex partial status epilepticus, but not absence, myoclonic, tonic and simple partial status epilepticus. </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To determine whether intravenous (IV) levetiracetam or IV phenytoin is the better second line treatment for the emergency management of convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) in children. 
Design and Methods: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing levetiracetam (40mg/kg, maximum 3g) with phenytoin (20mg/kg, maximum 1g) in 200 children, aged between 3 months and 16 years, presenting with CSE who are still seizing after two doses of benzodiazepines. The study will occur over three years in 13 Emergency Departments (EDs) in New Zealand and Australia associated with the Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) research network. The primary outcome for the study is clinical cessation of seizure activity five minutes following infusion of the study drug. Secondary outcomes include; time to clinical cessation of seizure activity, need for intubation with rapid sequence induction (RSI)/intensive care unit (ICU) admission, serious adverse events, length of hospital stay, health utility, health costs, and long-term outcome.
