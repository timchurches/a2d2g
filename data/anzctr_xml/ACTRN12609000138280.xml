  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomised to the treatment group will receive daily buprenorphine naloxone for a period of 3 months administered as tablets of Suboxone delviered sublingually. During week 1 of dosing, the daily dose will be escalated from 4mg up to 16mg per day and tolerability to the dose will be determined, The maximum tolerable daily dose level will then be given for the duration of the treatment period.  Dose tolerability will also be continually reviewed and doses modfied as required during this period. Half of the initial dose of Suboxone tablets on the first day of treatment will be delivered to the patient in the clinic.  For the remainder of the treatment period patients will be supplied with enough Suboxone tablets to enable them to self administer their own daily doses for the following week. At the commencement of each week during the treatment period patients will return to the clinic and be reviewed and receive enough take home doses for the following week of treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control / comparator group will be patients randomised to remain on the wait list to receive opiate substitution for a period of 3 months.  At the completion of this period they will be offered methadone or buprenorphine treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if heroin users randomised to receive buprenorphine-naloxone have a greater reduction in heroin use compared to patients on a waiting list for methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment. Heroin use will be determined by self report using the Opiate Treatment Index Questionnaire (OTI), urine analysis for drugs of abuse content and hair analysis (conducted at baseline and 3 months only) for drugs of abuse content.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of one, two and three months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare differences in the Quality of Life evaluation between the two groups.  This will be assessed using the World Health Organisation Abbreviated Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of one, two and three months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare differences in Psychosocial functioning between the two groups.  Pyschosocial functioning in all study participants will be determined using the Short Form 12 (SF12) interview-style questionnaire.  Psychological distress will be measured using the Kessler 10 (K10) questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of one, two and three months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare the blood borne virus risk practices between the two groups using the Injecting and Sexual Practises domain of the Opiate Treatment Index (OTI) Questionnaire.</outcome>

    <concealment>potential study candidates will be identified from the OST wait list .  Subjects will be provided with information regarding the study and informed consent will be sought. Eligibility criteria will then be evaluated and patients informed of their suitability for entry into the study. They will be randomly allocated to the treatment or wait-list group and informed on their group allocation. The treatment code for each patient will be written in a sealed envelope which the investigator / researcher will open following assessment of eligibility to determine group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A list of sequential group allocations will be randomly computer-generated using the randomisation tools on www.randomization.com. To avoid group bias to either investigative site a separate randomisation list will be generated for each study site.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The clinical trial would compare heroin use in a group of patients randomly allocated to receive unsupervised dosing with buprenorphine-naloxone to a group of patients remaining on wait list for a 12 week period (when this group would then be offered substitution treatment).  The study will also assess adverse events that may be related to providing unsupervised dosing with buprenorphine-naloxone.</summary>
