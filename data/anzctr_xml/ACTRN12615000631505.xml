  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Induction chemotherapy (1x 28 day cycle)
a.	Cytarabine given as a 2 hour intravenous infusion at a dose of 3 gm/ m2 on day 1, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion beginning 12 hours after commencement of the initial dose for a total of 96 hours at a dose of 1.5 gm/m2 per 24 hours.
b.	Idarubicin, given as an intravenous bolus at a dose of 12 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3.
Supportive treatment consisting of Allopurinol 300 mg daily per oral given from day 2 until the white cell count is below 1.0 x 10^9/L, and Fluconazole 200 mg daily orally for 28 days as fungal infection prophylaxis. Filgrastim started on day + 6 at a dose of 5 microgram / kg daily by subcutaneous injection until the post-nadir neutrophil count exceeds 2.0 x 10^9/L.
One intrathecal injection of Methotrexate 12 mg given at the start of induction therapy.  Induction therapy is 1x 28 day cycle.
2. Post-induction treatment (consolidation 1x 28 day cycle)
a.	Cytarabine 3 gm/ m2 as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours, followed  12 hours later by a continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 1.5 gm/m2 per 24 hours for 72 hours.
b.	Idarubicin, as an intravenous bolus at a dose of 12 mg/ m2 daily on days 1 and 2.
Filgrastim from day +5 at a dose of 5 microgram per kg subcutaneously daily until recovery of the neutrophil count to greater than 2.0 x 10^9/L.
One injection of intrathecal Methotrexate 12mg given at the start of consolidation therapy.
The duration between induction and consolidation is 28 to 35 days.
Following consolidation with cytarabine and Idarubicin, a further course of therapy was given using high dose intravenous Methotrexate, as soon as practical after day 28 from the start of consolidation therapy. This consists of 3 g/m2 for 2 courses 14 days apart.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary hypothesis is that an intensive chemotherapy protocol, incorporating high-dose cytarabine and Idarubicin, as originally designed for treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, when used in the treatment of adults with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, has acceptable tolerability and safety. The subsidiary hypothesis is that this regimen will result in a greater degree of reduction of the number of leukaemia cells, than conventional treatment.</summary>
