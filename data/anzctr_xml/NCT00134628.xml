  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The principle objective of this research is to more precisely determine the degree of benefit
      that hyperbaric oxygen therapy affords in the treatment of late radiation tissue injury.

      The study has eight* components. Seven involve the evaluation of established radionecrosis at
      varying anatomic sites (mandible, larynx, skin, bladder, rectum, colon, and gyn). The eighth
      will investigate the potential of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy to prophylax against late
      radiation tissue injury.

      *(One of the arms, HORTIS IV - Proctitis has been closed to further patient recruitment. This
      decision was based on an interim statistical analysis which generated sufficient evidence to
      support closing down this arm of HORTIS.)</summary>
