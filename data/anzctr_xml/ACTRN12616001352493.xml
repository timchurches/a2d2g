    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations indicate that 100 participants should be sufficient to detect a correlation of 0.3 between free sugars intakes, estimated from weighed diet records, and d13C. We will allow for a drop out rate of 20% giving a sample size of 120 subjects. 

Seven recording days are required to capture habitual dietary intake of participants. Diet records will be analysed for major nutrients including free and total sugars using Kai-calculator software and the New Zealand Food Composition Database, and the average daily intake for energy, macronutrients, free and added sugars, and dietary fibre will be calculated.

Relative validity of the d13Cversus mean intakes of free sugars estimated weighed diet records (7 days total per person) will be assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients (SCC). Bland-Altman analyses will be performed to assess the strength of agreement between the d13C and 7d weighed diet record in measuring sugars intakes. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA will be used to assess the between-subject effect and to compare bulk d13C in various tissues at each monthly time point with adjustment for potential confounders including age, sex, body size, hair thickness, physical activity level and total energy intake. 

Correlation coefficients (r) measured between nutritional biomarkers and reported dietary intake vary widely in research trials, with typical r values ranging from 0.03-0.70, with a mean of 0.39. These correlations may be interpreted as weak to modest, as they may underestimate the true validity of biomarkers due to the inherent inaccuracy of self-reported dietary intake measures. R values of 0.5-0.7 are typically considered acceptable as a precision in dietary validation studies.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Restriction of free sugars is an almost universal recommendation despite a relatively high degree of inconsistency in the evidence base linking free sugars with health risks. Food industry continues to debate the relevance of sugar reduction strategies thus ongoing research to investigate the effects of sugar on population health is needed. Nutritional studies typically assess free sugars intakes using self-report methods which are subject to substantial misreporting thus observed diet-disease relationships are frequently obscured. Previous research in the U.S. has shown that carbon stable isotope ratios could be used as a objective measure of intakes of free sugars. The carbon stable isotope composition of a sweetener reflects the isotopic composition of the plant from which it originated. In NZ the majority of sweeteners are derived from sugar cane which has a distinctive d13C signature compared with other plant-derived foods and preliminary research has shown that d13C values in various tissues correlates with consumption of sugar-sweetened foods and drinks. For the validation current study, we will recruit 120 volunteers, measure the carbon stable isotopes in blood and hair samples as biomarkers of free sugars intakes and validate these markers against intakes of free sugars estimated by conventional dietary assessment methods including a general short food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), a sugars-specific FFQ and a 7d weighed diet record.</summary>
