  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomized in two group using minimization.

For both groups patients are positioned 15 degrees reverse trendelenburg.
The trachea is intubated. Mechanical ventilation parameters are set to Peep: 3cmH2O, Respiratory rate: 12, Tidal volume: 6-8ml/kg. These parameters are then adjusted for a target EtCO2 of 30-35mmHg


Cata group	
 Anesthesia induction: 
1. Lidocaine 1mg/kg I.V. bolus 
2. Sufentanil 0.15mcg/kg I.V. bolus
3. Intravenous Propofol titrated to loss of eye lid reflex
4. Rocuronium 0.3mg/kg I.V. bolus
5. Clonidine 2mcg/kg  slow I.V. bolus (for 5 min)
Anesthesia Maintenance: sevoflurane 1 MAC  (inhalation)

15 min from the start of surgery, the Fromme score is assessed, if it's higher than 4  and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is greater than 65mmHg and the last sufentanil injection occurred more than 45min ago then a new bolus of sufentanil 0.15mcg/kg is injected I.V. If the last sufentanil injection occurred within the  last 45 minutes  then a new bolus of clonidine 1mcg/kg I.V. is slowly injected (for five minutes) to a maximum total clonidine dose of  3mcg/kg.

If, during the procedure,  the surgeon complaints about bleeding and the MAP is greater than 65mmHg and the last sufentanil injection occurred more than 45min ago then a new bolus of sufentanil 0.15mcg/kg is injected I.V. If the last sufentanil injection occurred less than 45 min ago then a new bolus of clonidine 1mcg/kg I.V. is slowly injected (for five minutes) to a maximum total clonidine dose of  3mcg/kg

If,during the procedure, the patients MAP fall below 55mmHg then ephedrine is titrated intravenously by 3mg for a MAP greater than 55mmHg.

In all cases, if ephedrine fails to raise the MAP the patient should receive neosynephrine or norepinephrine and leave the study.
If the surgeon is unable to perform the procedure due to bleeding despite a well followed protocol, the patient leaves the study.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Remi group
Anesthesia induction:
1. Lidocaine 1mg/kg I.V. bolus
2. Remifentanil I.V. infusion 0.25mcg/kg/min until trachea intubation. After that, the infusion rate is lowered to 0.12mcg/kg/min
3. Propofol I.V. injection titrated to loss of eye lid reflex
4. Rocuronium 0.3mg/kg I.V. injection

Anesthesia maintenance: sevoflurane 1 MAC  (inhalation)

15 min from the start of the procedure, the Fromme score is assessed. If it is higher than 4 and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is greater than 65mmHg then the rate of remifentanil infusion rate is doubled until a maximum of 1mcg/kg/min.

If, during the procedure,  the surgeon complaints about bleeding and MAP is greater than 65mmHg then the  remifentanil infusion rate is doubled until a maximum of 1mcg/kg/min.

During the surgery, if the patients MAP fall below 55mmHg then ephedrine  is titrated intravenously by 3mg for MAP greater than 55mmHg and the remifentanil infusion rate is halved.

In all cases, if ephedrine fails to raise the MAP the patient should receive neosynephrine or norepinephrine and leave the study.
If the surgeon is unable to perform the procedure due to bleeding despite a well followed protocol, the patient leaves the study.

    <concealment>Eligible patients will be approached during the anesthesia preoperative visit, days before the surgery. The anesthesia consultant will obtain an informed consent. The treatment received for each patient will be determined on the day of the procedure by minimization (handled by Qminim, online minimization at http://qminim.sourceforge.net).</concealment>
    <sequence>Minimisation
The factors used for stratification include age, sex, Mackay-Lund score, preoperative oral corticoid treatment, ASA score and surgeon.

    <statisticalmethods>The purpose of the trial is to detect a difference of 1 point on the Frommes scale. The preliminary data on 40 patients allowed to estimate Fromme scale as 2.4 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- SD).Using a two-tailed non parametric test, with an alpha risk of 0.05, a beta risk of 0.20 (or a power of 0.80), a minimal difference of 1 and a SD of Fromme scale of 1.3, the total number of patients necessary to perform the comparison is 58 (computation by G*Power 3 software).

Planned statistical analysis
