  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine whether food is a cost-effective method for improving treatment
      compliance for TB patients in Timor Leste. Our hypothesis is that the provision of locally
      available, locally acceptable, cheap and highly nutritious food at the clinic will encourage
      patients to come for daily directly observed treatment, and thus improve the chance of TB
      cure and decrease the chance of the development of TB drug resistance. Primary outcome will
      be successful completion of treatment and secondary outcomes will include treatment
      compliance and clinical and biological measures of nutritional improvement.</summary>
