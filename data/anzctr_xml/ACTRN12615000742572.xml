  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women will undergo two MRI scans on their arm - one while wearing their own compression garment and the other without. Compression garments will not be provided as a part of the study. The current recommendation is for compression to be used continuously (International Lymphoedema Framework, 2012).  For persons with upper limb LE, the recommendation is to use at least 30 to 40 mmHg (Class II garment). </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study providing proof of concept.  Digital image correlation will be used to measure strains on the surfaces of the compression sleeve while applied to the affected and the contralateral limb. In this way, the prevailing surface pressure of the affected limb can be compared to the contralateral while also evaluating the compression abatement via the compression sleeve. 
MRI data: The quantity of adipose tissue, fibrosis, and epifascial lakes will be quantified using PD images and segmentation software (AnalyzeDirect). The Volume Render module is used to measure volume of the oedematous tissue in three dimensions. DWI data will be analyzed with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian models using in-house software written in Matlab.
Magnetic resonance elastography data will be analysed using in-house custom software written in C++, to derive tissue shear modulus.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to describe the effect of limb compression on lymphoedema in terms of fluid distribution and soft tissue structure changes using MRI. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have a clinically detectable unilateral secondary upper limb lymphoedema arising from treatment of breast cancer. This diagnosis must be made using accepted diagnostic thresholds for bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) or volume measurements. You must also currently use a compression garment for management of your lymphoedema.

All participants enrolled in this study will have at least one MRI scan while wearing the upper limb compression garment. Depending on participant availability, a second MRI scan on a separate visit may also be performed where participants do not wear the compression garment for that day. It is hoped that this study will contribute to a better understanding of how different levels of compression can be used in control of the lymphoedema.</summary>
