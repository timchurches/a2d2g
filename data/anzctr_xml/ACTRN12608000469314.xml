  <interventions>
    <interventions>The education and support package consists of a written education booklet that provides tailored information, supplemented by verbal reinforcement and repetition of the information contained therein stroke. This verbal reinforcement will occur both face-to-face (prior to hospital discharge) and over the telephone (after hospital discharge) for up to 3 months post-discharge.

The written education booklet contains topics including the definition, causes, warning signs, risk factors, effects, diagnosis and treatment of stroke, as well as rehabilitation, recovery, returning to activities, going home, practical management strategies and services and support available after stroke. 

Face-to-face contact will be made up to three times with intervention participants, each contact estimated to last between 5 and 20 minutes. 

Telephone support will be initiated up to three times over the first 3 months post discharge, with each call estimated to last between 2 and 10 minutes. Additionally, over this time period, intervention participants will have the option to call to ask questions, again same time period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care: the usual contact that clients and their carers/family members would receive from the hospitals treating team members. This would include medical assessment and treatment, nursing care, assessment and/or treatment from allied health staff, discharge planning and any information or education associated with this treatment. The control group will receive no information or intervention from the principal researcher.</comparator>

    <concealment>Several days before discharge, an eligible participant will be advised of the study by a member of the Hospital’s treating team and be invited to received further information and/or participate. If agreeable, the principal researcher will provide more information and answer any questions.  If they wish to participate, the principal researcher will obtain their written consent and complete the initial interview. 
Randomisation will occur using sealed, opaque envelopes, marked for consecutive participants. After the initial interview is completed, the principal researcher will open the envelope to determine the participant’s random allocation. Participants will be randomised in this way in strict order of interview.</concealment>
    <sequence>The sequentially numbered opaque envelopes will be prepared by a person unrelated to the study, using a random numbers table.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The provision of information is recognised as a key component of post-stroke management for clients, their carers and their families and can improve client and carer knowledge, reduce client depression and increase some aspects of client satisfaction. Clients with stroke and their families need, and want, information about stroke, across a broad content range and there is evidence that their education and support needs are not met by current practice.

Current recommendations for effective information provision include providing a combining verbal and written information, using an interactive teaching style and repetition or reinforcement of information. 

Preliminary research conducted by this team sought stroke clients and carers content, format, teaching style and timing preferences regarding stroke educational support. Although this data is as yet unpublished, it confirms support for the aforementioned recommendations (combination of written and verbal information, an interactive style and reinforcement). It was further established that a combination of face-to-face and telephone contact is acceptable to clients with stroke and their carers.  As a result, an education and support package was developed, consisting of a previously trialled Australian tailored written education booklet, supplemented by verbal reinforcement and repetition of the information contained therein. 

This study will evaluate the impact of this education and support package through a single-blind randomised control trial, by comparing the health and psychosocial outcomes of participants in the intervention group with those of participants in the control group, who will receive usual care. Outcome measures will be administered prior to hospital discharge and again at three months post discharge.</summary>
