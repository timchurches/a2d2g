  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment of patients with Early Stage I/II Melanoma using Lymphatic Mapping and Selective (Sentinel) Lymph Node Biopsy. This treatment has shown a high degree of safety with very few adverse events. The scheduled initial follow-up period will be for 5 years post-surgery.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The fundamental primary outcome is clinical efficacy, measured by performance status (ECOG score), recurrence (local or distant) and overall survival.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The clinical efficacy will be evaluated at regular time-points according to the schedule of clinical visits initially 3-monthly for 2 years, then 6-monthly for 2 years, then yearly thereafter.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcomes are a range of other measures that will be correlated with clinical outcome. The aim is to determine any associations between the procedure and clinical responses. In some patients with a sentinel node positive for metastatic spread, some of these patients will be offered entry into an international multicentre clinical trial for randomization into either (i) radical surgical lymphatic nodal clearance, or (ii) regular ultrasound follow-up to the basin where the +ve sentionel node was removed, and later surgical clearance if required. </outcome>
      <timepoint>These will be evaluated at regular time-points according to the schedule of clinical visits initially 3-monthly for 2 years, then 6-monthly for 2 years, then yearly thereafter.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A further aim is to design better therapy.</outcome>
