  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Telbivudine (LdT)

Treatment: drugs: Telbivudine (LdT)
Telbivudine was to be supplied as white to off-white, oval, bi-convex tablets for the 200 mg tablets and white to off-white ovaloid, slightly curved, beveled edges, film coated tablets for the 600 mg tablets. Study drug (600 mg) was to be self-administered by patients orally (p.o.) in a once daily regimen for 104 weeks; for study consistency, the daily dose had to be taken at the same time each day, with or without food.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Therapeutic Response [Group A: LdT Pool 2302/015] - The maintained therapeutic response is defined as hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA &lt; 5 log10 copies/mL and either hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) loss or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalized. HBeAg loss is loss of detectable serum HBeAg in a patient who was HBeAg-positive at feeder baseline. ALT normalized is defined as ALT within normal limits for a patient with an elevated ALT level (&gt;1.0 × ULN) at either the feeder baseline or feeder screening visit. All efficacy data were analyzed separately for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>156 weeks, 208 weeks (from feeder study baseline)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Therapeutic Response [Group A: LAM Pool 2302/015] - The maintained therapeutic response is defined as hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA &lt; 5 log10 copies/mL and either hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) loss or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalized. HBeAg loss is loss of detectable serum HBeAg in a patient who was HBeAg-positive at feeder baseline. ALT normalized is defined as ALT within normal limits for a patient with an elevated ALT level (&gt;1.0 × ULN) at either the feeder baseline or feeder screening visit. All efficacy data were analyzed separately for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Therapeutic Response [Group A: Feeder Studies 2401/2402/010] - The maintained therapeutic response is defined as hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA &lt; 5 log10 copies/mL and either hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) loss or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalized. HBeAg loss is loss of detectable serum HBeAg in a patient who was HBeAg-positive at feeder baseline. ALT normalized is defined as ALT within normal limits for a patient with an elevated ALT level (&gt;1.0 × ULN) at either the feeder baseline or feeder screening visit.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Maintained Clinical Response [Group B: LdT 2301] - Maintained clinical response is defined as achievement of serum HBV DNA &lt; 4 log10 copies/mL, normal serum ALT level and improvement or stabilization in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score. Total CTP score ranges from 5 to 15; higher scores indicate liver impairment. Improvement is defined as a 2-point or greater reduction in CTP score, and stabilization is defined as a less than 2-point change in CTP score, compared to the patient's baseline value. Analysis was done on the overall per protocol (PP) population and separately for the HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative subpopulation.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Therapeutic Response [Group C: LdT Pool and LAM Pool (2302/015)] - The primary efficacy endpoint for Group C patients was the percentage of patients with sustained therapeutic response (defined as HBV DNA &lt; 5 log10 copies/mL and either HBeAg loss or ALT normalized) at Weeks 52 and 104 of off-treatment follow-up. HBeAg loss is loss of detectable serum HBeAg in a patient who was HBeAg-positive at feeder baseline. ALT normalized is ALT within normal limits for a patient with an elevated ALT level (&gt;1.0 × ULN) at either the feeder baseline or feeder screening visit. All efficacy data were analyzed separately for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Therapeutic Response [Group C: Other Feeder Studies] - The primary efficacy endpoint for Group C (other feeder studies) was the percentage of patients with sustained therapeutic response (defined as HBV DNA &lt; 5 log10 copies/mL and either HBeAg loss or ALT normalized) at Weeks 52 and 104 of off-treatment follow-up.
Patients were enrolled for off-treatment follow-up after the treatment discontinuation due to efficacy at their last visit of the feeder studies. Hence, patients did not receive study drug except in case of patients who relapsed and reinitiated treatment. No statistical summary was performed , only patient listing was generated.</outcome>
