    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1-After the school authority’s permission, we will approach the high school classes and brief them about the research purpose, process and procedures. Those who will be willing to participate will be given a consent form and an assent form to discuss it with their parents. They will be also advised to request their parents to visit the school on the date provided by the students and the school authorities as per their feasibility to sign the consent form. In case they have any concern, they can contact us on phone for further clarification. Those adolescents whose parents will sign the consent and he/ she is also agree to participate in the study will be selected for inclusion in the study. 
2-They will be then screened on the eligibility form for the conditions mentioned in the exclusion criteria. 
3-On average at least 15 participants will be selected from each school. We will the fill a questionnaire for assessing their lead exposure and collect a blood sample. 
4-Once the recruitment is completed from the school, It will be then randomized accordingly using Acluster software.</concealment>
    <sequence>1-A cluster randomization technique will used to allocate the treatment.
2-When recruitment is completed from two schools, They will be randomized using the Acluster (“Design and analysis of cluster randomization trails version 2.0 by World Health Organization, 2000”). 
3-Every school has a cluster number, which will be entered in the software with cluster numbers and the intervention options will be also entered in the software. 
4-A third person who is not related to the study will be asked to press the compute key to avoid any bias in the treatment allocation. Thus it will reveal the sequence of the treatment allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study we want to assess the effects of Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) on decreasing the blood lead levels in adolescents age 13-18 years. A cluster Randomized control trial will be used to conduct the the study. We hypothesize that there will be at least two units (mg/dl) difference between the two intervention groups. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of ascorbic acid in minimizing the lead toxicity by decreasing the blood lead levels and to provide an economical and convenient and safe method of ameliorating the adverse effects of lead in developing countries.
Thus a minimum 3 cluster per group will be enough to detect this difference with 90 % power. We will give vitamin C in two groups. Each school (cluster) will be given one treatment only. These school are selected from different areas (Industrial/ commercial and residential). We will collect a blood sample and fill a questionnaire to assess the lead exposure at base line. They will be then given Vitamin C for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks we will collect the second blood sample to assess the decrease in blood levels. We will also assess their dietary vitamin C intake at the time of second blood sample through a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).</summary>
