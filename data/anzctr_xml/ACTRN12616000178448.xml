  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised to one of three treatment groups: 
1. clozapine suspension for oral administration - Participants will be started on clozapine at a dose of 5 mg/day and titrated over 2 weeks to an interim daily dose of 100 mg/day for 2.5 months. The dose will be held at the same level across the weekends. After the 3-month clinical visit, the dose of clozapine will then be further titrated over 2 weeks to a final dose of 150 mg/day. This dose will be used until study completion at 6 months.
2. risperidone tablets for oral administration - Participants will be started on risperidone at a dose of 0.5 mg/day and titrated over 2 weeks to an interim daily dose of 2.0 mg/day for 2.5 months. Following the 3 month clinical visit, the dose of risperidone will then be titrated over 2 weeks to a final dose of 3.5 mg/day. This dose will be used until study completion at 6 months.
3. Or to a placebo To check compliance, at each site visit participants will be asked to bring all their study medication (used and unused) plus their dairy in which dates and time of dosing is to be recorded </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of clozapine and risperidone in a PMS population as assessed by the incidence of adverse events (AEs). AEs will be assessed by querying the study participant at their weekly visit/phone call, review of their daily diary and observations by site staff. The most common AEs associated with clozapine treatment, and occurring in more than 1 in 10 patients are weight gain, drowsiness, sedation, dizziness, tachycardia, constipation, and hypersalivation. The most AEs associated with risperidone treatment, and occurring in more than 1 in 10 patients are weight gain, dizziness, vomiting, dry mouth, nausea, anxiety, constipation, and hypersalivation. </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All site study staff will be blinded except for Pharmacy and  the research nurse. The research nurse will be responsible mainly for visit organisation however will review the participant diary, check compliance with study medication and ask about adverse events and concomitant medications. She may also collect blood pressure, heart rate, weight and temperature data at study visits Months 0, 3 and 6. While the research nurse will be blinded to the treatment allocation of the participants, some aspects of the study medicine formulation may allow the allocation to be guessed. However, although the research nurse will collect adverse event information, this outcome measure will be verified by the clinical investigator, who will be blinded.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (N=12 for each treatment): clozapine suspension titrated to a final dose of 150 mg/day, risperidone tablets titrated to a final dose of 3.5 mg/day, or placebo.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 12 per treatment group is proposed to allow comparison of the acceptability and safety of clozapine and risperidone treatment to placebo and to provide preliminary data on potential effects on disease parameters (i.e. MSFC, EDSS). The sample size has been calculated based upon the validation of the TSQM-9 by Bharmal et al. This study demonstrated that medium compliers had a significantly higher TSQM-9 score than low compliers, and compliance was assessed by the Modified Morisky scale, which evaluates self-reported patient adherence. Based upon this data, if we assume a similar effect size as that shown between medium to low compliers (81.25 +/- 15.19 compared to 69.82 +/-19.82 for global satisfaction) occurs between either drug treatment compared to placebo over the 6-month treatment, then 11 patients will give us an 80% power of observing a statistically significant result. Thus, a group size of 12 would slightly overpower the study. 

While the main comparison is between drug-treatment (clozapine or risperidone) and placebo, if clozapine or risperidone is found to be superior in terms of acceptability and safety and to show efficacy on disease parameters, a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial can be run to evaluate the efficacy of this superior drug at reducing disease parameters.  

The proportion of patients with SAE and AE in each group will be compared (clozapine vs risperidone) by Fishers exact test. TSQM-9, change in EDSS, change in FSS, and change in MSFC will be analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired participant analyses. To compare TSQM-9 between placebo, clozapine, and risperidone treatment, a Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric; multiple comparison correction) will be used.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> The CRISP study is a blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of clozapine and risperidone administration in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. The aim of the CRISP trial is to assess the safety and acceptability of clozapine and risperidone in SPMS patients. Thirty-six patients with SPMS will be recruited through the Neurology Department at Wellington Hospital with the expectation of 33 completing the trial. Baseline clinical and laboratory investigations will be taken and patients (n = 12/group) will receive oral clozapine titrated to a final dose of 150 mg/day (1, 2), risperidone titrated to a final dose of 3.5 mg/day, or no study medicine. Over the course of the 6 month participation in the trial, patients will have regular clinical review and blood sampling. The primary outcome measure is the safety and tolerability of clozapine and risperidone treatment. Secondary outcome measures include disability progression.</summary>
