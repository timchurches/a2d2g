  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Human immunodeficiency virus/Hepatitis B virus (HIV/HBV) co-infections are frequently
      observed due to shared routes of transmission, with reported figures indicating 6-9% of
      HIV-infected individuals in developed countries are chronically infected with HBV. HIV
      infection impacts on the natural progression of HBV infection, increasing levels of HBV
      replication and the risk of liver-associated mortality. Liver diseases associated with HBV
      are affected by the antiviral drugs used for HIV infection (toxic side effects), the current
      immune function in the patient, by improvements in the immune system brought about by control
      of the HIV infection, and by the development of resistance to the antiviral agents used for
      both the hepatitis B and the HIV infection. Tenofovir (TDF) is a newer antiviral drug that is
      frequently used for HIV infection and is also highly active against hepatitis B; however it
      is still unknown whether resistance to TDF will eventually develop and how this will affect
      the long-term outcomes</summary>
