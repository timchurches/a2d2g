  <interventions>
    <interventions>Diagnostic lung ultrasound (LUS) will be conducted within 48-hours of commencement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), then again on day 5 and day 10 after the commencement of ECMO (or on the day of ECMO de-cannulation).  The diagnostic lung ultrasound will be performed by a trained physiotherapist. The patient will be imaged in supine with the head of bed elevated 30-45 degrees dependent on device/patient stability.  The intensive care unit has a dedicated portable ultrasound unit (Sonosite Edge) and for this study the convex array probe (3 to 5 MHz) will be used. </interventions>
    <comparator>The daily CXR is a standard of care in intensive care. The CXR will be reported by the intensivist (blinded to LUS findings) with each hemithorax divided into 2 zones (upper and lower zones) and the number of zones (out of 4) for the presence infiltrates/opacification, pleural effusion and/or pneumothorax will be reported based on the Murray Lung Injury Score. 
The routine data collected as part of standard care at the same intervals as LUS will be used to calculate measures of lung function and include:
 Partial pressure of arterial oxygen/Fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) in mmHg, routinely taken from the arterial blood gases that are part of standard patient care will be taken with the FIO2 on the ventilator as clinically indicated.
 Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in CMH2O from the ventilator
 Lung Compliance measure from monitored values taken from the mechanical ventialtor display screen (in ml/CMH2O, only if the patient is in a mandatory mode of mechanical ventilation). The compliance may be calculated as follows: TV/PIP-PEEP, where TV is Tidal Volume, and PIP is Peak Inspiratory Pressure, only when in mandatory modes of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation parameters will be documented at the same time points as LUS immediately prior to LUS assessment, to allow the calculation of dynamic lung compliance (Tidal volume/Peak pressure-PEEP) and driving pressure (Peak pressure-PEEP).

    <statisticalmethods>This is an observational cohort study with descriptive variables.  A pilot sample size of 10 has been selected based on an expected accrual of patients who require VV-ECMO over a 24-month period.  At each time we will compared the LUS score of aeration with the dynamic compliance, ventilator driving pressure, CXR score to predict the de-cannulation time for patients on VV-ECMO.  ROC curves will be used to determine the most significant predictors of liberation and survival from ECMO. Optimal cut-points which maximise the true positive rate for each predictor will be obtained.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis: Diagnostic lung ultrasound may be a useful non-invasive bedside tool to assist with clinical decision making during veno-venous-extracorporeal membrane oxygen support and requires further investigation.
Objectives
Primary: Can diagnostic lung ultrasound be used to monitor the movement of air in the lungs of patients who require on veno-venous ECMO?
Secondary: To study the changes of in the movement of air in the lungs using lung ultrasound in comparison to standard measures of lung function and chest X-ray changes up to the point of weaning a patient from extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation
Study design
Prospective observational cohort study of 10 patients
LUS assessment will be undertaken within 48-hours after commencement of ECMO and at 5 and 10 days after ECMO commencement.  Standard measurements for VV-ECMO, including ECMO settings (sweep flow, ECMO flow) and arterial blood gases will be undertaken 4-6 hourly and recorded. The portable anterior chest radiograph will undertaken once per day and as clinically indicated.  </summary>
