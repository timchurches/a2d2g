    <interventions>Oral selinexor tablet 100 mg or 80 mg taken on Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-3 of each 4-week [28 day] cycle [6 doses per cycle] until disease progression or intolerability. 
Participants with a Body Surface Area (BSA) of 1.7 or greater will be given 100mg of selinexor. Participants with a BSA less than 1.7 and greater than or equal to 1.35 will be given 80mg of selinexor.

To minimise nausea, all participants will be given anti-nausea medication (e.g. ondansetron 8 mg tablet
or equivalent) starting on Day 1 before the first dose of
selinexor and continued twice or three times a day as needed.

Participants will be asked to return all the provided study medication at each study visit.  The study site staff will account for the number of tablets dispensed against those return by the participant. </interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will undergo screening assessments up to 30 days before the first dosing (Day 1) of Cycle 1.  If the participant meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria the participant will be enrolled into the study. The dose of selinexor is based on the Body surface area (BSA) of the participant. If BSA is greater than or equal to 1.7, the participant will receive 100mg of selinexor. If the BSA is less than 1.7 m2 and greater than or equal to 1.35 m2, the participant will receive 80mg of selinexor.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the analyses, including those who withdraw prematurely from the study. 

Hypothesis testing will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint data, in order to evaluate if selinexor provides statistically significant improvement in efficacy over a
minimally acceptable level of 20%. No formal hypothesis testing will be used for other study data, such as demographics and safety data.

Tabulations will be produced for appropriate disposition, demographic, baseline, efficacy and safety parameters. For categorical variables, summary tabulations of the number and percentage of patients within each category (with a category for missing data) of the parameter will be presented, as well as two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI), unless otherwise stated. For continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values will be presented. Time-to- event data will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methodology using 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles with associated 2-sided 95% CIs, as well as percentage of censored observations.

Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled. It is planned to enroll up to 10 patients with CTCL; the remaining patients may have PTCL or CTCL. The sample size of this study was not determined by formal statistical calculation.

    <summary>This study will determine whether selinexor has any effects against Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) and Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma (CTCL). 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and Relapsed or Refractory PTCL or CTCL

Study details
This study drug, selinexor, works by trapping tumour suppressing proteins within the cell and thus causing the cancer cells to die or stop growing. Selinexor has previously been tested in humans to define a safe dose to be administered. It is not known at this time if selinexor will treat PTCL/CTCL. This study will examine the effects of selinexor on PTCL/CTCL and look at the side-effects.
After signing the consent, participants will undergo screening assessments up to 30 days before the first dosing. These include: medical and medication history taking, eye examination, ECG, Echocardiogram or MUGA scan, chest X-ray, CT/MRI scans, tumour or skin biopsy, bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, height, weight, vital signs measurement, physical exam, and urine and safety blood tests. Eligible participants will receive oral selinexor tablets on Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-3 of each 4-week (28 day) cycle (6 doses/cycle) until disease progression or intolerability. The dose of selinexor will be either 100mg or 80 mg depending on the participants body surface area (calculated from their height and weight). Participants will also take dexamethasone to improve selinexor tolerability and antinausea drugs (e.g. ondansetron) to minimise nausea. Additional anti-nausea and anti-anorexia agents may be given as needed. The assessments done at screening will be repeated at various intervals to monitor safety and assess efficacy of the selinexor. In addition, photographs of skin lesions (CTCL patients only) will be taken and blood samples will be taken to check the level of selinexor in the blood at certain timepoints, and to test the binding of selinexor in the blood. Follow-up visits will occur 30 and 60 days after the last dose of selinexor, then participants will be contacted every 3 months to check on their disease status and other treatments.
