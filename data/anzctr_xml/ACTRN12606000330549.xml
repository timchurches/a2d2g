Prior treatment with cytokines, vaccines, antiangiogenic agents or signal transduction inhibitors is permitted. 13. Patients must not have had any other tumour treatment medications for 30 days prior to entering the study. 14. Patients must not be actively receiving any other investigational therapy, nor received any experimental agents within the previous 30 days. 15. Any other medical or psychological condition that would preclude participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Melanoma is the least common but the most life-threatening of all skin cancers, accounting for only about 4% of all cases but causing 79% of skin cancer deaths.
Whilst early stage melanoma can be successfully treated by surgical removal, few
effective treatments exist for melanoma which has progressed to a later stage.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of CoramsineÂ® in patients with late stage melanoma as well as evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug.
Also, the effect of Coramsine on Progression Free Survival will be assessed (this is defined as the length of time during and after treatment that the cancer does not grow and includes the amount of time patients have experienced a complete response or a partial response, as well as the amount of time patients have experienced stable disease).</summary>
