  <interventions>
    <interventions>4 weeks of daily supplementation with 1.5 g of arachidonic acid via oral capsule. Supplement is consumed twice daily: 0.75 g (two capsules) in the morning and 0.75 g (two capsules)  prior to exercise or in the evening if no exercise is preformed. Subjects will continue their normal exercise routine during the supplementation period.

Supervised acute exercise will take place in the morning following the 28th day (4th week) of supplementation. The supplement will not be consumed the morning of the acute exercise session. 
The acute exercise intervention will consist of 8 sets of both leg press and leg extension at 80% 1RM. With 2 min rest between sets.         </interventions>
    <comparator>4 weeks of daily supplementation with 1.5 g of a corn/soy oil blend. Supplement is consumed twice daily: 0.75 g in the morning and 0.75 g prior to exercise or in the evening if no exercise is preformed.       </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle protein synthesis (fractional synthetic rate) in response to acute resistance exercise. Fractional synthetic rate will be calculated based on the difference in vastus lateralis myofibrillar enrichments using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. A Primed constant infusion of ring 13C6 phenylalanine will be used to ensure a constant precursor pool enrichments.        </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Resistance trained men will undergo 4 week of supplementation with 1.5 g per day of arachidonic acid or a placebo. They will then complete an acute bout of resistance exercise. Muscle biopsies will be collated at 1.5, 4 and 48 hours after the exercise. It is hypothesized that arachidonic acid supplementation will increase the rate of muscle protein synthesis and the muscle satellite cell to a greater extent than placebo following the acute exercise bout.    </summary>
