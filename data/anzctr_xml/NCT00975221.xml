    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Cinacalcet
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Cinacalcet - Participants received cinacalcet at a starting dose of 30 mg orally BID and were eligible for a dose titration once every 3 weeks during the 12-week dose-titration phase based on corrected total serum calcium concentration and safety assessments. Participants continued to receive cinacalcet for another 16 weeks during the efficacy assessment phase and then continued into the open-label extension phase and received cinacalcet at a starting dose of 30 mg BID for 24 weeks. The dose of cinacalcet could have been increased or decreased as needed to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range through Week 52.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants received placebo orally twice a day (BID) for 12 weeks during the dose titration phase and for another 16 weeks during the efficacy assessment phase. Participants then continued into the open-label extension phase and received cinacalcet at a starting dose of 30 mg BID for 24 weeks. The dose of cinacalcet could have been increased or decreased as needed to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range through Week 52.


Treatment: drugs: Cinacalcet
Administered orally at a starting dose of 30 mg twice a day (BID). Participants will be eligible for a dose titration once every 3 weeks during the placebo-controlled dose titration phase based on corrected total serum calcium concentration and safety assessments obtained the previous week. Doses may be sequentially increased to 60 mg BID, 90 mg BID, and 90 mg 3 times a day (TID).

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Administered orally following the same tiitration regimen as the experimental arm.
