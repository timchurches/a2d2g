  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase II trial is studying how well selenomethionine (SLM) works in reducing
      mucositis in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who are receiving cisplatin
      and radiation therapy. SLM may help prevent or reduce mucositis, or mouth sores, in patients
      receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It is not yet known whether SLM is more
      effective than a placebo in reducing mucositis</summary>
