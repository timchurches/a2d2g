  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be provided with an iPod touch device loaded with a modified version of the videogame Tetris and will be asked to play for 1 to 2 hours per day for a total of 6 weeks while wearing red/green anaglyphic glasses. The Tetris blocks will be presented so that some blocks are seen by the amblyopic eye and other blocks are seen by the fellow (non-amblyopic) eye by means of red/green anaglyphic glasses. Tetris blocks will be presented to the amblyopic eye at 100% contrast and to the fellow eye at a contrast determined by a random dot kinematogram measure of suppression at the start of training. The contrast of the blocks presented to the fellow eye will be increased if patients play the game successfully. Specifically, if the patient successfully completes 3 or more levels of the game within 24 hours the contrast to the fellow eye will be increased by 10% for the next 24 period of play. If the game is attempted and 3 or more levels are not successfully completed the contrast presented to the fellow eye will be reduced by 5%. The time participants spend playing the game will be automatically recorded on the iPod device. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control (placebo) device will be an iPod touch running identical videogame software to the real treatment device, except that both eyes will see the same images with no contrast offset. Participants will be instructed to play the placebo videogame for 1-2 hours every day for 6 weeks while wearing red/green anaglyphic glasses and their normal refractive correction where applicable.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the University of Auckland Optometry Clinics, ophthalmology practices in Auckland and in Melbourne and the Department of Ophthalmology Clinics at McGill University in Canada. Potential participants will be identified through a search of current records and during the course of routine clinical appointments. Initial contact will be made via an invitation letter which will include a patient information sheet and a parent/guardian information sheet where appropriate. This initial contact will either be by mail or in person at the end of a clinic visit. A follow-up telephone call will be made by a researcher who will answer any questions about the trial.

Allocation concealment: Participants will be randomized to the placebo or treatment group after they have been judged to be eligible for the trial. Randomization will be conducted using an internet-based system that accesses a computer that is remote from the test sites. Allocation to each group will be made using a 1:1 ratio. </concealment>
    <sequence>Immediately after baseline data have been recorded, participants will be randomised by computer (using an internet-based system) in a 1:1 ratio. Stratified minimisation will be carried out by age (7-12 years, 13-17 years and &gt;17 years), severity of amblyopia (better or worse than 6/24 visual acuity in the amblyopic eye) and presence or absence of strabismus (a squint), to ensure a balance in these key prognostic indicators between the intervention and control groups.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 108 patients (54 per arm) will provide 90% power at p=0.05 to detect a minimal clinically important difference of 0.2 log units improvement in visual acuity at six weeks, assuming a standard deviation of 0.17. This sample size allows for an overall loss-to-follow-up of 10% and each of the three age-groups is powered (90%) separately (36 in each group). This sample size also allows for the consistency of effects for pre-specified subgroups, namely severity of amblyopia, and presence or absence of strabismus, to be assessed.

Statistical analyses  will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC).  All statistical tests will be two-sided at 5% significance level. Treatment evaluations will be carried out on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, using data collected from all randomised participants. Missing data on the primary outcome will be imputed using the last value carry forward method. Sensitivity analyses may be conducted to test the robustness of trial results under different assumptions on the missing data. This may include complete case analysis and multiple imputations methods. Per protocol analysis will also be conducted on those randomised participants who have no major protocol violations. 
Baseline demographics, visual acuity, stereopsis, suppression, and quality of life will be summarised using descriptive statistics by treatment arms. Regression models appropriate to continuous and categorical outcome variables will be used to assess the overall treatment effect, adjusting for baseline outcome value and by age groups (stratification factor). Repeated measures analyses will be conducted on those outcomes measured repeatedly over time. For binary outcomes simple incidence rates, relative risks, and adjusted odds ratios will be calculated with 95% CI. For continuous outcomes simple mean/SDs, and adjusted mean differences will be calculated with 95% CI.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Amblyopia, also known as lazy eye, is a developmental disorder of vision whereby the brain ignores the information from one eye. This leads to a reduction in the vision of that eye. Also, the two eyes fail to work together resulting in a lack of binocular vision. This study is designed to test a new treatment for amblyopia implemented as a videogame on an iPod touch device that aims to strengthen binocular vision. The treatment is expected to establish stereopsis (3D vision) and to improve monocular acuity in participants with lazy eye. Participants will be given real or placebo treatment for 6 weeks and standard clinical tests of monocular and binocular vision will be used to assess treatment outcomes.</summary>
