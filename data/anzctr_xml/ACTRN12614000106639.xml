  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants received a group based task specific motor intervention in which they attended a one hour session once a week for 13 weeks.  The one hour seession included gross motor and fine motor activities which were developmentally appropriate for 5- 8 year olds.  The basis of task specific intervention is practising the task itself under different conditions rather than focussing on impairments which contribute to difficulties with task. Each group had a maximum of 6 participants and had a staff to participant ratio of 1:3.  There were three intervention modes which were compared.  One mode was run by a physiotherapist in a health clinic setting, a second mode was run by a physiotherapist in a school setting and a third mode was run by a school assistant in a school setting.</interventions>
    <comparator>Evidence based intervention delivered by physiotherapist in clinic setting which accounts for the mode of intervention provided by a physiotherapist in a health clinic setting.  This group of participants received the group based task specific intervention once a week for an hour over 13 weeks in groups of 4-6 with a staff to participant ratio of 1:3.</comparator>

    <concealment>Children screened in select SA public schools for DCD using standardised questionnaire  DCD-Q. If consented children deemed at risk of DCD complete further testing  using Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) to confirm motor impairment and parents complete questionniare to screen for exclusion criteria. Children in each school identified with DCD offered intervention.  Type of intervention determined by  cluster randomisation of schools to particular mode of intervention.  Assessor was blind to type of intervention each school was allocated.Randomisation of schools was generated from a computer random numbers table and allocated by a third party independent of the study who was "off site".</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Two settings and two types of personnel were  compared for intervention delivery.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intervention for Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) has been shown to be better than no intervention, however there is scarce information on the delivery of all types of intervention.  This study compares different personnel and environments in service delivery.  Ninety-three children from 13 South Australian schools, aged five to eight years (at time of recruitment) were recruited to participate in this RCT.  Participants received a group intervention running for 13 weeks, working on fine and gross motor skills.  Schools were randomised using cluster randomisation to receive one of three modes of delivery.  Group one schools received the program at school run by a school assistant, group two received the program in school run by a physiotherapist and group three received the intervention in a health clinic run by a physiotherapist.  Group three was considered the control group for delivery as the literature concludes group programs run by health professionals in a health setting have success in treating children with DCD.  Participants were assessed pre and post-intervention, and six months after the program completion.  The Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC), Test of Gross Motor Development  Second Edition (TGMD-2), Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children (PSPCSA) and the School Function Assessment (SFA) were used to assess participants, while parent and child questionnaires were used to gain information on more practical aspects of service delivery.  </summary>
