  <interventions>
    <interventions>The programme uses graded exposure therapy with structured sessions of  up to one hour a week with homework tasks for clients to practice during the week leading up to their next session.  Exposure is graded over time from basic black and white images of their particular gambling cues to full exposure to gambling venues and gambling machines.  During exposure tasks clients learn to manage their urge to gamble and overcome their problem gambling.

Generally the programme consists of between 8 and 12 such sessions for face to face therapy with psycho-therapists who have post graduate qualifications in mental health science.  Therapists' backgrounds are usually in mental health nursing, psychology and social work.  In addition to individual face to face outpatient services, the Statewide Gambling Therapy Service (SGTS) also provides a more intensive inpatient service for a limited number of clients who require hospitalisation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Cognitive Therapy arm of the study is structured in the same way as the behavioural arm.  Clients will have 8-12 (depending on clinical need as determined my the treating therapist) sessions of cognitive therapy for an hour each week with tasks to be reviewed by clients in the intervening time.

Treatment will follow the well known and proven cognitive therapy processes outlined by Professor Ladouceur in his manuel 'Overcoming our Pathological Gambling'.  This approach involves teaching clients to challenge their eroneous thoughts about their gambling and provides a workbook of activities that clients work through in conjunction with their treatment sessions.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvements in pathological gambling scores over time...ie 
- Canadian Problem Gambling Index
- Victorian Gambling Screen
- Gambling Urge Scale
- Kestler 10 psychological functioning scale
- work and social adjustment scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>Key timepoints for data collection are...

- baseline: time of recruitment and beginning therapy
- end of therapy
- 3 months following discharge from treatment
- 6 &amp; 12 months following discharge from treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>improvements in quality of life will be measured by the work and social adjustment scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>- begiinning of treatment (baseline)
- end of treatment (discharge)
- 3,6,12 month outcomes following treatment completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>gambling activity (frequency of gambling, amount of money lost) data is collected by the therapist during the treatment and review process.</outcome>
      <timepoint>gambling activity data is collected at the same time points as key outcome measures...ie baseline, end of treatment, 3,6 &amp;12 months following completion of treatment</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The trial will be comprised of two parallel groups with measurements at baseline, end of treatment  and then at 3, 6 and 12 month follow up depending on date of recruitment. To maintain equilibrium with treatment modalities available to the Statewide Gambling Therapy Service (SGTS) clients the trial will use two groups: (1) exposure therapy (ET), and (2) cognitive therapy (CT). Randomisation will be blocked to ensure equal group sizes,
using varying block sizes to protect concealment.
Participants will be offered the alternative therapy to their randomised treatment if they do not experience a
clinically meaningful improvement on outcome measures during treatment and follow-up as determined
jointly by the patient and therapist.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be conducted at arm's length by the Flinders Medical Centre randomisation service and
researchers will be blinded from the allocation process and to the group into which participants will be
randomised. Randomisation will be blocked to ensure equal group sizes using varying block sizes to ensure
concealment in the randomisation process</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The objectives of this pilot randomised controlled trial are to establish high quality recruitment methods,
treatment techniques and manuals, research protocols, data collection methods and preliminary data in
preparation for applications to national (National Health and Medical Research Council and Gambling Research Australia) or international (National Institute for Mental Health
NIMH in the US) funding bodies for phase II and III randomised controlled trials in the field of problem
gambling practice and research. Specifically, we seek to establish high quality treatment methods and
research protocols which will contribute to answering the primary research question:
Among treatment seeking problem gamblers can exposure therapy alone improve gambling related
outcomes for up to 12 months compared with cognitive therapy?</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The nul hypothesis for the study is that there will be no significant difference in the clinical outcomes of cognitive and behavioural therapy approaches to the treatment of pathological gambling (gambling addiction).

Some cost or time efficienciies may emerge from this detailed study fo the outcomes of these two approaches to therapy.</summary>
