  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study involves comparing the efficiency of a non-invasive finger cuff to continuously monitoring haemodynamic states in vascular patients against the current gold standard which involves an invasive arterial line.
The finger cuff device being used is the Edwards Clearsight system. This device is a non-invasive cuff that is placed on the finger tip and inflates around the finger. It is automatic and allows the operator to receive up-to-the-minute haemodynamic information on the patient. It provides blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and stroke volume variation, which are all helpful parameters in predicting fluid responsiveness.
Currently, patients undergoing vascular surgery will always require the need for the invasive arterial line for continuous monitoring, and the clearsight finger cuff will additionally be used for comparision.
The devices will be used throughout the duration of the surgery, which should be at least 90 minutes in duration. It will be operated by the anaesthetist, as well as an operator will come and collect the data at the end of the surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>The current gold standard in continuous haemodynamic monitoring is through the use of an invasive arterial line, which all patients use when undergoing major vascular surgery.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare data similarity for stroke volume variation between non-invasive finger cuff and invasive arterial line. This outcome is assessed by using both systems at the same time on the same participant and collect data at the same intervals. For the non-invasive finger cuff, the Clearsight Edwards system will be used to monitor the data, and the Edwards Flotrac will be used to collect data from the arterial line.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The data is to be collected every 3 minutes for the duration of the surgery from when it starts to its finish, which should be at least 90 minutes in duration.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>We aim to sample 40 participants in this study. There is no gold standard sample size calculation. Bland and Altman, who developed the modern approach to agreement statistics (Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement, Bland JM, Altman DG. (1986). Lancet, i, 307-310.) have calculated sample size for agreement studies by estimating the accuracy to which the limits of agreement are measured.  With a sample size of 40, the limits of agreement can be assessed to 0.48 of a standard deviation of the difference between measurements.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To investigate the effectiveness of the Edwards clearsight non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring in vascular patients compared to the gold standard of invasive intra-arterial monitoring. Both systems will be monitored simultaneously on the same patients, with the parameters of interest being the stroke volume variation, cardiac output, blood pressure and stroke volume.

The study design will be an interventional clinical study. Participants from Princess Alexandra Hospital will be randomly selected from surgeries that include carotid endarterectomy, peripheral artery revascularisation, open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

Participants will be monitored with both the Edwards clearsight system (non-invasive finger cuff) and Edwards Flotrac system (invasive intra-arterial) simultaneously and data for stroke volume variation, blood pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume will be collected from both monitoring systems. These parameters will compared and analysed</summary>
