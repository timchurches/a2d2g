  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Inspiratory muscle training (URES HS730)
Treatment: devices - Sham inspiratory muscle training (URES HS730)

Sham Comparator: Sham inspiratory muscle training - Patients in the sham group used the threshold trainer (Threshold at IMT device URES HS730, Respironics, New Jersey, Inc, Cedar Grove, NJ, USA), with the diaphragm removed.

Experimental: Inspiratory muscle training - Inspiratory muscle training will be by a threshold trainer (Threshold at IMT device URES HS730, Respironics, New Jersey, Inc, Cedar Grove, NJ, USA), a commercially available spring-loaded inspiratory muscle training device. It will be set at 40% of the subjects baseline maximal inspiratory pressure and increased by 10% each week by an unblinded assistant. All subjects were trained with these devices for 8-10 breaths, 3 times a day, everyday for 6 weeks

Treatment: devices: Sham inspiratory muscle training (URES HS730)
Subjects in the control group underwent sham training, using the same device with the diaphragm removed, thus providing no resistance. They were not given frequency or duration but told to use the device when desired.
