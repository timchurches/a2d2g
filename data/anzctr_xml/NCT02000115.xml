    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion:

        High Risk Cohort:

        All candidates for the High Risk Cohort of this study must meet all the following inclusion
        criteria:

          1. Subjects must have co-morbidities such that the surgeon and cardiologist
             Co-Investigators concur that the predicted risk of operative mortality is =15% or a
             minimum STS score of 8%. A candidate who does not meet the STS score criteria of = 8%
             can be included in the study if a peer review by at least two surgeons concludes and
             documents that the patient's predicted risk of operative mortality is =15%. The
             surgeon's assessment of operative comorbidities not captured by the STS score must be
             documented in the study case report form as well as in the patient medical record.

          2. Subject is 21 years of age or older at the time of consent.

          3. Subject has senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis with echocardiographically
             derived criteria: mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg or jet velocity greater than 4.0 m/s or
             Doppler Velocity Index &lt;0.25 and an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of = 1.0 cm2
             (indexed EOA = 0.6 cm2/m2). (Qualifying AVA baseline measurement must be within 60
             days prior to informed consent).

          4. Subject has symptomatic aortic stenosis as demonstrated by NYHA Functional
             Classification of II, III, or IV.

          5. The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and
             has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board
             (IRB) of the respective clinical site.

          6. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all
             required post-procedure follow-up visits.

          7. Subject's aortic annulus is 19-27mm diameter as measured by CT conducted within 12
             months prior to informed consent. Note: if CT is contraindicated and/or not possible
             to be obtained for certain subjects, a 3D echo and non-contrast CT of chest and
             abdomen/pelvis may be accepted if approved by the subject selection committee.

        Extreme Risk Cohort:

        All candidates for the Extreme Risk Cohort of this study must meet # 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of
        the above criteria, and 1. The subject, after formal consults by a cardiologist and two
        cardiovascular surgeons agree that medical factors preclude operation, based on a
        conclusion that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeds the
        probability of meaningful improvement. Specifically, the probability of death or serious,
        irreversible morbidity should exceed 50%. The surgeons' consult notes shall specify the
        medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion and include a printout of the
        calculation of the STS score to additionally identify the risks in these patients.

        All Candidates:

        Additionally, all candidates for the study must meet the following inclusion criteria for
        the TAVR Leaflet Motion Sub-study, until the minimum sub-study sample size has been
        achieved:

        1. Be willing and able to undergo, at both 30-days and 6-months post-implant, a Multi-Slice
        Computed Tomography (MSCT) scan (or TEE, if medically or technically contraindicated for an
        MSCT) of the heart and cardiac structures.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage />
    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
