  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A clinically significant reduction in severity of pain using the verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS). A clinically significant change in the VNRS will be dependent on the baseline VRNS and defined as a change of 2 or greater for baseline score of 0 to 3, greater than 3 for baseline score of 4 to 6, and 5 or greater for baseline score of 7 to 10. This is based on the definition of Bird and Dickson for visual analogue scales.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 hours after the commencement of the trial medication</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resolution of systemic effects in patients presenting with systemic envenoming.  Systemic envenoming is defined as the presence of 3 of the following: nausea, vomiting, headache, lethargy, malaise and abdominal pain. This outcome will be assessed using clinical history and examination.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 hours after the commencement of the trial medication</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrolment will require contacting one of the chief investigators or designated study nurses through a single 1800 phone number diverted to the person on call. The on-call investigator/study nurse will keep a list of all treatment packs/kits at each site. Brief demographic and clinical data will be collected, and after informed consent has been confirmed, the treating doctor will be given the treatment KIT number to be used for the patient based on a randomised list of treatment kits. The list will simply have the study number and the treatment site and not the allocation to active or placebo.

Based on logistical problems in RAVE-I and the potential errors made in selecting the correct treatment pack by the treating doctor/nurse, the allocation to each treatment pack will be done based on the pre-randomised list of all blocks for all study sites that will be kept by the chief investigators and on-call research nurses. When a patient is enrolled, the research nurse or investigator will find the appropriate pack of 4 based on the hospital site and whether the patient has only local pain or systemic envenoming. They will then take the next study code from the pack (packs will be used in sequential order) and this number will be given to the treating doctor/nurse to identify the treatment kit to be used. Allocation of each study code/treatment pack to active or placebo will only be known by the pharmacy at Calvary Mater Newcastle.</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomisation will be used with random block-sizes and include stratification between patients with local and systemic envenoming. Each site will have 2 packs each containing 4 treatment kits, one pack of 4 for patients with pain only and the other for systemic envenoming. The use of random block sizes will mean that each pack of 4 may contain a mixture of blocks making it impossible for the treating clinicians to predict the last kit in each pack.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Redback spider bites are common in Australia and red back spider envenoming (latrodectism) is the commonest significant envenoming in Australia. Redback spider antivenom (RBS AV) is the most frequently used antivenom in Australia. An estimated 5000 redback spider bites are treated with antivenom each year requiring a median of 2 vials of redback spider antivenom and an emergency department or hospital admission. We estimate this costs between $200,000 and $500,000 annually for antivenom and an equivalent amount in hospital costs. Early adverse reactions occur in approximately 4% of cases (40 to 120 patients annually) causing additional risk to the patient and costs to the health care system. Redback antivenom treatment therefore carries a considerable cost and measureable risk. However, despite the wide use of RBS AV and the clinical impression that it is effective, it has never been tested in a placebo randomized controlled trial. The results from our recent randomised controlled trial of intravenous versus intramuscular administration of redback spider antivenom (RAVE I) raise questions about the effectiveness of the antivenom. It is therefore essential to determine whether RBS AV is effective and justifies the costs and risks associated with its use. We propose to determine the effectiveness of RBS AV in a multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial.</summary>
