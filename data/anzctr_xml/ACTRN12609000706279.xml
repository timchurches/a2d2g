  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Nellix AAA System is a catheter based system used to treat aneurysms between the renal and iliac arteries by excluding the aneurysm sac thereby preventing rupture.  The System includes two Nellix Cathters placed into the vascular space via the femoral arteries. The Nellix Implant is positioned below the renal arteries and will terminate in each of the common iliac arteries.  After positioning the Nellix catheters across the aneurysm, the Deployment Balloons are simultaneously inflated to deploy the Endoframe, and then deflated. The in-situ curing Polymer material is injected into the Endobag, thereby expanding the bag to fill the aneurysmal space between the Endoframe and the sac wall and excluding the aneurysm which forms the Implant. The Endoframe/Endobag is then released from the Nellix Catheter and the Catheters are removed from the patient. The average Nellix procedure time is approximately 45 to 60 minutes.</interventions>
