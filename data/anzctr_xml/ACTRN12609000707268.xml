  <interventions>
    <interventions>Peribulbar anaesthesia technique involves firstly anaesthetising the conjunctiva with oxybuprocaine hydrochloride 0.4%w/v drops. The eye and surrounding skin are sterilised with iodine solution. An injection of about 8mls of local anaesthetic solution (8ml 0.75% Ropivicaine, 2ml Xylocaine 10% and Hyalase 10units/ml solution) is given inferotemporal to the eye. Compression is applied on the eye to reduce raised intra-ocular pressure due to the volume of local anaesthetic being introduced. If the block is not adequate a second medial canthal injection can be added to produce an adequate block.

The cataract surgery takes about 45 minutes</interventions>
    <comparator>Sub-Tenon's technique involves first anaesthetising the conjunctiva with oxybuprocaine hydrochloride 0.4%w/v drops. The eye and surrounding skin is sterilised, and an eye speculum is inserted. The patient is asked to look up and out to reveal the inferonasal quadrant of the conjunctiva, blunt forceps are used to lift the conjunctiva and Tenons fascia about 5mm from the limbus, Wescott scissors are used to snip the raised tent of conjunctiva and Tenons fascia to expose the sub-Tenons space. Closed Wescott scissors are passed in to the sub-Tenons space and used to blunt dissect posteriorly past the equator of the eye in to the posterior sub-Tenons space. A blunt cannula is passed in to the posterior sub-Tenons space and about 4-5ml of anaesthetic solution made up of 8ml 0.75% Ropivicaine, 2ml Xylocaine 10% and Hyalase 10units/ml solution is injected. The cannula is removed and the eye is lightly massaged for 2-3mins to aid in anaesthetic spread.

The cataract surgery takes about 45 minutes</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Worst pain over 24hours post surgery as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>VAS measured at immediately post operative, 12 hrs, 24hrs and worst pain over the 24 hour period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Analgesic use over 24 hours post surgery is assessed by asking the patient to keep track of their analgesic use over the 24 hour period and providing this information at the post-operative visit.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently very little evidence comparing pain felt by the patient post operatively between the two most commonly used local anaesthetic blocks for cataract surgery, the peribulbar (pericone) block and the sub-Tenon's (parabulbar) block. We think that the peribulbar block will have a lower pain score and analgesic use over the 24 hour period due to the less invasive nature of providing the anaesthetic.</summary>
