  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention : Cutting seton 
Cutting seton will be placed through the fistula track with the aid of Lockhart-Mummery.  The anoderm overlying the sphincter complex will be scored with diathermy and the vessel loop secured snugly with suture ties.  This duration of this procedure is approximately 45 minutes and will be performed by consultant colorectal surgeon. Patients will be reviewed every 6 weeks, and readmitted for tightening of the seton at a minimum of 6 weekly intervals until completion of treatment. 
Completion of treatment is when the seton has cut through the sphincter . This decision is made by the treating Surgeon.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator treatment: LIFT procedure
An incision is performed in the intersphincteric groove.  The primary fistula tract is dissected out and isolated.  The track is ligated and where possible, a section excised for histopathology.  Where possible, the external track lateral to the sphincter complex is either excised or curetted. The duration of this procedure is approximateley 45 minutes and will be performed by consultant  colorectal surgeon.

    <statisticalmethods>Primary analysis  will be at 3 months and longitudinal analysis will be  6 and 12 months and take into account secondary outcomes and correlated to patients. Repeated measures will be analysed using  ANOVA with mixed modeling principles. Effects  ( fixed and random) will be specified and estimated to identify  which mechanisms and the degree to which they affected outcomes.
Descriptive analysis will be used to calculate mean, median and report 95% confidence intervals. Differences in continuous normally distributed data will be calculated using a t test. Differences in categorical variable will be calculated using Mann Whitney U test and Wilcoxin sign ranks test. Multivariate and univariate analysis will be performed and significance will be set at 0.05.
From current literature, the median rate of primary healing is 71% and 98.5% for LIFT and cutting seton, respectively.  Using Pococks formula comparing two proportions in a randomised clinical trial with a difference of 20%, significance of 0.05 and rate of 30%, the number of patients in each group is determined to be 93.  Allowing for dropouts, the total number to be recruited into the study will be 200 patients.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anal fistula is a common condition. The aims of treatment are fistula healing, prevention of recurrence and maintenance of continence.  Treatment options and their associated risks vary according to the fistula track.  Simple fistulae (intersphincteric or low trans-sphincteric) may be treated successfully with fistulotomy.  Complex fistulae pose a therapeutic challenge and carry a higher risk of treatment failure, altered continence and recurrence. (Joy and Williams 2002) (van okelen, Gosselink et al. 2013) To date, no single intervention simultaneously fulfils all three therapeutic aims.   

The cutting seton has been employed for centuries and involves the use of various materials (including suture, vessel loops etc) to slowly divide through the sphincter and induce fibrosis.  The literature reports recurrence rates in the 3  5 % range (Vial, Pares et al. 2010) .  Reported incontinence rates after cutting seton vary widely from 0 - 63 % (Vial, Pares et al. 2010) (Garcia-Aguilar, Belmonte et al. 1998) (Karri-Pekka, Hamalainen et al. 1997) (Charua-Guindic, Mendez-Moran et al. 2007) (Ritchie, Sackier et al. 2008) , which may be partially attributable to incomplete/inadequate scarring behind the seton when tightened rapidly. 

The ligation of the intersphincteric track (LIFT) procedure was described in 2007 as a sphincter preserving technique for high fistulae. (Rojanasakul, Pattanaarun et al. 2007) Early reports published fistula cure and continence rates in excess of 90% (ref).  Subsequent series have reported success rates ranging from 57% to 82%. (Yassin, Hammond et al. 2013)   The procedure involves identification, dissection and then ligation of the fistula track in the intersphincteric space, thereby eliminating the fistula source from its track and avoiding the need for sphincter division.

Multiple interventions to manage fistulae have been described including sphincter preserving techniques such as fibrin plugs and tissue glue. (Ellis and Clark 2006) (Garg 2009) With the prospect of altered continence as a complication, heterogeneity of fistula anatomy, and the interplay with physiology, studies are limited in their ability to generalise findings and recommend treatments in the form of guidelines.

Aim
To prospectively assess the clinical outcomes of patients with complex fistulae treated by cutting seton and compare these to patients treated by LIFT.
