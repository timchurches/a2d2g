  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>85 % of all VL patients attending the Upazila Health Center are treated with the single dose liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) scheme. Outcome will be calculated using the monthly medical record data and calculating the proportion of subjects diagnosed with VL that were treated with the proposed scheme.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over the period of time required to complete the sample size.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>95% of cure rate using single dose liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) at Upazila Health Center

Cure rate will be calculated using the patient's medical records. Only subjects who according to the protocol fulfill the "final cure" criteria will be included.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after end of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Less than 3% of patients treated with single dose liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) are referred to the district hospital for adverse events management.

Most adverse events expected are drug related such as fever, back pain and myalgias. The severity of an adverse event will be quantified using the Common Toxicity Criteria grading. Patient's medical records will be used to calculate the proportion of patients referred to an upper level hospital for the management of any adverse event.</outcome>
