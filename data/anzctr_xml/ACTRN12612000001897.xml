  <interventions>
    <interventions>patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were given bilateral single injection thoracic paravertebral block at the level of T5 with 25ml of 0.25% bupivacaine. Before induction of general anaesthesia,  Group M (magnesium group) received a loading dose of magnesium sulphate 30 mg per kg in 100 ml of normal saline  over 10 min followed by an infusion of 10 mg per kg per h till the end of surgery. Control group (group C) received the same volume of normal saline as a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>postoperative fentanyl consumption. 
In PACU and surgical ward, pain intensity was assessed by nurses who  were blinded to the treatment group using a VAS at rest (VAS-R) and after movement {coughing or changing sides on the first postoperative day and walking on the second postoperative day}(VAS-M). The first analgesic medication was administered when the VAS-R exceeds 3 cm.  Intravenous fentanyl 25 microgram at 10 min interval was titrated until the VAS decreased to less than 3 cm at which time, fentanyl consumption was recorded and the patients had access to a PCA device. This device was set to deliver fentanyl 10 microgram as an i.v bolus with a lockout interval of 10 min, without background infusion. Patients were advised to push the analgesic-demand button when they felt pain, and to repeat till pain relief. This PCA regimen was discontinued when no longer needed and replaced by oral analgesics. Cumulative doses of fentanyl given by PCA were recorded at 12, 24 and 36 h postoperatively.</outcome>

      <outcome>The presence of nausea and vomiting. 
The presence of nausea and vomiting was noted using a four-point scale (0=no nausea or vomiting, 1=mild nausea, 2=severe nausea, 3=retching or vomiting). Patients with a nausea score of 2 or 3 were initially given an i.v. bolus of metoclopramide 10 mg followed by ondansteron 4 mg if this was unsuccessful.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Magnesium has antinociceptive effects. This study was designed to examine whether intraoperative administration of i.v magnesium with bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) enhances postoperative analgesia while reducing opioid consumption and opioid-related side effects.

Methods: In this prospective randomized, double-blinded, controlled study, 59 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were given bilateral single injection PVB at the level of T5. Before induction of general anaesthesia, patients were assigned to two groups. Group M (magnesium group) received a loading dose of magnesium sulphate 30 mg per kg in 100 ml of normal saline  over 10 min followed by an infusion of 10 mg per kgper h till the end of surgery. Control group (group C) received the same volume of normal saline as a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion.  In both groups, postoperative pain was initially controlled by i.v. fentanyl titration and then fentanyl PCA. Cumulative PCA fentanyl consumption, pain intensities, sedation scores, cardiovascular and respiratory variables and opioid-related adverse effects were recorded for 36 h after operation.</summary>
