  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose is to investigate whether a simple additional treatment applied during
      colonoscopy (called 'soft' coagulation) can reduce the risk of recurrence of polyp at the
      area where the polyp was removed. After a large polyp is removed it is known that there is a
      20% chance that a small recurrence of polyp occurs at the site of removal can occur within 5
      months of the polyp being removed. This in theory will burn off tiny polyp tissue, which is
      usually not visible to the naked eye. This additional treatment may possibly reduce the risk
      of polyp recurrence.</summary>
