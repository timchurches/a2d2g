  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise intervention. Professional Yoga and Tai Chi trainers delivered modified Yoga and Tai Chi to participating  residents of an aged care facility in half hour sessions, twice a week for fourteen weeks. There were two parallel intervention groups: a Yoga group and a Tai Chi group.

The yoga program included limbering movements, asanas, breathing practices and a type of relaxation meditation called 'yoga nidra'. 

The tai chi program comprised slow, controlled and circular movements that used functional patterns and engaged the mind. 

Both Yoga and Tai Chi were modified to suit the individual participant.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual activities offered in residential care facility. The facility offered all residents a ' Staying Active' program that included:
1. weekly half hour seated exercise sessions called Physical culture.
2. gym with bikes, pulleys and massage by a trained staff
3. Games and group activities ( eg. Bingo, group reading, story telling)</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aims of the study are to:
1. Determine the feasibility of conducting a 14- week Tai Chi or Yoga program in a residential care setting. 
2. Observe and record the modified Tai Chi and Yoga approaches used for older people with different levels of balance ability
3. Determine the feasibility of detecting changes in balance, pain experience, quality of life and incidence of falls in older residents who follow the Yoga/ Tai Chi programs compared to those who receive usual care.</summary>
