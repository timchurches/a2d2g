  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the bioequivalence of new formulation of bevacizumab called
      CBT124 and safety when compared to two already marketed formulations, one approved in US and
      other in EU of Avastin(Registered Trademark). Adult healthy male aged 18 to 50 years (both
      inclusive) can participate in this trial.

      Participants will be randomised (allocated by chance) to either a test formulation or one of
      the two marketed formulations of bevacizumab. Drugs will be administered intravenously once
      only. The study will compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) (the levels of
      drug in the blood), pharmacodynamics (PD) (what the drug does to the body) and immunogenicity
      (body's immune response) of the 3 drugs. In order to measure this, blood samples will be
      collected at various points after treatment has been given.</summary>
