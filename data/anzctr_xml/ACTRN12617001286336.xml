  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1 (intervention): routine exit site cleaning + topical acetic acid
Group 2(control group - standard care): routine exit site cleaning + topical mupirocin 

Routine exit site (ES) cleaning involves: Cleaning ES in the shower with a packet of sterile gauze with antibacterial soap and water, drying the ES after the shower with sterile gauze then sunning ES for 10 minutes where possible. 
Topical mupirocin involves: application of small amount (approx.. 1/4 pea size) of Mupirocin ointment 2% with cotton tip, after cleaning and sunning of ES (as described above).
Topical acetic acid involves: application of sterile gauze soaked with 2% acetic acid (approximately 5ml) for 10 minutes contact time to the ES after cleaning and sunning of ES as above.

Exit site cares (including the intervention and control treatment) are performed daily in the morning and for the duration of the trial (12 months). Exit site cares are administered by the patient.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to first exit site infection.

The exit site will be visually inspected by nursing staff at each clinical visit every 8-12 weeks. Patients will also have written instructions to inspect the exit site and alert nursing staff if there are signs of infection (as per normal existing clinical practice). Exit site infection will be defined by increased redness, tenderness and or discharge from the exit  site with a positive culture on swab.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 12 months of intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rates of exit site infection expressed as episodes per patient year (a usual metric and performance indicator which is monitored and calculated routinely).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Rates of exit site infection are calculated per 12 patient months and the rate for the 12 months of intervention will be compared to the historical average and other metrics.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trial feasibility aspects:
1) Tolerability of acetic acid; qualitative and by recording and assessing adverse events - patient reported skin reactions &amp; clinical examination of exit site for evidence of skin reactions - erythema, blistering etc.
2) Feasibility of application procedure, assessed by observation of participants application procedure at routine clinical follow up.
3) Assessment of follow up procedure - are routine clinical follow up timeframes sufficient to catch the clinical outcomes (and any problems with acetic acid application or reactions)? ie: if exit site infections occur at times between the scheduled follow up appointments are they being reported by patients - or presenting as emergency cases to hospital or being unreported? Is more regular follow up needed to re-educate about correct application procedure? This will be mostly a qualitative outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 12 months of intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to exit site infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which will be defined by clinical evidence of an exit site infection with a positive culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a feasibility study and will aim to recruit all available patients in the service.
Exit site statistics, expressed as episodes per patient year will be separately calculated for each arm of the study. These will be compared with each other and also with previous years statistics for the whole unit. Time to exit site infection and time to Pseudomonas aeruginosa exit site infection will be compared using KaplanMeier estimators and the log-rank statistic, and Hazard rates for the outcomes will be compared using Cox models.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PD catheter ESI is a major predisposing factor to PD peritonitis and resultant catheter and modality failure. The two most frequent causative organisms of ESI are Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Daily topical application of an antibiotic cream such as mupirocin is the standard of care, however this agent is not anti-pseudomonal and may promote antibiotic resistance.
Acetic acid at low concentrations is non=toxic to humans and non-irritant, but has broad antimicrobial activity including against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and may therefore offer a cheap and effective alternative. It has a long history in chronic wound care for this purpose. In this trial we will investigate the feasibility of the use of daily acetic acid dressings to reduce exit site infection, in comparison to the use of standard mupirocin treatment.</summary>
