  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Tapes applied to wound immediately after surgery and for 12 weeks therafter.  Patients are required to change tapes once per week or sooner if they become loose or soiled.  We are using 10mm x100mm  "leukostrips" which are manufactured by Smith &amp; Nephew</interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Width and general appaerance of scar (measured by a blinded assessor)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months following surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with appaerance of scar.  The Likert scale will be used</outcome>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All eligible patients requiring surgery to the torso informed of study during consultation prior to surgery appointment.  Informed consent signed by those wishing to partake in study.  Sequentially numbered (corresponding to participant study number)sealed opaque envelopes containing details of intervention or control group allocation only opened after the surgery has been completed.  Thus the doctor and staff are all blinded to patient study group until after surgical intervention completed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computer generated  random sequence of study group allocation done in blocks of six. Details of study group allocation sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes within the Department of General Practice, University of Queensland prior to patient recruitment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Several studies have shown that scars on the torso look worse than elsewhere and lead to poor subjective scar satisfaction. We hypothesise that using tapes applied perpendicular across wounds on the torso immediately following surgery and continued for several weeks will result in better looking scars and increased patient satisfaction with the scar.</summary>
