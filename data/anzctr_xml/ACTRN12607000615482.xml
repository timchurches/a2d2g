    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Upon completing and returning the initial self assessment, subjects are assigned as follows: The data entry operator requests the next assignment from a table of assignment codes (see below) corresponding to the sex of the subject. By entering the subject's unique ID code, that assignment is exhausted and will not reappear.</concealment>
    <sequence>Two tables of group assignments were generated by randomising the order of blocks of assignment codes. One table were thus randomised for each sex, totalling twice the number of assignments planned for recruitment.</sequence>

    <assignment>Other</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The wait list control subjects begin the intervention after waiting the length of time required to complete the intervention (three months).</designfeatures>
