  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to compare the efficacy of two different fitness exercise
      programmes on improving fitness and psychosocial functioning in a traumatic brain injured
      population. We hypothesize that a supervised fitness-centre based exercise programme,
      compared to an unsupervised home-based exercise programme will show significant improvements
      in cardiorespiratory fitness, depression and community integration.</summary>
