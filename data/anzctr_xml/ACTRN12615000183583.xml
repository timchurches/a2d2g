  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised into one of three conditions which are outlined below:

Arm 1: Fruit and Vegetable (FV) intervention group. Participants assigned to this condition will be given three additional servings of fruit and vegetables to consume daily for two weeks. The fruits and vegetables provided will vary depending on what is seasonal, commonly available and what will remain freshest for longest (e.g., carrots, kiwifruit, apples).

Arm 2: Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI). Participants assigned to this group will be given a challenge to increase their FV consumption, which will be aided by daily text-messages for two weeks. These messages will provide information, prompts, and suggestions for ways to improve their FV consumption in real-time. 

Arm 3: Control group. Participants assigned to this group are encouraged to maintain their usual routine; however, will be asked to consume one piece of sugar free gum each day (to ensure that all participants are required to engage in the study each day). 

Monitoring adherence: while the proposed study is heavily reliant on self report, adherence will be promoted by stressing the importance of honest and accurate reporting over reporting 'socially desirable' behaviour. Furthermore, the blood analysis for vitamins and carotenoids may provide some information about the current state of healthy eating. Participants will be informed that the inclusion of blood samples will allow insight into their general health, including healthy vs. unhealthy consumption. This provides a means of promoting accurate FV reporting based on social psychological principles (which show greater honesty in reporting when their reports can be checked against an objective marker).

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size of 150 participants (50 in each condition) will provide 93% power to detect a one serving difference in FV consumption between the experimental and control groups (at p&lt; .05) and 85% power to determine a .3 standard deviation difference in mental health scores between groups (at p&lt; .05). 

ANCOVA analyses will test for group differences between both the intervention groups and the control group on: pre- and post-test changes in mental health, average daily differences in vitality and mood; average daily differences in FV consumption controlling for covariates including (but not limited to) gender, BMI, and exercise.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study is a brief two week intervention (randomised control trial, RCT) to test the influence of fruit and vegetable consumption on short term changes in mental health in a healthy, young adult population with low fruit and vegetable consumption. A total of 150 participants aged 18-25 will be randomised into three groups: an increased fruit and vegetable group (to be given an additional 3 servings of fruit and vegetables per day for two weeks); a reminder group (to receive nutritional information and mobile text message reminders to eat more fruit and vegetables for two weeks); and a no-intervention control group. A range of mental health measures (depression, anxiety, and mood) will be measured before, during, and after the intervention, and compared between groups. All participants will complete daily assessments of mood and food consumption using their mobile phones. Additionally, a blood sample will be taken before and after the intervention for analysis of biomarkers of fruit and vegetable consumption; specifically, vitamin C and serum carotenoids.</summary>
