  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Observational cohort

Observational cohort - Ultrasound measurement of quadriceps muscle size and echogenicity will be obtained at baseline (within 48 hours of ECMO commencement), 10 days and 20 days after baseline measurement.
Measures of muscle strength and highest mobility level will be obtained at day 10 and day 20 after baseline measurement in order to determine the relationship between these volitional measures and the ultrasound parameters.


Other interventions: Observational cohort
Ultrasound assessment of quadriceps, muscle strength testing, highest mobility level

          -  A cognitive impairment prior to the acute illness that is associated with admission to

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the changes in quadriceps muscle size and quality
      over the first 10 days on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) using ultrasound
      imaging. This study will also examine the relationship between those changes and muscle
      strength and level of physical function at day 10 and day 20 after ECMO commencement.</summary>
