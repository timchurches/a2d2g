  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will look at the body composition, bone health, quality of life, physical activity and dietary intake of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) and determine whether the use of a nutritional screening tool is indicative of nutritional status and body composition. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 5 and 25 years, were treated at the Royal Childrens Hospital for cancer and are at least 2 years post active treatment. Study details All participants will undergo body composition and bone health examinations using techniques such as total body potassium counting, air displacement plethysmography, and dual x-ray absorptiometry. Participants will also complete questionnaires on quality of life, physical activity and dietary intake. Only one visit of approximately 1.5 hours will be required to undertake the measurement. The proposed research project will ultimately allow childhood cancer survivors to have the best chance of nutritional health, growth, quality of life and optimal health in the long term. This work has immediate clinical relevance, with expected outcomes to guide clinical practice.
