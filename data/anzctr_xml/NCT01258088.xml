             in the Investigator's Brochure.

          -  Any clinically significant central nervous system (e.g., seizures), cardiac,
             pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic or gastrointestinal conditions or history of such
             conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator may place the subject at an
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  Abnormal physical findings of clinical significance at the Screening examination or
             Baseline which would interfere with the objectives of the study.

          -  History of orthostatic hypotension (an increase in HR =20 bpm accompanied by a =20 mm
             Hg drop in SBP and/or =10 mm Hg drop in DBP) present at Screening.

             allergic rhinitis).

          -  12-lead ECG obtained at Screening with: PR &gt;240 msec, QRS &gt;110 msec and QTc &gt;450 msec,
             bradycardia (&lt;50 bpm) or clinically significant minor ST wave changes on the Screening
             ECG, or any other changes on the Screening ECG that would interfere with measurement
             of the QT interval.

          -  Major surgical interventions within 6 months of the study.

          -  Has a positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen; positive Hepatitis C (HCV)
             antibody or detectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA); or positive HIV antibody result.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamin supplements, herbal
             and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to
             the first dose of study medication, or use of St. John's Wort within 28 days prior to
             the first dose of study medication. However, the Investigator and study team can
             review medication use on a case by case basis to determine if its use would compromise
             subject safety or interfere with study procedures or data interpretation. By
             exception, the subject may take paracetamol or acetaminophen (=2 g/day) or ibuprofen

             study.

             to enrollment or concurrently during the study.

          -  Use of topical treatments that have a known beneficial effect on psoriasis, including
             but not limited to corticosteroids, retinoids, vitamin D derivatives, tar or
             anthralin, within the past two weeks prior to enrollment or concurrently during the
             study.

          -  Systemic medications for other medical conditions that are known to affect psoriasis
