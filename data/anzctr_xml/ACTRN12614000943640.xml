  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves the use of chewing gum (Xylitol, Epic Dental LLC peppermint flavour) to reduce thirst in patients with CHF. Consenting subjects will be randomised to each study arms. Study participants allocated to the chewing gum will be instructed to chew sugar free Xylitol, Epic Dental LLC peppermint flavour gum gently, for at least 10 minutes, six times a day and as desired throughout the day when the mouth feels dry or when they are thirsty.  Participants in the no chewing gum group will instructed to continue with what they normally use to relieve their thirst. 
Participants will continue the use of chewing gum for 2 weeks as part of the study protocol. After the 2 week intervention if subjects perceive there has been benefit in the use of chewing gum and the patient wishes to continue using the gum, they are allowed to do so. 
Monitoring of adherence to the intervention is performed through self- reporting. At the end of the trial participants will be asked to report their adherence to the intervention and if they are continuing to use the chewing gum. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be identified through inpatient lists and outpatient clinic lists by the trial co-ordinator. The trial co-ordinator will also approach the patients and invite them to participate in the study. Patients will be given the opportunity to read the information and consent form. Prior to randomisation, baseline data (includes demographic profile, clinical status, comorbidities, results of their physical examination, level of thirst and quality of life) for each participant will be taken and recorded in the appropriate case report forms. If the patient meets the eligibility criteria, they are then randomised to either study arm 1: chewing gum (intervention group) or study arm 2: no chewing gum (control group) using block randomisation and computer generated numbers. Allocation involves contacting the Research Administrative Coordinator at the Centre for Cardiovascular &amp; Chronic Care of the allocation schedule which is "offsite". </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization of participants will be performed through the Research Administrative Coordinator at the Centre for Cardiovascular &amp; Chronic Care using a block randomisation and computer generated random numbers. The investigators will not have access to the randomisation schedule. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on previous assessment of thirst by Philipson et al, we estimate the baseline level of thirst to be 5 and the standard deviation to be 2. To detect a 1 point difference in the level of thirst with a standard deviation of 2 points, we estimated a sample size of 65 per group is needed with a 2 sided 5% significance level and 81% power. When taking into account a loss to follow-up of 10% per group, 144 participants (72 per group) are required to be enrolled in the study.

Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis and correlations to document the distribution, central tendency and dispersion as well as the associations between outcomes on study questionnaires and clinical variables. Multivariate analysis will be undertaken to determine the contribution of clinical and non-clinical factors to clinical outcomes where appropriate. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic heart failure is a progressive and burdensome syndrome with thirst as a major reason for non-compliance to self- care practices such as fluid restriction. Due to the life threatening effects of non- compliance to fluid restricted therapy, evidence based interventions are needed to manage thirst. Systematic evaluation of available strategies such as chewing gum is essential in ensuring that the best possible management is provided to CHF patients. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that chewing gum can reduce thirst in people with chronic heart failure. </summary>
