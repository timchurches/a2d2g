  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.The patients with laryngeal cancer and ended treatment at least 6 months will be recruited (use the methods of self evaluation and telephone follow-up )in our research,and they need to fill in The Chinese versions of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Head and Neck Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTCQLQ-H&amp;N35)and Voice Handicap Index(VHI). We also collecting general information and medical record so that we can analyse the effective factor and predict patient quality of life .We will stop recruiting until collect enough cases (expected to be 200 cases).
2.Comparing the QOL of patients through different treatment (e.g.partial laryngectomy, irradiation as primary therapy, laryngectomy, laryngectomy and radiotherapy ) then , discuss the pros and cons of every treatment methods aimed to help doctors find out the most suitable one considering the characteristics of different patients.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>QOL of patients after total laryngectomy and with radiotherapy will be measured using the global EORTC QLQ-C30 and the head- and neck-specific EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35.

The general EORTC QLQ-C30: consists of 30 questions and incorporates five functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status, and a number of single items assessing additional symptoms. 
The head and neck specific module EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 :consisting of 35 further questions divided into seven multiple-item symptom scales assessing pain, swallowing, senses (taste and smell), speech, social eating, social contact and sexual-ity and six symptom items (teeth problems, trismus, dry mouth,sticky saliva, cough, and feeling ill).</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year after ended treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&amp;N35 filled by patients after all kinds of partial laryngectomy . Then we analysis what kind of operation to get higher QOL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at 6 months after ended treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Voice ability of postoperative laryngeal cancer patients accessed by Voice Handicap Index(VHI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after ended treatment</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effect of radiotherapy on patients, accessed by symptom scales of EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Radiotherapy after more than six months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes of QOL in patients wich different length of postoperative period (&lt;1year, 1-2year , 3-5year, &gt;5year)</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after ended treatment</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are many therapies for Laryngeal cancer, such as laryngectomy, irradiation as primary therapy, laryngectomy, laryngectomy and radiotherapy, the choice of treatment between them is being influenced increasingly by the expected voice quality and quality of life (QoL).This study we use three validated questionnaires: Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Head and Neck Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTCQLQ-H&amp;N35)and Voice Handicap Index(VHI).for evaluated patients QOL after surgery or radiotherapy treatments.</summary>
