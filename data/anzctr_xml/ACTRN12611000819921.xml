  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is an extension study which recruits patients that formerly took place in the MITCH Metal Ions Study which followed patients for 2 years after their hip surgery by looking at blood metal ion concentrations, quality of life, hip functionality/pain.  

The ACTR Number for the MITCH Metal Ions Study is ACTRN12608000193370.  This study took patients that required a total hip replacement, or just hip re-surfacing and used either the MITCH modular system or MITCH resurfacing system respectively.  Both used 'metal-on-metal' components.  The study aimed to analysed chrome and cobalt blood chemistry and compare the results to activity levels.  The patients were followed at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post-operatively.  At each visit the patient had a blood test, an X-ray and completed 3 x questionnaires relating to health, function of hip and quality of life.

This extension study aims to continue following these patients at 3 and 5 years after their original surgery.  This is an observational study which is both retrospective and prospective.  The retrospective data will come from the aforementioned MITCH Metal Ions Study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to analyse the serum metal ions for the MITCH system throughout the steady state phase after surgery. This study extends the current MITCH Metal Ions Study from an endpoint of 2 years to a longer post-operative time point of 5 years. The results will be used as a direct comparison to other research completed for hip resurfacing components on the Australian Market. This study also forms part of the post-market surveillance activities of the Sponsor.</summary>
