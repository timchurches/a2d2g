  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Victorian WorkCover Authority (VWA) is an injury compensation system in the state of Victoria, Australia which provides financial, as well as health and related support, to Victorian workers who have sustained an occupational injury. On April 14th 2014, VWA introduced a compensation claims process change for approval of selected elective surgical procedures. Following this policy change, injured workers' selected elective surgical procedure requests were automatically approved. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control participants will be defined as injured workers within the compensation scheme in the state of Victoria, Australia who have undergone a key elective surgical procedure BEFORE the introduction of the compensation claims process change (i.e., January 1st 2014-April 13th 2014).

Prior to April 14th 2014, elective surgical procedures required prior approval by VWA Claims Agents. As part of this approval process, VWA Claims Agents contacted the injured workers' doctor or healthcare provider for information about the injured workers' progress and treatment plan. In some cases, the VWA Claims Agent also asked the injured worker to attend one or more independent medical examinations by a VWA appointed independent medical practitioner for their independent medical opinion.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Injured workers will be identified within a workers' compensation scheme within the state of Victoria, Australia who have undergone selected elective surgical procedures BEFORE and AFTER the introduction of a compensation claims process change (1st January 2014-13th April 2014; 14th April 2014-31st July 2014, respectively).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Victorian WorkCover Authority (VWA) is an injury compensation system in the state of Victoria, Australia which provides financial, as well as health and related support, to Victorian workers who have sustained an occupational injury. In 2014, VWA  introduced a compensation claims process change for key elective surgical procedures. The aim of the proposed research is to determine whether the compensation claims process change improved injured workers' perception of the service quality of the compensation claims process, as well as whether the compensation claims process change reduced injured workers' time away from work and compensation claims costs, and improved injured workers' ratings of health-related quality of life. </summary>
