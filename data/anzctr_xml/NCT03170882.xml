      <outcome>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire- Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Physical Domain Score - The EORTC QLQ-C30 physical domain consists of 5 items covering participant's daily physical activities. The total score reported is between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating better functioning.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to 7 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HRQOL based on EORTC QLQ-C30 Total Score - The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. Most of the 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.</outcome>

Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale. For the future perspective scale, higher score = better perspective of the future. For the body image scale, higher scores = better body image. Higher score for the disease symptoms scale = higher level of symptomatology.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HRQOL based on 5-level Classification System of the EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Score - The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 domains: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each rated on 5 levels. 1 = no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, 5 = extremely severe problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm, vertical, visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The scores from all dimensions are combined into a single index score that is reported.</outcome>
