    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Venetoclax
Treatment: drugs - ABBV-838
Treatment: drugs - Dexamethasone

Experimental: Arm A Venetoclax QD + ABBV-838 Q3W + Dexamethasone - ABBV-838 administered at cohort-defined doses every 3 weeks (Q3W; starting dose 4.0 mg/kg) in combination with venetoclax (400 mg or 800 mg once daily [QD]) and dexamethasone (40 mg once weekly [Q1W]); once the maximum-tolerated-dose (MTD) and recommended phase two dose (RPTD) are determined, ABBV-838 in combination with venetoclax and dexamethasone at RPTD will be administered in a dose expansion phase of the study.

Experimental: Arm B Venetoclax QD + ABBV-838 Q1W or Q2W + Dexamethasone Q1W - Dose escalation portion will investigate either the ABBV-838 weekly (Q1W) or bi-weekly (Q2W) dosing interval in combination with venetoclax (400 or 800 mg QD) and dexamethasone (40 mg Q1W).
The dose expansion portion will investigate either the ABBV-838 weekly (Q1W) or bi-weekly (Q2W) dosing interval in combination with venetoclax and dexamethasone at the RPTD combination defined from the Dose Escalation portion.

    <summary>This is an open-label, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and
      potential efficacy of venetoclax and ABBV-838 combination therapy with dexamethasone in
      participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received 2 or more
      prior lines of therapy for multiple myeloma (MM). The study will consist of 2 arms: Arm A and
      Arm B (if applicable). Each arm will have a dose escalation and dose expansion portion.</summary>
