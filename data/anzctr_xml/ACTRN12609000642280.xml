  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the impact of TPF chemotherapy (combined Taxotere, Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil) on squamous cell (skin) cancer of the head and neck as measured by the oxygen levels in the tumour. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have locally advanced or locally recurring squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity or laryngeal region, which has not been previously treated. 

Trial details 
Participants will all receive treatment with TPF (combined Taxotere, Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil) chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation which is the standard treatment for locally advanced or locally recurrent head and neck cancer. The study aims to test whether chemotherapy with TPF gets rid of low oxygen levels in tumours as detected by FAZA PET imaging uptake (a way to measure oxygen levels in the tumour) prior to chemoradiation. FAZA uptake is measured prior to treatment and again after 3 cycles of TPF. The response rate to chemotherapy will also be assessed with a CT scan before and after chemotherapy and the response to chemoradiation will be determined by a FDG PET scan at the completion of treatment. The response to treatment will be correlated with the level of hypoxia in the tumour.</summary>
