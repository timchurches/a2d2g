    <interventions>Ultrasound with nerve stimulator for infraclavicular brachial plexus block in children undergoing elective upper extremity orthopedic surgery, intervention arm is the injured arm and did not apply anything to healty arm
Lateral sagittal infraclavicular brachial plexus block with neurostimulator was applied to injured arm at a dose of 0.5 mg per kg levobupivacaine after general anesthesia induction and before surgery starts. The stimulator was initially adjusted to the parameters of 1.0 mA, 2 Hz, 0.1 ms. The insertion was performed with the sagittal plane in an anteroposterior manner at a 3045 degrees angle from the intervention point to the ground where the patient was lying.  When twitching response was obtained from one of the nerves , the current was reduced to 0.5 mA and this was considered to be an indicator of successful localization of nerve. 
To perform the ultrasound for the nerve block, a General Electric (GE) LOGIQ e model Linear Multifrequency 12L probe (GE Medical Systems, Phoenix-USA) was used. Multistimpleks (Pajunk, Germany) was used as nerve stimulator, and a custom needle specific to plexus anesthesia, Stimupleks A (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Japan) 21G, 50 mm was used as the needle. The USG probe was placed in the sagittal plane 1 cm under the conjunction of the clavicle and coracoid process. After the axillary artery and cords were identified, the stimulation needle was advanced (with the in-plane technique) to be in the same plane as the USG probe.</interventions>
    <comparator>An infraclavicular brachial plexus nerve block was performed at a dose of 0.5 ml/kg of 0.5% levobupivacaine in Group 1 with USG, Group 2 with USG plus neurostimulator, and Group 3 with only neurostimulator.  Standart treatment (0.5 ml/kg of 0.5% levobupivacaine) is used in 3 groups. </comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>87 pediatric trauma patients were scheduled for surgery in pediatric ortophedics within the study time period. 7 patients did not accept regional anesthesia, 3 patient had a risk of neurologic deficit after surgery, 2 patient had mental retardation and 3 patient had  history of shoulder surgery on nerve block side so 15 patients excluded from study. Others were randomly split into double blind 3 groups of 24 patients. 
All values are expressed as mean +/- SD. The SPSS 7.0 program was used for statistical analyses. Differences in height, weight, block time, needle depth, and sensorial and motor block duration were evaluated using an independent t test. The Mann-Whitney U test and chi-squared tests were used to evaluate intergroup differences in VPS and motor and sensorial block durations. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant.   Post hoc analysis was used for group participant numbers. Power was calculated as: %83</statisticalmethods>
