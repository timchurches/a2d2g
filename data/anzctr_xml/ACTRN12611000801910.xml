  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraperitoneal administration (injection into the abdomen) of a drug called bevacizumab in patients with ascites due to advanced chemotherapy resistant gynaecological cancers. Who is it for? You may be eligible join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or more and have symptomatic ascites due to chemotherapy resistant gynaecological cancer. You must have required at least one therapeutic ascitic draining in the 4 weeks prior to study registration. Trial details All participants in this trial will undergo therapeutic draining of malignant ascites as per local institutional protocol. This will then be followed by intraperitoneal administration (injection into the abdomen) of the drug bevacizumab at a dose of 5mg/kg. This treatment may be repeated while on study. Participants will be assessed to determine whether this treatment can reduce the formation of ascites and delay the time to re-accumulation of ascitic fluid. The duration of participation will up to three months after the initial on-study ascitic drainage and bevacizumab infusion. </summary>
