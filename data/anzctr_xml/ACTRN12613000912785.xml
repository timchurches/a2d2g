  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will take part in a 16-week three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT). Apart from a healthy eating control group, there are two arms involving intervention, including the dietary group and the supplement group. All the participants in the RCT will have different mobile phone app(s) installed in their phones, according to which group they are randomly allocated to.

Participants in the intervention group will receive a mobile phone app with an online component that contains fact sheets and quizzes about dietary iron and zinc, and encourages dietary habits that may maximise iron and zinc absorption through a goal system. The goal system encourages participants to 1) eat two iron-fortified products each day, 2) eat 50 mg of vitamin C with meals, 3) use a point system where foods are assigned points depending on iron content, consume at least 12 points per day, and 4) drink coffee/tea away from meals.

Participants in the supplement group will be provided a supplement of 65.7 mg elemental iron daily for the duration for the 16 weeks of the study. The supplement will be taken orally as a film coated tablet. The participants will receive regular reminders of iron supplement intake and dietary advice for a "healthy diet" through mobile phone apps. There will be two apps involved for the supplement group. One app has an online component and contains fact sheets, reminder and a goal system encouraging participants to: 1) limit intake of saturated fat, 2) choose wholegrain foods, 3) reduce sodium intake, and 4) aim to eat 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables daily. The second app is the publically available FoodSwitch app developed by Bupa and the George Institute which participants are encouraged to use when shopping for food.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive dietary advice for a "healthy diet" through mobile phone applications, which are the same ones used in the supplement group without the supplement intake reminders.

Participants in all study arms will be asked not to consume supplements other than those provided in the study for the participants in the supplement group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in iron status (as assessed by changes in serum ferritin, haemoglobin and serum transferrin receptor).
Measurements of iron status will be serum ferritin, haemoglobin, and serum transferrin receptor and will be conducted by a local pathology laboratory (Dorevitch Pathology).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (week 0), week 12 and week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in zinc status (as assessed by serum zinc) in response to dietary change. Serum zinc concentrations will be determined by Professor Rosalind Gibsons laboratory, University of Otago; samples will be collected as the same samples for iron status analysis, and will be processed, stored and analysed in accordance with the IZiNCG procedures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (week 0), week 12 and week 16.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in measures of cognition in both/either the intervention groups. Cognition will be measured using Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), Verbal Memory and Learning California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), and CogState, a computer-based cognitive assessment system consisting a battery of cognitive tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (week 0), week 12 and week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in mood (depression and anxiety) in both/either the intervention groups. Mood will be measured by using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in fatigue (fatigue severity and impact, sleep quality) in both/either the intervention groups. Fatigue severity and impact will be determined using The Fatigue Severity Scale and the Daily Fatigue Impact Scale, respectively.

A fasting blood test will be used to determine whether participants have serum ferritin less than 20 micrograms/L and haemoglobin equal to or greater than 120 g/L.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint of the RCT is the change in the natural logarithm of serum ferritin (micrograms/L) over the duration of the 16-week intervention period.  A logarithmic transformation of the serum ferritin measurements is required to uncouple the variance-mean relationship in these measurements; variance-mean relationships are evident in the reports of Bruner and Joffe (Lancet, 348(9033): 992-; 1996), Heath et al (Journal of the American College of Nutrition, 20(5): 477-484; 2001) and Patterson et al (Journal of the American College of Nutrition, 20(4): 337-342; 2001). According to the listed studies, combined with statistical analysis on the between-subject variance, predictive power, a sample size of 91 participants is suggested. Thus the target sample size is set as 95.
The statistical package SPSS version 17.0 will be used for all data analysis. 
The mean, SD and range of iron and zinc will be calculated for the participants as a whole and across age groups. The dietary record and food frequency questionnaire will be used to determine bioavailable iron and zinc intake from the different food groups and any inhibitors that affect absorption.
Cognitive results will also be analysed using the mean, SD and range from the participants as a whole and across age groups.
Regression analysis will be utilised to examine whether there is a significant relationship between iron and zinc intake and in blood samples, and whether improvements in iron and zinc status positively affects mood, levels of fatigue and concentration.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Premenopausal women are at increased risk of iron deficiency due to iron losses in menstrual blood and increased requirements during pregnancy. Additionally, inadequate consumption of dietary iron or over-consumption of compounds that impede absorption of iron (e.g. phytate) can result in iron requirements not being met. In addition, women who have a low dietary intake of iron and a low iron level are frequently at risk of a low intake of zinc. Rich dietary sources of iron also tend to be rich sources of zinc. Currently very little is known about the zinc status of Australian women.

The aim of this study is to investigate the use of technology to improve iron status, by determining if the dietary advice delivered by the mobile apps can 1) increases intake of bioavailable iron and zinc compared to a control "healthy diet" group; and 2) results in a significant improvement in iron and zinc status and markers of cognition, mood and fatigue compared with a control "healthy diet" group.

We hypothesise that:
The use of a mobile phone app to optimise intakes of bioavailable iron and zinc over a 16-week period in premenopausal women with low serum ferritin will result in:
a) higher dietary intake of bioavailable iron and zinc; 
b) a greater improvement in iron status; 
c) a greater improvement in cognition, mood (including indicators of depression and anxiety), fatigue and sleep compared to a control "healthy diet" group.</summary>
