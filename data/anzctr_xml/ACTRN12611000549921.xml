  <interventions>
    <interventions>patients will undergo primovist MRI as part of their work up for presentation with colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM)

most patietns will undergo one MRI but may have a second if they need neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then restaging for possible surgery.

MRI usually takes about 30 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>patients will undergo Angio CT which is usual practice in the work up for CRCLM

as with MRI patients will undergo angio CT on more than one occassion if tehy need restaging after chemotherapy. this is our standard practice and not done differently in this study.

the angio CT takes about 4 hours. 15 minutes for catherter placement, 15 minutes for scanning, and 4 hours llying flat after catheter is removed from groin.

it is hoped angio CT and MRI will be done on the same day or within one day of each other.</comparator>

      <outcome>assessing accuracy of primovist MRI compared to angio CT.

both tests will be reported by 2 radiologists blinded to results of the other imaging modality.

tis will allow assessment of interobserver variability as well as accuracy of test.  all 4 reports will be correlated with histopathology from surgery to assess accuracy of the tests.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the accuracy of two different diagnostic tests used to examine liver lesions in patients with colorectal cancer.

Who is it for?

You can join this study if you are aged 18 to 85 years and have colorectal cancer liver metastases for which you are considering surgery.

Trial details

Participants in this trial will undergo an Angio CT scan and an MRI with Primovist scan. The Angio CT is a very useful standard test which is used to detect lesions within the liver.  The test is also very good at showing the relationship of the lesions to the important blood vessels within the liver. However, sometimes this CT picks up lesions which might not be colorectal cancer metastases (a deposit of colorectal cancer within the liver). It is important to know this so that patients are not excluded from surgery because they have too much disease. It is thought that MRI with Primovist may be better at characterising the liver lesions, i.e. MRI with Primovist is better at deciding whether a lesion seen is a colorectal metastases or not. There has never been a study that directly compares Angio CT with MRI with Primovist. This study would aim to make this comparison. It would help us decide which is the better test in different circumstances to assess the liver disease in a patient with colorectal cancer.</summary>
