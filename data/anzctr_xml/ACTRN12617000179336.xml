    <interventions>MiniLit Intervention (http://www.multilit.com/programs/minilit-program/). It is classified as a Tier 2 intervention according to the Response To Intervention framework.

The reading intervention involves up to 80 unique lessons delivered by a trained intervention deliverer in face-to-face groups of up to 4 students. The intervention is delivered during school hours, on school property. The intervention deliverer is required to attend a 2-day training session and to have completed at least high school.

The starting point for each group is determined by a pre-assessment that assesses the child's reading ability, matched to the content and difficulty of the unique lessons. The program takes around 20 weeks to complete, with four lessons of up to 60 minutes per week, and includes regular curriculum-based measures to monitor the progress of the students.  Each lesson comprises three main components:
1. Sounds and Words Activities
2. Text Reading
3. Story Book Reading

The resources required as part of the MiniLit intervention, are:
1. Introductory DVD (11 mins)
2. Teacher manual (78 pages)
3. Handbook (four handbooks covering 4 x 20 lessons, 1050 pages)
4. Sounds and words books (five copies of 78 pages each)
5. Presentation cards (7 different types, totalling 900 cards)
6. Student workbooks  (2 x five copies of 84 pages each. Note: separate booklets are required for each student undertaking the program. 
7. Testing and lesson records (2 x one copy of 88 page)

Program fidelity will be measured as part of the process evaluation by the research team. This will include the number of unique lessons completed, length of each lesson, number of lessons repeated as well as start and end lesson. This will be collected by examining the lesson plans of the MiniLit intervention deliverers.

    <concealment>Allocation of individual students to MiniLit versus Business as Usual groups will be concealed from members of the research team involved in outcome assessments for the duration of the project. The allocation will be conducted by an indepedent statician who is independent of the research team to ensure concealment from the research team. Once child eligibility has been determined by the research team, the statistician will randomise children with only the child's study ID.

Because school staff, teachers and students will not be blinded, they will be asked not to disclose student randomisation status to the research staff when the research staff conduct assessments at their schools. However, in cases of disclosure, this information will be recorded in the project database and ‘unblinding’ will be examined as a potential confounding variable in the outcome analyses.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will follow standard methods for randomised controlled trials. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat and will include all randomised participants where outcome data are available.

The primary outcome is student reading outcomes at 12 months post-randomisation, as measured by the YARC - PR.  The primary analysis will use a multivariate linear regression to examine the YARC  PR score (continuous) at 12 months post-randomisation for the intervention students, compared to students in the control group. Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses will be conducted. For adjusted analyses, two models will be conducted. The first will account for baseline assessment scores whilst the second will also include student age, gender and family SES as a priori confounders. Family SES will be determined using the NSW Department of Educations Student Educational Advantage score, which is derived from parent education level and occupation. This will be provided by the NSW Department of Education. Clustering of students within schools and MiniLit groups will be accounted for in the models using regression techniques that respect these structures. Findings between groups will be presented as mean differences with 95% Confidence Intervals, p-values and Hedges g effect sizes.

For secondary outcomes, continuous variables will be analysed using linear regression and categorical data will use logistic regression. Unadjusted and adjusting findings will be presented according to the models described in the primary outcome analyses. Given the pragmatic sample size, sub-group analyses will only be conducted if the sub-group has over 40 students per group (25% of the final sample).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A number of studies have examined the impact of the MiniLit program on the reading ability of students participating in the program. Although these previous studies have shown promising benefits in terms of effect sizes on childrens reading (d = 1.1 to 1.8), results are derived from differences between pre- and post-training scores. In addition, there has been limited efficacy and effectiveness studies that compare children who complete MiniLit to those who receive business as usual classroom teaching or alternative RTI Tier 2 interventions. The current evidence for MiniLit consists of studies performed by the developer, including a small within-school, wait-list randomised controlled trial of the MiniLit program demonstrating its positive impact (5-8). Therefore, these promising findings now need to be evaluated in a large scale RCT to determine the impact of the program on student outcomes when scaled to system-level implementation. In addition, it is important to evaluate the process indicators that can predict the outcomes of the intervention, as well as the implementation cost-benefit.

The overarching question of this project is whether the MiniLit intervention, offered to Year 1 students identified as being in the bottom 25% of readers, improves student reading and literacy outcomes 12 months post-randomisation? 
The primary research aim of this project is:
1To determine, for Year 1 students in the bottom 25% of readers, whether students who receive MiniLit have better reading outcomes at 12 months post-randomisation, compared to those who have usual classroom teaching

We therefore hypothesise that students who receive the MiniLit intervention will have better mean reading ability scores on the Australian Edition of the York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension - Passage Reading (YARC  PR) at 12 months post-randomisation, compared to students who receive business as usual. 

The secondary aims are:
1. To determine student reading outcomes in both intervention and control groups 6 months (short term) post-randomisation.
2. To determine the proportion of students with low reading ability in both intervention and control (business as usual) groups at 6 and 12 months post-randomisation
3. To determine the implementation enablers and barriers that are predictive of program success and sustainability
4. To determine the cost per student, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention
