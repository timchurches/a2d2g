    <interventions>A description of the study: Once recruited, subjects will be randomly assigned to either a test pre-entry diet or control group.  The test pre-entry loading group will have their usual (baseline) diet assessed to determine their overall energy intake and percentage contribution of energy nutrients as well as fatty acid (FA) composition.  Based on the percentage of their dietary fat intake, Macadamia nut and oil products will be provided to substitute a major proportion (~20%) of the usual source of dietary fat without affecting total daily energy intake, i.e. isocaloric with usual baseline diet.    This pre-entry loading phase will continue for a period of 10 weeks, after which time subjects from each of the test pre-entry loading diet and control groups will be randomly assigned to one of two different energy-controlled weight reduction diets. 

In the energy-controlled (second) phase of the trial, the test diet will consist of moderately high fat intake (35-40%) with a large proportion (~20%) derived from macadamia nuts.  Each diet will be progressively adjusted to facilitate a reduction in body weight of 0.5-1.0 kg per week. 

The test period will endure 6 months duration in the first instance, with subjects being monitored regularly over a period of up to 18 months. This protocol will involve regular face-to-face consultations over this time to enable collection of samples and present opportunities to sustain adherence to the dietary protocol. Specifically visits at 0, 1, and 4 weeks, followed by two-monthly visits during the weight loss protocol will be conducted for subject monitoring.  Additional consultation will be provided as required for each subject.  Dietary data in the form of 3-day food records, 24 hour dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires will be taken to monitor adherence.

Non-invasive anthropometric measures (BMI, waist and hip circumference, bioelectrical impedance) and endothelial function tests will be conducted as well.  Blood samples will be taken both to screen for subject eligibility and to provide information on risk factors such as serum lipids, markers of inflammation and to cross-validate dietary data. A proportion of samples will be allocated to low temperature storage to enable retrospective biochemical analysis.

Pre-Entry Intervention Group:  Usual diet modified to allow for pre-determined amount of macadamia nuts.

Weight Loss (energy-controlled) Phase Intervention Group:  a moderately high fat (close to 35% of energy) monounsaturated fat-enriched, energy-controlled, weight loss diet including a pre-determined amount of macadamia nuts daily.</interventions>
    <comparator>Pre-Entry Control Group: Usual diet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In the energy-controlled (second) phase of the trial,  The control diet will be a moderately low fat diet (20-25%) aligned with the American Heart Association (AHA) Step II Diet.  Diet will be progressively adjusted to facilitate a reduction in body weight of 0.5-1.0 kg per week. </comparator>
