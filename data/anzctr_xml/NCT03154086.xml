  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK3352589
Treatment: drugs - Matching Placebo

Experimental: Part A-Cohort 1 - Eligible subject will be assigned to four single dose, crossover dosing periods, 1 placebo and 3 escalating dosing (GSK3352589-2 to 400 mg) periods. Subjects will return for their next scheduled dosing period approximately 14 days (wash out period) after administration of the study drug.

Experimental: Part A-Cohort 2 - Eligible subjects will be assigned to either single dose of GSK3352589 (dose selected after completion of Part A-Cohort 1) or placebo administered in the fasted and then fed states. Subjects will return for their next scheduled dosing period approximately 14 days (wash out period) after administration of the study drug.

Experimental: Part B- GSK3352589 - Eligible subjects will receive single sequence of planned dose range is 2 mg once daily to 200 mg twice daily administered for 14 days in Cohorts (1 to 6) in the fasted and fed states. Selection of the starting dose for Part B will occur after review of the safety, tolerability and PK data of all subjects enrolled in Part A

Placebo Comparator: Part B-Placebo - Eligible subjects will receive single sequence of Placebo either once daily or twice daily administered for 14 days depending on allocation to Cohorts (1 to 6). Part B will occur after review of the safety, tolerability and PK data of all subjects enrolled in Part A.


Treatment: drugs: GSK3352589
It will be available in the dose of 1, 5, 25 and 100 mg tablet for oral administration.

Treatment: drugs: Matching Placebo
It will be available across all strengths to match active drug in the form of tablet for oral administration.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of subjects with adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) for Part A and Part B - An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgement will be categorized as SAE</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This FTIH study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) of
      escalating single and repeat oral doses of GSK3352589 in normal healthy volunteers. This is a
      randomized, double-blind (sponsor unblinded), placebo controlled, dose escalation study that
      will have two parts; Part A and Part B. A total of 64 subjects will be randomized (8
      subjects/cohort) to GSK3352589 or matching placebo.</summary>
