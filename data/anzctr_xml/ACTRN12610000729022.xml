    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential subjects will be sourced primarily from the research database, and from advertising if required. The study researcher will initially discuss the nature of the study over the phone with the subject and review eligibility criteria. If interested an information sheet will be sent for review. An appointment will be made at the clinic, where the study investigator will obtain informed consent and further determine their eligibility. At this appointment subjects will be randomised to active or placebo treatment.
The attending researchers will be blinded to the randomisation schedule, and only nominated members of the study team (for example the safety data reviewers) will have access to the schedule.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be done by a senior doctor on the research team once they have received from a statistician a randomisation table generated by statistical computer software.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The number of people with asthma has been steadily increasing for many years in most countries of the world including New Zealand, but researchers are not sure why. Some studies have suggested that one reason could be the increasing use of paracetamol. We are aiming to find out if giving paracetamol to people with mild asthma has any effect on their asthma.</summary>
