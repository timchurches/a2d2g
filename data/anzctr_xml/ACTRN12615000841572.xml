  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 weeks after a pleurodesis to control MPE, patients will undergo a single blinded randomized controlled trial.  
The intervention arm will receive inspiratory muscle strength training (IMT), requiring patients to take 30 deep forceful breaths (in 5-7 minutes) twice daily for 6 weeks through a Powerbreathe Medic device with an inspiratory threshold load initially set at approximately 40% of Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and increased as tolerated.
The Powerbreathe device is a small handheld device held up to the mouth which provides resistance during inhalation. The initial 5-7 minute training session will be supervised by the principal investigator who is a Thoracic Physician, after baseline assessment. 30 minutes instruction on how to use the Powerbreathe Medic will be provided at this time. A 5-7 minute  session of training supervised by a Thoracic Physician will be repeated after 2 and 4 weeks of home training. The principal investigator will prescribe increased threshold load each week, by approximately 10% of baseline MIP, after weekly 10 minute phone call.  Adherence will be monitored with diaries. </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator arm will perform deep breathing exercises through a Powerbreathe Medic device with complete lung inflation, using the same number of  breaths twice daily for 6 weeks. This arm will not perform strength training as the inspiratory threshold load will be set at less than 5 cms H2O, and less than 15% of MIP.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomization will be concealed from the primary investigator and stratified according to MIP &gt; or &lt; 70% predicted, as there is wide variability of MIP in patients with MPE. In other clinical populations such as COPD, IMT has greater effect in patients with lower baseline MIP. Randomization will use a 1:1 allocation which is restricted using random block sizes. The allocation sequence and block size will be concealed from the principal investigator who enrols, trains and assesses patients. The allocation sequence will be concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed and stapled envelopes. Aluminium foil inside the envelope will render the envelope impermeable to intense light. Envelopes will only be opened to allocate the respiratory muscle training intervention after participants complete all baseline (visit 1) assessments. There will be a witnessed signature that each envelope was sealed just prior to randomization.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random number generator will determine the order of the random block sizes. A random number generator will determine the order of allocation within each block, until allocation is required to be non-random to achieve balanced allocation within the block. </sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Blinding: Patients will be blinded to the nature of the intervention although they will receive coaching to ensure they are aware how to correctly complete the assigned breathing exercise. The principal investigator will not be blinded as this is not feasible while controlling the threshold load intervention. Symptom and quality of life instruments are completed by patients with no influence by the investigator, and oxygen cost of hyperpnea is an effort independent physiologic outcome.The principal investigator will perform the effort dependent MIP test with a standard protocol (5 MIP replicates per test, with scripted instructions and ATS criteria for performing additional replicates).</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size is based on change in Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) as the primary outcome:
Based on SD of 10.8 cms H2O for change in MIP, when 15 patients complete each arm, this study will have 80% power to demonstrate a =11 cms H2O increase in MIP due to respiratory muscle training, with a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 20%, the recruitment target is 36 patients over 6 months, in order that 30 participants complete the intervention.
Unpaired t test will compare the change from baseline over 6 weeks between the two interventions:
MIP (primary outcome)
Forced Vital Capacity
Inspiratory Capacity
Oxygen Cost of Hyperpnea (slope = mls of O2 used for each L of ventilation)
Resting end-expiratory diaphragm thickness (contralateral to the Malignant Pleural Effusion)

Linear mixed model will compare repeated measures between the two interventions:
MIP
Dyspnea-12
EQ-5D-5L

Cox proportional hazard modelling will compare the proportion of patients (a) requiring further invasive drainage of effusion, or (b) with pneumonia,  over the 6 month period from randomization

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine the effect of respiratory muscle training on the inspiratory muscles after pleurodesis in cancer patients with malignant pleural effusion. It will assess whether this is a promising therapy to improve clinical outcomes in cancer patients with malignant pleural effusion.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have had a diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and have had pleurodesis with no significant fluid re-accumulation on clinical assessment 3 weeks after.

Study details
Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive inspiratory muscle strength training twice daily for 6 weeks using a Powerbreathe Medic device. While participants in the other group will perform deep breaths to improve lung capacity using the same device.

Participants will perform tests of the strength of the breathing muscles, lung capacity and the oxygen fuel economy of the breathing muscles. An ultrasound test will be performed to check the thickness of the main breathing muscle. Participants will answer questionnaires to compare the effectiveness of the two interventions.

If the respiratory muscles can be trained, this may reduce the need for further invasive drainage procedures and/or improve dyspnea.
