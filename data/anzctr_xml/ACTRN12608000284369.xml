  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of speech pathology treatment on chronic (persistent) cough. It is expected that the treatment will have a positive effect on cough by decreasing a person's cough sensitivity, frequency and severity and by increasing a person's cough quality of life.</summary>
