    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Panobinostat/LBH589

Experimental: Stratum A - patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) initially diagnosed as de novo AML received 60 mg of panobinostat per day on three discontinuous days per week.

Experimental: Stratum B - patients with refractory AML initially diagnosed as AML secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD) received 60 mg of panobinostat per day on three discontinuous days per week.


Treatment: drugs: Panobinostat/LBH589

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Response as Per Investigator Assessment by Stratum (FAS) - Response to treatment was defined as complete remission rate (CRR). CRR is complete remission (CR) and morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (residual neutropenia or thrombocytopenia) (CRi). To stop or to proceed with Stage 2 of a given stratum of the Simon's optimal 2-stage design was based on the number of patients with CR/CRi and a safety evaluation of the patients from Stage 1 in that stratum. If early results clearly indicated that the drug was not active or worthy of further investigation, enrollment of that particular stratum would be terminated. CR and CRi were assessed by the Investigator according to IWG response Criteria for AML (Cheson et al 2003). As per protocol we would continue to stage II if = 4 patients out of 26 patients enrolled to stage I had a CR or a CRi. As per response observed there was only 1 patient with CR/CRi in stratum A and 2 patients with CR/CRi in Stratum B.</outcome>
