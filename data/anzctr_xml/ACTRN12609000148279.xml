  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention to be evaluated in this study (i.e. the alcohol intervention program) is based on an adapted version of the Alcohol Skills Training Program (ASTP), an evidence-based intervention developed for college students in the USA by Professor Alan Marlatt and his colleagues. The Alcohol Intervention Program (AIP) consists of 5, 2-hour group sessions held once weekly for 5 weeks, with a focus on learning controlled drinking techniques in high-risk situations. Total duration of the intervention: 5 weeks. Other components of the program are: learning information regarding alcohol's effects, Blood Alcohol Level (BAL) discrimination training, limit setting, the role of myths about alcohol (outcome expectancies) and social and normative cues for drinking, including mindfulness strategies for counteracting these influences. The program requires facilitation by a qualified therapist and is a closed group program generally consisting of 10 participants. An additional two sessions of Therapeutic Telephone Counselling (TTC) are delivered fortnightly once a person leaves (exits) the Therapeutic Community (TC).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group consists of 2, 2-hour group sessions, conducted once weekly over 2 weeks.  Total duration of the control treatment: 2 weeks.  This group will contain similar alcohol education information included in sessions one and two of the intervention group. Information will be that which is commonly known and shared within current drug and alcohol treatment.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Approximately 150 (75 in each group) recovering drug users who provided informed consent were recruited for participation in this study from Odyssey House Victoria drug rehabilitation services (inpatient) and Windana Society (drug rehabilitation service in Victoria).  Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was at a central adminstration site within each TC. Participation was voluntary, free of charge and all clients are able to withdraw at any stage. In order to ensure comparability between groups, randomisation occurred after recruitment, selection criteria, and baseline assessments had been conducted approximately 2 weeks into residential treatment. At baseline all eligible participants were assigned a numeric code. An independent researcher (not involved in the study) randomised the participants into the treatment or control groups using computer-based random number generation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study was to develop, pilot and evaluate a group-based program within a TC, aimed at reducing alcohol problems in drug rehabilitation clients.  It was hypothesised that participants who recieved the 5-session intervention would demonstrate reduced alcohol consumption and relapse to drug use, post-residential care.  A secondary hypothesis was that participants who received the 5-session intervention would demonstrate improved alcohol use skill acquisition, health status and psychosocial functioning.</summary>
