  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are three (3) interventions - two medium level and one high level. Medium intervention 1 will consist of an additional specialised 1 hour antenatal education session delivered to the fathers when the mother is at least 32 weks gestation.  The session content will focus on fatherhood and the positive role of fathers in relation to breastfeeding support, the importance/benefits of breast feeding to infants and mothers and anticipatory problem solving (eg. for breastfeeding issues like engorgement and mastitis). Infant developmental milestones and postnatal depression will also be specifically included.  In addition, fathers will receive associated take-home educational print material for both parents to support the anticipatory problem solvoing and decision making component of the session. For medium intervention 2, the content will be similar to that for medium intervention 1 but it will be delivered sequentially with information relevant to the infant developmental milestones at the time. Material will be delivered to the father via the internet and mobile phone technology on a weekly basis for the first 6 weeks after birth and then every two weeks from 6-26 weeks or until breastfeeding stops, if earlier than 26 weeks. Materials will include goal setting exercises and short quizzes. Links to web-based materials will be provided, which participants will access using a unique log-in. High intervention comprises medium intervention 1 and medium intervention 2 combined (ie specialised antenatal class and  social support).

Process evaluation at the end of the intervention will determine participant self-reported use and acceptance of materials with questions included in the final questionnaire.  Participation in phone app exercises and visits to web-pages can also be monitored at the participant level.

      <outcome>Cost-effectiveness</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following conclusion of the study. This study will undertake a cost- consequences analysis conducted from the perspective of the health service. The economic analysis will compare the incremental costs of the PIFI intervention (difference in costs accrued in the control arm, compared to those in the intervention arms) with those of the incremental primary outcomes, all expressed in their natural units of measurement (e.g. weeks of breastfeeding). We will also attempt to provide cost-effectiveness data on longer term outcomes associated with breastfeeding, using existing WA epidemiological data and evidence from the literature to explore and model the linkage between breastfeeding incidence and duration and longer term health outcomes. Sensitivity analysis will be used to explore the uncertainty in the cost and outcome data.  The study will also conduct a discrete choice experiment to explore participants perspectives of the PIFI initiative which will be used to elicit information on the benefits of the intervention. This aspect will allow for the exploration of individuals preferences for each of the alternative levels of intervention (i.e. control, medium intervention 1, medium intervention 2 and the high intervention). Discrete choice  experiments are increasingly being used in economic analysis to measure the benefits associated with health care interventions </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size
The key outcome variable for statistical analysis is duration of breastfeeding. It is assumed that at 26 weeks, there is at least a 10% difference in the proportion of mothers breastfeeding between any two of the groups. A sample size of 300 subjects (fathers) is required in each of the 3 intervention groups and control group to be able to detect the difference at 80% power and 5% level of significance, using a Log-rank survival test. Assuming a loss to follow-up of 25% in each group, a total of 400 for each group will be recruited (Total n recruited = 1600 fathers, total n required =1200). The sample size calculations were calculated in terms of the hazard ratio taking into account the censoring of data, as required since survival analysis will be used for the analysis of the main outcome variable  time to breastfeeding cessation. 

Data Analyses
After data are cleaned, the missing values analysis procedure in SPSS Version 22 will be used to: describe the pattern of missing data; estimate means, standard deviations, covariance and correlations for different missing value methods; and impute the missing values with estimated means from regression or expectation minimization methods.
	
Multivariable survival and logistic regression analyses will be used to assess the effect of the treatment groups on the outcome after adjusting for covariates. The study has a factorial treatment structure comparing Antenatal Education (Yes, No) and Social Support (Yes, No).  In addition to testing the main effects, this factorial treatment structure will allow the testing of the interaction between any two factors. It is hypothesised that the combined effect of both interventions will be significantly greater than the effect of either intervention in isolation. The main effects of Antenatal Education and Social Support together with all the interactions between these factors will be assessed in the analyses of the data. Survival analysis will be used to examine the effects of the various treatment groups on the duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding.  A similar analysis will be performed for introduction of infant formula and complementary food. This type of analysis allows for the presence of censored data.  Censored data refers to those cases where breastfeeding continues beyond the end of the study period or beyond the time at which the subject dropped out of the study. Variables reported in the literature to be associated with duration of overall breastfeeding and age of introduction of complementary foods will be investigated using Coxs proportional hazards model. This model allows joint estimation of the effects of predictor variables on the hazard  the risk of cessation of breastfeeding / complementary food introduction. Possible covariates that will be considered in the Survival analysis will include amongst others: socio-demographic factors such as maternal age, level of education and return to work; biomedical factors such as parity, maternal smoking and weight status; and psychosocial factors such as infant feeding attitudes and breastfeeding self-efficacy.

Cost and cost effectiveness analysis  
The study will undertake a costs analysis from the perspective of the health service and will develop an economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the PIFI intervention. Costs will include direct costs associated with the program including set up costs and cost of delivering activities. In terms of outcome measurement we will include short-term outcomes that look at the cost per additional women breastfeeding and cost per percentage change in breastfeeding . We will also attempt to provide cost-effectiveness data on longer term outcomes associated with breastfeeding using existing WA epidemiological data and evidence from the literature to explore and model the linkage between breastfeeding incidence and health outcomes. Relevant data from this aspect of the study will then be included in our economic model and used to explore the cost-effectiveness of the PIFI intervention.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This 3-year RCT will involve the development, implementation and evaluation of an intervention to increase the duration of breastfeeding amongst participating families in metropolitan Perth WA. The study will require the development and testing of additional intervention elements to enhance those already developed during the FIFI trial. This will be followed by the implementation of a RCT involving a sample of 1200 parents (1200 fathers and 1200 mothers) recruited from hospitals in the Perth metropolitan area. The interventions will consist of a control group intervention (the usual antenatal education offered by that hospital), two medium interventions groups and one high level intervention group. Beneficial outcomes may include increased duration of breastfeeding, delaying the use of infant formula and solid foods, a better start to life for the infants and less potential disease later in life. The study will also explore the cost effectivness of each of the three interventions.</summary>
