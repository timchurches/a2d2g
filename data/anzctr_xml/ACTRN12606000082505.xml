  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects are randomised to the six-week self-management program Stanford Model Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP).
The CDSMP is a licensed program conducted under licence from Arthritis Victoria by a registered nurse with either a clinician or peer leader, both of whom are accredited with Arthritis Victoria as program facilitators.  The six week program comprises a two an a half hour per week group attendance and covers formation of action plans, relaxation therapy, medication usage, effective communication with the health care team, nomination of a power of attorney, end of life decision making, encouragement of candidate to participate in activity (eg walking) and symptom management.  The program is facilitated in a manner to foster participant self efficacy with weekly  feedback from the program facilitators.  For the duration of the intervention each participant wears a pedometer.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects are randomised to a six week pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP).  Pulmonary rehabilitation subjects are re- randomised at week 7 to weekly maintenance (PRP+m) or, usual care.  The six week PRP is a twice weekly 90 minute program conducted by a registered nurse with gymnasium attendance assisted by an allied health clinician (physiotherapist &amp;/or allied health assistant).  The program comprises  lower limb exercise therapy ( walking, stair climbing, cycling) and limited upper limb exercises (free weights) facilitated in a manner to foster participant self efficacy with weekly  feedback from the program facilitators. For the duration of the intervention each participant wears a pedometer.  The weekly maintenance (PRP+m) consists of one hour of weekly gymnasium attendance for sixteen weeks.  The gym program is identical to the six week program in structure and content.</comparator>

    <sequence>Each candidate is randomized from a store of three sealed opaque envelopes (1 self management, 2 rehabilitation) which are replenished after each candidate is randomised.  The candidate selects one envelope in the presence of the researcher and the candidate's family/significant others.  The contents of the other two envelopes are then displayed.  Group allocation occurs in much the same way as a roll of a dice.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to investigate in a sample of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the effects of a psychological intervention as compared to a pulmonary rehabilitation program and then; compare six weeks of rehabilitation with and without weekly maintenance and construct a model to identify candidates who benefit most from maintenance.  The incremental cost effectiveness of the three interventions will then be evaluated.</summary>
