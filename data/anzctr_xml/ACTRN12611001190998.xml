  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exposure CO2 or air was insufflated during single balloon enteroscopy .CO2 was insufflated using pump UCR Olympus. CO2 was insufflated at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Air was insufflated using the ordinary air inlet system of the endoscope rack. The approximate duration of the intervention in the CO2 group was 42 +/-  15 minutes and the air group was 43 +/-  20 minutes with a mean difference  1+/-  5 minutes, being this was not statistically significant (p = 0.7476). 
Mean and standard desviation of the continuous variables were calculated, in the case of nominal variables was calculated frequencies and percentages
The contrasts of continuous variables between groups were based on Student's t test for independent samples, in the case of nominal variables contrasts the X2 test of  Pearson was applied, continuity correction was applied in cases where the expected frequencies per cell were  less than 5.
Comparisons between groups of continuous variables and nominal variables was performed by using  ANOVA of two factors.  
A value p &lt;0.05 was considered to be a contrast statistically significant. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 18.</interventions>

      <outcome>Effects of CO2 and air insufflations on the intubation depth during SBE</outcome>
      <timepoint>Each maneuver involving advancement and withdrawal of the whole endoscope system, with blocked balloons, in general allows a maximun of 40 cm of the small bowel to be threaded on. The endoscopist has to estimated the efficacy of  insertion of the enteroscope by endoscopic checking of the instruments  advancement and  has to estimate the length  of small bowel released during insertion of the  overtube and pulling back of the enteroscope and overtube.
This measurement technique is a standardized form and universally approved

      <outcome>Effects of CO2 and air insufflations on post procedure pain during SBE</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation of pain and discomfort
 Having confirmed that the patients were pain-free before the examination, the patients were asked to grade any pain experienced immediately after the procedure SBE and again at 12 hour after the enteroscopy using a questionnaire containing  100 mm visual analog scale</timepoint>
