  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - cyclosporine or tacrolimus
Treatment: drugs - sirolimus

Active Comparator: 1 - Group 1: Continuation of CNI regimen

Experimental: 2 - Group 2: (CNI-Free) Conversion to SRL-based regimen


Treatment: drugs: cyclosporine or tacrolimus
Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are provided by the sites and dosed to achieve a target trough level determined by the investigator; therefore, form, dosage, and frequency are site and patient specific. Duration should be 52 weeks on-therapy.

Treatment: drugs: sirolimus
Oral (1 and 2 mg) tablets, dosing should be once daily to achieve a target trough level of 7- 15 ng/mL. Duration should be 52 weeks on-therapy.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Calculated Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation) at 52 Weeks Post-randomization - Creatinine Clearance (CC) calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation, adjusted for body surface area. Calculated CC: method to approximate kidney function. It measures rate creatinine (substance formed from metabolism of creatine) is cleared from blood by kidneys. Normal adult creatinine clearance is greater than or equal to (=) 90 milliliters per minute per 1.73 meters squared (mL/min/1.73m^2). Change from baseline=CC at Week 52 minus CC at baseline where higher scores represented improved renal function; Least squares mean adjusted for baseline calculated creatinine clearance and center.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Serum Creatinine Level at 4, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 52 Weeks Post-randomization - Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine=45 to 90 micromoles per liter (mcmol/L) for females, 60 to 110 mcmol/L for males, however normal values are age-dependent. Change from baseline=creatinine level at Week x minus baseline level where higher scores represented decreased kidney function. Least squares mean adjusted for treatment group and center.</outcome>

      <outcome>Annual Change in Calculated Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation) - The change in creatinine clearance over time assessed using the random coefficient slope of the regression line with creatinine clearance as the dependent variable and study day as the independent variable. Time points calculated as study days, relative to time of randomization of study medication. Observed data multiplied by a scale factor of 365 to express an annual change.</outcome>

Death was determined from the Death report. The distribution of time to death was to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared between treatment groups with a proportional hazard model. The number and percent of survival at 6 and 12 months were to be reported.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether converting from calcineurin
      inhibitor (CNI) therapy to sirolimus therapy will be more effective than continuing
      calcineurin inhibitor therapy with respect to renal function in cardiac transplant recipients
      with mild to moderate renal dysfunction.</summary>
