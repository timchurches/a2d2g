  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects are screened for their sensitivity to fat taste via triplicate sensory evaluations, where they need to accurately differentiate between control samples and those containing  1.4mM and 3.8mM oleic acid. Samples are presented to subjects in non-fat milk. Subjects are screened three consecutive times on one day, for each test subjects are presented with 3 samples, 2 control and one  fatty acid and asked to pick the odd sample. Subjects are advised to wash their mouth only between tests, not between individual samples within the same test.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sensitivity to the taste of oleic acid</outcome>
      <timepoint>Taste sensitivity was determined on one occasion via triplicate sensory evaluations. This test was completed before all other tests. All tests were conducted within a single test session.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fat perception: Subjects were required to rank 4 custards with varying concentrations of fat (0, 2, 6 and 10% canola oil). This test is conducted after taste sensitivity has been determined.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects completed this task on one occasion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Food and fat intake: Subjects completed a 4 day diet record from which energy and macronutrient contents were quantified, the also completed a a food variety questionnaire, to assess dietary variety, and a food habits and behaviour questionnaire, from which dietary habits aand practices were determined</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects completed all diet related questionnaires within 1 month of sensory testing</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Height, weight and body mass index</outcome>
      <timepoint>On the day of sensory testing, all subjects were weighted and measured without shoes and in light clothing. Body mass Index (BMI) was calculated from these measurements.</timepoint>
