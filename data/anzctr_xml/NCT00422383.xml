    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Response as Determined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% Improvement (ACR20) - ACR20 defined as overall score of =20 in ACR number (ACRn) calculation. Overall score defined as lowest percent improvement from baseline (BL) of following 3 measures: tender joint count (TJC; 68 joints), swollen joint count (SJC: 66 joints), and the 3rd lowest improvement achieved by at least 3 of 5 remaining ACR core parameters: physician's global assessment of disease activity, participant's global assessment of disease activity, participant's assessment of pain (visual analog assessment [VAS]), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). If CRP missing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was used. In order for improvements in the ACRn score to be expressed as a positive result, rather than the negative changes that improvements represent, the final ACRn results were multiplied by negative 1. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) for TJC/SJC, HAQ, CRP/ESR, VAS. If change in CRP incalculable, change in ESR used. ACR20 set to Non-Responder if ACRn missing</outcome>

      <outcome>Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR): Adjusted Mean Change From BL at Week 48 - DAS28 was calculated according to the following formula: DAS28 equals (=) [0.56 multiplied by (*) the square root (v) of TJC] plus (+) [0.28 * v of SJC] + (0.70 * the natural logarithm (ln) ESR in millimeters per hour (mm/h)] + [0.014 * participant's global assessment of disease activity (GH)]. DAS28-ESR = 5.1 = high disease activity, DAS28-ESR less than or equal to (=) 3.2 = low disease activity, DAS28-ESR less than (&lt;) 2.6 = remission.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score From BL at Week 48 - FACIT-F scores were obtained from a 13 question self-administered participant questionnaire designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants responded to the questions using a value between 0 and 4, where 0 indicated "not at all" and 4 indicated "very much." 11 of the 13 questions were negatively stated; indicating the higher the score of the participant's response, the greater their fatigue. These questions were calculated as 4 minus the participants' response, so that a higher score indicated an improvement in health. The scores for the 2 positively stated questions were not changed. The participants' responses were summed to result in an overall score, which are scored 0 to 52 (52 = highest level of functioning). A positive change from BL indicated improvement.</outcome>
