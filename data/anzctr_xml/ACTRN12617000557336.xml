    <interventions>Intervention name: ARB-1740 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection.

Intervention description: Approximately 30 HBeAg-negative, noncirrhotic subjects will be enrolled in three sequential cohorts; each cohort will include approximately 10 subjects, randomized 4:1 to treatment with  ARB-1740 or placebo.

Cohort 1 (0.05 mg/kg): All subjects will be HBV-DNA Positive and either treatment experienced or treatment naive.

Cohort 2 (0.1 mg/kg) and Cohort 3 (0.2 mg/kg): All subjects will be virally suppressed (HBV-DNA Negative), and receiving nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy for at least 12 months. A premedication regimen will be used prior to each dose of ARB-1740. Briefly: anti-inflammatory medication will be administered 8-12 hours prior to study treatment infusion; anti-inflammatory and antihistamine medication will be administered 30 minutes prior to study treatment infusion.

For each cohort, ARB-1740 or placebo will be administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. Subjects will receive ARB-1740 or placebo on Days 1, 29 and 57 (End of Treatment [EOT] Visit). All subjects will be followed for at least 24 weeks after the EOT Visit.

At each visit, subjects will be asked by the site personnel about their state of health and use of any concomitant medication since Screening or since the previous study visit. They will also be questioned about their adherence with study restrictions.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite Primary Outcome: The frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs, and laboratory abnormalities, by cohort, in HBV-DNA Negative (-) subjects, assessed through continuous monitoring by the Investigator.

Possible AEs may include infusion related reactions, cytokine release syndrome, or anaphylactic reactions. The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of AEs, and assessment of severity and causality. 

Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, complement, cytokines) or other abnormal assessments (e.g., ECGs and vital signs) that are judged by the Investigator as clinically significant will be recorded as AEs.

Discontinuation: The Investigator is responsible for determining if any AE or laboratory abnormality indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored over the course of the study, through 28 days after the last infusion of study treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of ARB-1740 in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and the best dose of ARB-1740. This includes looking at any side effects or health problems that might occur after ARB-1740 is given, as well as changes to HBV infection. Another purpose is to see how ARB-1740 behaves in the body, including the way the drug is absorbed (taken up) by the body. Three doses of ARB-1740 or placebo (a treatment that looks like ARB-1740 but does not contain any drug) will be given over eight weeks. The doses with be given intravenously (through a small tube into a vein in the arm). Subjects will have an 80% chance of receiving ARB-1740, and 20% chance of receiving placebo. Group 1 of the study enrolled patients with virus that can be detected., These subjects received placebo or ARB-1740 at 0.05 mg/kg. Enrollment of this group is complete. Group 2 and Group 3 of this study will enroll subjects already taking nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus infection, with no measurable virus. Subjects in Groups 2 and 3 will receive some medication to prevent allergic reactions before being treated with placebo or ARB-1740 at 0.1 mg/kg  (Group 2) or ARB-1740 at 0.2 mg/kg (Group 3).</summary>
