  <interventions>
    <interventions>This involves the intervention group of primary caregivers reading a problem-solving based bibliotherapy manual. The manual contains five modules which focus on improving the primary caregivers' wellbeing, equipping them to support the care recipient, and strengthening the care givers' ability to access and get the best out of support services. By reading the manual it is anticipated the caregivers will acheive better general wellbeing and have a lower level of distress. The intervention lasts for five weeks. Data will be collected at three timepoints: Baseline,  end of program, and 10 weeks follow-up.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group of primary caregivers will not be given the self-help manual but will continue to receive the standard support for caregivers. The standard support is the basic information that is given to families when the care recipient commences treatment. The duration of control group treatment is five weeks. Data will be collected at three timepoints: baseline, end of five weeks, and 10 weeks follow-up (same as intervention group).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary caregivers who complete the problem-solving based bibilotherapy program will have better general wellbeing and coping, greater problem solving ability, and lower distress at 10-week follow-up than at baseline. Outomes will be assessed using the following psychometric instruments:
(i) Short Form Health Survey (SF) - 12 (Version 2) (Ware et al. 1996), a 12-item instrument developed as a generic measure of perceived health status. 
(iii) Ways of coping (WOC) (MacCarthy et al. 1989), provides information about coping style. Respondents are requested to rate the coping behaviour they have used during the previous four weeks. 
(iv) Kessler Psychological Distress plus Scale (K-10 plus) will be used to measure non-specific psychological distress.
(v) Social Problem Solving Inventory (Short Version) (D'Zurilla et al. 1990), a 25-item instrument that measures social problem solving ability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Week 0), completion of program (Week 5), and 10 weeks after completing program (Week 15).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary caregivers who complete the problem-solving based bibilotherapy program will have better general wellbeing and coping, greater problem solving ability, and lower distress less at 10-week follow-up compared with the control group who will continue to receive the standard approach to caregivers of individuals with with first-episode psychosis. Outomes will be assessed using the following psychometric instruments:
(i) Short Form Health Survey (SF) - 12 (Version 2) (Ware et al. 1996), a 12-item instrument developed as a generic measure of perceived health status.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary caregivers who complete the problem-solving based bibilotherapy program will have a more favourable experience of caregiving, and a lower level of expressed emotion at 10-week follow-up than at baseline. Outomes will be assessed using the following psychometric instruments:
(i) Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI) (Szmukler et al. 1996), a 66-item instrument which measures caregivers' appraisal of their caregiving experience.  
(ii) Family Questionnaire (Wiedemann et al. 2002), a 20-item self-report instrument, which assesses the level of expressed emotion in a family. Expressed emotion is a type of negative communication involving excessive criticism and emotional over-involvement directed at a patient by family members.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Week 0), completion of program (Week 5), and 10 weeks after completing program (Week 15).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess if a self-help manual for primary caregivers of family members with first episode psychosis is effective in improving the caregivers' general wellbeing and lowering their distress. The study involves two groups: an 'intervention' group who will study the manual, and a 'control' group who will not study the manual.</summary>
