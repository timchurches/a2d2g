    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - migalastat HCl 150 mg

Experimental: migalastat HCl 150 mg - Migalastat HCl is a capsule provided in 14-day supply blister packs. Migalastat HCl is taken every other day by mouth. An inactive reminder capsule is taken or a punch-out reminder is used on days between migalastat HCl.

    <summary>This is an open-label extension study intended to provide continued treatment with migalastat
      HCl for subjects with Fabry disease who completed treatment of a previous migalastat HCl
      monotherapy study.

      The study will assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of migalastat HCl in subjects
      with Fabry disease who completed migalastat HCl treatment in a previous study.</summary>
