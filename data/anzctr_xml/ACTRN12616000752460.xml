  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention exercises will be conducted four times per week at participants usual training session with equipment provided by the investigators. Players can do their exercise before or after training.
The exercise program will be individualised and delivered electronically to participants with exercise prescription software. the repetitions and sets will be consistent in all participants, the weight will be individualised to each participant and to each leg of each participant to account for differences in muscle strength. Participants will record on the software the number of times each week they complete the session and the weights that they use for the exercise session. 
The intervention will be offered for the length of the season, this can vary between 6 and 10 months depending on the competition and the country. 
Isometric protocol: Participants will complete isometric holds on a leg extension machine. These consist of 5 x 45 second holds at 70% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) with 2 minutes recovery between holds. 
Isotonic protocol: Participants will complete the isotonic exercise on a leg extension machine using established protocols (4 x 8 contractions at 70% MVC). The rest period between sets will be 1 minute. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>OSTRC outcome measure. This validated tool measures that includes 4 simple questions,quantifies the impact of overuse injuries on function and is used for all overuse injuries.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monthly for the length of the season, this will vary depending on country and league and will be between 6 and 10 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>VISA-P that assesses the amount of pain and dysfunction in people with anterior knee pain. The questions are designed to measure symptoms of jumper's knee, but the questionnaire is not diagnostic. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Monthly for the length of the season, this will vary depending on country and league and will be between 6 and 10 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants will complete a global rating of change in knee pain and function on a seven point scale from very much worse to very much better.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of the competitive season that will be between 6 and 10 months after the start of the intervention depending on the competition level and country. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The change in the amount of patellar tendon pathology will be assessed using UTC tendon imaging.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of the competitive season that will be between 6 and 10 months after the start of the intervention depending on the competition level and country. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
