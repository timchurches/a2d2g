  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesize that reduction in dietary advance glycation endproducts (AGE) intake will
      increase insulin sensitivity and normalise insulin secretion in overweight and obese
      individuals through reduction of chronic low grade inflammation.

      We propose to test this hypothesis by performing euglycemic hypeinsulinemic glucose clamp and
      intravenous glucose tolerance test before and after low AGE diet and normal Australian diet
      in a cross-over design. This study will provide information relevant to the development and
      prevention of type 2 diabetes.</summary>
