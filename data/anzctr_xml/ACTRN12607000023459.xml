  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of tamoxifen has provided a reduction in deaths due to breast cancer in postmenopausal women with both node-positive and node-negative disease.  However, the benefit of tamoxifen treatment may be confined to patients with oestrogen receptor positive disease and a standard adjuvant treatment for all postmenopausal patients with node-positive, oestrogen receptor negative disease has not yet been defined.  Results from previous trials have indicated that the combination of CMF and tamoxifen (chemo-endocrine therapy) improved disease-free survival in all postmenopausal patients when compared with CMF or surgery alone.  Patients with oestrogen receptor negative disease were found to benefit significantly from the combined treatments.  Therefore, IBCSG VII will investigate the effectiveness of adding early combination chemotherapy and late additional chemotherapy to adjuvant tamoxifen compared to administering tamoxifen treatment alone in postmenopausal women.</summary>
