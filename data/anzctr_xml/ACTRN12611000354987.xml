  <interventions>
    <interventions>An intervention was conducted through a process-oriented program on parental support and breastfeeding counseling for midwives and postnatal nurses from the antenatal and child health centers in the study area. The training program included evidence-based methods to parental support and breastfeeding counseling. The learning methods were based on lectures and collegial discussions on professional stance, reflective processes, problem-solving processes, and practical skills in relation to breastfeeding. In all seven lectures and seminars were held during the training period. Between the meetings each participant wrote a diary with personal reflections on the issues that were discussed in the lectures. The training program was carried out from September 1999 through March 2000.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two control-groups and one intervention group were used in this study. Before any effects of the process-oriented training program could be detected data were collected for a baseline group called control group A (CGA, n=167). The baseline group (CGA) allowed detection of changes over time and any spillover effects of the intervention. The recruitment of the CGA mothers took place between April 2000 and October 2000 from the control sites. After the healthcare professionals at the intervention sites had received their process-oriented training program, recruitment started for mothers at the intervention sites (IG) as well as at the control sites (CGB n= 172) in a consecutive order between October 2000 and April 2003. All mothers were followed at three days, three and nine months postpartum. Datacollection from CGA and CGB only differed in time for data collection, otherwise the control group mothers belonged to the same control site.</comparator>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation to intervention or control group were done at municipality level, i.e. mothers living in and cared for at  intervention site health centers were allocated to intervention group and mothers living in and cared for at control site health centers  were allocated to control group. The mothers were invited in the study consecutively at the maternity ward. 
The midwives at the maternity ward provided information and questionnaires and they knew if the mothers were intervention or control since allocation to intervention or control was already decided based on the mothers living area. However these midwives were not aware of the content of the intervention and they could not affect allocation of mothers. The mothers did not know if their antenatal midwife and postnatal nurse had had the process-oriented training program or not since randomization was done on municipality level. Hence the mothers were not aware if they belonged to intervention or control group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Based on the findings of a baseline study, ten municipalities in the selected area were grouped into pairs according to size and breastfeeding duration. The antenatal and child health centers in these ten largest municipalities, were randomized to either the intervention site or the control site. Randomization was done by tossing a coin. Antenatal midwives and postnatal nurses at the intervention site were invited to the process-oriented training program. 
The intervention was blinded for the mothers but not for participating midwives and post natal nurses, since the mothers did not know if they were cared for by health professionals that had had process oriented training or not</sequence>
