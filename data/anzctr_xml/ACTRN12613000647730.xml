    <concealment>The patients need to meet the eligibility criteria at the screening visit (week 0) and at the end of the screening period at visit study-2 (end of week 4) prior to randomisation in order to have fullfilled the definite inclusion criteria of having at least 2 RBD events in the last 4 weeks.
 
 More precisely, the following assessments and procedures need to be completed:
- Medical history and examination (quality of life as well as medical, psychiatric and family history, medication and substance abuse, caffeine and alcohol included.)
- Mini Mental State Examination
- RBDSQ (RBD screening questionnaire)
- Current medication
- Exclusion criteria 
- A previously recorded nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) report is required to confirm patient eligibility and exclude OSA. If a PSG has not already been performed within the last 12 months or the patient has recently lost or gained a substantial amount of weight, the PSG done prior to randomisation would define the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). If AHI&gt;20, the participant will be withdrawn. After 4 weeks (screening period), the patient need to meet all the inclusion criteria, including to have presented at least 
two or more events of RBD defined by dream enactment and/or sleep related injuries as stated by the weekly CIRUS- RBD questionnaire on the question 2 and 4 of the wCIRUS-RBDQ. 

Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomised. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive melatonin or placebo in a 1:1 ratio in random blocks. Patients will be allocated a unique ID code in sequential, ascending chronological order. The ID code will be a three-digit number prefixed by “I-RBD”  (e.g. I-RBD001, I-RBD002, etc...;)The only way to match an individual’s name with their code is with a password protected excel file. </concealment>
    <sequence> Treatment assignment will be determined according to a computer generated randomisation list prepared by an individual not directly involved in patients’ recruitment or assessment.

    <statisticalmethods>M-iRBD trial and M-PD.RBD trial are two clinical trials with the same protocol in two different subtypes of patient with RBD, i.e idiopathic RBD and the Parkinsonian related form of RBD (RBD patients with Parkinsonian syndrome).
Because of the potential longer duration of recruitment in the idiopathic group (I-RBD) in comparison to the PD group (PD-RBD), the analyses are designed to be stratified with equal or separate statistical power for both Idiopathic and Parkinsonian-related subtypes and these subtypes will be registered as separate clinical trials with 2 clinical trial registrations in the ANZCTR. 
We need to randomise 30 patients in each strata to have 56 completers in this efficacy trial assuming a dropout rate of 7% to detect a drop from 2.25 RBD events per week to 1 event per week with a standard deviation in events of 1 per week (measured by the wCIRUS-RBDQ averaged over the 2 month treatment period and employing all measurements made in all patients in the statistical model). With 28 completers in each strata we will have 90% power with alpha set at 5% to detect this 56% relative improvement.

Raw data will not be analysed at the participating sites but will be collected via electronic case report forms via a secure website to the central study coordinating site under the control of the Woolcock Institute for Medical Research.

	Statistical analyses will be undertaken by the trial epidemiologist or under their direction and supervision. The analysts will be blinded to treatment allocation. Reductions in the number of RBD events reported by patients and their observers will be analysed for statistical difference via mixed model analyses of variance using the patient and the centre they were recruited from as random effects. Drug randomisation and time (weeks into the trial) will be fixed effects. The primary endpoint will be the last 4 weeks of therapy versus the 4 weeks prior to therapy compared with a least means square test within the interaction between time and treatment (regardless of the significance of that main interaction). The model will employ all interim measures of the primary outcome to reduce measurement error within patients.

		All other measures will be regarded as secondary in importance. The actigraphy data will be compared to the diary and primary outcome data for the purposes of aiding in the validation of these diagnostic and monitoring approaches.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the study is to test in a randomised, double ­blind, placebo­ controlled trial the efficacy of melatonin in patients with REM sleep behaviour disorder over 8 weeks of treatment
Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that, compared to placebo, melatonin treatment will result in a reduction in the frequency of patients' self reported events.</summary>
