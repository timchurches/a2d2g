  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will review subjects 14 and 28 days post exposure to low dose sertraline (expected average dose = 50mg). Sertraline will be taken as an oral tablet, once daily. 

Background:
Prior to commencment of study, patients will be confirmed to have hypertension and panic disorder by a clinical psychiatrist. Diagnosing Panic disorder will involve DSM-IV classification schemes
Patient's will be prescribed sertraline for their panic disorder (which is licensed as first line treatment for panic disorder in australia)
Patients will be recruited over a course of 3 months
In relation to dose:

Patients will initially start on 25mg sertraline for one week
One the second week patients will take 50mg
If there are no side effects and the patient is happy with the management of their panic, the dose will be maintained at 50mg. If side effects are prominent the dose can be lowered, and if the patient is not happy in the reduction in panic, the dose can be lowered. Determing dosage is at the descretion of the treating psychiatrist.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the difference between the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in subjects, 14 and 28 days post exposure to low dose Sertraline (50mg final dose)

To assess this outcome, subjects will have 24hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at 0, 14 and 28 days. Blood pressure will be measured every half hour between 9am-9pm, and once every hour between 9pm-9am.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The brain chemical serotonin is involved in both anxiety and the regulation of the autonomic nervous system (the main system involved in regulating blood pressure).  A dysfunction relating to serotonin may explain why anxiety and hypertension often co-occur. 

Individuals with both a clinical anxiety disorder (Panic Disorder) and Hypertension will be offered a routine course of the serotonergic medication Sertraline  which is a licensed treatment of anxiety disorders in Australia. Participants continue to take their usual medications throughout the study, including antihypertensives. Blood pressure is studied over a one-month period

This work may result in an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which
hypertension and anxiety are linked, and may provide evidence to support targeted future therapies.</summary>
