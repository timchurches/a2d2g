  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - IASD System II implant
Other interventions - intra-cardiac echocardiography (ICE), or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)

Experimental: Treatment - Patients randomized to the treatment arm will undergo a fluoroscopically and intra-cardiac echocardiography (ICE), or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guided trans-septal puncture and IASD System II implant procedure.

Sham Comparator: Control - Patients randomized to the control arm will undergo ICE from the femoral vein or TEE for examination of the atrial septum and left atrium.


Treatment: devices: IASD System II implant
The primary component of the system is an implant placed in the atrial septum designed to allow left to right flow between the left atrium and right atrium to reduce the elevated left atrial pressure.

Other interventions: intra-cardiac echocardiography (ICE), or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)
intra-cardiac echocardiography (ICE), or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for examination of the atrial septum and left atrium.
