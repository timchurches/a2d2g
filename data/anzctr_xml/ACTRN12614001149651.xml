  <interventions>
    <interventions>The education will consist of a PowerPoint program with graphically designed and culturally relevant content synchronized with key activities for the child. It will be delivered by one of the asthma educators (researchers).  In the intervention group, after completing the research record, the education session (the SSP) was conducted. The core asthma education content will cover information about asthma, asthma triggers, different asthma medications and their use, self-management and first-aid skills. This content was embedded within an audio visual dialogue using Power Point. The child was involved simultaneously by providing them with a child friendly workbook which matched the audio-visual education of the parents. The educational session will take an hour usually (ranging from 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes). Handouts of the audio-visual education will be provided to the parents/caregivers of children with asthma. Following the education, children will set a few key goals to achieve for their asthma, and the child-carer pair will be referred onsite to a physician for the usual consultation appointment and an asthma action plan, which is usually 15- 20 minutes. The template suggested by National Asthma Council Australia was used. A section is also developed in the patient asthma record to investigate whether the child had an action plan, if they had it, then they were further queried about who wrote the plan and how confident the parent and the child were in using it. The adherence and barriers to adherence will be mapped by using modified sections of a previously validated brief medication questionnaire (BMQ). 
The Follow up plan: A face to face appointment will be conducted at 1 and 6 months after baseline for the intervention group. The intervention group will also receive a reminder telephone call 3 months after baseline where goal setting progress and any changes in medication or general asthma management were reviewed. The 1 month and 6 month follow-up will include re-measuring all the outcome measures collected at baseline. At these visits the physician was not involved. At 6 months, the parent-child pair  will be asked to complete a customized 'satisfaction' questionnaire in addition to re-completing the other questionnaires completed at baseline 
</interventions>
    <comparator>In the control group, parents and children will be given a standard information pack and requested to obtain an action plan as they move on to see their doctor for a 'usual appointment'. Standard information included information about asthma symptoms, triggers, medications, adherence, medication related beliefs, inhaler technique, using a written asthma action plan, setting health goals.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, IL, USA) will be used for data analysis. Test for normality will be performed using the one sample, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For between groups comparisons, if the data are normally distributed Students t-test for independent samples or 1 way ANOVA (e.g. to compare more than 2 groups) will be used. For non-normal data Fisher Exact test or Mann Whitney U test will be used. For within group comparisons, if the data are normally distributed repeated measures t tests for paired samples or Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test will be used.   The level of significance was set at 0.05 for all statistical tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthma is possibly one of the most common non-infectious respiratory diseases among Indian children. Although asthma cannot be cured, appropriate management can control the condition effectively. Medication is pivotal in asthma control. Appropriate use of medications in children is associated with an array of factors  such as parental beliefs, fears and socioeconomic circumstances, characteristics of the child, the medication regimen and device selected, and the prescribing physician. Whilst many educational interventions have been effectively implemented for improving paediatric asthma control and adherence, only a few studies focus on medication or have education directed simultaneously on the parent and the child. There is thus an urgent need to design educational programs for children, focusing on medication use in asthma, which have clear objectives and meet the local needs. This educational intervention will enhance the understanding of children with asthma and their parents/carer, empower them with self management skills and hence improve the quality of their use of asthma medications.
