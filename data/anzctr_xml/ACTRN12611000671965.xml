    <interventions>Oxytocin nasal spray - Participants will receive 2 daily doses of oxytocin (36 International Units per day) for the duration of the entire trial, 6 weeks.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Persons attending day programs, inpatients and outpatients
with Anorexia Nervosa will be approached to participate in the study. Informed consent procedures will be followed in
recruiting persons to the study, parental consent will be sought for individuals 16 to 18 years of age. All potential participants in the study will have been screened using the Eating Disorder Examination 16th Edition (EDE 16.0D) to confirm diagnosis. Participants will be randomly assigned to the Oxytocin or Placebo Treatment by computer program. A
member of the Brain and Mind Research Institute, along side a compouding chemist, will be responsible for the random allocation of participants. Nobody at the data collection site will be aware of the group to which the participant has been allocated to.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to ascertain whether inhaled oxytocin might have therapeutic potential in reducing the cognitive rigidity and social anxiety that have been shown to be important perpetuating factors in Anorexia Nervosa. Participants will be analysed to determine whether oxytocin brings about any improvements in thinking which might help patients with Anorexia Nervosa to recover more easily.</summary>
