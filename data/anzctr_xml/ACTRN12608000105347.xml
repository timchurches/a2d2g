  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three groups:  Fasting alone vs. minimal residue diet alone vs. mechanical bowel preparation and minimal residue diet.

Fasting alone - see comparator/control treatment below
Minimal residue diet - 1 day before surgery: no solid food or milk products to be consumed, clear fluids allowed. On the day of surgery: for morning surgery patients are advised to eat and drink normally up until the day before surgery and to have nothing to eat or drink from midnight (this includes water) and for afternoon surgery, no solids are allowed after midnight, but clear fluids such as Gatorade and water are allowed until 6am only.   Patients will be advised if they are having morning or afternoon surgery. 

Full Mechanical Bowel Prep - 2 days before surgery: no solid foods, full liquid diet, milk products allowed.  1 day before surgery: no solid food or milk products to be consumed, clear fluids allowed.  One 15.5g sachet of sodium picosulphate (Picoprep) no later than 3pm, and a 2nd sachet 4-6 hours later. Only 2 sachets of osmotic laxative will be used in this study.  On the day of surgery: for morning surgery patients are advised to eat and drink normally up until the day before surgery and to have nothing to eat or drink from midnight (this includes water) and for afternoon surgery, no solids are allowed after midnight, but clear fluids such as Gatorade and water are allowed until 6am only.   Patients will be advised if they are having morning or afternoon surgery.</interventions>

    <summary>AIM: To determine the impact of mechanical bowel preparation on patient symptomatology and surgical field in deep pelvic gynaecological laparoscopic surgery. 
HYPOTHESIS: That there is no difference in patient comfort or the surgical field when patients have mechanical bowel preparation by
fasting alone, minimal residue diet alone or minimal residue diet with osmotic mechanical bowel preparation prior to
advanced laparoscopic gynaecological procedures involving the posterior compartment
BACKGROUND: For advanced gynaecological procedures involving
the posterior compartment, there is, as yet no evidence to support or refute the use of mechanical bowel preparation,
despite its widespread use in clinical practice. Only one study has assessed the impact of mechanical bowel
preparation prior to gynaecological laparoscopic surgery, demonstrating increased patient preoperative discomfort with bowel preparation (1)
