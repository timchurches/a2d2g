  <interventions>
    <interventions>The clinical trial will test the effectiveness of a head-mounted display in supporting anaesthetist activity in the operating theatre. The head-mounted display will be the Microvision Nomad(tm) see-through monocular display.

Trial aims are to do the following:

1. Implement a clinical prototype of a monitoring display using an HMD connected to a Philips IntelliVue MP70 patient monitor.
2. Provide participants with enough exposure to the HMD that they can develop new scanning patterns that make specific use of the HMD.
3. Evaluate the HMD under clinical circumstances, as opposed to the simulated OR.
4. Compare the performance of participants across anaesthesia lists during which they do vs. do not wear the head-mounted display.

Each participant will be studied over six sessions, the sessions no less than a day apart and usually no more than a week apart. The study itself will be completed by 31 December 2008.</interventions>
    <comparator>The effectiveness of the head-mounted display will be evaluated using a crossover design. Performance and behaviour will be compared across lists during which the anaesthetist does vs. does not wear the head-mounted display.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rating of anaesthetist's effectiveness using objective scoring system (eg. the Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills or ANTS rating system)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ratings will be made by subject-matter experts after the trial is completed on the basis of video collected during the trial.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency with which anaesthetists turn their heads to examine the standard patient monitoring system and pattern over time of head-turns.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Head-turns will be coded after completion of the trial on the basis of video collected during the trial.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Latency for anaesthetists to respond to changes in patient vital signs or other significant events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Latency to respond will be measured after completion of the trial on the basis of video collected during the trial.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anaesthetists' subjective satisfaction with the head-mounted display.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Satisfaction will be measured after completion of the trial on the basis of questionnaire responses collected during the trial.</timepoint>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants must be anaesthesia consultants or senior registrars working at Royal Adelaide Hospital. Participants must be able to comfortably view the patient monitoring information on the head-mounted display as well as the outer field of view. Participants who have prior experience with the head-mounted display from previous simulator-based experiments are preferred.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria are:
1. Inability to comfortably view patient vital signs on the head-mounted display.
2. Inability to wear the head-mounted display due to interference with glasses or discomfort caused by the headgear.</exclusivecriteria>
