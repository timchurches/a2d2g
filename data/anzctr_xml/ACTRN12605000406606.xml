    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants rated their symptoms daily using the Menstrual Health Questionnaire. From this data the mean daily scores from each follicular phase (cycle days 5 - 11, with day 1 being the first day of menstration) and each late luteal phase (days -1 to -7 from the next menstruation) were extracted so that the PMSS score could be calculated for each menstrual cycle</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted over 42 weeks using parallel groups of individuals with prospectively confirmed mild to moderate premenstrual tension.  The primary outcome measure was the Premenstrual Symptom Score (PMSS) assessed by questionnaire.  Women were initially enrolled based on the Menstrual Health Questionnaire results taken at baseline.  They then completed the assessment instrument each day for 2-3 menstrual cycles.  Subjects were then excluded if they did not demonstrate a 30% increase in premenstrual symptoms between the follicular and luteal phases of 2 consecutive cycles.  Only subjects meeting these criteria were randomised for the intervention phase.

The treatment arms were 1) Swisse Ultivite for Women and 2) placebo.  Minimal side effects were reported during the treatment period.  Initial consideration of the data pertaining to liver, renal and hemopoietic function showed no clinically significant changes.  

There were significant reductions in premenstrual syndrome symptoms between the pre-treatment and post treatment stages of the study for both the placebo and active treatments.</summary>
