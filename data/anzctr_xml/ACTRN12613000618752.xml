25.  Detection of any drug  in the urine drug screen unless there is an explanation acceptable to the medical investigator (eg the subject has stated in advance that they consumed a prescription or OTC product which contained the detected drug) and/or the subject has a negative drug screen on retest by the pathology laboratory.  These drugs include: Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, Barbituates, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Methadone, Opiates, Phencyclidine, Tetrahydrocannabinols and Tricyclic anti-depressants.
26. Evidence of any condition that, in the opinion of the clinical investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives or pose excessive risks to participants
27. G-6-PD deficiency

Although not exclusion criteria, volunteers will be asked to answer the following questions to enable interpretation and analysis of immunogenicity data:
28. History of malaria
29. Travelled to or lived (&gt;2 weeks) in a malaria-endemic country during the past 12 months or planned to travel to a malaria-endemic country during the course of the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is examining the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in humans of an inoculum containing tafuramycin-A treated P. falciparum NF54.   Participants will receive a single inoculum which consists of human red blood cells containing P. falciparum NF54 malaria parasites that have been attenuated with tafuramycin-A.  Following administration of the inoculum, we will monitor participants for adverse events and for any symptoms/signs of a developing malaria infection (which would indicate that attenutation of the malaria parasite was incomplete).  We will also be assessing the way the immune system responds.  </summary>
