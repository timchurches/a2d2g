  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients who had undergone an uncomplicated ACL reconstruction procedure and were in
             satisfactory health were included in the study

          -  In addition, they needed to have a baseline pain intensity of = 50 mm on the VAS and
             "moderate to severe" pain on the categorical scale within 8 hours of the completion of
             the surgical procedure to be included</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patient was scheduled to undergo any other surgical procedure, along with the
             orthopedic procedure, that was expected to produce a greater degree of surgical trauma
             than the orthopedic procedure alone

          -  The patient was undergoing bilateral knee arthroscopy

          -  The patient used conventional NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, or Tramadol during the 6 hours
             preceding surgery, during surgery or subsequent to the end of surgery, until
             randomization

          -  The patient received oxaprozin or piroxicam within one week prior to randomization

          -  The patient was required to take muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants,
             tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics and neuroleptics, in the post operative period
             after the patient was randomized into the study

          -  The patient had been treated with patient controlled analgesia subsequent to the end
             of the surgical procedure</exclusivecriteria>
