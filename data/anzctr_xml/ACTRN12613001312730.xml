  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a brief four-week group-administered treatment program of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT-I) for older adults with sleep maintenance insomnia.

Design: Randomized controlled trial of CBT-I compared to waitlist control with comparisons at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow up. 

Setting: Flinders University Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Research Laboratory, Adelaide, South Australia. 

Participants: One-hundred and eighteen (mean age = 63.76 years, SD = 6.45, Male = 55) adults with sleep maintenance insomnia. 

Interventions: A four-week, group-based treatment program of CBT-I including bedtime restriction therapy, sleep education and cognitive restructuring. 

Measurements: Seven-day sleep diaries, actigraphy, and several self-report measures to assess perceived insomnia severity, daytime functioning, confidence in and beliefs about sleep.

Results: The brief group-administered CBT-I program produced robust and durable improvements in the timing and quality of sleep, perceived insomnia severity, daytime functioning, and participants confidence in and beliefs about sleep. 

Conclusions: The treatment program used in the current study has demonstrated impressive potential for a brief, inexpensive, and effective treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia in the older adult population.</summary>
