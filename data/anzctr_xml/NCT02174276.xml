  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of GS-4774 in adults with
      chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) and who are currently not on treatment. Participants will
      be randomized to receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) alone or GS-4774 plus TDF for 20
      weeks. After Week 20, GS-4774 will be discontinued. All participants will continue on TDF and
      will be followed for an additional 28 weeks. Following completion of the 48 week study
      period, all participants will be eligible for a 3 year registry study.</summary>
