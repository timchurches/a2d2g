  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group: Power, strength, and aerobic exercise training
Setting: Supervised by a research assistant in a gym set up in the residence of the participants (subsidized apartments for the elderly)
Modality: Machine-based multi-modal training using Keiser pneumatic resistance machines, Nu-step seated stepper machines and StairMaster stairclimber machine.
Frequency: 3 days per week
Intensity: Power training at 80% 1 repetition maximum, progressed each session as guided by daily use of Borg perceived exertion scale (15-17/20 or "hard to lift") and monthly repeat 1 repetition maximum testing.  Strength training at 80% of 1 repetition maximum, progressed as for power training each session throughout the year.  Aerobic training at 60% Heart rate reserve, calculated from peak aerobic capacity testing with indirect calorimetry, and progressed each session as guided by heart rate monitors during all exercise bouts and perceived exertion (12-14/20 on Borg perceived exertion scale).
Volume: Each session lasted approximately 1 hour. 1 set of 8 repetitions of strength training, 1 set of 8 repetitions of power training, 20 minutes of aerobic exercise.
Speed of contraction: As fast as possible for concentric phase for power training, 3 seconds for eccentric phase, 1 second rest between reps, 1 min rest between sets minimum.  For strength training, same except that concentric phase lasted 3 seconds.
Machines used: Chest press, seated row, leg press, hip abduction, knee extension.
Length of intervention: 1 year.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group:  Seated stretching and mild calesthenics for 1 hour , 2 days per week in small group setting supervised by research assistant. Heart rate monitored to keep it within 10 beats of resting heart rate.  No use of equipment, no progression over the course of the year.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>Placebo control group was a sham exercise condition (seated stretching/calesthenics of low intensity) Subjects were blinded to the investigators' hypotheses as to which was the preferred intervention. Muscle strength and power and physical performance testing was single-blinded. Therapists (Exercise trainers) were not blinded. Data collection by research staff was not blinded except for blood tests, stress tests and computerized tomography scanning. Data analyst was blinded for body composition, muscle biopsy, nutritional biochemistries, aerobic capacity testing and gait analysis. Questionnaires were interveiwer-administered.  Subjects were blinded as to which was the hypothesized effective intervention, both were presented as potentially beneficial for the study outcomes.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Disability in older adults is multi-factorial, and in part related to age-related changes in exercise capacity, including muscle strength, power, and endurance. To address these multiple areas, more than one kind of exercise may be needed to optimize function. Therefore, we are testing the efficacy of a combined program of strength, power and cardiovascular fitness training on functional independence, health status, psycholgocial health and physical performance over one year.</summary>
