  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free Survival (EFS) - EFS was defined as the time interval from date of study entry to date of disease progression, disease recurrence, second malignant neoplasm or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, or to the date of last follow-up for patients without events. EFS was estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. 3-year estimates are reported with 95% CI's.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time interval from date of study entry to date of death from any cause or to the date of last follow-up for survivors. OS was estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. 3-year estimates are reported with 95% CI's. For purposes of this analysis, arms I, III and V [IFRT] are combined and compared to arms II, IV and VI [PFRT].</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Local Posterior Fossa (LPF) Failure Rate - LPF failure was defined as tumor recurrence/progression within the tumor bed. The cumulative incidence (CI) of LPF failure was estimated; 3-year estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Patients with other failure types (e.g., NPF) and with other events prior to LPF failure (e.g., death, second malignancy) were considered as having competing events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Non-local Posterior Fossa (NLPF) Failure Rate - NLPF failure was defined as tumor recurrence/progression outside the radiation therapy clinical target volume boost (CTV-boost) but within the posterior fossa CTV (CTV-PF). The cumulative incidence (CI) of NLPF failure was estimated; 3-year estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Patients with other failure types (e.g., NPF, LPF) and with other events prior to NLPF failure (e.g., death, second malignancy) were considered as having competing events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Non-posterior Fossa (NPF) Failure Rate - NPF failure was defined as tumor recurrence within the neuroaxis but outside the radiation therapy clinical target volume (CTV). The cumulative incidence (CI) of NPF failure was estimated; 3-year estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Patients with other failure types (e.g., LPF failure) and with other events prior to NPF failure (e.g., death, second malignancy) were considered as having competing events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-treatment Endocrine Function (Growth Hormone (GH) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) as Measured by Laboratory Assessment) - Growth hormone stimulation tests were performed and noted as normal or abnormal at baseline and after completion of therapy/follow-up. Proportions of patients with abnormal results after completion of therapy will be calculated and reported separately for LDCSI vs. SDCSI patients. Mean post-treatment TSH levels will be reported by CSI group. Eligible and evaluable patients 3-7 years of age will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-treatment Grade 3+ Hearing Loss as Measured by CTCAE v4 - Proportions of patients with grade 3+ hearing loss after the completion of therapy will be calculated and reported separately for LDCSI vs. SDCSI patients. Eligible and evaluable patients 3-7 years of age will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 1 year after the end of treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-treatment Neurocognitive Function as Measured by the Estimated Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) and Also the Metacognition Index (MI) on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) - Average scores for FSIQ and MI will be reported at each of the 3 neurocognitive assessment time points by LDCSI vs. SDCSI groups. All eligible and evaluable patients 3-7 years of age will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years post-diagnosis</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Grade 3+ Hearing Loss at 1-year Post Treatment as Assessed by CTCAE Version 4 - Proportions of pts with grade 3+ hearing impairment as assessed by CTCAE v4 at 1-year post treatment were calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year after end of treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Endocrine Dysfunction as Measured by Growth Hormone Stimulation Test at the Completion of Therapy. - Incidence rates of abnormal growth hormone stimulation tests at the after completion of therapy assessment will be reported separately for eligible and evaluable IFRT and PFRT patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After completion of therapy, an average of 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Death From Any Cause / Overall Survival (OS) by Molecular Subgroup Based on Methylation Arrays - Three-year survival rates will be reported by methylation subgroup. Randomized eligible and evaluable patients (patients without disease dissemination or excess residual disease by central review and patients without anaplastic histology) will be included.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Recurrence, Progression or Death Due to Cancer / Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Molecular Subgroup Based on Methylation Arrays - Time from study entry to disease progression, relapse or death due to cancer or to last follow-up. Deaths from causes that are clearly not associated with tumor recurrence or progression and second malignancies will be censored. Three-year PFS rates will be reported by methylation subgroup. Randomized eligible and evaluable patients (patients without disease dissemination or excess residual disease by central review and patients without anaplastic histology) will be included.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compliance Rates for All Eligible and Evaluable Patients Enrolled - A patient will be considered to be compliant if the patient/parent participated in the PedsQLTM v4 and the ABAS assessment. The patient should have a PedsQL total score which measures quality of life and a general adaptive composite (GAC) score which measures adaptive functioning. Compliance rates will be assessed at each of the 3 neurocognitive/quality of life assessment time points. All eligible and evaluable patients enrolled on ACNS0331 will be used. Patients removed from treatment prior to the time of neuropsychological assessment (for reasons such as disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, etc.) will not be included in the denominator to assess the compliance rate.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying how well standard-dose radiation therapy works
      compared to reduced-dose radiation therapy in children 3-7 years of age AND how well standard
      volume boost radiation therapy works compared to smaller volume boost radiation therapy when
      given together with chemotherapy in treating young patients who have undergone surgery for
      newly diagnosed standard-risk medulloblastoma. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, cisplatin, lomustine,
      and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Giving radiation therapy with chemotherapy after surgery may kill any
      remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether standard-dose radiation therapy is more
      effective than reduced-dose radiation therapy when given together with chemotherapy after
      surgery in treating young patients with medulloblastoma.</summary>
