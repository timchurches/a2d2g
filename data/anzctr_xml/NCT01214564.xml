  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is primarily designed to investigate whether treatment, once daily for up to three
      consecutive days, with PEP005 (ingenol mebutate) Gel, 0.05% will be safe and tolerable in
      patients with Seborrhoeic Keratosis on non-head locations. The secondary endpoint is to
      investigate the efficacy of PEP005 Gel, 0.05% when administered for up to three consecutive
      days to Seborrhoeic Keratosis on non-head locations.</summary>
