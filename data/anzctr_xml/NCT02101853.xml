    <summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well blinatumomab works compared with standard
      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that
      has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed). Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      blinatumomab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet
      known whether standard combination chemotherapy is more effective than blinatumomab in
      treating relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</summary>
