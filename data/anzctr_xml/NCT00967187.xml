Treatment: drugs: bevirimat dimeglumine
Patients will be treated with MPC-4326 200mg monotherapy for 14 days. Once the Day 15 viral load results become available, patients, who achieve at least a 0.5 log10 reduction in viral load by Day 15 will have the option to continue on both MPC-4326 and an optimized background regimen (OBR) through Week 72.
