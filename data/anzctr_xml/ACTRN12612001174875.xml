  <interventions>
    <interventions>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS).
	This clinical trial will be conducted with a single arm of rTMS, with the standard arm parameters used derived from our estimate of best practice. A MagStim Rapid magnetic stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, UK), connected with a figure-of-eight coil with a diameter of 70mm, will be used to deliver stimuli with the coil handle pointing posteriorly and 45degrees below the coronal plane.
	Prior to the commencement of the treatment course, resting motor threshold is measured with single-pulse TMS applied to the motor cortex. The resting motor threshold was measured as the minimal stimulator intensity producing a visible peripheral motor evoked potential response by inspection.
	A total of 2000 pulses (40 trains) will be delivered in a session (20 minutes). 10Hz for 5 seconds, with 25 second break between trains. Intensity is set at 100% of magnetic threshold. Application over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDPFC)
	Daily sessions will continue up to a maximum of 10 (2 weeks, 20000 pulses).</interventions>

    <designfeatures>As Introduced, the requirements for timely standard treatment attempts restricts the scope for application of rTMS.clinical. Standard medication must have been attempted with unsatisfactory results. In addition, the application of ECT must have been considered. Unsuccessful ECT would likely indicate that rTMS will have similar or less effect. These chronic cases will be recruited, but rTMS investigations would probably be most informative in those cases where ECT is not possible for other reasons. Clearly these cases will be reported separately. Written documentation of previous treatment attempts will be included.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that can occur due to medical or psychiatric disorder. It is a behavioral syndrome that can be associated with schizophrenia, shizoaffective disorder, or atypical psychosis.
ECT was found to be effective for both catatonic stupor and excitement, where benzodiazepine or neuroleptics may not prove successful, and has proven to increase intracortical inhibition (ICI) which is reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Since TMS has been shown to alter cortical excitability, this provides a rationale for moving from ECT to TMS based treatment. Essentially arguing by analogy with ECT, and its effect in depression, three case reports appear to show an ECT-like effect of rTMS in catatonic schizophrenia. All studies used facilitatory fast rTMS (10Hz and 20Hz) although on opposite sides of the prefrontal cortex.
In this study we will replicate the best practice application of rTMS in the treatment of catatonia. Since this paradigm is similar to an existing treatment for depression at our unit, no additional preparation is required. As suitable participants are expected to be uncommon, a case series approach will allow us to recruit opportunistically, over an extended period, as clinically warranted. Findings will be reported as a series of case studies, or accumulated as a case series report, depending on the number of cases.
This is a fairly novel application of rTMS, but builds on our units experience with rTMS, and Dr Lees previous experience in catatonia research, to contribute to this emerging field. The objective is to answer two questions. Whether rTMS will affect catatonia, and what are the clinical circumstances that indicate rTMS treatment. A series of case findings will give an indication of an answer, and inform local treatment consideration.</summary>
