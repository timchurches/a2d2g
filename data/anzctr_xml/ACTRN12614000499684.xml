  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a facility level study in which a multidisciplinary, generic intervention is targeted on long-term care facilities for older people, with the aim of reducing avoidable acute  hospitalisations for five conditions: stroke, ischaemic heart disease, COPD, pneumonia and congestive cardiac failure. 

The ARCHIP intervention is designed to provide intensive intervention and staff clinical coaching to improve assessment and care planning for those recently discharged from hospital with the big 5 diagnoses as described above. The Gerontology Nurse Specialist (GNS) will visit intervention facilities weekly for 3 months. Multidisciplinary team meetings will occur for approximately 20% to 25% of residents in each region.  The facility will have direct telephone access to the geriatrician during normal business hours. Descriptions of each of the components of the intervention are described below:

a.	Post Hospitalisation Care Planning Clinical Coaching for facility RN by the GNS:
 
Residents newly discharged from hospital will be targeted by the GNS as the subject of a clinical coaching to hone RN assessment and care planning skills. The following methods will be employed: Clinical Coaching, Case Study, Red Flag Recognition, Clinical Communication Skills, Advance Care Planning, GNS Care Coordination and  Multi-disciplinary meetings. 

b.	Multidisciplinary Team Meetings (MDT) Processes and Procedures:

It is estimated that approximately 6 residents will be reviewed at a typical MDT meeting (up to 20%-25% of total residents in 1-4 MDT meetings).  The criteria for selecting residents for discussion in the MDT meeting are as follows for residents with one of the big 5 diagnoses (as described above):

*      New acute hospital admissions within the last month 
*      New admissions to the facility
*      Those residents on 9 or more medications
*      Any resident with important change(s) in physical or cognitive status since last review 
*      Any resident who has been subject to an incident report since last review

The GNS and facility clinical staff will create a list for the MDT using the above prioritised criteria. Residents will be reviewed in the order of highest priority. The GNS will finalise the list of residents to be discussed at the MDT in collaboration with the facility RN.  The GNS with the RN will prepare a clinical review and assess each resident to be discussed, and work with senior nurse to contact family about MDT review. 

MDT meeting participants will include: 
*      Residents General Practitioner (GP)
*      Facility Senior Nurse
*      DHB Geriatrician
*      GNS
*      Community pharmacist
*      Other available and relevant health professionals will be invited to participate as needed and available such as: dietitians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and/or social workers.  
</interventions>
    <comparator>Facilities are their own controls in a before/after design using a stepped-wedge analysis. 

National Ministry of Health databases will be used to :
a) identify residents in each participating facility in receipt of a government residential care subsidy over defined time period prior to and during the trial, and
b) identify all hospitalisations of those residents during the period for that facility, centred on the data at which the intervention began in each facility. 
c) Rates of admissions post-commencement will be compared to rates post-intervention, for the five diagnoses of interest: stroke, ischaemic heart disease, COPD, pneumonia and congestive cardiac failure. </comparator>

      <outcome>Acute hospitalisations with a first diagnosis of one of those five conditions: stroke, ischaemic heart disease, COPD, pneumonia and congestive cardiac failure.
These will be established from electronic medical records submitted to the national hospitalisation and death record systems, through the DHB, and using the first ICD diagnosis code associated with each admission.  </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The trial is not a randomised controlled trial, but a translational study of an intervention previously trialed. That trial used 36 facilities, this will use about 24-30, and that determined largely by the resources available, knowing that before-after trials are considerably more efficient than randomised trials. No forma l power calculations were conducted for this study.  

Stepped wedge design in which hospital admissions (for the five conditions described) and resident deaths will be monitored and expressed as a rate per bed-days of subsidised residents. We will also monitor RAC staff turnover. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older people who are residents of rest homes and private hospitals are commonly admitted acutely to public hospitals because of potentially avoidable deterioration in medical conditions such as heart diseases, chronic lung disease and stroke. Such acute hospital admissions commonly have adverse consequences for the older person. 
The current study will provide added intervention (nurses, geriatricians, pharmacists) working with the rest home/private staff and general practitioners, with the aim of preventing such avoidable acute hospital admissions for these five medical conditions.</summary>
