    <summary>This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of 3 formulations of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine
      compared to 2 control groups receiving licensed meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine
      and/or licensed Hib conjugate vaccine administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Antibody
      persistence and immune responses to polysaccharide vaccine boosters were additionally
      assessed at 11 to 14 months of age.</summary>
