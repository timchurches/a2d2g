    <studytitle>Retrospective/prospective Clinical Study of AcrySof (Registered Trademark) IQ ReSTOR (Registered Trademark) +2.5 D Multifocal Toric Intraocular Lenses, which will collect information about the safety and effectiveness (how the lens works) from participants who have had cataract surgery and been implanted with these intraocular lenses</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety
(adverse events) and effectiveness (residual cylinder and visual acuity) of the ACRYSOF IQ ReSTOR +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL in primary eyes of subjects at least 3 months and no more than 14 months after IOL implantation. The primary eye is defined as the eye of a subject that qualifies with the most recent implantation of the study lens (ACRYSOF IQ ReSTOR +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL Models SV25T2- SV25T5).

      <outcome>Safety (including adverse events)

Medical Records and an examination of the eye and discussion with patient. Tools and tests used are Visual Acuity, Manifest Refraction, Adverse Event Assessment, Secondary Surgical Interventions, Slit Lamp Exam, Dilated Fundus Examination, Device Deficiency Assessment. Examples of adverse events may be 
*Halos (circles) or lines around light sources in nighttime conditions
*Decreased contrast sensitivity in low light conditions (ex. Driving at night or in poor visibility conditions)
*Rotation of the lens from the original placement on the eye can decrease astigmatic correction

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a retrospective and prospective clinical study comprised of a retrospective chart review for preoperative, surgical and early postoperative data and a prospective postoperative visit conducted at least 3 months but not more than 14 months after IOL implantation. The study is unmasked with no control group, no randomization and will include approximately 4 sites.

The primary  objective of the study is to characterize  the safety (adverse events) and effectiveness (residual cylinder  and visual acuity) of the AcrySof IQ ReSTOR +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL in primary eyes of subjects at least 3 months  and no more than 14 months  after IOL implantation. The primary eye is defined as the eye of a subject that qualifies with the most recent implantation of the study lens (AcrySof IQ ReSTOR +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL Models SV25T2-SV25T5)
