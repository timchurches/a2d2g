  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Home Monitoring Guided OAC
Treatment: drugs - Physician-Directed OAC

Experimental: Home Monitoring Guided OAC - Home Monitoring is fully enabled and continuous remote surveillance data is available to investigators. Patients will be treated according to a predefined anticoagulation plan, which uses the total duration of AF/AFL combined with patients' CHADS2 score to determine the start, stop, and restart of OAC.

Active Comparator: Physician-Directed OAC - In Control (Group 2), Home Monitoring is active for Safety Net alerts, but the remote AF/AFL data is not revealed to the patient or treating physician. These patients receive physician-directed OAC consistent with current standards of care.
Safety Net data include:
ERI/EOS
Special Implant Status
Implant in Backup Mode (ROM)
VT/ VF Detection Inactive
Emergency Pacing
250 O &gt; RV Pacing Impedance &gt; 1500 O
Symptomatic VT/VF therapies including both ATP and shock
VT/VF storm
HM transmission failure &gt;3 days


Treatment: drugs: Home Monitoring Guided OAC
Active monitoring for atrial episodes through the automatic HM notifications (email, fax, short message service) is required. If the total duration over 48 consecutive hours reaches the predefined anticoagulation condition, and AF/AFL diagnosis is confirmed using the IEGM online, the site instructs the patient by telephone to start OAC. Clinicians continue to monitor patients using HM, and if freedom from AF/AFL reaches the predefined interval, stop of OAC therapy is requested over the telephone. Following stop of anticoagulation, any recurrence of AF/AFL requires restart of OAC therapy.
OAC drugs used: Dabigatran etexilate, Rivaroxaban, Warfarin, other approved VKA

Treatment: drugs: Physician-Directed OAC
Patients will receive physician-directed anticoagulation therapy based on conventional criteria.
OAC drugs used: Dabigatran etexilate, Rivaroxaban, Warfarin, other approved VKA

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite Primary Endpoint: Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Patients Without a Stroke, Systemic Embolism, or Major Bleed - The primary endpoint is to demonstrate whether early detection of atrial arrhythmias based on BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring technology combined with a predefined anticoagulation plan in the Home Monitoring Guided OAC group is superior to the Physician-Directed OAC group reflecting conventional care and physician directed treatment of AF in terms of risk reduction of the primary composite endpoint including stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of enrollment until date of primary endpoint event, assessed up to study exit, with a mean treatment duration of 2.0 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rates of All-cause Mortality, Stroke (Ischemic and Hemorrhagic, Disabling and Non-disabling, Cardioembolic and Non-cardioembolic), and Major Bleeding, as Well as the AF Burden, Quality of Life, and Mean Heart Rate Reduction. - Secondary endpoints will be evaluated in a hierachical closed test procedure. If at the termination of the study, the result for the primary endpoint is found to have reached statistical significance, then Secondary Endpoints will be tested in turn for statistical significance at a 0.05 significance level. If at any stage, however, a non-significant result is found, no further testing of remaining secondary endpoints for statistical analysis will occur.</outcome>
