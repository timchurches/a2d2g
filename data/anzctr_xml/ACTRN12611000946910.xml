  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 3 arms to this trial. Arm 1: mood enhanced Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for medically unexplained symptoms. Arm 2: Structured Care. Both interventions are administered using once-weekly 30-minute sessions of one-on-one therapy with a primary care physician over 4 consultations with an option for 2 additional consultations. Arm 1, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy includes an initial ethnographic illness interview and then metaphor based cognitive restructuring to reduce abnormal illness behaviour, breathing retraining for anxiety symptoms, and activity scheduling for depression symptoms, with sleep hygiene instruction. Arm 2, Structured Care involves an initial ethnographic illness interview followed by time matched clinical sessions with a primary care physician without the CBT content</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3: Treatment as Usual will involve short primary care consultations consistent with current practice within Vietnam. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 12-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 14 months.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>(1) Screen positive on the somatisation scale of the Phan Vietnamese Rating scale defined as a SUM score above 21
(2) Report experiencing five or more medically unexplained symptoms for a period of at least 6 months.

A medically unexplained symptom is defined on the basis of at least one of the following (a) incompatibility of the clinical presentation with a known physical illness, (b) absence of relevant positive physical signs, (c) laboratory investigations not supporting a diagnosis of a physical illness. 
A symptom is defined as a distinctive subjective sensation or a personal observation in relation to the body, which the patient describes as abnormal. Similar symptoms (such as pain) experienced at different anatomical sites will be counted as separate symptoms, as will different symptoms at the same anatomical site. 

To elicit medically unexplained symptoms we will use the following questions until no additional symptoms are elicited: 

- What are your symptoms?
- Are there any other symptoms/problems?</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The clinical trial will be undertaken in collaboration with 4 primary health care clinics in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Patients who are found to present with medically unexplained symptoms after extensive medical investigation will be invited to participate in the clinical trial. Results from an earlier population based survey suggests that up to 50% of people with MUS may have comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder.
Initial screen and referral: 
Consecutive patients presenting for treatment to one of 4 primary care settings with possible MUS will be screened using the 6 month version of the PVPS somatisation scale. Patients scoring above the clinical threshold will be referred for more comprehensive assessment to one of the Primary Care Physicians working with the research project.

Expanded Assessment: 
Patients referred with possible MUS, will be offered a full medical assessment that will include a consultation with the Primary Care Physician to obtain a history of the presenting complaint and other physical symptoms; a physical investigation of the presenting symptoms; a blood and urine laboratory assay to examine for markers of illness (Full blood and differential white cell; markers of inflammation [ESR/CRP]; urea/electrolytes/creatinine/calcium/magnesium; liver function; thyroid function).  The cost of this consultation and associated investigations will be fully covered by the project and there with no expectation that the patient will agree to participate in the clinical trial.  

Patients identified with MUS who meet the study inclusion criteria will then be provided verbal and written information about the study and invited to participate.


Allocation concealment procedures:
The entry into the study and subsequent randomization will occur by electronic communication (email) by personnel at UNSW who are independent of this treatment study, and will be conducted using a coded number system to ensure that personnel involved in patient assessment will not be aware of randomization results.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patient randomization to treatment condition will be conducted using random permuted blocks within strata. Randomization will be stratified according MUS severity and comorbidity (PVPS diagnosis of depression or anxiety).  Randomization will be conducted using a coded number system to ensure that personnel involved in the assessments will not be aware of randomization results. All assessments will be conducted by an assessment team blind to the treatment condition.  The permuted blocks will not be clustered within clinics to reduce the possibility of staff guessing randomization protocols. All assessors will be required to rate the condition that they believe the patient has been allocated to at the completion of each assessment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study aims to improve the understanding of patients with 5 or more medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) by undertaking ethnographic and clinical assessments of patients presenting with MUS to one of four primary health care clinics in Ho Chi Minh City; to evaluate the treatment efficacy of interventions for MUS by undertaking a randomised control trial (RCT) and one year follow up of mood enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), structured care (SC), and treatment as usual (TU); and in parallel, to identify the range of Vietnamese stakeholders involved in responding to MUS, and to work with the Vietnamese Ministry of Health and policy officials to enhance the value of evidence generation and policy formulation for the management of MUS</summary>
