  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Venous Thromboembolism Event (VTE) or VTE-related Death - VTE included:
asymptomatic proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) detected by the mandatory CUS and confirmed by a Compression Ultrasound Adjudication Committee (CUSAC) after central and blind review of the mandatory CUS;
symptomatic DVT and non-fatal Pulmonary Embolism (PE) reported by the investigator and confirmed by a Central Independent Adjudication Committee (CIAC) after central and blind review of diagnosis tests.
VTE-related Death included fatal PE and unexplained deaths.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization up to 15 days after randomization or the day of the mandatory Compression Ultrasound (CUS), whichever came first</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced asymptomatic proximal DVT</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization up to 15 days after randomization or the day of the mandatory CUS, whichever came first.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Clinically Relevant Bleedings - Bleedings were centrally and blindly reviewed by the CIAC and classified as:
"major" (fatal, symptomatic in a critical area/organ, causing a post-operative drop in hemoglobin =2 g/dL or requiring post-operative transfusion =2 units of blood);
"clinically relevant non-major" (overt bleeding requiring medical intervention and not meeting criteria for major bleeding);
"Non-clinically relevant bleeding".</outcome>
      <timepoint>From 1st study drug injection up to 3 days after last study drug injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Required the Initiation of Curative Anticoagulant or Thrombolytic Treatment After VTE Assessment - Initiation of curative anticoagulant or thrombolytic treatment after VTE assessment was defined from investigator's answer to the question "was the subject treated for VTE?" asked after the diagnostic tests for suspected VTE and after the mandatory CUS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization up to 15 days after randomization or the day of mandatory CUS, whichever came first</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of once daily [q.d] subcutaneous [s.c.]
      injections of Semuloparin sodium (AVE5026) with q.d. s.c. injections of Enoxaparin for the
      primary prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events [VTE] in patients hospitalized for acute
      medical illness.

      The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of AVE5026 and to document AVE5026
      exposure in this population.</summary>
