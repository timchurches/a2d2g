  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to collect safety information associated with the use of Xyntha
      in a usual care setting. Upon meeting eligibility criteria, patients will be required to have
      approximately 5 study visits over a 2 year period. Procedures completed throughout the study
      include collection of vital signs, physical exams, and laboratory assessments. Patients will
      be required to complete an infusion log for each Xyntha infusion.</summary>
