  <interventions>
    <interventions>Physiotherapy diagnostic classification and  examination ( modified McKenzie diagnostic classification),measurement of transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus muscle using real time ultrasound scanning, flouroscopy guided spinal (either facet, foraminal or epidural) injections - conducted by a neurosurgeon, and determined by the neurosurgeon diagnosis. The procedure consists of instillation of less than 30 mls of 0.25% Bupivicaine (Marcaine) or less than 10 mls of 1% Lignocaine, and 40 mg (per vial) of Methylprednisolone (Depomedrone) as determined by the attending neurosurgeon, into the predetermined spinal structure
Duration of intervention 2hours with two repeat sessions consisting of a 2 week phone interview and 3 month post injection 20minute reexamination. Flouroscopy guided injection as reference standard. This is the usual treatment that would be applied to the study cohort.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>An independant assistant will input data from the physiotherapy examination proforma  into an excel spreadsheet in a format suitable for import to SPSS statistical analysis software (version 20). Physiotherapy classification and neurosurgeon diagnosis will be coded and entered into the same spread sheet. 
Demographic data will be analysed  Diagnostic classification validity will be determined by correlation analysis with positive participant response to spinal injection.  Pre and post injection data will be analysed using SPSS version 20 [SPSS inc., Chicago, IL]. This analysis will specifically include pre and post injection pain rating, provocative movement and muscle size measures. 
To assess the levels of agreement the distribution of classification judgements will be compared between the physiotherapy classification system and the neurosurgeons diagnosis. For each study participant, comparison of the physiotherapy classification and neurosurgeons diagnosis will be conducted and categorized as in agreement (same classification and diagnostic judgment for both raters) or in disagreement (different classification judgments for each rater). Participants will be grouped according to the following outcomes for each classification subgroup:
	
Using the spinal injection as the reference standard an analysis of the level of agreement and disagreement to establish sensitivity and specificity between physiotherapy classification, neurosurgeon diagnosis and spinal injection outcome will also be conducted. For each participant whose classification and injection code agree, a level of &gt; 50% improvement in VAS and NPS will indicate a clinically significant improvement post injection. 
Overall agreement will be calculated as the percentage of classification &amp; diagnosis judgements in which both examiners were in agreement, compared to the total number of possible combinations for both examiners. Contingency tables will establish numbers to calculate the overall percentage agreement. A Kappa coefficient statistic will be used to measure the after chance proportion of agreement between examiners. An un-weighted kappa coefficient will calculate the overall agreement of CLBP classification into diagnostic categories (these will be determined by final physiotherapy classification and neurosurgeon diagnosis codes) with 95% confidence intervals. Any patterns of disagreement between the classification protocol and neurosurgeon will also be evaluated with analysis of predictors of outcome for each classification using linear regression. Predictors will be pre procedure reported pain levels and scores from the quality of life (ODI and RM) and the psychosocial (MSPQ) questionnaires. However, it is anticipated that participant numbers for each classification specific subgroup may be small and therefore linear regression may not be possible. 
RTUS images will be measured and muscle activation will be calculated as a percentage of thickness change between rest and sub-maximal contraction. The mean percentage change for the three repeated measurements from rest to submaximal contraction will be calculated, and a one-way ANOVA will analyse differences between the pre and post injection measurements. Significance level will be set at P &lt; 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are 3 components to this research study.Prior to assessment patients will be asked to completequality of life (QOL) and disability surveys and a visual analogue score (VAS) of their pain. 
1. The McKenzie diagnostic classification (MKD) is used during examination of patients with chronic low
back pain (CLBP) to determine if a joint or disc is likely to be the source of symptoms. It requires the patient
to repeat movements in a number of directions. To determine the validity of this classification system
physiotherapists will assess patients attending the Townsville Hospital Pain Clinic using the MKD. A
neurosurgeon will also examine the patients and at the discretion of the neurosurgeon an injection of the
joint or area surrounding the spinal nerves with anaesthetic and corticosteroid will be performed. The patient
will be reassessed using MKD to determine if the injection has altered the pain response and range of
motion. Outcome measures will be range of motion (ROM), response to MKD and (VAS) for pain.
2. It is known that the core trunk muscles supporting the spine 'switch-off' when pain is present but it is
unknown what direct effect pain relieving injections have on the short term and long term function of the core
muscles. Hence, patient core muscle function will also be assessed prior to and after injection using
ultrasonography.
We hypothesise that the physiotherapy classification pathway will be a valid physiotherapy diagnostic indicator for CLBP patients.  We also hypothesise that the deep spinal postural muscles (transversus abdominis and Lumbar Multifidus) do not immediately start to function normally post spinal anaesthetic injection.</summary>
