  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants receive 3 x 30 minute health education and motivational individual consultations (to encourage increased physical activity, low-fat diet, increased calcium, increased photoestrogens, increased fruit &amp; vegetables, increased water intake and smoking cessation).  These are provided 6 weeks apart (ie, week 0, week 6, week 12).  These individual sessions are accompanied by a book about Managing Mid-life &amp; Older Health Issues for Women and a Journal.  The Journal facilitates/ encourages a change in health behaviour on a daily basis.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: patients receive either a group education session (3 hours) + individual consultation (1 hour) OR 2 x individual consultations (2 hours).  These consultations provide education about the physiology of diabetes, symptoms and complications of diabetes, self mangement and sources of support, the influence of exercise and diet on glycemic control, the healthy heart diet and changing dietary habits, and foot care and avoiding foot complications.  Patients are able to come back for a follow-up appointment at 6 months if they require.</comparator>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All eligible patients of the clinics will be invited to participate. Patients who consent will post their signed consent form to university staff (off-site).  Once the consent form is received, randomisation will occur off-site by a person independent of the project using permuted random blocks stratified by clinic site. A blind procedure will be used; participants will not know which condition they are receiving.  Lists of patients who are allocated to the Intervention condition will be provided to the clinic staff (who deliver the intervention).  The clinic staff who provide the intervention will know which patients receive the intervention; they will not be blinded.</concealment>
