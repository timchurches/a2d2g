  <interventions>
    <interventions>One drop was administrated per application to the on-dominant eye by the primary investigator who is an ophthalmologist. Each participant received three treatments to the non-dominant eye - 3% carbachol and 0.2% brimonidine in both combined and separate forms, carbachol only, and brimonidine only. It is a cross-over trial, so that, the washout period was one week. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: To test and compare in a masked fashion the efficacy of using a parasympathomimetic drug (3 % Carbachol) and an alpha-2 agonist (0.2 % brimonidine) in both combined and separate forms to create optically beneficial miosis to pharmacologically improve vision in presbyopia.
Methods: A prospective, double-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Ten naturally emmetropic and presbyopic subjects between 42 years and 58 years old with an uncorrected distance visual acuity of at least 20/20 in both eyes without additional ocular pathology are eligible for inclusion. All subjects received 3 % carbachol and 0.2 % brimonidine in both combined and separate forms, 3% carbachol alone and 0.2% brimonidine (control) alone in their non-dominant eye in a crossover manner with one week washout between tests. The subjects pupil size and both near and distance visual acuities will be evaluated pre- and posttreatment at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours, by a masked examiner at the same room illumination.
Results: Statistically significant improvement in mean near visual acuity (NVA) was achieved in all subjects who received combined 3 % Carbachol and brimonidine in the same formula compared to those received separate forms or Carbachol alone or brimonidine alone (P&lt; 0.0001).
Conclusion: Based on the data, the combined solution demonstrated greater efficacy than the other solutions that were tested. Improving the depth of focus by making the pupil small caused statistically significant improvement in near visual acuity, with no change in binocular distance vision.
