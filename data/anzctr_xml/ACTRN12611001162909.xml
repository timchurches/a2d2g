  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise intervention to improve blood flow to skeletal muscle thereby decreasing insulin resistance and improving gycaemic control.  Those randomised to the intervention will participate in a 12 week intensive exercise program 3 times per week (1 hour) consisting of a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises tailored to the patient.  They will then be given a home exercise program tailored to them by an accredited exercise physiologist.   The intensive exercise program will be repeated at the end of one year.  Exercise sessions will be in small groups approximately 6-8 participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care.  Usual care consists of any regular medical care or clinic visits perscribed for their diabetes.  No other interventions will be initiated or treatment withheld</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased blood volume in skeletal muscle.  This will be assessed using ultrasound and and ultrasound contrast agent (Definity) which is approved for use in Australia</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in systolic and diasolic left ventricular function.
This will be assessed using echocardiography.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will recruit 200 patients with T2DM between the ages of 25 and 65 with no history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or cardiovascular complications.  We anticipate numbers of men and women to be roughly equal.  All testing will take place at Princess Alexandra Hospital in the cardiovascular clinical measurements department and intensive exercise sessions will also be held at the Princess Alexandra hospital in the cardiovascular imaging research centre gym.  The primary outcome variable of this study will be:
1.	Increased capillary recruitment and glycaemic control
Secondary outcomes measures will be:
1.	Improvement in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function
2.	Improvement in functional capacity.</summary>
