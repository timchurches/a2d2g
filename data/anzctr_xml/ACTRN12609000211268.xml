    <interventions>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT).
Mindfulness is a technique or "mode of being" that is about accepting and being content in the present moment with a non-judgemental and curious attitude.  The MBCT group program involves attending 8-weekly group therapy sessions (2 hour duration).  Groups will consist of a maximum of 10 participants at any one time.  The group program is modified and adapted from Jon Kabat-Zinn's Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) work.</interventions>
    <comparator>Waitlist Controls will not be required to change their daily routines over a 10 week period.  At the end of this 10 week period they will be offered the opportunity to participate in the MBCT group program that will be exactly the same as that received by the participants in the MBCT group program condition.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvements in i) stuttered severity (% syllables stuttered), ii) speakers reactions to their stuttering; iii) communication in daily situations; and iv) quality of life.  Each of these outcomes will be measured using the "Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES)" standardized questionnaire.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project aims to evaluate prospectively the effectiveness of an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) group program implemented for adults who stutter.
The study hypothesis is that the implementation of an 8-week MBCT group program for adults who stutter will facilitate improvements in psychosocial and behavioural functional outcomes post group program and these improvements in therapeutic outcomes will be maintained up to 3 months after completion of the MBCT group program.</summary>
