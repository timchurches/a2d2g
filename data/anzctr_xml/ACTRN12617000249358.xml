    <interventions>Arm 1-Early Treatment with MCP using the AIMhi Stay Strong App

Participants who are randomised to the intervention complete a Motivational Care Plan (MCP) interview using the AIMhi Stay Strong App (on a tablet device) at baseline, with one further session using the App within two to four weeks. Session 1 explores family, current strengths and worries. Participants are encouraged to set 1-2 goals that are achievable, meaningful, and practical for addressing an identified worry. 
The client-centered nature of the intervention ensures the goals are client driven and empowers them to take manageable steps toward achieving that goal. Session 2 reviews and refines the goals (identifies whether goals and steps were achieved) and helps clients address any barriers to goal attainment and set new goals as appropriate. Participants receive a text message or phone call following the initial treatment reminding them of their goals and steps for making change and a further text message or phone call at weeks 10-11 reminding them of the planned 3 month follow up assessments. 

Participants in the early treatment group also receive a further two sessions using the AIMhi Stay Strong app following the 3 month follow up assessment.  The two sessions also occur 2-4 weeks apart and follow a similar format to the sessions received at baseline  reviewing family, strengths, worries and previous goals set and sets new goals. Participants receive a text message or phone call following the initial treatment reminding them of their goals and steps for making change and further text message or phone call at weeks 21-22 reminding them of the planned 6 month follow up assessments. A text message or phone call is received between the two sessions to remind participants of their goals and the time for the next session. Participants in the early treatment group also receive usual care from their renal service provider. 


Sessions using the app involve a supervised session during which the session is completed digitally on the app in a face to face session between participant and research officer/therapist. The app is designed to provide step by step instruction for the therapist and to be used by a range of practitioners with little professional training in counselling such as Indigenous wellbeing workers. The research officers delivering the treatment have varied undergraduate and post graduate qualifications. They have all received specific training in the use of the App and related basic counselling techniques. 
The approximate duration of the treatment session is thirty minutes. The key reason for use of phone reminders rather than text reminders is that of facility with English language. For those with limited English language knowledge a text message is less likely to be an effective means of communication. Most Alice Springs based participants will receive phone calls rather than text messages. The pictorial summary provided is paper based and handed to the participant. It is an electronic summary of what has been entered into the app during the session: supportive family (name, role, relationship); strengths (e.g. work, exercise), stressors (eg physical illness, smoking) and change goals discussed (eg 'decrease smoking' and steps to that goal eg 'contact quit line'). The app software monitors timing of each session and whether each page has been addressed in each session. The researcher/therapist records comments after each session and notes any areas for discussion at regular fidelity review meetings (fortnightly).

    <comparator>Arm 2 - Contact Control/Late Treatment - (CC/LT)

Participants who are randomised to CC/LT receive 20 minutes of contact with the researcher using a culturally appropriate generic health App (i.e. The Hep B Story) at baseline with a further session using the app after three to four weeks. Session 1 of CC goes through the structured Hep B App. Discussion specifically avoids review of family, strengths or individual goal setting. The participant interacts with the App with support from the researcher and discussion focuses on navigation of the App and the App content. A goal is agreed to talk to someone else in their family about the app content before the next session. A pictorial summary (utilising similar colours and images to the intervention summary) is given to the client. Session 2 reviews the information discussed in Session 1. This ensures each group receives the same contact time with researchers and interaction based on a structured App to aid participant blinding and to structure the control session. Participants receive a text message or phone call with a health tip linked with the health App in the intervening weeks. Participants also receive a text message or phone call at weeks 10-11 to remind them of the planned 3 month follow up assessments.   

Participants in the CC/LT group then receive a MCP interview using the AIMhi Stay Strong App (on a tablet device) following their 3 month follow up assessment, with one further session using the App within three to four weeks. Session 1 explores family, current strengths and worries. Participants are encouraged to set 1-2 goals that are achievable, meaningful, and practical for addressing an identified worry. The client-centered nature of the intervention ensures the goals are client driven and empowers them to take manageable steps toward achieving that goal. Session 2 reviews and refines the goals (identifies whether goals and steps were achieved) and helps clients address any barriers to goal attainment and set new goals as appropriate. Participants receive a text message or phone call reminding them of their goals and steps for making change in the intervening weeks. Participants also receive a text message or phone call at weeks 21-22 to remind them of the planned 6 month follow up assessments. 

Participants in the CC/LT group also receive usual care from their renal service provider.

Arm 3 - Treatment as usual/Late treatment (TAU/LT)
Baseline: Participants who are randomised to TAU/LT receive no researcher intervention at baseline.  Participants in this group receive only usual care from their renal service provider. Participants receive a text message or phone call at weeks 10-11 to remind them of the planned 3 month follow up assessments. 

Participants in the TAU/LT group then receive a MCP interview using the AIMhi Stay Strong App (on a tablet device) following their 3 month follow up assessment, with one further session using the App within three to four weeks. Session 1 explores family, current strengths and worries. Participants are encouraged to set 1-2 goals that are achievable, meaningful, and practical for addressing an identified worry. The client-centered nature of the intervention ensures the goals are client driven and empowers them to take manageable steps toward achieving that goal. Session 2 reviews and refines the goals (identifies whether goals and steps were achieved) and helps clients address any barriers to goal attainment and set new goals as appropriate. Participants receive a text message or phone call reminding them of their goals and steps for making change in the intervening weeks. Participants also receive a text message or phone call at weeks 21-22 to remind them of the planned 6 month follow up assessments. 

Participants in the TAU/LT group also receive usual care from their renal service provider.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may suffer distress and poor mental health from living with a chronic illness, travelling away from family and country to receive treatment, poor access to housing and accommodation and big changes to their lifestyle. 

 The WICKD Study is a randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a culturally-adapted, electronic mental health intervention (i.e. Motivational Care Planning (MCP) using the AIMhi Stay Strong App) in improving psychological distress, depressive symptoms  and quality of life among Indigenous Australians on haemodialysis in the NT.

People with ESKD on dialysis are a group in which distress is likely to be unacceptably high, yet relatively untreated. The highly structured MCP intervention can be used by a wide range of healthcare workers and provides a high-fidelity treatment that can be integrated into a primary health care or chronic disease management setting. This coordinated approach, combining mental health prevention and intervention within a chronic disease setting could substantially reduce the impact of mental illness among Indigenous people with CKD and may have broad applicability across CKD and other chronic disease populations, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. Demonstrating the effectiveness of this intervention will provide evidence for best practice intervention for managing distress for people on dialysis and facilitate integration of treatment for psychological distress within a chronic disease management setting.

HYPOTHESES
We hypothesize that:

Compared with the control interventions, MCP using the AIMhi Stay Strong App will elicit greater reductions in psychological distress as measured by the Kessler distress scale (K10) at 3 months post-baseline. 

1.	Compared with the control interventions, MCP using the AIMhi Stay Strong App will elicit: 
a.	Greater reductions in severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Indigenous adapted Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 3 months post-baseline.
b.	Improved QoL as measured by the EQ-5D (5 level) at 3 months post-baseline.
c.	Greater adherence to treatment as measured by higher attendance at scheduled dialysis sessions and fewer hospitalisations at 3 months post-baseline 
2.	Similar improvements from baseline on psychological distress, depressive symptoms, QoL and adherence to dialysis will be seen in the three conditions at 6 months post-baseline, when all will have received the MCP intervention.
3.	Compared with the control interventions, MCP using the AIMhi Stay Strong App will be cost effective, from the health service provider perspective, as measured by the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and the cost per additional patient achieving a clinically meaningful improvement in the K10 at 3 months and 6 months.
