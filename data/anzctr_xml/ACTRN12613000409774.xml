  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 3 separate drug forumlations in this study:

Afuresertib Forumulation/treatment No1 - Gelatin Capsule - 25mg adminstered per single dose.
Afuresertib Forumulation/treatment No2 - Enteric Coated Tablet - 25mg adminstered per single dose.
Afuresertib Forumulation/treatment No3 - HMPC Capsule (Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose or 'Hypromellose' capsule)- 25mg adminstered per single dose.

Each of these are further divided into Fasted and Non-Fasted states (providing a total of 6 possible study treatments). The definitions of these states are provided herewith:

Subjects Dosed in the Fasted State:
* Subjects must fast from all food and drink (except water) for at least 10 hours prior to dosing on Day 1 and will continue fasting for at least 4 hours after dosing.
* Each dose of study drug will be administered with 240 mL of water while the subject is standing.  All of the water must be completely consumed within 1 minute.  Subjects may sit upright, but must not lie down for at least 30 minutes after study drug administration.

Subjects Dosed in the Fed State:
* Subjects must fast from all food and drink (except water) for at least 10 hours prior to breakfast on Day 1 and will continue fasting for at least 4 hours after dosing.
* On Day 1, all breakfast meals will be identical for all Dosing Periods and Subjects and will be served at approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing.
* On Day 1, breakfast must be completely consumed within 20 minutes, and the start and stop time of the meal and any food items not consumed will be recorded.
* Dosing must occur within 10 minutes of completing consumption of the breakfast.
* Each dose of study drug will be administered with 240 mL of water while the subject is standing.  All of the water must be completely consumed within 1 minute.  Subjects may sit upright, but must not lie down for at least 30 minutes after study drug administration.
* Subjects will receive a high fat (approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal) and high-calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal for breakfast.  This meal will derive approximately 150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively.

Each participant in the study will receive a total of 4 doses during the treatment period.  Each subject will be randomised to 1 of 6 possible treatment arms (also termed 'sequences' within the protocol).  Each treatment sequence is a combination of any 4 of the 6 study treatments listed above (known as a 'Dosing Period' in the study protocol). No study treatment will be repeated each each sequence.  Each subject will undergo a wash-out period of 10 days between their last dose and their next dose (hence a total of 3 wash-out periods per patient).</interventions>
    <comparator>There is one active control arm in the study.  The treatment in this arm is Afuresertib  (Hard Gelatin capsule) and is orally administrered.

There are two comparator arms in the study both investigating two new formulations of Afuresertib.  These are an Enteric Coated Tablet and a HPMC capsule - both are administered Orally.

Subjects will receive a total of 4 single doses from any combination of the 3 listed formulations list above. Since this is a randomised trial, the randomisation schedule will dictate the combination (a maximum of 6 combinations are provided).</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

2. Male or female between 18 and 40 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

3. Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI less than or equal to 32 kg/m2.

4. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

*Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy [for this definition, documented refers to the outcome of the Investigator's/designees review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subjects medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory].  Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods permitted as per protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.  For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.  Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

* Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum hCG test at Screening and prior to dosing, AND;

a.  Agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or Investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.  Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 14 days (2 weeks) post last dose.

b. OR has only same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

5. Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods as listed in the protocol.  This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study drug until 14 days (2 weeks) post last dose.

    <summary>This study is comparing the extent to which the drug Afuresertib can be used by the body when administered to healthy volunteers in 3 different formulations under fasted and non-fasted states. 

Who is it for? 

You may be eligible to join this study if you are a healthy male or female aged between 18-40 years, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. 

Trial details: 

This is a trial examining the bioavailability of a total of 4 doses of 3 different formulations of the same drug (Afuresertib), in both fasted and non-fasted states. The 3 formulations are a Gelatin Capsule and two prototype formulations of Afuresertib, which are another capsule and the other, a tablet. This means that throughout the study you will be asked to take a tablet or a capsule on 4 different occasions and on each of these occasions, you will be asked to either eat (non-fasted state) or not eat (fasted state). Whether you will receive a tablet formulation or one of the 2 capsule formulations will depend on what treatment sequence you are randomly allocated to. Likewise, whether you will be receiving your dose in the non-fasted state or fasted state will again depend on what treatment sequence you are randomised to ('randomisation' is like flipping a coin, where the outcome cannot definitely be determined). Throughout the trial, apart from other assessments, blood samples will be taken from you to measure the absorption and elimination of the drug in your body. This is measuring the 'bioavailability' of the drug. You will also be assessed for Adverse Events to be able to evaluate the safety of the drug.

You will be on-study for a total duration of 9 weeks (3 weeks for screening, 5 weeks for the treatment phase and 1 week for a Follow-up Visit).  You participation maybe be less should the screening phase of your participation take less than the maximum of 21 days.

It is hoped that eventually, the data obtained from this study will help us to determine the best formulation of the drug Afuresertib to administer to cancer patients diagnosed with, for example, multiple myeloma or other haematological malignancies].
