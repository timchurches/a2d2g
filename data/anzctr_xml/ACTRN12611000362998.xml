  <interventions>
    <interventions>the motor imagery is a rehabilitation technique that was applied one hour a day for two consecutive weeks. Assessments and reassessments were applied by an examiner and treatment were administered by another examiner. Individuals selected after evaluation were followed by a period of two consecutive weeks, Monday through Friday, with one hour each session, undergoing the use of motor imagery associated with exercise alone (based on activity of daily living (ADLs): sliced beef, sandwiches, eat with a spoon, drinking cup, comb his hair, opening a jar and come to pick up a small object). The activities were planned during all sessions. The procedure involved the following steps: STEP 1: The patient was filmed performing each activity of daily living every,  STEP 2: Watch a video that was shown 10 times the correct way to perform each activity (pictures visual). STEP 3: with closed eyes held a series of 10 repetitions imagining the correct moves for each activity, without running them in fact, associated with the verbal command (kinesthetic images). STEP 4: held three sets of 10 repetitions of each activity. Walks through the steps all occurred the same day during 10 consecutive days</interventions>

      <outcome>The assessment of motor function through the Test of Motor ability Superior State (THMMS)- 30 score, Fugl Meyer Scale (FMS)- score 100 and Motor Activity Inventory (MAL)-score 30 and spasticity was assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)- score 5. 
Results: After 10 sessions it was observed significant improvement in THMMS (p = 0.005) of the FMS (p = 0.005), MAL (p = 0.005) and elbow flexor muscle groups AMI (p = 0.014) and wrist flexors (p = 0.023)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: The motor imagery (MI) is a complex cognitive operation that is self-generated using sensory and perceptual processes, enabling the reactivation of specific motor actions in working memory. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of IM associated with kinesiotherapy recovery of motor skills of the upper limb of hemiparetic patients with stroke. Methods: Ten individuals with hemiparesis with brachial predominance stroke patients underwent the treatment of motor imagery and kinesiotherapy for ten consecutive sessions lasting one hour. The assessment of motor function through the Test of Motor ability Superior State (THMMS), Fugl Meyer Scale (FMS) and Motor Activity Inventory (MAL) and spasticity was assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). For the statistical analysis we applied the Wilcoxon test to evaluate pre and post treatment. Results: After 10 sessions it was observed significant improvement in THMMS (p = 0.005) of the FMS (p = 0.005), MAL (p = 0.005) and elbow flexor muscle groups AMI (p = 0.014) and wrist flexors (p = 0.023) and also saw significant improvement in time taken for completion of activities: cutting meat (p = 0.008) and sandwiches (p = 0.005), eating with a spoon (p = 0.005), drinking mug ( p = 0.011), combing hair (p = 0.018); open jar (p = 0.027) and extend the arm to pick up small object (p = 0.028). Conclusion: The use of IM associated with kinesiotherapy promotes relearning, leading to improvement in upper limb function.</summary>
