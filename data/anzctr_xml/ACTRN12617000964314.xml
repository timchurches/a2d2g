    <interventions>The ARCHER study is a six-year multidisciplinary longitudinal cohort study using a community sample of adolescents living in/around Dubbo and Orange in regional NSW.

The study hypothesis is that onset and/or tempo of the rise in puberty hormones (testosterone and oestradiol) play a significant role in adolescent health, wellbeing and behaviour. As such, the study measures three/six-monthly change in urinary testosterone and oestradiol (see below), annual change in serum testosterone and oestradiol, and relates these hormonal changes to annual measures of physical health, mental health, wellbeing, behaviour and cognition. 

Data collection involves collection of a three-monthly first-morning urine sample during years 1-3 of the study, and a six-monthly first-morning urine sample during years 4-6 of the study (all urine samples collected at home), as well as baseline and annual study visits.
At the study visits, adolescents undergo physical examination, complete a battery of questionnaires related to physical and mental health, wellbeing, behaviour and a cognition test. Parents/guardians complete a battery of questionnaires seeking demographic and family information. At around the time of annual visits, adolescents also provide a fasting morning blood sample (completed at the local pathology centre in Orange or Dubbo). All biological samples are biobanked at -80 degrees for future analyses.

The study recruited adolescents and their parent/guardian over a 27-month period between June 2011 and August 2013. The last recruited participant reached the third year of follow-up in mid-2016. It is expected that the cohort will complete six years of follow-up by August 2019.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is powered on the least common study outcome because there is inadequate existing data on which to power the study on its primary outcome of urinary puberty hormone change.

Depression is the least common outcome measured in the study, estimated to affect 5% of participants in mid- to late-puberty.

We estimated that 160 boys and 160 girls at Tanner Stage 3 (the pubertal stage where clinical onset of depression is most likely) will be required to detect a one SD difference in testosterone or oestradiol levels between those with and without depression. The anticipated loss to follow up was 5% per annum in this setting. Assuming a mean age of puberty onset of 11.4 years, 400 participants was set as the target for ensuring adequate numbers of adolescents reach Tanner Stage 3 during the study,

The main independent variables are age of onset at puberty and tempo of puberty. Both will be measured by testosterone and oestradiol, in blood and urine. Data analysis will have three main components:

1. The first component is testing the reliability and validity of measures under focus. These analyses will centre on:
a) descriptive, reliability and item functioning;
b) factor analysis to test factor structure and validity of measures;
c) ANOVAs for preliminary tests of main and interaction effects of background socio-demographics; and
d) tests of (in)variance in factor structure to ensure congruence in measurement properties across subgroups to justify pooling sample data for subsequent modeling throughout the project.

2. The second component is a correlational one and assesses the impact of tempo and onset of puberty over time. Specifically, for example, by assessing in the one analytic model (e.g. in linear regression models for continuous variables such as Youth Self Report scores for sensation seeking and in logistic regression models for dichotomous outcomes such as depression or sexual debut) the effects of Time 1 onset and tempo of puberty on Time 2 outcomes after controlling for Time 1 outcomes, it is possible to get a sense of the relative salience of the onset, and tempo of puberty in one time period over factors in a following time period. Also in these longitudinal analyses, key socio-demographic (and other) factors such as gender, school grade and socioeconomic factors can be included to get a further sense of puberty by controlling for other potential influences. The three monthly urine samples for the biological markers of puberty can be used to regress time on time measures, with tempo being defined by the residuals. Thus the larger and the more positive a residual over time, the more rapid the tempo of change.

3. The third component is based on mean-level differences (e.g. repeated measures) and explores for significant upward and downward shifts in means on target outcomes as a function of main effects (e.g. early and late onset; rapid and slow tempo) and interactions (e.g. early onset/rapid tempo; late onset/rapid tempo; early onset/slow tempo and late onset/slow tempo) of puberty effects that also control for key socio-demographic (and other) factors as covariates. Taken together, these analyses (and adaptations of them) allow for integrative tests of the substantive and methodological issues at hand.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The longitudinal Adolescent Rural Cohort study of Hormones, health, Education, environments and Relationships (ARCHER Study) is a prospective cohort study of 342 healthy adolescents that aims to examine how puberty hormone change affects physical health, mental health, wellbeing and behaviour in young people.

Adolescents aged 10-12 years and their parent/guardian who live in and around the regional Australian townships of Orange and Dubbo were recruited during June 2011 and August 2013. Data collection includes annual physical measures (height, weight, waist circumference, body fat), questionnaires on various aspects of health, wellbeing and behavior and cognition test. Annual blood collection, and frequent urine collection (three-monthly collections over the first three years, and six-monthly collections over the last three years of the study) are undertaken to accurately measure changes in puberty hormones. Parents/guardians also complete annual questionnaires on demographic, family and environmental data.</summary>
