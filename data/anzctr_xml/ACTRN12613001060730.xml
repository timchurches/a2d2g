  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study medication is Human pro-ANP (31-67).
Participants will be randomised into one of three groups.
For the 1 hour intravenous infusion the two drug groups will receive the same dose of drug 100ng/kg/min. 
The subcutaneous infusion dosing of 12 hours on and 12 hours off is for a minimum of three days and a maximum of six days.
Group A-Placebo as described below in the Comparator / control treatment field
Group B- Low dose will  receive 450 ug/hr for the first 5 hours and then 135 ug/hr for the next 7 hours.
Group C-High dose will receive 1800 ug/hr for the first 5 hours and then 540 ug/hr for the next 7 hours.
Close monitoring will occur using adverse event monitoring, vital signs including ECG monitoring,vital signs, urine volume and fluid input monitoring, physical examinations and laboratory assessments.
As all study drug is administered in hospital this allows for greater compliance and closer monitoring.
Follow up is at 30 days by a clinic visit and a 6 month follow up phone call.</interventions>
    <comparator>For the placebo arm 0.9% sodium chloride is used for the intravenous 1 hour infusion given at the same rate as the study medication.
For the subcutaneous infusion Elliott's B solution is used as the placebo at the same rates as for Groups B and C above.
Follow up is a clinic visit at 30 days and a phone or email contact at 6 months.</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The sample size estimation is based on the primary efficacy endpoint, nominal change from baseline in creatinine clearance at 72 hours after IV dose infusion start in the VSDL treatment arms.  Assuming a standard deviation around the change in creatinine clearance of 16 mL/min, 26 patients in each VSDL treatment arm will provide 90% power to detect change in creatinine clearance of 16 mL/min or greater with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. An additional 13 patients will be randomized into a placebo arm, for a total of 65 patients enrolled in the study. Although this study is not adequately powered to compare the active treatment groups to placebo, these relationships will be explored as a secondary objective.
Due to the exploratory nature of the study, standard summary statistics will be used and all statistical methods will be descriptive.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The CONTINUUM-HF study aims to evaluate whether vessel dilator peptide VSDL has effects on renal function in participants with acute decompensated congestive heart failure. It shall also evaluate the tolerability and safety of VSDL over 7 day dosing, and assess the pharmacodynamics of VSDL in these participants.
The study is a multi-centre, blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study to be conducted in 8 sites in Australia targeting two target peak concentrations following 1-hour intravenous bolus and daily 12-hour subcutaneous infusions for up to 7 days. The target plasma VSDL concentrations of 5ng/ml and 20ng/ml are chosen to reflect well tolerated and efficacious concentrations in previous trials using this drug.
Study subjects shall be reviewed post-IV infusion, at 72 hours, pre-discharge, and at 30 days. A 6 month followup contact will be made via phone call or email.
Participants will be given a diary to record any adverse events, changes in medication and visits to doctors.</summary>
