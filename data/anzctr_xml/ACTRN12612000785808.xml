    <concealment>After successfully completing the phone screen, diagnosis confirmation and practice session, participants will be randomly allocated to receive either treatment A or B (active or placebo) on their first testing day. This will be done by a randomised computer number sequence generator. At the conclusion of the baseline test session they will receive a 90 day supply of the treatment. A disinterested third party will be responsible for the blinding procedure.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Bacopa as an adjunctive therapy to existing pharmaceutical treatments for Alzheimers patients. The study will test individuals diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease, in a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel groups design. Particpants will either take Bacopa monniera for 90 days or a placebo for 90 days. Participants will attend an initial pre-screening and pratice session, baseline session and one follow-up testing session following 90 days of supplementation. During these session, participants will be required to complete several cognitive tests, which have been widely used to assess both enhancement and impairment of human cognitive performance. Mood and quality of life will also be assessed. 
It is hypothesised that measures of attention, processing speed and memory will improve in the Bacopa group relative to the placebo group. A further aim of the study is to investigate differences in mood and quality of life in the Bacopa treatment group relative to placebo.</summary>
