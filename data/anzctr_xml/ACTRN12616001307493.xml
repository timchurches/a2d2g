  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will compare the feasibility, tolerability and acceptability of offering New Donors (blood donors who have no record of having donated previously in Australia) aged between 30 years and 70 the option to choose between two donation types (1) whole blood OR (2) Plasma by Apheresis

Allocation: 
a. Inbound Calls: New Donors who meet the inclusion criteria who book appointments  at one of  the 10 participating Donor Collection Centres via the National Call Centre (NCC) will be offered by a call centre agent the choice to donate whole blood or Plasma by apheresis
b. Outbound Calls:  New Donors who meet the inclusion criteria who book appointments at one of  the 10 participating Donor Collection Centres via the Blood Service Website will be contacted by a NCC agent and offered the choice to donate whole blood or Plasma by apheresis
c. Walk Ins:  New Donors who meet the inclusion criteria who present at one of  the 10 participating Donor Collection Centres will be offered the choice to donate whole blood or Plasma by apheresis by Donor Centre Staff.

Apheresis is the process of collecting blood components, like plasma using a cell separating machine. During a plasma donation, blood is drawn from the donation arm by a pump into a sterile single use disposable kit inside the cell separating machine. Inside the apheresis machine there is a blood processing chamber that centrifuges the blood, separating it into layers. Red cells are the heaviest and sit at the bottom, platelets and white cells are in the middle and plasma is at the top as it is the lightest. The apheresis machine is programmed to detect the plasma and divert it into a collection bag with the rest of the blood given back to the donor (red cells, white cells and platelets). This cycle is repeated until the desired collection volume is achieved. A small amount of citrate anticoagulant is mixed with each withdrawal of blood to prevent clotting. This is controlled by the cell separator. The anticoagulant works by inactivating calcium, which is require for clotting to occur. The donor will receive a small amount of anticoagulant as it is returned with the components that are not being collected. The cell separator also infuses 500ml of saline solution to the donor, to aid in the replacement of fluid.

The plasma collection volume for new donors is 13% of their Total blood Volume(TBV) capped at 750ml. TBV is estimated using the modified Nadler's equation


The plasma donation is collected over 45minutes, The entire donation process including registration, interview and refreshment time after donations usually takes around 1.5 hours</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: Whole Blood Donation. 
Intervention: Plasmapheresis as a first donation type

Currently the Australian Guidelines for Selection of Blood Donors states that all blood donors must have donated at least 1 whole blood donation prior to being offered the choice to donate plasma by apheresis. Therefore Plasmapheresis as a first donation type is the intervention under investigation</comparator>

Assessment of Vasovagal Reactions (VVRs) follows the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) guidelines for surveillance of complications related to Blood Donation. 

Vasovagal reactions are self reported by donors or observed by attending donor centre staff. Vasovagal reactions are divided in two main subgroups 
1. Without loss of consciousness (LOC) or
2. With loss of consciousness (LOC)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Global demand for plasma-derived products including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) continues to grow steadily. In contrast, medical advances and improvements in patient blood management have decreased requirements for red cell products. With less collections required to meet red cell inventory, the amount of fractionated plasma available from whole blood donations has been reduced. These factors have shifted donor centre operations from a primary focus on whole blood collections to an increased effort to recruit and retain plasmapheresis donors to meet future demand.

Australian Blood Service policy currently requires that blood donors give at least one whole blood donation before entering the plasmapheresis programme. The rationale behind this policy has been to determine donor suitability for apheresis donation (e.g. blood type, vein suitability) and to minimise vasovagal reactions and resulting donor drop-outs and deferrals. Similar policies for recruitment to plasmapheresis donation panels exist overseas with only the United States and the United Kingdom Blood Services permitting first-appointment apheresis donation. Consequently, little data exists regarding tolerability and donor acceptance of first-attendance plasma donation  particularly for voluntary non-remunerated blood donors.

With improvements in plasmapheresis safety (e.g. saline compensation), and concern over iron depletion among whole blood donors, a review of Australian plasmapheresis donation policy is warranted. Importantly, there is no regulatory barrier to implementing first appointment plasmapheresis donation. 

If tolerable and acceptable to donors, first-attendance plasmapheresis donation could help to:
1. Increase the plasmapheresis panel and overall collections of plasma for fractionation
2. Reduce the number of first attendance red cell deferrals
3. Reduce reliance on fractionated whole blood donations for collection of plasma
