  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be initiallly contacted by telephone and will subsequently receive 3 questionnaires via mail to complete and return.  These questionnaires aim to screen for risk of developing chronic pain and disability and will be evaluated for their usefulness in this patient group.  Follow-up will occur after 4 months.  Two of these questionnaires have been previously validated: (i) The Orebro Musculoskeltal Pain Screening Questionnaire (short version) and (ii) The STarT Back Screening Tool.  The third screening tool - The 3 Item Screening Questionnaire, has been specifically developed for this study.  All questionnaires are sent together at the initial timepoint.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size is based upon published variance measures for the primay outcome variables: 11 point (0-10) numerical rating scales for pain and disability.  The pain measure shows the higher variance - the mean (SD) pain score for patients with subacute low back pain is 5.3 (2.2) and the limiting factor will be the comparison of those patients who are screened and those who are not.  As such, in order to detect a 2 point difference between these groups and obtain likelihood ratios with acceptable confidence intervals, with an alpha of 0.005 and 80% power, we will need 196 patients.  
The research team will continue to work with a biostatistician to formulate and analysis framework as the project progresses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This investigation involves the collection of data via postal questionnaires from patients with low back pain who have been placed on a waiting list for surgical opinion.  The questionnaires aim to identify those at risk of developing chronic back pain and will be evaluated for their usefulness in this patient group.  Additionally, this study will ask the question of whether screening itself reduces pain and disability.  This investigation will lay the critical platform for an investigation of treatment aimed at reducing risk.</summary>
