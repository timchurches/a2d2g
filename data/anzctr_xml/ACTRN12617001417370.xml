    <interventions>Dementia-friendly book clubs within residential aged care facility (RACF).
In week 1, all participants (intervention and control) will receive the baseline evaluation, and the intervention will begin.  The Assessor will be blinded to treatment allocation, and will be either a Psychiatry Registrar or a Psychiatrist. Baseline evaluation includes the following measures: Quality of Life (Resident QoL-AD self-report and proxy); "Thriving"(how well the individual has adjusted to life at the RACF (TOPAS and TOPAS-proxy) ; Theory of Mind via the Eyes/Faces Test (EFT); Assessment of Cognitive Function (ACE-III); depression (GDS-SF); and any changes in behaviour (NPI).  
During weeks 2  8, facility staff will conduct the book clubs (2/week, 45 mins each), and patient carers will provide support to the patients to encourage them to read the books between meetings, attend and participate in the book clubs. All participants with dementia will have their own books to read.  The books are dementia-friendly books, written by the researchers (Drs Rimkeit and Claridge, see www.dovetalepress.com) after initial research. One book will be read each week.  The book clubs will involve reading these books, and discussing them with the participants. Only the participants with dementia will attend the book clubs.
In week 9, the final assessment, a repeat of the baseline assessment for all participants (intervention and control), will be done, again by a blinded assessor who is either a Psychiatrist or a Psychiatry Registrar.
Frequency of attendance at the book clubs will be noted for each participant by the book club facilitator.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Activities as usual at the RACF.  This may vary from RACF to RACF, but as we will be using only Bupa facilities will probably be more consistent than if we just used two different facilities.  Usual activities would normally include social gatherings (eg, "Happy Hour"), games, television, mild exercise classes etc.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion Criteria
1	All participants will have a medical diagnosis of Dementia, or will be a carer for someone diagnosed with dementia.  In addition, the Bupa facility staff will attest that, in their latest InterRAI ( InterRAI Long-Term Care Facility (LTCF) Assessment Form Version 9.3, copyrighted), the participant with dementia has a recorded diagnosis of Alzheimers disease or Dementia other than Alzheimers (section I: Disease Diagnosis).  Participants will be recruited as a dyad of carer and person with dementia (PWD).
2	Participants with dementia will be recruited from those living in rest home or hospital level care (with likely mild-moderate dementia) and those living in secure dementia units (likely moderate  severe dementia). Participants with dementia will reside at the Bupa Care Home. The Carer Participants can reside outside of the Care Home, in community, or at the Bupa Care Home. 
3	Participants will be recruited by invitation by the facility manager, or his/her surrogate, with referral to a poster giving information about the book club.
4	All participants with dementia will score 0, 1 or 2 on all parts of Section D: Communication and vison of the InterRAI Long-Term Care Facility (LTCF) Assessment Form Version 9.3, copyrighted. 
5	All participants with dementia will be recorded as NOT having any problems with verbal abuse, physical abuse or socially disruptive behaviour in their InterRAI (Section E.3, parts b, c, and d).
6	With patient autonomy being a guiding principle in health care law, it is important that the test that sets the limit for capacity is at a level that allows most people to make their own decisions about treatment. (Gunn, 1994)) . In consultation with HDEC, we have carefully designed our consent/assent process to respect this autonomy principle. As per The HDC Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights Regulation 1996, all participants will be deemed to have the capacity to give informed, written consent or assent (even if they have been deemed incompetent within PPPR legislation). This written consent/assent will be sought only after they have had time to fully read the Information Sheet, speak to family members (who have been provided with a Family Information Sheet and Carer Views on their Relatives Participation in the study), and had an interview with the clinical researchers (Drs Rimkeit and Astika), so that their questions about the study are fully answered. In this consent/assent process, we will ensure that those who agree to participate do so because 1) it is their personal, informed choice to participate, and 2) they believe it is in their best interest to participate. 
7	The carer-participant for each PWD will receive their own letter of information for the role they will play in the study and interview with the researchers, and will sign their own consent form.

    <statisticalmethods>Assessing the burdens/ resource requirements:  The participants will be required to meet with the blinded assessor in an initial interview at baseline and a week after completion of the seven-week trial. We anticipate that the assessment process, measuring Resident QoL-AD self-report, Thriving of Older Persons Assessment Scale (TOPAS), Faces Test for Theory of Mind, Addenbrookes-III cognitive assessment, and the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS SF), will take approximately 1 hour.  For the pilot, we will carefully consider whether this assessment process is too burdensome for the participants and whether it causes undue anxiety.  We will not extend any one assessment session for longer than one hour to reduce strain on the PWD. This may mean that assessment sessions for the PWD takes place twice in one week, on separate days. In addition, we need to consider resource obligations for the blinded assessment, which will be undertaken as a Scholarly Project by a Psychiatric Registrar (Dr Kappagoda), supervised by psychogeriatrician and clinical investigator Dr Sally Rimkeit, and independently by Dr Rimkeit. Through the pilot RCT, we can evaluate whether blinded assessment is practical or achievable. It will also allow evaluation of time commitment involved in assessing selected participants at an RACF, requiring this assessment to take place in a in a relatively short space of time (preferably one week): we may find this is impractical. Importantly, the pilot study allows opportunity for review and feedback from our sponsor Bupa Care, who is providing staff resourcing for recruitment and facilitation of the book club intervention. Beth McDougall is the Dementia Care Advisor for Bupa and has agreed to work with facilities closely during the study to address any clinical issues that arise.  
As anticipated for the full RCT, for the pilot study, we will require the recording of demographic factors on each participant, including, by proxy report, age, gender, marital status, nationality, ethnicity, Iwi if Maori, placement level in RACF (rest home, hospital or secure dementia unit), years of education, and estimated number of books read each year 10 years ago.  Although we will not use these variables for the analysis of the pilot study, we will collect them so that we can describe our participants, and trial our data collection mechanisms.

Assessing Effect size and variance: The pilot RCT will provide data for refining protocol requirements for the full project.  This includes estimates of mean and variance of the effect size, from which a sample size estimate can be made.  The required sample size will be calculated for the primary outcome (Quality of Life), but the power available to test secondary outcomes will also be calculated.
The assessment tools for the pilot RCT, and proposed for the full RCT are:
A.	Primary Assessment: The change in Quality of Life, as measured by the Resident QoL-AD-self and the Resident QoL-AD-proxy reports
B.	Secondary Assessments are: 
1)	Change in Thriving (TOPAS self-report and TOPAS-proxy);
2)	Change in Theory of Mind ability (Faces Test Theory of Mind);
3)	Change in Cognitive functioning (Addenbrookes Cognitive examination, version III);
4)	Change in mood (Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form) ;
5)	Change in behaviour (Neuropsychiatric Inventory);
Qualitative Analysis:  The Pilot study will also enable us to complete the Qualitative evaluation of the book club experience, namely:
1.	To use Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to explore the lived experience of a convenience sampling of participants in the book clubs;
2.	To compare change in language with D-level scale and proportional density analysis, from a convenience sampling of participants, from the first to the last session of the book club intervention. Qualitative analysis of intra- and interclausal meaning relationships will also be carried out.

    <summary>Reading for Pleasure: The benefits of a dementia-friendly book club.
Reading is an important leisure activity with multiple health benefits, and the elderly are known to spend more time reading than any other age group. People living with dementia may find book reading difficult to access and enjoy. We plan to conduct a full RCT testing  whether participating in a shared reading group, using dementia-friendly books, provides psycho-social benefits. The proposed primary outcome is quality of life (as measured by Resident QoL AD, self and proxy). Secondary outcome measures are effects on thriving (TOPAS, self and proxy), Theory of Mind (Adapted RMET), cognition (ACE-III), mood (GDS), and behaviour (NPI). The control participants will engage in activities as usual at the facility. The study will include participants with both moderate and severe dementia and their family carer. This pilot tests the feasibility of our study design.  The outcomes of the pilot study will be an assessment of whether or not the assessment process as proposed is too burdensome in this populations; estimates of effect size and variance of Quality of life measures; phenomenological analysis of recorded book club sessions.
