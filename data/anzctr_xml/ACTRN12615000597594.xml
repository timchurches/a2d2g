  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a computerized task involves matching the identity of two faces that have either a painful expression (pain training group) or a happy expression (happy training group). This is intended to train the participant implicitly to attend either towards happy or painful facial expressions

A one-off 20-30 minute session</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is a placebo where participants are trained equally often to match the identity of the painful/happy faces.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Threshold: The amount of time (measured by a stopwatch) that the participant takes to report pain once the hand is immersed in the cold pressor apparatus (5 degrees celcius).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately post-treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain levels: Pain is assessed at threshold (when the participants first report pain) and tolerance (when they remove their arm from the cold pressor) on a visual analog scale. An average is used. </outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately post-treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerance: Tolerance is the time that the participant leaves their arm in the cold pressor (maximum time 4 minutes). Recorded by stopwatch.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately post-interveniton</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HesitanceThe time taken to fully immerse the hand in the cold pressor from the instruction to do so (timed with a stopwatch). </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The results will be analyzed with a one-way ANOVA on outcomes. We will also use regressions to determine whether the attentional bias of participants following training predicts their pain outcomes. Our power analyses, based on an effect size of f = 0.327, achieved in the only other study to use this task in anxiety, indicates that we require 75 participants in total using an alpha of 0.05 to achieve 80% power.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Attention modification training refers to training participants to attend away from emotionally relevant information. In the pain literature, ABM has been shown to improve pain outcomes. However, all research has used the dot-probe paradigm, the reliability of which has been questioned. This project aims to trial a novel ABM procedure using painful faces.</summary>
