  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Radical prostatectomy is used to treat early prostate cancer in otherwise well men, but is
      followed by later cancer relapse in 1 in 4 cases. This study aims to see if post-operative
      adjuvant therapy with a combination of zoledronic acid and docetaxel might help reduce
      relapse in such cases. Patients will be randomized to receive the adjuvant combination
      therapy or no therapy. All patients will be monitored closely for signs of relapse and
      treated appropriately with conventional salvage therapy.</summary>
