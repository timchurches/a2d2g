  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a confirmatory, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 104 week
      study with a 88 week treatment period and a 16 week follow-up period evaluating the efficacy
      and safety of BI 655066 / ABBV-066 (risankizumab) to support Registration for the treatment
      of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients. This study will also look
      at the maintenance of response following randomly withdrawing treatment from those patients
      responding to treatment at week 28, as well as the response to re-treatment for patients who
      relapse. This study will also assess PK and emergence of anti-drug antibodies as well as the
      influence of study treatment on disease specific markers. In a subset of psoriasis patients
      with concomitant psoriatic arthritis, the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis will be
      evaluated to assess improvement.</summary>
