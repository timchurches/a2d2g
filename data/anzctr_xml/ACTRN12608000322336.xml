    <interventions>Three brands of Long-lasting Insecticidal nets (LLINs) will be trialed and assessed for their acceptability among a randomly selected sample of households in Malaita Province, Solomon Islands. Randomly selected villages be cluster randomized to one of the 6 bed net assessment groups.  Each bed net assessment group will be assigned 2 brands of long lasting insecticidal bed nets (cross-over design) to trial.  Each household will trial the 2 different brands of bed nets assigned to their group for approx 10 days each, then the second brand of net trialed will be continued for a further 3 weeks.  As this is an acceptability and preference study, no wash-out period was deemed necessary.
STUDY DESIGN OUTLINE:
Group 1 - to trial Olyset then PermaNet nets
Group 2 - to trial PermaNet then Olyset nets
Group 3 - to trial Olyset then DuraNet nets
Group 4 - to trial DuraNet then Olyset nets
Group 5 - to trial PermaNet then DuraNet 
Group 6 - to trial DuraNet then PermaNet</interventions>
    <comparator>No control group:  Three brands of Long-lasting Insecticidal nets are used in the study and no particular brand acts as a control group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: Acceptability of bed net trialed.  This will be assessed using a pre-determined Acceptability survey (informed by a previous qualitative investigation into bed net acceptability and preference)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: 10 days after the start of the trial of each brand of bed net.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome: Preference for one of the 2 nets trialed.  This will be assessed using a pre-determined Preference Questionnaire (informed by a previous qualitative investigation into bed net acceptability and preference)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: At 20 days (at completion of trial of both brands of net) and again 3 weeks following the first preference quesionnaire.</timepoint>

    <sequence>The study population will consist of heads of households and primary care-givers.  Three stage sampling will be used to select the study population.  In the first stage, 6 villages in Malaita province, SI, will be randomly selected from a list of villages (with a population &gt; 200 people) using an Excel generated random numbering system.   In the second stage, the selected villages will be cluster randomized to one of the 6 bed net assessment groups.  Finally, natural clusters of households within each selected village (at least 20 households per cluster) will be identified and one cluster randomly selected within each village to be invited to participate in the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the acceptability and preference of three long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (LLINs) (Olyset, PermaNet and DuraNet) in the Solomon Islands.  The information obtained from this assessment will assist policy makers to determine which brand of bed net is most appropriate for large-scale distribution in Solomon Islands.  Information on bed net colour, shape and size preference will be collected. Feedback provided by participants will guide future promotional and educational messages that accompany LLIN distribution.  The Ministry of Health, SI providing populations with bed nets they find acceptable would improve user compliance and ultimately, contribute to the overall success of the expanded malaria control and elimination program in SI.</summary>
