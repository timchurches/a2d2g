  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab
Treatment: drugs - Cobimetinib

Experimental: Dose-Escalation: Cobimetinib, Atezolizumab - Participants will receive single dose of 800 milligrams (mg) of atezolizumab IV infusion on Day 1, 15 and 29 of Cycle 1 (cycle length=42 days [14-day run-in period + 28-day concomitant dosing period]), thereafter with atezolizumab IV dosing every 2 weeks (q2w) in all subsequent treatment cycles (28 days each). Combination with cobimetinib will begin on Cycle 1 Day 15 and will be given at increasing dose levels during Stage 1. During Stage 1, cobimetinib will be administered once daily (QD) orally for 21 consecutive days out of 28 days (21/7 dosing schedule) at a starting dose of 20 mg with escalation of 20 mg until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD; not more than 60 mg) for the two-drug combination.

Experimental: Dose-Expansion: Cobimetinib, Atezolizumab - Participants will receive single dose of 800 mg of atezolizumab IV infusion q2w in all subsequent treatment cycles (28 days each). Participants will receive cobimetinib at the selected recommended RP2D on Days 1-14 of each 28-day cycle during Stage 2.


Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab
Atezolizumab will be administered at a fixed dose as specified via IV infusion.

Treatment: drugs: Cobimetinib
Cobimetinib will be administered orally at an escalating dose during Stage 1 and at RP2D during Stage 2.
