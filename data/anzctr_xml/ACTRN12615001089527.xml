  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Insertion of the AuraGain laryngeal mask
a) The AuraGain laryngeal mask is inserted through patient´s mouth and down to the perilaryngeal area (down airway) to keep the airway open during anaesthesia.  The cuff at the end of the tube is then inflated to form a seal. The device is kept in place for the duration of surgery.
b) time of insertion and time of device removal - the device is inserted at start of general anaesthesia and removed on emergence post surgery.
c) the device is inserted by a doctor with a Board Certification in Anaesthesia - anaesthetist
d) approximate duration of the mask in place is five minutes for the first allocated mask, and for second mask the average time is approximately 1 hour, dependent on surgical procedure.
e) features differing from the control/comparator mask - broader breathing channel than LMA Supreme, gastric channel is not incorporated in the middle of the breathing tube (such as in the LMA Supreme) but in front of it.

2. Achievement of the cross-over design in the clinical setting.
With a patient already under general anaesthesia, patient will have the first allocated mask inserted, with number of attempts and time taken for insertion recorded. The seal pressure will then be recorded and 5 minutes after insertion, the mask will be removed. After a 1 minute washout period, the second mask will be inserted with attempts, timing and seal pressure recorded. This mask will stay in place for the duration of the surgical procedure until emergence from anaesthesia.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oropharyngeal seal pressure (cmH20)
This outcome will be measured with a sphygmomanometer (pressure monitor) located on the anaesthetic machine.
Pressure limit is set to 40 cmH2O, the APL valve is fully closed and fresh gas flow is set to 3 L/min. Oropharyngeal seal pressure is defined as the pressure inside the system when the first sounds are audible above the larynx using a sthetoscope.  </outcome>

Based on the results of previous studies (Weber et al., Anaesthesia 2011; Theiler et al., Anesthesiology 2009) for differences in oropharyngeal seal pressure (OSP). Lowest significant difference - 3 cmH20 (10% of predicted value of OSP). Level of significance (alpha) = 0.05, beta error = 0.20.
46 minimum of patients, 51 (+10%) chosen for potential drop-outs or incomplete data. Freeware MGH Biostatistics Center (www.hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/biostatistics) used.  

2. Planned analysis of data
- testing for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test of normality)
- analysis of data using parametric (chi-square, Fischer´s exact test) or non-parametric tests based on data distribution.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Comparison of insertion parameters and seal pressures between two types of supraglottic airway devices (breathing devices used for airway management) - an established device called Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme and a novel device AuraGain Laryngeal Mask, using a cross-over design. Study participants will be females undergoing planned (elective) procedures (gynaecology, all types of general surgery, urology), with Body Mass Index between 25-35 kg/m2, without any additional risk for gastric content regurgitation/aspiration. 
Study null hypothesis: no differences in the oropharyngeal seal pressures between the AuraGain LM and LMA Supreme. </summary>
