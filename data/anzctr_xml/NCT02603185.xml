             screening visit and at Day -1.

          4. Female participants of childbearing potential with male partners must use a highly
             effective method of contraception/birth control (methods which result in low failure
             rate, i.e. less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly) and if
             currently lactating, participant's should not breast feed an infant while on this
             study, and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug has been taken.

             Examples of acceptable forms of highly effective contraception include:

               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

               -  Sterilised male partner (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
                  absence of sperm in the ejaculate).

               -  True abstinence: When this is in line with the participant's preferred and usual
                  lifestyle.

             Examples of non-acceptable methods of contraception include:

               -  Condoms alone or double barrier

               -  Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation)

               -  Spermicide (as it is not approved as a method of contraception in Australia) Male
                  participants with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use a
                  condom, in addition to their female partner using another acceptable method of
                  contraception. Acceptable methods that may be used are listed in above from a) to
                  e), or surgical sterilisation (vasectomy) from the screening visit until 6 months
                  post-dose.

             For this study, a female is considered of non-childbearing potential if they are
             post-menopausal with =6 months' spontaneous amenorrhea or surgically sterile (e.g.
             bilateral tubal ligation, salpingectomy with or without oophorectomy, surgical
             hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy).

          5. Males must agree to refrain from donating sperm, blood or plasma (other than for this
             study) while participating in this study and for at least 28 days after the last dose
             of study drug.

          6. Understands and is willing, able and likely to fully comply with study procedures and
             restrictions.

             the study.

          6. Participants who have donated, or plan to donate &gt;450 mL of blood, or have donated
             plasma, within 12 weeks of the planned dosing date. All participants should be advised

             study drug.These laboratory tests may be repeated once, if they are abnormal on first
             screening, and if there is a medical reason to believe the results may be inaccurate.
             If the repeat test is within the reference range, the participant may be included only
             if the investigator considers that the previous finding will not compromise the
             participant's safety and will not interfere with the interpretation of safety data. As

         10. Clinically significant abnormal vital signs obtained at screening or prior to the
             first dose of study drug, as determined by the Principal Investigator or delegate.

             from using drugs of abuse during the study period.

         12. A history of alcohol abuse or dependence within 12 months of the screening visit.

         13. Dietary habits or food intolerances which will interfere with the requirements for
             participants to consume a standardised diet whilst confined to the clinical unit.

         14. Participation in another clinical trial or receipt of an investigational drug within 3
             months of the screening visit. Females who have had unprotected sex with a male
             partner within 30 days prior to the screening visit.

         15. Pregnancy or lactating females. Participants must be compliant with all inclusion and
             exclusion criteria unless, following discussions between the Investigator and the
             Sponsor, it is concluded that any minor deviation will not be of clinical significance
             and is considered unlikely to have any significant effect on the results of the study.
             The deviation and date of the decision will be documented in the CRF and the Study
             File.</exclusivecriteria>
