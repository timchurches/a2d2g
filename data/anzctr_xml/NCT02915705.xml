  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - KRN23
Treatment: drugs - Oral Phosphate
Treatment: drugs - Active Vitamin D

Experimental: KRN23 - Subjects randomized 1:1 to receive 0.8 mg/kg starting dose, administered every 2 weeks by subcutaneous injection.

Active Comparator: Active Control - Subjects randomized 1:1 to receive multiple daily doses of oral Phosphate and Active Vitamin D therapy, individualized for each subject at the Investigator's discretion.


Other interventions: KRN23
KRN23 is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G isotype 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and inhibits the activity of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).

Treatment: drugs: Oral Phosphate


Treatment: drugs: Active Vitamin D

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>UX023-CL301 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy
      and safety of KRN23 with active control (oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy) in children
      with XLH (aged 1 to =12 years) who have radiographic evidence of rickets, open epiphyses, and
      have received oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy for = 6-12 consecutive months prior to
      screening. Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive open-label KRN23
      administered by subcutaneous injection or oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy for a
      total of 64 weeks.</summary>
