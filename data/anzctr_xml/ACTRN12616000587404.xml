    <interventions> Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula (HHFNC) is a therapy that utilises heated humidified blend of gases (i.e. Oxygen, Room Air) via large bore nasal cannula. Due to humidification, high flow therapy can deliver flows of up to 60lt min and titrated fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02). 
 In this study, patients randomised to HHFNC will be commenced on 60lt/min and Fio2 titrated as per protocol. Oxygen concentration will depend on patients individual room air staurations after 10mins on 60lt. If patients Sp02 &lt;94% (for non- COPD patients),then the FiO2 is tritated to achieve O2 saturations of &gt;94%. If patients Spo2 &lt; 88% (for known COPD patients), then  Fio2 is tritated to achieve between 88%-92% O2 saturations. The duration of HHFNC therapy will depend on the individual patients clinical observations. 
Weaning off HHFNC therapy will occur when respiratory rate is &lt;20bpm,SpO2 is within target ranges specified above in &lt;50% FiO2 and improvement in the dyspnoea scale. Purpose made observation charts are utilised to monitor adherence and aid in data collection.</interventions>
    <comparator>Once patients are assessed and flagged as a potential participant in this study, they will be randomised to either standard therapy (control) or HHFNC therapy (intervention). If they are randomised to the control group then they will be placed on nasal prongs, hudson mask or non-rebreather mask as per standard therapy to patients who present with respiratory distress. Standard therapy used is dry oxygen from a flow metre attached to the wall of cubicles. The O2 concentration, flow rate and type of delivery (i.e. nasal prongs or mask) are dependent on the clinical severity of the patient and response. If there is no improvement or worsening symptoms then the patients can be escalated to the HHFNC arm or other (i.e. Bi-Pap) at the discretion of the physician.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who experience relief of dyspnea. This will be defined as a reduction of 20 points on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS), reduction in heart and respiratory rate prior to discharge from ED. The proportion of patients who achieve dyspnea relief in each group will be reported and the differences between each group (with a 95% confidence interval of the difference) will be reported.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tne Breathe Easy Early study is a randomised control trial to assess the efficacy of early intervention with humidified high flow nasal cannula in the emergency department- Optimising outcomes in the Golden Hour of respiaratory failure. 
Many patients present to the emergency department frequently feeling breathless. The cause of the breathlessness is varied and can be caused by problems with the heart, lungs, cancer or infection. On presentation to the emergency department, standard treatment of the breathless patient involves the application of oxygen via a face mask in addition to drug therapy and investigations including chest xrays and blood tests. If
breathlessness gets worse, the patient may need breathing support in the way of non invasive or invasive breathing support which requires intensive nursing and medical care. Despite the benefit of these therapies they come with inherent risks to the patient. A breathing support device that provides noninvasive humidified high flow via a nasal cannula is one method of breathing support that is currently utilised safely in the critical care units of adult and paediatric hospitals. The high flow delivery provides small amounts of pressure to reduce the effort exerted by the patient while breathing in and to help splint the airways open. This pressure is not present during simple oxygen therapy. Additionally, the humidification of the high flow therapy helps maintain normal airway and lung function, by not drying out the airways. If we treat patients early with high flow therapy rather than using the standard facemask, we may be able to relieve symptoms of shortness of breath sooner and avoiding the worsening of breathing difficulties.

Research Design and Methods:
Ipswich Hospital Emergency Department will be the pilot site for this randomised controlled trial of early intervention with humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) vs. standard practice in the breathless patient. Patients that present to the Ipswich Hospital ED with dyspnoea will be identified at the point of triage and flagged as potential participants in the study. Participants will be randomised to receive study arm (HHFNC) or standard practice.

Outcomes:
The Primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who experience relief of dyspnoea.
The secondary outcomes will include
Time to relief of dyspnoea
Time requiring respiratory supplementation
Health care cost reduction with early initiation of supportive respiratory support</summary>
