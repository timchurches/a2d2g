  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pharmacokinetic analysis of antibiotic disposition in children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Antibiotics (cephazolin, vancomycin) are given intravenously during the procedure only. The first dose is at induction of anaesthesia. A second dose is commonly given at the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass. They are not continued into the postoperative period. A dosing log will be kept.
</interventions>
    <comparator>This is an observational study of drug disposition in those children given routine prophylactic antibiotics</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Characterise antibiotic disposition in children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass or on extracorporeal circuits.
Blood assays taken after drug administration will be used for a pharmacokinetic population analysis using mixed effects models. Covariate effects (age, size, renal function, surgical type, bypass duration, temperature) will be assessed in order to decrease population parameter variability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approx 15 blood samples for assay from each individual will be taken over the duration of surgery from anaesthesia induction and into a 12 h postoperative period. Specific time points are not used for this type of analysis, but rather windows of time e.g. early samples assist determination of V; late samples (3 half lives) help determine CL. Samples will be required after interventions (e.g bypass initiation). Optimal design simulation will be used to determine the best windows for sampling</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The use of simulation using computer modelling to predict therapeutic blood concentrations in a typical individual</outcome>
      <timepoint>This simulation analysis will be performed once data for primary endpoint analysis is complete. We anticipate 6 months after PK analysis is complete </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>We will relate given dose to observed drug concentration in the blood, using nonlinear mixed effects models and the computer program NONMEM. Once a structural pharmacokinetic model has been developed, we will consider incorporation of key covariates to better describe variability in observed concentrations following standard dosing in our population. We will assess our model using standard goodness of fit criterion and plots, visual predictive checks and simulation methods. Required numbers required for this population analysis remain uncertain but we anticipate approx. 50 children. This aspect is pharmacokinetics

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prophylactic antibiotic choice and dosing during paediatric cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass  remains poorly defined. Cardiac surgery should be associated with an incidence of infection (superficial and deep) &lt; 5%. This target is not reached in many centres. One contributing factor is a lack of understanding of antibiotic pharmacokinetics during support with extracorporeal circuits. Dosing may not achieve desired concentrations in the body. Children undergoing cardiac surgery will receive routine antibiotic prophylaxis. Blood concentrations will be monitored. Population pharmacokinetic modelling will be used to determine a dosing regimen to achieve desired target concentration. </summary>
