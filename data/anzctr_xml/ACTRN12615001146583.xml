    <interventions>The primary outcome of this study is to determine the effect of hyperbaric pressure on the flow rate of the Baxter elastomeric LV 10 pumps. This will be done by placing elastomeric pumps in the hyperbaric chamber at three different pressures and comparing the flow rates to those obtained by elastomeric pumps not pressurized. Pump weight will be used as a surrogate for flow rate. At no time will any solution be administered into any participant. The solution will be collected in a specimen container held next to the participants arm.
Participants will  be allocated to one of the 4 pressure groups. All pressurizations will be in a hyperbaric chamber, no participant will be underwater. The 0 kPa group will have the pump attached to their arm for 2 hours. The other 3 pressure groups will be of the duration of their respective treatment table, T10 (101kPa) 90 minutes , T14. (140 kPa) 110 minutes and T18 90 minutes (180 kPa). Participants may be used more than once. All dives will be no-decompression dives (ie decompression stops on ascent are not required to off gas absorbed nitrogen during compression to prevent decompression sickness (the bends)) and no participant will be compressed on two consecutive days. A certified hyperbaric technician will compress the chamber and monitor that all treatment pressures are adhered to by the current computerized chamber system.

This study will test one null hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: There is no difference in the flow rate of elastomeric pumps at sea level (0kPa) and any of the three common hyperbaric treatment pressures (101 kPa, 140 kPa and 180 kPa).

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is to determine the effect of hyperbaric pressure on the flow rate of the Baxter elastomeric LV 10 pumps. In a pilot study it was verified that the weight of the delivered solution equaled the infusion rate that is gram=milliliters, therefore weight will be used as a surrogate marker of flow rate. The pumps will be weighed using a scale, rated for 1 kilogram with 2 decimal points, prior to compression and at the end of compression to determine the amount of solution delivered and therefore flow rate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pumps will be tested at 0 (sea level) and at 101, 140 and 180 kilopascals (kPa). Separate pumps will be tested at the commencement of the infusion (0 to 2 hours) and at the last 2 hours (19 to 21 hours post commencement) to replicate the clinically significant time the patient would be in the hyperbaric chamber. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome of this study is to determine the effect of hyperbaric pressure on the flow rate of the Baxter elastomeric LV 10 pumps. In a pilot study it was verified that the weight of the delivered solution equaled the infusion rate that is gram equals milliliters, therefore weight will be used as a surrogate marker of flow rate. The mean amount of solution delivered across the different compression and time points will be analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

The pump specifications state that the nominal flow rate will be 10 ml/hr plus or minus 10 percent using 5 percent dextrose as a diluent solution at 31.1 degrees Celsius. The flow rate may be 1o percent faster than the labelled rate (i.e, 11 ml/hr) when normal saline (NS) is used. All the antibiotics at The Townsville Hospital are diluted using NS; therefore a flow rate of 11 ml/hr will be used. A 10 percent (1.0 to 1.1 ml) under or over administration rate is considered clinically acceptable; a flow rate error of 20 percent more or less than recommended could be clinically significant. Therefore a flow rate of less than 9 or greater than 13 ml/hr will be considered significant.

The sample size calculation is based on 4 levels of effect for pressurization (0 kPa, 101 kPa, 140 kPa, 180 kPa) and 2 levels of effect for time (0 to 2 hrs and 19-21 hours), a known variability in the pump delivery rate of plus or minus 10 percent (or 1 ml), and a 2 ml threshold for significance (i.e., an effect size of 2.0). We estimate a sample size of 5 pumps at each compression depth for each time point (total  equals 40) will provide a greater than 90 percent power (with an alpha equal to 0.05) to detect a 2.0 ml difference in delivered volume across the different compressions and time points.

We will use separate pumps for each test. That is, we won't use the same pump for 0 to 2 hr at 0 kPa and then waste the remainder to use it again at 19 to 21 hr.  This is to avoid compounding the intrinsic error in a single pump.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Elastomeric pumps are balloons filled with antibiotics. As they deflate they deliver the medication to the patient at a constant rate. Patients that require long term antibiotics, such as as for infections in the bone, often use these pumps. These patients may also require treatment in the hyperbaric chamber for their infection. This study will compare the flow rate of the elastomeric pump in the hyperbaric chamber with its flow rate outside the hyperbaric chamber. If the pump flows at the same rate in the hyperbaric chamber there will be no need for disconnecting the pump before hyperbaric treatment. This will improve patient care by reducing the risk of infection and ensure appropriate antibiotic dose administration.</summary>
