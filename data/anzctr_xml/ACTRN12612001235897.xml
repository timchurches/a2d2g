  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will evaluate the bronchodilatory effect, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of TD-4208 for 7 days in subjects with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. 

Each subject will receive four of six possible doses of TD-4208 (22 micro g, 44 micro g, 88 micro g, 175 micro g, 350 micro g, or 700 micro g) and placebo once per day via a nebulizer over five 7-day study periods in an incomplete crossover study design. Each period of treatment will be separated a washout period of 10 days up to a maximum of 16 days dependent on logistic considerations for the next dosing period. 

A final safety follow-up assessment will be completed for all subjects 7 to 14 days after their last study treatment dose.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo solution is made of citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate and normal saline.</comparator>

4. Subject has an uncontrolled hematologic, immunologic, renal, neurologic, hepatic, endocrine, or other disease or condition based on information gathered from the medical history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that might place the subject at undue risk or potentially compromise the results or interpretation of the study.

Subject has a history (or family history) of congenital prolonged QTc syndrome or has an abnormal clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening, including QTcB value &gt;450 msec (males) or &gt;470 msec (females); or shows evidence of clinically significant rhythm abnormality.
6. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to TD-4208 or similar drug class. 
7. Subject has a history of alcoholism or drug abuse within 2 years prior to screening.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Each subject will be randomized immediately before dosing using a central Interactive Web Randomization System (IWRS) to one of 60 unique treatment sequences (six different treatment combinations, each ordered in 10 unique sequences) with placebo and four dose levels of TD-4208.  The Investigator and study staff and all sponsor trial staff will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Non-study staff prepared the randomization lists and these reside in the IWRS system and are not available except in the case of an emergency.</concealment>
    <sequence>A statistical programmer at Theravance Biopharma, Inc. who is not involved in the study was responsible for preparing the randomization schedule using a computer program. The randomization schedule specifies the treatment sequence for each treatment number. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are five (5) periods in the study. Study treatments are to be administered once daily for seven (7) days in each of the five (5) periods.  All participants will receive seven (7) daily doses of placebo for one of the five (5) treatment periods.

The duration of the study is up to 134 days:
- participants will receive study medication for up to 35 days (28 days active drug and 7 days placebo)
- the remaining 99 days consist of: the screening period; each washout period between the five (5) dosing periods (i.e., the period when participants are not taking study medication); and the safety follow-up visit.</summary>
