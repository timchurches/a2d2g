  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will receive ACH-0144471 as Liquid Filled Capsule (LFC), tablet or Softgel capsules.
A total of 26 healthy subjects, between the ages of 18 and 55 years inclusive, will be enrolled into 2 groups. The first group, (Group 1), will have 18 subjects, and each will receive 3 single dose treatments. 
The second group, (Group 2), will have 8 subjects, and each will receive 2 single dose treatments.

Subjects in Group 1 will be randomised to receive 1 of 3 treatments in an open label and 3-period crossover study design.
The three treatments are:
A single dose of the LFC, fasted, followed by a 4-day (96 hour) washout.
A single dose of the tablet, fed medium fat meal, followed by a 4-day (96 hour) washout.
A single dose of the tablet, fasted, followed by a 4-day (96 hour) washout.

Subjects in Group 2 will be randomised to receive 1 of 2 treatments  in an open label and 2-period crossover study design.
The two treatments are:
A single dose of the LFC, fasted, followed by a 4-day (96 hour) washout.
A single dose of the softgel capsule, fasted, followed by a 4-day (96 hour) washout.

The ACH-0144471 dose to be used for all three formulations will be the same and will be determined based upon review of data from the ongoing single and multiple ascending
dose studies. The ACH-0144471 daily dose will not exceed 1600 mg.
The current ongoing studies are registered under the following ACTRN identifiers:
Single Ascending Dose study  ACH471-001 ACTRN 12616000082404
Multiple Ascending Dose study  ACH471-002 ACTRN  12616000568415
All doses of ACH-0144471 will be administered orally and taken under direct observation of research staff. Dosing should be at the same time each day and the time of dose administration will be recorded.
</interventions>
    <comparator>ACH-0144471 Liquid Filled Capsule (LFC), will be the reference comparator for this study.
The LFC dose will be determined based  upon review of data from the ongoing single and multiple ascending dose studies.  </comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety of ACH-0144471 after single dose administration as a tablet, softgel capsule, or the LFC in healthy volunteers.
The safety of each formulation of ACH-0144471 as determined by number and incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs); AEs leading to discontinuation of the study; and the number and incidence of clinically significant laboratory and ECG abnormalities.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse Events and Serious Adverse events will be assessed at the following visits for each group.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effect of concomitant food intake on ACH-0144471 pharmacokinetics (PK) after administration as a tablet in healthy volunteers.
Plasma ACH-0144471 concentration-time data will be analyzed by non-compartmental methods with PK software programs. Calculations will be based on the actual 
sampling times recorded during the study. From the plasma concentration-time data, the following plasma PK parameters of ACH-0144471 will be determined for each treatment: Cmax, tmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-8, and t1/2.  Additional PK parameters may be calculated.
PK parameters for ACH-0144471 will be summarized for each treatment group using descriptive statistics. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) for cross-over design techniques will be performed on the ln-transformed PK parameters, e.g., Cmax, AUCs. Ninety percent (90%) confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference between the treatment means for each parameter will be calculated to determine the relative bioavailability of the tablet or soft-gel capsule formulations vs. the reference formulation LFC.
For Tmax, non-parametric technique will be utilized to assess the comparability of the tablet or softgel capsule formulations with reference formulation LCF.
Food effect on tablet formulation will also be assessed.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ACH-0144471 is an orally administered, small molecule, fD inhibitor that inhibits the alternative pathway of complement. Its alternative pathway inhibitory activity has been established in nonclinical studies, as well as in human healthy subjects in the single ascending dose study in healthy subjects (ACH471-001) that is ongoing in New Zealand. ACH-0144471 has the potential to treat multiple complement mediated diseases 
including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).
In both the ACH471-001 (SAD) and ACH471-002 (MAD) clinical trials of ACH-0144471,
an extemporaneously prepared LFC have been used. For continued development, 
more formulations of ACH-0144471 are being developed. The aim of this study is to determine the relative bioavailability and clinical safety of these two new formulations (tablet and softgel capsule) under fed and fasted conditions compared to the reference LFC formulation. The effect of food on the bioavailability of ACH-0144471  in the LFC will have been determined in the SAD study. 
The results from this study will provide quantitative information that will be used to determine doses of the new formulations that will provide similar exposures to those achieved by the LFC.</summary>
