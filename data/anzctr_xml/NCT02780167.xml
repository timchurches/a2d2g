    <summary>Study B7451006 is a Phase 2b POC study which is planned to assess four PF 04965842 once daily
      (QD) doses (10, 30, 100, 200 mg) relative to placebo over 12 weeks to characterize the
      efficacy and safety of PF 04965842 in subjects with moderate to severe AD. The objectives of
      the study are to demonstrate the efficacy of PF 04965842 by showing improvement in disease
      severity in patients with moderate to severe AD as measured by the Investigator's Global
      Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores, and safety to support
      further clinical development of PF 04965842.</summary>
