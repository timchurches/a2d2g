  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anti-immunoglobulin E antibody will be administered to participants as a subcutaneous injection, at a dose of 375mg (which may be altered during the course of treatment, depending on individual patient response), every fortnight, for a total of 24 weeks, equivalent to twelve doses.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this trial will be the effect of treatment with anti-immunoglobulin E antibody on the symptoms of mastocytosis. Symptoms of mastocytosis include a flaring rash, anaphylaxis (a severe life-threatening episode that resembles severe allergic reaction), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headaches. This will be assessed using a variety of data collection tools including questionnaires for the patients to complete on a regular basis, photographic doumentation of the rash before and after treatment, assessment of symptoms and rash by a doctor, and independent assessment of rash by a dermatologist. Blood tests measuring serum tryptase (a marker of mastocytosis activity) will also be collected several times during the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be assessed at multiple time points - on a fortnightly basis during the 24 weeks of treatment, at the end of 24 weeks of treatment, and every month after treatment has been completed for 6 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome of this trial is physiological evidence of reduction of mast cell burden (mast cells being the cells that are increased in mastocytosis and are responsible for the symptoms). Mast cell burden is assessed on bone marrow and a blood test (tryptase). A bone marrow is done as part of standard care in mastocytosis and so this trial will collect the results of this test, done any time in the 12 months leading up to the start of the trial. A second bone marrow will be repeated 6 months after therapy has been completed. Bone marrow assessment will follow published guidelines for mastocytosis. Blood levels of Immunoglobulin E will also be performed to assess the effect of treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Again, this secondary outcome will be assessed by blood test (tryptase and total Immunogloblin E) at several points in the trial - at the end of treatment and 6 months after treatment. 
Bone marrow will only be performed twice for trial purposes.</timepoint>
