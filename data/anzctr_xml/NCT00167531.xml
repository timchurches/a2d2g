  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Being able to walk is a major determinant of whether a patient returns home after stroke or
      lives in residential care. For the family, the loss of the stroke sufferer from everyday life
      is a catastrophic event. For the community, the costs of being unable to walk after stroke
      are exorbitant, involving a lifetime of residential care. Therefore, an increase in the
      proportion of stroke patients who regain walking ability will be a significant advance.

      This trial will determine, in patients early after stroke who are unable to walk, whether
      training walking using a treadmill with partial weight support via an overhead harness will
      be more effective than current intervention in (i) establishing more independent walking,
      reducing the time taken to achieve independent walking, and improving the quality of
      independent walking, and (ii) improving walking capacity and participation 6 months later.</summary>
