    <interventions>Phase Two: Evaluating the efficacy of the narrative intervention
The second phase of this study, which follows on from the pilot study ACTRN12613001108707) will involve administering the narrative intervention programme to determine efficacy of the programme. 

Treatment sessions will occur at a selected school within the North East Metropolitan Education Region. Treatment will occur with 12 participants in small groups of three-four, three times a week for a period of six weeks. Participants will be monolingual English speaking, and aged between 5.5 and 6.5. The primary researcher will conduct the treatment sessions and all treatment sessions will be video and audio recorded with consent for later data analysis.

Intervention sessions will consist of a range of activities such as book sharing, story generation, picture sequencing, story re-tells and character maps. These activities are commonly used in Speech Pathology sessions with young children. Each intervention session will last for 45 minutes.

      <outcome>Pre- and post-treatment data collection will use the Test of Narrative Language. Narratives will be analysed according to the test guidelines, utilizing SALT. Samples will be scored on narrative quality, using a like-ert scale. Measures of narrative quality include; amount of scaffolding and support required, use of paralinguistic features and engagement.

Repeated measures analysis of the DVs will be completed using the macro and microstructure measures collected during baseline and treatment to determine change, and determine if changes are related to onset of treatment. Visual and statistical methods will be used to evaluate clinical and statistical significance. </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Twelve monolingual English-speaking children between the ages of 5.5 to 6.5 with narrative delay will be selected from a metropolitan mainstream school.  The school will be implementing typical classroom practice that does not include explicit teaching of narrative. A parent/teacher questionnaire will be used to ensure all participants are typically developing with no evidence of significant hearing, vision, behavioural, language and educational or medical issues present. </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will investigate the efficacy of a manualised theoretically driven oral narrative programme. Intervention will involve explicitly teaching macrostructure to 12 Pre-Primary children with narrative difficulties in small groups in a mainstream school. Multiple baseline repeated measures single-case design will be used to evaluate changes. Measures will include narrative macrostructure, microstructure and quality. The relationship between vocabulary and memory and response to intervention will also be investigated. This study has practical and theoretical significance as it will add to evidence for narrative intervention focusing on macrostructure and investigate the influence on vocabulary and sentence development.</summary>
