  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Garden to Table programme is an in-school nutrition promotion programme which teaches children to build a garden and to build and maintain a garden; to grow and harvest fruit, vegetables and herbs; and to prepare and share meals. A comparison of fruit and vegetable consumption and variety, as well as knowledge and attitudes about fruit and vegetables will be made between year 4 and 5 students who have been participating in the Garden to Table programme for at least one school year, with students at schools not participating in the programme, matched for year level.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research will evaluate the effect of the New Zealand Garden to Table programme on the amount and variety of fruit and vegetable consumption in children from high- and low-decile schools, and their knowledge and attitudes about fruit and vegetables. It will involve comparing children from primary schools with and without the programme, matched for decile. Quantitative questionnaires will be used to assess fruit and vegetable intake, variety, knowledge and attitudes. If the findings of this study support the Garden to Table programme, it could be used to justify an extension to other New Zealand schools, potentially having a major effect on childrens dietary patterns and their later risk of disease.</summary>
