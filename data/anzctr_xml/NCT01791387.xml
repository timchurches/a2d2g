  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Dovitinib

Experimental: Dovitinib - Dovitinib 500 mg taken orally once daily 5 days on / 2 days off, until disease progression


Treatment: drugs: Dovitinib
Patients will be treated with dovitinib (500 mg orally, once daily 5 days on/2 days off) until disease progression, intolerability, patient refusal, death or study drug discontinuation for any other reason. Dovitinib should be ingested at least 1 hour prior to a meal or at least 2 hours following a meal at approximately the same time each day.
If patients cannot tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose reductions or treatment interruptions are permitted. When necessary, dovitinib may be reduced to 400 mg for 5 days on/2 days off. If an additional dose reduction is required, dovitinib may be reduced to 300 mg dose 5 days on/2 days off. Once dose is reduced due to an adverse event, it cannot be re-escalated. Patients are allowed only 2 dose reductions.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by RECIST 1.1. - Description: Subjects will undergo baseline radiology assessment with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and head within 4 weeks of registration. Thereafter subjects will then undergo CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (where possible using the same technique) every 9 weeks until week 54. From week 54 onward, subjects will undergo CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis every 12 weeks until disease progression. Tumour responses will be evaluated using RECIST 1.1. Confirmation of responses (PR/CR) with repeat CT is not required as the primary end-point is PFS. CT will be the only imaging modality required for subjects on study. The RECIST 1.1 assessments will be done in Auckland by one of the members of the Tumour Response EvAluation Team (TREAT) who have expertise in RECIST reporting.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to find out how useful dovitinib is when given as the
      initial treatment to participants with advanced kidney cancer, that has spread to other parts
      of the body. The usefulness of dovitinib will be assessed by: how long the disease is
      controlled while participants are receiving the drug, the proportion of participants who get
      a reduction in the size of their tumours and how long participants live (both while on
      dovitinib and on any subsequent therapy they may receive).

      If participants have secondary disease in the bones, the study will evaluate how useful
      dovitinib is in controlling this site of disease. In addition, this study will look for
      changes in the genetic makeup of tumour cells and see if some of these changes are associated
      with a benefit from dovitinib. The study will also compare and contrast the genetic changes
      in the primary tumour cells with cells from secondary tumour specimens, and with cells from
      tumour specimens taken if a participant's disease has worsened. The purpose of the latter is
      to identify possible ways in which the tumour becomes resistant to the study drug.</summary>
