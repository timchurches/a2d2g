      <outcome>heart rate

Polar heart-rate monitors (Polar Vantage NV, Polar Electro Oy, Finland) were used to continuously collect heart rate data in the form of RR intervals from all participants before and after one session of qigong exercise. </outcome>

      <outcome>heart rate variability

After data collection, HRV parameters were calculated using Kubios HRV (version 2.1; Biosignal Analysis and Medical Imaging Group, University of Eastern Finland, Finland). The participants spectral HRV data were expressed in terms of RR intervals, lower frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), normalized LF, and normalized HF. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of this study are to evaluate the effects of qigong on meridian system, heart rate variability and quality of life. 50 healthy volunteers who practice qigong regularly will be recruited. Heart rate variability and questionnaires (SF-36 and State Trait Anxiety Inventory) will be collected 30 minutes before and  after one hour of qigong exercise. The meridian state will be measured using MEAD Skin Response Measurement Device. The condition of meridian will be evaluated 30 minutes before and  after one hour of qigong exercise. The results of outcome variables will be collected and compared.</summary>
