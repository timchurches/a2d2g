  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study formally investigates specific breathing exercises, using a threshold device, for patients who require a breathing machine. It is hoped that the study will demonstrate that this training reduces breathing muscle weakness and also enhances quality of life, with significant improvements even 2 weeks following weaning from the breathing machine. The results of this study will guide physiotherapists in the optimal treatment of breathing muscle weakness for patients who have needed a breathing machine.</summary>
