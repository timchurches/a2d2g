  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Part A:

          -  Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have either progressed on
             standard therapy or for whom standard therapy is not known

        Part B:

          -  Subjects with advanced or metastatic gastroesophageal cancer, HRPrC, HNSCC, or PRCC
             who have either progressed on standard therapy, or for whom standard therapy is not
             known. Eighteen (18) subjects each with gastroesophageal cancer, HRPrC, and HNSCC will
             be treated. Subjects with PRCC (up to 18) will be enrolled as feasible

          -  Tumor paraffin tissue block or 6-10 unstained slides from the tumor tissue block must
             be provided

          -  Subjects with HRPrC must have either measurable disease or rising PSA levels (=3
             consecutive rising levels with at least 1 week interval and with PSA level =5 mg/ml).
             All other subjects must have measurable disease as assessed by CT or MRI</inclusivecriteria>
