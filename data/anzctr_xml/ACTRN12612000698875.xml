  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or absence of surgical site infection.  This will be determined using the CDC definition of surgical site infection: is an infection which occurs within 30 days after the excision AND infection involves only skin or subcutaneous tissue of the incision, and at least ONE of the following: a purulent drainage with or without laboratory confirmation from the superficial incision, at least one of the signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness, localised swelling, redness or heat OR if diagnosis of infection is made by the general practitioner.  A stitch abscess is not considered as a superficial site infection.

Chi-squared test will then be used in order to determine how effective sterile or non-sterile gloves are in regards to infection, baseline comparison would be made between both the sterile and non-sterile groups in order to ensure that all variables are equally distributed in both arms of the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of removal of sutures, if excision on back- 10-14 days; if on other sites 5-7 days.  Patients can present up to 30 days to be considered as a post-operative surgical site infection.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to determine whether the use of non-sterile clean boxed gloves in comparison to the existing guidelines of using sterile gloves in minor skin excisions has an effect on surgical site infection (SSI).

Hypothesis: The use of non-sterile clean boxed gloves in minor skin excisions in general practice will not have an effect in increasing surgical site infections (SSI) compared to use of sterile gloves.</summary>
