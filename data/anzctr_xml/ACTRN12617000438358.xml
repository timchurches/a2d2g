  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with a peripheral intravenous catheter admitted to cancer care services unit, within the preceding 48 hour period will be identified prospectively. Consenting patients will have demographic data collected: e.g. admitting diagnosis, co-morbidities, skin and vein condition, cannula insertion details. Participants will be reviewed by a research nurse second daily and collect other risk factors including (but not limited to): antibiotic use, type and dosage, flushing regime, continuous or intermittent intravenous fluid administration, dressing and other securement types, presence of extension tubing or 3-way taps, catheter type and size. Details will be collected for all peripheral venous catheters the patient receives , as well as any subsequent central venous catheters during their hospital admission. Participants will be monitored until discharge from hospital.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Continuous data will be presented as means (and standard deviations), medians (and inter-quartile ranges); and categorical, nominal data will be presented as rates and percentages. For the primary outcomes, patients who experience peripheral vascular catheter failure will be compared against those who did not. Preliminary analysis will be performed to identify associations between risk factors and outcomes using independent sample t-tests or Chi-square tests, results will be presented as crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) or mean differences (MD) with their 95% CI. Predictors significant at the 0.1 level will inform multivariable modelling. As part of the analysis, potentially confounding factors and multicollinearity will be assessed. Survival analysis will be used to evaluate time-to-event data (e.g. time to catheter failure). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This observational study will evaluate causes of catheter failure in cancer care patients. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been admitted to a cancer care service inpatient unit, and have had a peripheral venous catheter (PVC) inserted within 48 hours of admission.

Study details
All participants in this study will be reviewed by a research nurse second daily throughout their hospital admission. Information will be collected about risk factors, such as antibiotic use, flushing regime, dressing types and catheter types; and catheter related outcomes such as PVC failure, insertion of a Central Venous Access Device (CVAD), adverse events, and hospital length of stay.

Participants in the study who experience peripheral catheter failure will be compared against those who did not, to identify the risk factors associated with this failure and how this can be mitigated. Patients who go on to receive Central Venous Access Devices (CVADs) will also be compared to those who do not, in order to explore the decision-making processes that go into transitioning to long-term devices (as well as the outcomes of these decisions e.g. CVAD success or failure).</summary>
