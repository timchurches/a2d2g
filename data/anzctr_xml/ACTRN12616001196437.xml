    <interventions>Esoteric Connective Tissue Therapy (ECTT)
Materials: Participant Information and Consent Form
Procedures: Esoteric Connective Tissue Therapy
The treatment consists of small circular motions, primarily with a diameter of 23.5cm to the legs, arms and head, with the motions to the head being even smaller. Further actions involve techniques for gently holding the hip, knee, ankle, back and spine, allowing the body to adjust (align). 
Who: Two ECTT Practitioners with eight years' experience each. One per patient.
Mode of delivery: Face to face, client lies on massage table
Number of times: Four 40 minute sessions, once per week for four weeks
Location: Hospital
Personalisation: No personalisation
Adherence: Each session is recorded by the nursing staff.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Physiotherapy
Materials: Participant Information and Consent Form, Heat Lamp, TENS machine, electro-acupuncture, vibrating handheld massage tool
Procedures: 

Massage of low back for 15 minutes:
   Slapping with cupped hands to increase movement
   Circular massage movement on low back.
   Further slapping with cupped hands.
   Using thumbs on each side of spine along the spine.
   Kneading of skin and underlying muscles.

TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) machine for 15 minutes using 9V electrical pulses transmitted via electrodes placed on the skin at the low back area of pain. 

Electro-acupuncture with 250W UV heat lamp for 20 minutes. Electro-acupuncture applies a pulsating electrical current to acupuncture needles which are placed on the low back of the client. The current is 50Hz, 90-120V, 10-80 milliamps with the highest setting used that the patient is comfortable with. The heat lamp is 250W and 50cm distant from the patient's low back.

Who: Physiotherapy nurses with three years' training
Mode of delivery: Face to face, client lies on massage table
Number of times: Four 50 minute sessions, once per week for four weeks
Location: Hospital
Personalisation: No personalisation except for intensity of TENS and electro-acupuncture stimulation.
Adherence: Each session is recorded by the nursing staff.

    <statisticalmethods>a. Satterthwaite's t-test to compare means of treatment and control groups at primary endpoints. In a phase I/II study by a physiotherapist (unpublished), Kate Greenaway, the mean pain score for participants with a starting pain level of 30/100 or more improved by 28mm with an sd of 20mm after five treatments.
Assuming a 10mm improvement in the control group with the same standard deviation, a power (beta) of 0.8 and a=0.05, we need a sample size of 2x21=42 for Satterthwaites t-test to have a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) result, ignoring crossovers and withdrawals. Hence 50 participants in each group could well be sufficient.
As the pain score is longitudinal data, multi-level modelling will also be employed in the analysis of the pain score.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to ascertain how a newly developed complementary-to-medicine low intervention therapy called Esoteric Connective Tissue Therapy (ECTT) compares to the standard treatment, physiotherapy, for chronic low back pain.
The main hypotheses are that ECTT provides a larger improvement than physiotherapy in a. pain reduction as measured on the 0-100 Visual Analogue Pain Scale, b. physical and mental well-being as scored by the SF-36 questionnaire or c. pain functionality as measured by the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale.</summary>
