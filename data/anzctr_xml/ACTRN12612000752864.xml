  <interventions>
    <interventions>The experimental group received a whole body vibration treatment with an increase in the frequency (from 5 to 21 Hz), sets (from 4 to 7) and the time per set (from 30 to 60 s) over 17 sessions (2 sessions per week). Each subject was placed standing on a vibration platform (Galileo Home, Galileo, Novotec, Germany), with a knee flexion of 30 degrees (taking 0 degrees as the anatomical position). In front of the subject was a wall bar that could be grabbed if they were to fall. In each set, the vibration was applied first in the medio-lateral axis (ML, with the feet parallel to the lower edge of the platform) and, then in the antero-posterior axis (AP, with the feet parallel to the longest edge of the platform). These foot positions determined the vibration amplitude, which ranged between 4 and 6 mm peak to peak.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each subject was placed standing on a vibration platform. The experimental group received a whole body vibration treatment, with an increase in frequency, sets, and time per set over 17 sessions. The sham group -control- performed the same exercises as the experimental group, but were not exposed to the vibration.</comparator>

    <summary>Background. Whole-body vibrations (WBV) have recently been applied and investigated as a rehabilitation method. 
Objective. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of WBV on lower limb muscle architecture, muscle strength, and balance in stroke patients over a period of 3 months.
Design. The study used a prospective, randomized, before-after trial design. Inclusion criteria were to have suffered an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke 6 or more months prior to the study, and a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score greater than 1 and less than 20.
Patients. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG; n = 11) and a sham group (SG; n = 9). 
Intervention. Each subject was placed standing on a vibration platform. The EG received a WBV treatment, with an increase in frequency, sets, and time per set over 17 sessions. The SG performed the same exercises as the EG, but were not exposed to the vibration. 
Measurements. Outcome variables included the muscle architecture (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and medial gastrocnemious), maximal isometric voluntary contraction of knee extensors, and Berg balance scale.</summary>
