  <interventions>
    <interventions>Therapy will be tailored to the individual participant. It will focus on reading material of the participants choice.  Goals will be determined with the client and the therapy will be tailored to meet those goals.  The clients reading profile will influence the therapy approach adopted.  Methods used will be similar to those used at the City University London Reading Clinic including highlighting words, using mind maps, creating summaries of chapters on post-it notes etc.  Participants will attend 12-13 therapy sessions, 1 session per week for 1 hr.  Ideally, all participants would have been seen at the student clinic but the student clinic only has capacity for 10 clients and only runs one day a week, in order to increase the numbers of clients that could be seen at the clinic and increase the flexibility of the days that therapy is offered we sought funding for a research assistant to see an additional 5 participants.  There will be no difference in the type of therapy that will be provided by the students and the research assistant.</interventions>

Fifteen participants with mild-moderate reading difficulties related to impaired cognition or language after stroke will be recruited from community stroke groups in Perth. Ten participants will attend the student clinic and an additional five will be seen by a research assistant.
Participants will participate in assessments at five time points and 12-13 therapy sessions.  The assessments will consist of the following:
*Three pre-therapy assessments:  an initial baseline assessment (A1) spread over two sessions, a second baseline assessment one month later (A2) and an additional assessment session one week later (A3).
* Two post-therapy sessions: one week after therapy is completed (A4) spread over two sessions and one a month after therapy is completed (A5) in order to determine whether gains have been maintained
Gray Oral Reading Assessment V (GORT-V) (Wiederholt &amp; Bryant, 2012), and the Western Aphasia Battery- Revised (WAB-R) (Kertesz, 2006) will measure changes to reading accuracy, reading speed, reading comprehension and verbal language.  These will be conducted in A1, A2, A4 and A5.
The Reading Confidence and Emotions Questionnaire (RCEQ) (Cocks et al., 2013) will capture changes in confidence and emotions associated with reading and conversing about reading.  This will be conducted in A1, A2, A4 and A5.
Any additional diagnostic assessments needed to confirm hypotheses about the client’s diagnoses will be carried out in A3, for example the non-word reading subtest from the Psycholinguistic Assessment of Language Processing in Aphasia (PALPA) (Kay, Coltheart, &amp; Lesser, 1992), the Test of Everyday Attention (TEA) (Robertson, Ward, &amp; Ridgeway, 1995).  If appropriate these diagnostic assessments will be repeated in the post-therapy sessions.
Exit interviews similar to that used in Cocks et al. (2013) will be conducted in A5.  These will capture changes to participation in reading and further information about changes to confidence and emotions associated with reading.  Questions will include: “Have you noticed any changes with your reading or your communication since you started coming to the clinic?” “What did you like/not like about therapy?” “Have there been any changes to activities you participate in outside of clinic that you think is a result of attending the clinic?”</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Analysis: The type of analysis used will depend on how different the participants goals and therapy will be.  It is most likely that participants will have different goals and so participants are most likely going to be treated as either single cases or a case series. 

As this was an exploratory study and very little research has been done previously on reading therapy for people who have reading difficulties as a result of cognitive or languae impairment, sample size was determined by clinic capacity and funding available.  As participants are most likely to be treated as single cases or a single case study the size of the sample was therefore not of concern.

If by chance all participants have similar goals and profiles (which is unlikely)  then their results will be grouped together and a repeated measures or Friedmans (depending on normality) ANOVAs will be used in order to capture changes in:
* reading speed, reading comprehension, reading accuracy (as indicated by GORT-V scores)
* verbal language (as indicated by WAB-R scores)
*reading confidence and emotions associated with reading (as indicated on RCEQ)

Friedman's ANOVA will most likely be used due to the small sample size and likelihood of the assumption of normality being violated.

Please note that the most likely scenario is that participants will be treated as single case studies or in a case series.

The interviews will be analysed qualitatively in order to capture recurrent themes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reading is a significant part of our everyday lives.  Reading is needed for work, for home life, e.g. reading bills and for pleasure, e.g. reading a novel or reading aloud to grandchildren.  The loss of the ability to read as a result of a stroke can therefore have a devastating impact on peoples lives.  There is therefore a significant need to find reading therapy approaches that are effective. This project will determine the effectiveness of reading therapy delivered at Curtin University Reading Clinic (CURC) for people who have mild-moderate reading difficulties after stroke.  Fifteen participants will be recruited to take part in the study.  Assessments will be conducted pre and post therapy in order to determine effectiveness.  Gains will be measured in terms of reading accuracy, reading comprehension, reading speed, verbal language, reading confidence and emotions associated with reading.  Additional qualitative data regarding identity as a reader and participation in reading related activities will also be collected via a post-therapy interview.  Therapy will focus on functional reading and use materials selected by the participants e.g. a novel they wish to read.  The therapy approach will be individualised depending on the participants own goals and the profile of their reading difficulties.  We hypothesise that the reading therapy delivered by CURC will result in similar gains to those found with the participants in Cocks et al., 2013 and Cocks et al., 2010.  These include significant, positive improvements in: reading comprehension, reading accuracy, reading speed, improved verbal language, pleasure in reading, confidence with reading and participation in reading related activities.</summary>
