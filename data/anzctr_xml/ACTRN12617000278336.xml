  <interventions>
    <interventions>60 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive either azithromycin (125mg) twice per day or Erythromycin ethylsuccinate 400mg twice per day for 4 weeks orally. adherence to therapy will be monitored by counting the number of tablets retuned after one week and 4 weeks.  80% adherence to therapy will be considered compliant.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether erythromycin and azithromycin differ in their respective propensities to induce macrolide resistance within commensal oropharyngeal flora in healthy participants (index case). Throat swabs will be assessed by PCR and sequencing of the resident streptococcal species.  Genetic determinants of macrolide resistance will be assessed before starting the drug, at weeks one and 4 after starting the drug and 30 days after finishing the drug. comparisons to baseline and between each group will be assessed to determine whether there is an increase in macrolide resistance, </outcome>
      <timepoint>week 1, week 4 after starting study treatment and 30 days post end of intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether macrolide resistance also develops in the commensal oropharyngeal flora of close household contacts of the index case, who is consuming macrolides in the short-term (within 4 weeks).  Throat swabs will be assessed by PCR and sequencing of the resident streptococcal species. Genetic determinants of macrolide resistance will be assessed before starting the drug, at weeks one and 4, and 30 days after finishing the study. comparisons between treated subjects and their household contacts will be assessed to determine whether there is an increase in macrolide resistance in the untreated group also, </outcome>
      <timepoint>week 1, week 4 after starting study treatment and 30 days post end of intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the effect of macrolide antibiotics upon oropharyngeal microbiota composition. Throat swabs will be assessed by PCR and sequencing of the resident streptococcal species.  Genetic determinants of macrolide resistance will be assessed before starting the drug, at weeks one and 4 after starting the drug and 30 days after finishing the drug. comparisons to baseline and between each group will be assessed to determine whether there is a difference in macrolide resistance induction between the two drugs, </outcome>
      <timepoint>week 1, week 4 after starting study treatment and 30 days post end of intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine changes in resistance gene profiles in oropharyngeal flora in response to macrolide antibiotic therapy.  Throat swabs will be assessed by PCR and sequencing of the resident streptococcal species. Genetic determinants of macrolide resistance will be assessed before starting the drug, at weeks one and 4 after starting the drug and 30 days after finishing the drug. comparisons to baseline and between each treatment group, </outcome>

Quantification of bacterial resistance genes 
Multiplex endpoint PCR assay will be used to determine the presence of a panel of resistance genes (erm(A), erm(B), mef, tet(M), tet(O), tet(K), tet(L) as described in Malhotra-Kumar.
Where resistant genes are detected; gene specific qPCR assays will be used to determine their abundance relative to total bacterial load. This will be determined by 16srRNA gene qPCR as previously detailed in Rogers GB et al
Microbiota composition analysis
Oropharyngeal swabs will undergo DNA extraction, followed by paired-read 16S-rRNA gene V1-V3 amplicon sequencing, using the illumine MISeq platform as per Rogers GB et al 
Subsequent data analysis will utilize the following principles: Bray Curtis dissimilarity matrices will be generated based on microbiota profiles from visit 1, 2 and 3 samples. Distribution of microbiota similarity will be visualized by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and the existence of significant between group differences tested by PERMANOVA test. Specifically assessment will be made on whether significant differences exist in microbiota composition between azithromycin or erythromycin groups at each timepoint. Where significant variances occur, SIMPER analysis will be used to determine the contribution to observed subgroup differences in microbiota composition by determining individual bacterial taxa as described in Rogers GB et al. . Significance of these taxon-level differences will be tested based on relative abundance variation (Mann Whitney U Test).
