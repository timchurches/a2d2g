    <interventions>Mobile Text Message Reminders:Contant of these text message reminders are gereral dietary tips, we developed these text message reminders using "American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide"

Cereal, starch and whole grain foods:

1.Eat plenty of cereals (preferably whole grain), including breads, pasta and rice.
2.To eat more whole grains, use a whole-grain product instead of a refined product - such as eating whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.
3.Cooked oatmeal is an inexpensive, healthy cereal, which lowers cholesterol also.
4.Do not use white rice, instead use brown rice.
5.Do not eat fried food e.g. French fries, fried rice and biryani. Prefer baked products.

Vegetable:

1.Choose most of your foods from vegetables. These foods are loaded with nutrition, providing vitamins, and minerals
2.Keep a bowl of cut-up all kinds of vegetables on the top shelf of your refrigerator. So you will have frequently in your diet.
3.Start every meal with a salad: a mix of dark green varieties of lettuce and colorful vegetables.
4.Do not use fried vegetables. Use a nonstick frying pain to avoid oil.
5.Do not cook vegetable for a long period of time, than it will lose its nutrient.
  
Fruits:

1.Include fresh, low sugar fruits in your diet e.g. apple, apricot, lemon, papaya, plum etc.
2.Do not eat more than one fruit at a time but you can include a variety over the whole day.
3.Try to eat fruits with skin. Do not peel the skin of apple, apricot, pear, peach and plums etc. 
4.Eat small amount of grapes, mango and persimmon, overeating of these foods is non-beneficial. 
5.Do not put fruits in refrigerator for long, try to eat fresh fruits.

Nuts and legume:

1.Nuts are laden with fat, but the type of fat is good for our heart, (most nuts do not contain saturated fat, coconut is an exception).
2.To keep your heart and blood vessels healthy, choose plant foods, such as include nuts, legumes and olives in cooking.
3.Some legumes are beings used to improve diabetics' blood glucose control i.e. Soya beans, fava beans, guar ki phalli and same etc. 
4.Daal eaten with roti or rice provides good quality protein to an individual.
5.Do not overcook beans, because they will lose the important nutrients. 

Fish, poultry and eggs:

1.Choose fish and skinless poultry for your diet. 
2.Limit the number of eggs you eat to 2-3 per week. 
3.Fish, poultry and eggs are all good sources of high-quality protein
4.Seafood (fish) is a good source of food containing healthy contents, so consume fish 1/week at least.
5.Prepare fish baked, broiled, grilled or boiled rather than breaded and fried. 

Dairy products:

1.Select low-fat or fat-free milk e.g. skim milk.
2.Choose low-fat and fat-free yogurt, artificially sweetened or unsweetened.
3.Many dairy products, like no sugar added, fat-free yogurt, can be eaten as a dessert 
4.Do not eat butter daily in your routine.
5.Do not eat food containing high quantity of cheese like pizza's and cheese burgers.  
 
Meat products:

1.Meat and meat products:  Eat sparingly, once in a week or even less than that.
2.Meat is good sources of high-quality protein, but they also come with high fats, so be careful.
3.Buy lean cuts of meat.
4.There are several ways you can reduce the fat in meat: Broil, grill, steam or roast instead of frying.
5.Chill meat broth and drippings so the fat rises and solidifies. Then it can be skimmed off the top before serving or making gravy. 

Sweets and drinks:

1.Sweets and cold drinks: Eat small amounts of these foods, once or less times in a week.
2.Artificial sweeteners give you the sweet taste of sugar without its calories. One packet gives the same sweetness as two teaspoons of table sugar.
3.Volunteer to bring your favorite low-sugar dessert to social functions
4.Always check every label if in any doubt about a food or drink.
5.Try to use diet drinks rather better to avoid at all.

Discription:
we will send 3 different messages per week for three months (12 week). 

A pamphlet of general dietary guidelines will be given to the patient while conducting baseline interview in the clinic face to face. And a breif counseling will be given.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compliance to dietary guidelines scores would be the Primary outcome , which would be measured by using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). FFQ would be conducted at the baseline as well as after the intervention period (3 months of follow up). We would expect a difference of 1.5 score of dietary compliance between the two groups</outcome>
      <timepoint>We will conduct the food frequency questionnaire at the baseline, midway (one and half month) for the interim analysis and at the end of follow up period (three months)</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1. We will enroll a subject  from Aga Khan Hospital by taking information about the status of the disease both from online records and from each participant. We would inform the participants (in person) about our study in detail. If the participant would agree to participate, then he/she would be given a copy of consent form with our signature, which would contain detailed information about the study. We would confirm the eligible cases by reviewing their files at the clinic after taking informed consent. Those who are eligible for our study based on the eligibility criteria would be interviewed.
2. Sealed Opaque envolopes will be used. A third person will randomly pic the envolop to allocate the subject.</concealment>
    <sequence>We will use block randomization. We made all the possible combinations for these two blocks. We assign A for intervention and B for control group. We made the envelops of only two combination for block 2, i.e. AB and BA while for block 4 we made 6 possible combinations like AABB, ABAB, BABA, BBAA, ABBA, BAAB. A third person is picking any one of the envelop to assign the participant for any of the group.</sequence>
