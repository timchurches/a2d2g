  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study participants were randomized into two arm:
Arm 1: HPV DNA self-sampling before Pap smear
Arm 2: Pap smear before HPV DNA self-sampling

Participants were explained the study detail before agreeing to participate, they performed both HPV DNA self-sampling and Pap smear.

Each woman was given a long-handled, sterile Dacron swab in a wrapper, a plastic vial and a specimen bag.  The participant was directed to a private, well-lit room.  Verbal and written instructions for cell collection and diagram of the female genital anatomy were provided.  The participant inserted the swab into her vagina at least 2 inches deep following with five full rotations of the swab.  The participant then pulled out the swab, placed it in the plastic vial and be sealed in a specimen bag.

Each woman was examined by clinicians. The clinician collected a Pap smear sample from the ectocervix using a cytobrush. The cytobrush was placed into a 20 ml vial containing phosphate-buffered saline. Research staff pipetted 1 ml of this solution to a vial for the purpose of HPV DNA test.

Both self-sampling and Pap smear were conducted on the same day one immediately after the other.</interventions>

      <outcome>Participants' acceptability towards HPV DNA self-sampling vs clinician sampling. Each participant was asked the acceptability towards both sampling methods, by means of face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. After having both screening tests performed, they were again asked the acceptability and preferences toward both methods.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on 50% of acceptance of HPV sampling from our previous pilot study, the minimum sample size was estimated at 390 participants with 95% power at 5% level of statistical level.

Acceptability of self-sampling method and Pap smear was compared using McNemar test. The agreement between HPV detection by two methods was determined by kappa statistic. Statistical significance was considered when p-vales were &lt; 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study measures the acceptability of HPV DNA self sampling in the general population of women in Hong Kong, and accuracy of self- and clinician-collected samples for HPV DNA testing. Participants were randomized into 2 arms, to have either self-sampling or clinician-sampling first. The results of this study would facilitate guidelines implementation for new cervical screening programme.</summary>
