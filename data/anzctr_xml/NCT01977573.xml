    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK1278863
Treatment: drugs - rhEPO

Experimental: GSK1278863 - Subjects will be administered GSK1278863 QD. Starting dose will be based on data from previous studies with GSK1278863 and dose-response modelling, as well as Baseline Hgb concentration. After 4 Week of fixed dose period, dose may be adjusted to achieve Hgb 9.0 to 10.5 g/dL

Other: Control - All subjects who are randomized to the Control arm will receive rhEPO (epoetins or their biosimilars, or darbepoetin) as necessary per standard of care, to maintain Hgb levels within the target range. The decision around whether a subject requires rhEPO, selection of the type of rhEPO and rhEPO dose should be based on Investigator clinical judgment, with the historical rhEPO dose (where applicable) and the current Hgb value being considered.


Treatment: drugs: GSK1278863
Film-coated tablets containing 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5mg or matching placebo

Treatment: drugs: rhEPO
Locally sourced rhEPO. All subjects who are randomized to the Control arm will receive rhEPO (epoetins or their biosimilars, or darbepoetin) as necessary per standard of care, to maintain Hgb levels within the target range. The decision around whether a subject requires rhEPO, selection of the type of rhEPO and rhEPO dose should be based on Investigator clinical judgment, with the historical rhEPO dose (where applicable) and the current Hgb value being considered..

      <outcome>Summary of Hemoglobin (Hgb) Concentration at Week 24 - The original Hgb Criteria for Group 1- rhEPO naive participants with a stable baseline Hgb of 8.0-10.0 g/dL (8.0-10.0 g/dL USA site only) and for Group 2- rhEPO users with a stable baseline Hgb of 9.0-10.5 g/dL (9.0-10.5 g/dL USA site only); the Hgb target range was 9.0 to 10.5 g/dL (9.0-10.5 g/dL USA site only). The study amended Hgb Criteria for Group 1- rhEPO naive participants with a stable baseline Hgb of 8.0-11.0 g/dL and Group 2- rhEPO users with a stable baseline Hgb of 9.0-11.5 g/dL; Hgb target range - 10.0 to 11.5 g/dL. Data are presented for those participants following the original criteria ("Original") and those following the amended ("Amended") criteria. The primary objective was to characterize the ability of GSK1278863 to achieve mean Hgb response within the target range.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Time Within, Below, and Above Hemoglobin (Hgb) Target Range, Between Weeks 12 and 24 - The number of days a participant's Hgb was within target range was calculated by estimating (using linear interpolation) the number of days within target range between two scheduled Hgb visits.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be conducted in approximately 228 subjects with anemia associated with CKD
      who are not on dialysis. Two groups of subjects will be enrolled into the study: Group 1:
      recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) naive subjects; Group 2: rhEPO users, who are
      currently receiving rhEPO. Subjects who are rhEPO naive will be randomized to receive either
      GSK1278863 once daily (QD) or rhEPO in a 3:1 fashion; subjects who are receiving an rhEPO
      before enrolling (rhEPO users) will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to GSK1278863 QD or to the
      control arm. For those randomized to the control arm, the decision around whether the subject
      requires rhEPO, the selection of the type of rhEPO (if needed) and the choice of rhEPO dose
      to achieve and maintain Hgb concentrations within the target range should be based on
      Investigator clinical judgment, with the historical rhEPO dose and the current Hgb value
      being considered. The study consists of a screening phase of at least 4 weeks, a 24-week
      treatment phase and a follow-up visit that will occur approximately 4 weeks after completing
      treatment. It is anticipated that the data generated will enable selection of the starting
      dose(s) and optimize dose adjustment regimen(s) for Phase 3 clinical trials.</summary>
