    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measure in this study is a measurement of blood vessel function by non-invasive ultrasound (flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery). Our research team has considerable experience with the use of this technique. Using data from several of our previous trials we expect that the standard deviation for the measurement of flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery will be approximately 2%. A sample of 25 participants (with paired comparisons) will provide greater than 90% power to detect a 1.5% difference in flow-mediated dilation between control (maltodextrin only) and EMIQ(140 mg quercetin equivalents for a 70 kg person). That is, if the true difference in the mean response is greater than or equal to 1.5%, we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power) greater than 0.9.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine if acute ingestion of EMIQ, a dietary flavonoid, can improve blood vessel function and blood pressure stress response in human volunteers. We will investigate the biochemical mechanism of any beneficial effects via the measurement of plasma levels of nitrate, nitrite and biomarkers of vascular function and oxidative stress. 
We hypothesize that EMIQ will improve vascular function and moderate the BP response to stress.
