    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment is done via central randomisation by phone /fax /computer (IVRS/WRS). Subjects who complete all Screening procedures, meet the eligibility criteria, complete the baseline neurological assessment, and quality of life and activities of daily living instruments can proceed to randomization. A subject's most recent GPA score and their neurological symptoms must be known prior to randomization and when accessing the IVRS/WRS for randomization. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio with one-third of the subjects being randomized to veliparib 200 mg BID and WBRT treatment group, another one-third will be randomized to the veliparib 50 mg BID and WBRT treatment group, and the other third will be randomised to the placebo and WBRT treatment group.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization will be stratified by GPA score (= 2.5 versus &gt; 2.5) and neurological symptoms (symptomatic versus asymptomatic). Computer software is used to randomise using permuted block randomization method.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at: 
1. The safety of two different dose levels of Veliparib when it is given together with WBRT 
2. To determine if participants benefit more with veliparib and WBRT compared to placebo (a substance that looks like the real medication but has no active ingredients) and WBRT.

Who is it for: Patients with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer.

Trial details: Participants will take Veliparib/Placebo orally twice per day, every day while receiving WBRT. Participants will also dose the day following the last day of WBRT. Participants will then have monthly visits for 9 months, followed by visits every 3 months for up to 2 years.</summary>
