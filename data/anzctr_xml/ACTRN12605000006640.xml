  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be recruited at the Royal Hobart Hospital with an acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Following discharge, active participants will be provided with a Community Health Nurse mentor who will act to facilitate their self-efficacy over the 1-year duration of the study. Information Technology systems will be developed to enable participants to closely monitor their disease using their newly developed skills of self-efficacy to respond appropriately.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group will receive usual treatment for COPD, including follow-up by GP or respiratory specialist.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We investigated the effect of a programme to increase self-management behaviours delivered by community health nurses, compared to usual care, on health-related quality of life and healthcare utilisation in people with COPD following hospitalisation.

Participants were recruited during an admission to hospital and allocated according to domicile. The mentor role was to collaboratively develop self-management strategies over the 12-month study duration. Outcomes included quality of life and healthcare utilisation.  

Linear mixed models analyses found a significant benefit in the Physical Functioning and General Health components of the SF-36 questionnaire for the mentored arm, the average difference between interventions being 5.60 and 4.14 respectively over 12 months. Survival analysis using a combined end-point of time to next acute exacerbation requiring rehospitalisation or death found a significant benefit favouring the mentored group (p = 0.037).</summary>
