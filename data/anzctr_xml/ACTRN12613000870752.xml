  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten minutes of brief physician counseling on smoking cessation. The counseling was administered face-to-face, on individual basis, stage-matched counseling, all participants were given information regarding the health benefits of smoking cessation and health hazards of continue smoking. Treatments modalities available to help quit smoking at the nearest quit smoking facilities were explained and contacts given. </interventions>

      <outcome>The translated and validated version of the Stages of Change Questionnaire Short Form in Malay version was used (with author's permission) to determine the stages of smoking behaviour at the beginning of the study, one month, and three months after the intervention, to determine any improvement in smoking behaviour. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Quit rate of 22% was used in the calculation as shown in similar study. A sample size of 148 was obtained with confidence interval of 95% and power of 80%. Estimating a drop out rate of 10%, the targeted sample size was 163. Chi-Square test was used to study the association between categorical variables (eg between stages of smoking behaviour and the control or intervention groups), missing data was included in no improvement as intention to treat, and p value of &lt; 0.05 was taken as statistically significant</statisticalmethods>
