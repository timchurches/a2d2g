  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this randomised, crossover trial, 11 adults on insulin pump therapy consumed 6 individual foods (steak, battered fish, poached eggs, low fat yoghurt, baked beans and peanuts) with the insulin dose determined by the Food Insulin Index (FII) algorithm.  Postprandial glycemia was measured in capillary blood glucose samples at 30 min intervals over 3 h. Researchers and participants were blinded to treatment.  The order of the foods and algorithms was randomised and there was a 24 h washout period.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical package version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  If the session was stopped due to hypoglycemia, the last recorded value was carried forward.  A general linear model with pre-prandial blood glucose level as a covariate was used to analyze the following parameters for the two test algorithms: 1) pre-prandial blood glucose level, 2) mean absolute blood glucose level over 180 min, 3) change in blood glucose over 180 min, 4) peak blood glucose excursion, 5) time to peak blood glucose excursion, 6) mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), 7) time to return to fasting blood glucose level, and 8) number of hypoglycemia episodes (defined as blood glucose level less than or equal to 3.5 mmol/L).  Differences in coefficients were considered statistically significant if P was &lt; 0.05, and highly significant if P was &lt; 0.01 (two-tailed).  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Food Insulin Index (FII) is a novel algorithm for ranking foods based on insulin responses in healthy subjects relative to an isoenergetic reference food. Our aim was to compare postprandial glycemic responses in adults with type 1 diabetes who used both carbohydrate counting and the FII algorithm to estimate the insulin dosage for a variety of protein-containing foods. 

Subjects/Methods:  11 adults on insulin pump therapy consumed 6 individual foods (steak, battered fish, poached eggs, low fat yoghurt, baked beans and peanuts) on two occasions in random order, with the insulin dose determined once by the FII algorithm, and once with carbohydrate counting.  Postprandial glycemia was measured in capillary blood glucose samples at 30 min intervals over 3 h. Researchers and participants were blinded to treatment.</summary>
