      <outcome>Number of Participants Developing Ciprofloxacin-resistant Mucoid P.Aeruginosa Isolates - Susceptibility and resistance assessment of a bacterial isolate was performed using the established Food and Drug Administration (FDA) susceptibility criteria for ciprofloxacin. The susceptibility criteria in mg/L are =1 for organisms Enterobacteriaciae, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus species and S. pneumoniae. The "susceptible" bacterial species likely responds to typical doses of ciprofloxacin. The resistance criteria for ciprofloxacin in mg/L are =4 mg/L for the same organisms. Resistance indicates that the bacteria is less likely to respond to typical doses of ciprofloxacin therapy.</outcome>
