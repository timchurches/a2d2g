  <interventions>
    <interventions>Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea - the diagnostic test under evaluation is a  two stage screening model of questionnaire and overnight oximetry. The OSA50 questionnaire is administered in the evening, followed by one overnight oximetry test, involving non-invasive sensor placed on the finger for the duration of the participant's sleep. The testing is performed in the participant's home or on the inpatient ward (if a current inpatient of the spinal unit).</interventions>
    <comparator>Full overnight polysomnography is the comparator test. The sleep study will be performed using a portable sleep monitoring device which comprehensively measures respiratory and sleep variables. (Compumedics TM SomtePSG, Abbottsford, Australia). This measures EEG, EOG, EMG (mentalis and diaphragm), ECG, respiratory motion, nasal pressure, oral thermistor, arterial oxygen saturation, snoring and body position. The comparator test will be administered on the same night as the two stage screening model described above (questionnaire and oximetry).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 50% of people with tetraplegia have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which is a direct consequence of their injury. OSA has been linked to poor quality of life and problems with memory, learning and concentration in people with tetraplegia. Current guidelines recommend that all people with tetraplegia and symptoms of sleepiness undergo a full sleep study (polysomnography) to diagnose OSA or not. However, very few spinal units have access to this expensive and highly specialised equipment, a sleep scientist to perform the test and a sleep physician to understand and communicate the results. It is therefore likely that most people with tetraplegia and OSA are undiagnosed and untreated. 
This project aims to test whether a questionnaire followed by overnight oximetry (a finger probe that measures the oxygen level of the blood) can accurately detect moderate to severe OSA in people with tetraplegia. If successful, this simple screening test could replace the need for a full sleep study. Improving the diagnosis of this condition will enable many people with tetraplegia and OSA to access treatment for their condition with likely improvement in their quality of life.
