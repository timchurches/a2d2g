  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised, controlled, cross-over (latin square) designed trial will be performed to investigate the acute effects of quercetin and nitrate on blood pressure, endothelial function and NO status. Each participant will complete 4 visits one week apart in random order.  Prior to each visit participants will be asked to consume a standard low flavonoid, low nitrate meal for breakfast.  For each visit participants will attend the School of Medicine and Pharmacology Research Unit at Royal Perth Hospital in the morning prior to lunch. The treatments will correspond to:
1.	200 mg quercetin + 200 mg nitrate as sodium nitrate (270 mg)
2.	200 mg quercetin + nitrate control (180 mg of sodium chloride)
3.	quercetin control (no quercetin) + 200 mg nitrate as sodium nitrate (270 mg)
4.	quercetin control (no quercetin) + nitrate control (180 mg of sodium chloride)
Each of these treatments will be consumed dissolved in 200 ml of warm water and consumed over less than 1 min, immediately after a fixed energy lunch.</interventions>

    <concealment>The treatment order for eligible individuals will be randomly assigned using computer generated random numbers. The treatment order allocation will be sealed in numbered envelopes. These envelopes will be used for randomisation by opening an envelope, in consecutive order, as participants are entered into the study. These envelopes will be held by an independent person within the Univesity of Western Australia. The study coordinator will contact the independent person to obtain the next available envelope once an individual is deemed eligible. The envelope will be opened and code will be recorded.</concealment>
