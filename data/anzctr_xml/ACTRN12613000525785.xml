  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three subject groups will be recruited.  Group 1; twenty healthy fit young adult males aged 20  25 years, free of cardiovascular risk factors and with no family history of cardiovascular disease.  Group 2; twenty healthy fit older adult males aged 40-60 years with no history (or family history) of cardiovascular disease.  Group 3; Twenty male patients recently diagnosed with overt coronary artery disease aged 40-60 year about to start statin drug therapy. None of the subjects in each of the three groups shall have received prior statin therapy. All subjects will receive statin therapy for one week but group 3 subjects will continue thereafter for a period of at least 6 months. An overnight fasted blood sample will be obtained at 0800hrs from all subjects immediately prior to receiving Atovastatin 40mg  daily (oral tablet). Additional overnight fasted blood samples will be drawn from all subjects at 0800hrs on days 1, 2 and 7 following initiation of statin therapy. Adherence to drug schedule will be assessed by drug tablet return. Further  monthly blood samples will be obtained from group 3 subjects for 6 months. Blood samples will be analysed for lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL), creatinine, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), CNP and NTproCNP content. Subjects in groups 1 and 2 with baseline triglyceride &gt; 1.7 mmol/L will be excluded.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test a new potential marker of atheroma risk and/or severity  aminoterminal C-type natriuretic peptide (NTproCNP).
We will follow longitudinally the changes in blood concentrations of NTproCNP in response to the statin, Atovastatin, in healthy male volunteers and male patients who have just been diagnosed with overt coronary artery disease and are about to start statin drug therapy. Three groups of volunteers will be studied, all of whom will not have previously received statin treatment:-
Group 1;  20 normal, healthy male volunteers aged between 20-25 years.
Group 2;  20 normal, healthy male volunteers aged between 40-60 years.
Group 3;  20 male patients aged between 40-60 years recently diagnosed with overt coronary artery disease and about to start statin drug therapy.
All subjects will receive statin therapy for one week but group 3 subjects will continue thereafter for a period of at least 6 months. An overnight fasted blood sample will be obtained from all subjects immediately prior to receiving Atovastatin 40mg daily. Additional overnight fasted blood samples will be drawn from all subjects on days 1, 2 and 7 following initiation of statin therapy. Further monthly blood samples will be obtained from group 3 subjects for 6 months. Blood samples will be analysed for lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL), creatinine, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), CNP and NTproCNP content.</summary>
