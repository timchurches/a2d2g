  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Active implementation of 3 evidence-based guideline recommendations. *Guideline recommendation #1: Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis prior to peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion should be used to reduce the risk of early peritonitis (Level I evidence) (either Vancomycin, Cephalosporin or Gentamicin can be used)
How it will be implemented: A clinical pathway will be developed with surgical team input to include IV antibiotic administration pre-operatively by a designated individual. A 1-page checklist will also be developed. 
*Guideline recommendation #2: Prophylactic therapy using mupirocin ointment, especially for Staphylococcus aureus carriage (intranasally or at exit site) is recommended to decrease the risk of Staphylococcus aureus catheter exit site/tunnel infections and peritonitis (Level I evidence). 
How it will be implemented: Units can choose 1 of 2 options:
1)	Unit protocol to include nasal swabbing of each PD patient every 6 months by a nurse, with treatment (nasal mupirocin) prescribed on the return of a positive swab for S. aureus or MRSA. Patient and staff education to explain that this should occur. 
2)	Unit protocol to include daily application of mupirocin to catheter exit site by patient/carer or nurse. Patient, GP and staff education to explain that this is the agreed procedure. 
A 1-page checklist will also be developed for both options. 

*Guideline recommendation #3: The use of oral antifungal prophylaxis should be considered at the time of antibiotic administration to peritoneal dialysis patients to reduce the occurrence of fungal peritonitis (Level II evidence). 

How it will be implemented: Unit protocol to include prescribing of nystatin (Nilstat) whenever PD patients are prescribed antibiotics. Patient, GP and staff education to explain that this should occur. Patients will also be given a wallet size card containing the relevant information. A letter to their GP will be sent by the unit nurse for all new PD patients, outlining the need for anti-fungal prescribing. A 1-page checklist will be developed for use when PD patients come to hospital. 

Duration: A 6 month baseline period has been completed. A 12 month implementation period will start approx. April 2013. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: To establish current practice and protocols at 8 units in relation to key guideline recommendations for the prevention of infection in PD patients.
A process map has been made for each unit after interviewing nurse staff members. Further detail has been obtained from the nephrologist in response to a questionnaire.   </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Baseline monitoring period of 6 months (12 Dec 2011  30 June 2012).   </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2: Rates of and time to first exit site/tunnel-associated infection and/or peritonitis among new PD patients  and technique survival rates after active implementation of key guideline recommendations. 
A case report form (CRF) has been developed to record key information about each patient and any infection episodes or technique failures that occur. Each unit will be asked to complete a CRF at the end of each month for any patient who experiences an infection or technique failure in that month. The completed forms will be sent to the Project Officer for the study, and the details entered into the study database. The infection outcomes will be defined according to internationally accepted criteria. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: 12 months after intervention commencement.  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 3: Identification of barriers and enablers to implementation of key guidelines related to prevention of infection in PD patients in 8 ANZ renal units. 
After visiting each unit and making their process map and obtaining replies to questions about unit practice, protocols and policies, a table was created by the Project Officer which lists perceived barriers and enablers at the patient, physician and organisation levels. These were sent to each unit for their feedback. The NICS Barrier Tool was used for this.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Baseline and 12 months after intervention commencement. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 1: Quality of Life of patients who experience any of the 3 types of PD-related infection as assessed by 2 questionnaires (KDQOL-36; EuroQol-5d-5l). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: At start of PD, after 6 months of PD, after 12 months of PD, for those who do not experience any PD-related infection. At 2 weeks (post infection), 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months for those who do experience a PD-related infection. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to see if assisting 8 renal units to actively put certain clinical practice guideline recommendations into practice will result in fewer infections and a longer time to first infection in their peritoneal dialysis patients. The study hypothesis is that assisting nephrologists and renal nurses to follow infection prevention guidelines in their daily practice will lead to better patient outcomes in terms of less PD-related infections, better quality of life, less need to remove Tenckhoff catheters and less technique failure (and transfer to haemodialysis or withdrawal from dialysis altogether).    </summary>
