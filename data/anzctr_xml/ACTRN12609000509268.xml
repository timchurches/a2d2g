  <interventions>
    <interventions>The project will be investigating the effect of green tea capsules (GTC) acutely (one off ingestion of GTC) and chronically (8 weeks ingestion of GTC) on vascular health. Also the ingestion of GTC and its interaction with moderate intensity of exercise will be examined. A double blinded cross over design will be used in the study. Both acute and chronic settings will consist of two different interventional arms; ingestion of GTC (arm 1) and GTC plus exercise (arm 2). In the acute and chronic settings, the dose of GTC will be 1500 mg of GTC containing 375 mg of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which will be taken orally in the morning. The exercise intensity for both settings will be at 65% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) for 30 minutes. Thus, in the acute setting, cardiovascular function will be assessed following ingestion of one GTC (arm 1) then a week later (following a one week of wash out period) participants will perform exercise on a bike following ingestion of GTC (arm 2). In a chronic setting, participants will be provided GTC for the duration of 8 weeks. The GTC (1500 mg of GTC containing 375 mg of EGCG) will be taken orally once in the morning for 8 weeks (arm 1). Cardiovascular function then will be assessed at pre, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks post ingestion of GTC. Following one week of wash out, participants will ingest GTC every morning plus perform one-on-one sessions of supervised moderate intensity exercise at 65% of VO2max for 30 minutes, 3 times/week for 8 weeks (arm 2). Cardiovascular function then will be assessed at pre, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks post GTC plus exercise.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects will act as their own controls in a placebo condition. The placebo will be 1500 mg of a cellulose capsule that will be taken orally. In acute setting, the placebo will be taken one off in the morning, whereas in the chronic setting, the placebo will be taken once in the morning for 8 weeks. The exercise will be carried out in the same manner for both GTC and placebo treatments.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Vascular function (e.g., forearm blood flow) will be assessed using Hokanson plethysmograph. Arterial stiffness will be assessed using SphymoCor. Whereas heart rate will be monitored through electrocardiograph (ECG). Blood pressure will be assessed using a beat-by beat blood pressure monitor.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The vascular change following green tea ingestion will be assessed at regular intervals (every 20 minutes) up to 2 hours. During the  chronic ingestion of GTT, vascular change will be assessed at pre (week 0), during (week 4), and post treatment (week 8) same as the above intervals.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The metabolic response will be assessed through blood chemicals, such as assessment of insulin using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit and blood lipid profiles (using Cholestech). Whereas the autonomic responses (heart rate and blood pressure using ECG and blood pressure monitor) will be assessed while the mental challenge task (word conflict task/Stroop task) is administered to the participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The metabolic and cardiac response will be assessed at pre (baseline), 4 weeks, and 8 weeks post intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overweight individuals typically possess metabolic and vascular problems. Most overweight individuals have high levels of fat and sugar in their blood and also typically carry a lot of fat around their abdomen. Overweight individuals also possess problems in their arteries and veins which become stiff and are unable to stretch easily.  Thus, the purpose of the study is to examine cardiovascular function following green tea supplement and its combination with exercise both acutely and chronically. It is hypothesised that (1) green tea supplement will reduce cardiovascular dysfunction in overweight males; (2) a combination of green tea supplement and exercise will normalize cardiovascular dysfunction possessed by the overweight males.</summary>
