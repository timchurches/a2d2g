    <statisticalmethods>Sample sizes of 43 (43 patients and 43 family members) in the intubated group and 43 (43 patients and 43 family members) in the non-intubated group will provide 80% power to see a statistically significant difference between the two groups, assuming underlying post ICU psychological stress rates of 30% and 5% in the intubated and non-intubated populations, respectively, based upon a chi-squared test at a significance level of 5%. To allow for a potential drop off rate of 30% at 2 months follow up, the study will recruit 110 participants  (55 patients and 55 family members) in each of the groups. 

Patient demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarised by the 2 different patient cohorts using means, standard deviations, medians, and 25-75% quartiles for continuous measures, and frequencies and percentages for categorical measures. ICU patient survivor psych outcomes at baseline and at 2 months follow-up will be compared between risk groups using a mixed model analysis. A time by group interaction will be tested. Means and standard errors for psych assessment scores for each time period and risk group will be presented and compared. ICU patient family members outcomes will be analysed similarly. All tests will be two-sided, and p-values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All analyses will be performed using SPSS version 22. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A significant proportion of patients who have survived admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) experience long-term psychological consequences that include anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A high proportion of family members of ICU patients also present with varying psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD. 
Currently there are no routine follow ups of psychological well-being of patients discharged from intensive care units in Australia. There are little data from Australia about the incidence of psychological stress in the local population of ICU survivors and family members. Understanding of the incidence of the psychological stress in ICU survivors and their family members could potentially lead to routine assessment of the problem and measures to reduce the incidence. 
We aim to determine the baseline incidence of psychological stress in Australian ICU survivors and family members by screening for PTSD, anxiety and depression using validated screening tools. Identifying patients or family members at high risk for psychological distress post intensive care discharge could lead to further studies and policies targeting specific measures to reduce the incidence and hence improve long term well-being and quality of life long after discharge after a severe illness.</summary>
