  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sit to stand is a common functional exercise prescribed by physiotherapists.  The intervention in this study involves completing a set number of a sit to stand exercise per day which will be monitored with a device connected to an app.  The app will providing feedback to the patient and enable the therapist to see the number of sit to stands performed by the patients remotely.  The therapist will also be able to change the number of sit to stand goal remotely via a function on the application.   
Participants will be instructed in their home on how to use the sit to stand activity monitor (AM) and smart device application (on participants own iPhone, iPad or project provided tablet).  The AM consists of a small pressure sensor which is placed under a nominated chair in the participants home.   Participants will use the AM for the 5-week study period and track their number of daily sit to stand repetitions. At the start of weeks 2-5 the research therapist will review the participants results remotely via the internet and set a target for the participant for the following week based on the number of sit to stands performed each day in the preceding week. The weeks goal will be programmed remotely into the smart device application (and phone call if necessary). Participants will connect to the smart device application to get feedback on how close they are to their goal or whether they have achieved the days target. Results will be available to the research therapist remotely.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Adherence will be described as percentage equal to the number performed/target.  Participant perceptions (primary outcomes 2 and 3) of the technology will be described using frequency counts and percentages for each likert scale from the questionnaires. Changes in secondary outcome measures will be performed using t-tests or non-parametric tests to compare normally and non-normally distributed data respectively.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current stroke guidelines recommend as much physical practice as possible in the first 6 months after stroke.  A number of recent reviews concluded that therapy should include intensive repetitive task training to improve functional outcomes (such as the ability to transfer and walk).
However, a number of factors can lead to patients remaining inactive, particularly once home.  
1)	Limitations of outpatient therapy: Frequency of appointments is low and programs are time limited in duration. 
2)	Motivation and confidence: Low motivation and lack of a therapist monitoring practice can contribute to poor adherence to exercise. Providing accurate feedback, goal setting and rewards can enhance compliance and self efficacy.
3)	Geographical location: Patients may live in remote or rural areas resulting in less access to specialist rehabilitation services or have limited access to transport to attend therapy. 
Novel, cost-effective and enjoyable ways are needed to increase the intensity of practice outside of centre-based therapy. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether for people who have had a stroke:
1. a smart device application and activity monitor (AM) can be used to increase repetitions of a functional exercise outside of centre-based therapy
2. the activity monitor and smart device application package is enjoyable, acceptable and easy to use.
3. progression of intensity of practice can be delivered remotely by a therapist via the internet.
