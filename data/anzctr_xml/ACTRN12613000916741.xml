  <interventions>
    <interventions>The PACT (Psychosocial Assessment, Care and Treatment) model, targeting patients with head and neck (H&amp;N) or urological cancers at John Hunter Hospital, will be developed as part of this study. This model aims to systematise the approach to screening for distress and responding to that distress in a coordinated manner, including facilitating continuity of care for patients who reside some distance from the acute care setting where their cancer treatment was received. 
As part of the newly developed model of care, all inpatient and outpatient urology and H&amp;N cancer patients will be screened at their first diagnostic or treatment visit and at each subsequent follow-up visit, using the Distress Thermometer (DT) and accompanying Problem Checklist, which will inform the development of a care plan to address the issues identified through the screening and second-line inquiry. The care plan will facilitate provision of care tailored to specific needs of patients and promote continuity of care across care settings and providers, including with health care providers (HCPs) in rural and regional areas.
The screening and problem checklist will act as a trigger for frontline staff to inquire about and discuss the cause/s of distress with patients whose distress levels are above the recommended cut-off of 4 out of 10. Training for frontline staff will focus on discussing the cause of the distress, developing an evidence-based psychosocial care plan to address identified concerns, providing information and/or basic counselling or referring patients with significant or persistent distress to the psycho-oncology service, and facilitating continuity of care including linking patients with hospital and community services as required. Training will be delivered in 2.5-3 hour sessions on a quarterly basis throughout the duration of the intervention period. Long-term sustainability of these service changes will be promoted through organisational leadership and management support; engagement of cancer clinician leaders in each unit in the design and evaluation of the service model; and development of a model with the aim of adaptability and flexibility to diversity of locations and patient complexity (e.g. through complex case review and revision of psychosocial care plans and active involvement of clinicians from rural locations in this process). This new model of care is expected to be implemented for a period of 15 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Historical data will be collected at the baseline data collection period for those patients who receive care from John Hunter Hospital prior to the introduction of the new care model. This data will pertain to the 12 months preceding their recruitment date.</comparator>

      <outcome>Increase in the proportion of eligible patients who report positive experiences of their cancer care. This will be assessed via a Patient Experiences Survey; a 35-item survey assessing the emotional support, information and education and coordination of care perceived by patients to have been provided to them throughout their treatment period at John Hunter Hospital. All items will be answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is developing, and evaluating the feasibility, cost and acceptability of, a patient-centred, integrated model of psychosocial care for people receiving treatment for urological or head and neck cancers. 
Who is it for? 
You will be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with a urological cancer or a head and neck cancer, for which you are receiving inpatient and/or outpatient care at John Hunter Hospital. 
Trial details 
All participants in this study will receive treatment, as required, under the PACT (Psychosocial Assessment, Care and Treatment) model. As part of this newly developed model of care, all inpatient and outpatient urology and head and neck cancer patients will be screened at their first diagnostic or treatment visit and at each subsequent follow-up visit, using the Distress Thermometer (DT) and accompanying Problem Checklist. This will be used to develop a care plan to address any issues identified through the screening and second-line inquiry. The care plan will facilitate the provision of care which is tailored to the specific needs of patients, and promote continuity of care across care settings and providers; including with health care providers (HCPs) in rural and regional areas. 
Participants will be asked to report experiences of their cancer care at baseline, and at 21 and 30 months after intervention commencement. It is anticipated that implementation of this model will improve continuity of care, increase health care professionals' awareness, confidence, knowledge and skills to discuss and respond to patients' specific concerns, and improve access to specialised psychological care services.</summary>
