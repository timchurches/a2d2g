    <interventions>The REVIAN System includes a Cap configured for portable use with rechargeable battery and adapter with active LEDs using modulated light therapy (MLT trademark).  Daily 10-minute treatments are done in the home over the course of 26 weeks.  Intervention adherence will be assessed via firmware in the Cap and monitored by the clinical sites.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary efficacy outcome of this study is mean change in hair count from baseline.  Standardized Canfield macro-photographs will be taken to capture digital images at baseline and will be compared to images captured at various endpoints throughout the study.  Multiple images will be taken at each endpoint and will be reviewed by independent blinded observers to conduct the hair count. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary endpoint is 16-weeks follow-up from the initial application at baseline.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quantitative Scalp Hair Growth: Changes in terminal hair count. Terminal hair counts (non-vellus/non-miniaturized greater than or equal to 0.03 mm) will be assessed in the target region with macrophotography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Quantitative Scalp Hair Growth at 8 and 26 weeks over baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physician's Global Assessment (PGA): Determination of hair growth over baseline through global photographic review by blinded reviewer(s).</outcome>
      <timepoint>PGA at 8-weeks, 16-weeks, and 26-weeks</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Adult males between 18 and 60 years of age with a diagnosis of Androgenic Alopecia with hair at least 1 inch in length consistent with Norwood Hamilton active hair loss scales of IIa  V and Fitzpatrick skin type I  IV and an overall baseline score of greater than or equal to 45 on the Hair Specific Skindex-29 Quality of Life questionnaire. Participants agree to undergo all study procedures including global photographs of hair loss/growth, placement of a 1 mm tattoo dot placed on the scalp for macrophotography, refrain from using all other hair growth products or treatments (oral or topical medication including over the counter herbal medications, or Dutasteride), avoid the use of wigs, hairpieces, and/or hair extensions during the study, return for all the required follow-up visits, and in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are able to understand this clinical investigation and cooperate with the investigational procedures.</inclusivecriteria>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary effectiveness outcome will be the difference between study groups in the change between baseline and the average of the 16-week follow-up terminal hair counts.  The sample size for this study is based on the primary efficacy endpoint of mean change in hair count from baseline to 16-weeks following the initial application at baseline.  Calculations are based on a Pearson chi-square test assuming a 1:1 randomization ratio between active comparators to the sham control. 

The study design is a 2-arm study of a superiority of an active device to Sham group with a maximum of 60 participants per arm.  Assumptions are 15 hair difference between treatments, SD=20, 10% drop-out rate, 5% alpha level, 90% power and 2-sided t-test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The REVIAN study is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the REVIAN System in male participants with androgenic alopecia. An Active modulated light therapy REVIAN System will be compared to a Placebo Comparator non-active REVIAN System in participants using the device for a daily 10-minute treatment over the course of 26-weeks. At each follow-up visit, participants will be interviewed to determine if any adverse events (AEs) were experienced since the previous follow-up visit.  All participants will be required to complete self-administering scalp hair growth and life quality questionnaires at each follow-up visit. Investigators will be required to complete global assessments of scalp hair growth for each enrolled participant at each follow-up visit. Macrophotography evaluations will be performed at baseline, 8-, 16-, and 26 weeks for all participants using standard Canfield blinded reviewer.  Global photographs of superior and vertex scalp will be taken by participants and by PI to be assessed by a blinded reviewer once all photos have been captured for each participant per visit.</summary>
