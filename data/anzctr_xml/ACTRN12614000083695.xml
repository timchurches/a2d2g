    <studytitle>REducing AntiPsychotic use in residential care: Huntington Disease. A pilot Randomised Controlled Trial </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A randomised controlled trial comparing a multi-faceted intervention based on a behavioural management clinical pathway for health professionals (MFI), against standard staff outreach education (SSE), in reducing anti-psychotic dosages for people with Huntington Disease (HD) in residential care facilities (RCF)</scientifictitle>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of people with HD who has had a reduction in antipsychotic dosage at 4 months, in RCF receiving MFI vs. SSE. Dosage will be assessed as per medication chart, including all regular and prn doses for 1 week prior to each time-point. Any change in antipsychotic type will be managed by calculating dose equivalence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 4 months post intervention
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in the severity of behavioural symptoms, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Q (NPI-Q).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 4 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of people with HD who has had a reduction in antipsychotic dosage at 4 months for each strategy, compared to 4 months prior to enrolment. This secondary outcome takes a 'before and after' analysis approach, often used in health services research.  It incorporates all three time points- 4 months pre enrolment, at enrolment, and 4-months post enrolment.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Since there are only a small number of RCF with more than one HD resident, and cluster size is not uniform across RCF, it will be difficult to take into account clustering in sample size calculation. For sample size calculation, we will therefore only count one resident from each of RCF. Difference in primary outcome (proportion of people with HD who has had a reduction in antipsychotic use) between the two arms of the RCT, will be expressed in terms of absolute risk reduction, and relative risk reduction. Statistical significance between the two proportions will be tested with a Chi-squared test (p&lt;0.05).
The likely effect size for MFI or SSE on the primary outcome is unknown. This trial is therefore designed as a pilot study, with 19 participants in each arm. This represents approximately 30% of nursing home in NSW looking after people with HD. Anecdotally, we have not seen any antipsychotic reduction in RCF, following our previous education sessions. So assuming that antipsychotic will be reduced in 5% of people in the SSE arm, our sample size will be able to detect a difference of 50% vs 5% in the primary outcome for MFI vs. SSE, with a power of 82% (alpha=0.05). Changes in NPI-Q will be analysed using the paired t-test. All analysis will be carried out on an Intention-To-Treat basis. 
If there are additional residents available at a RCF, they can also be included in the study and the final statistical analysis will take into account the clustering.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale for using antipsychotics for behavioural management in Huntington Disease is weak, and antipsychotics are potentially harmful. REAP-HD intends to change clinical practice in residential care facilities (RCFs) so that antipsychotics are used as second line, time-limited therapy subject to regular review. REAP-HD will implement two different strategies, and compare their efficacy in helping health care professionals reduce antipsychotic use. </summary>
