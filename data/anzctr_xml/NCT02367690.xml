  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with eligible diabetic foot ulcers will be screened, treated, and followed for
      complete ulcer closure. This is a randomized trial. All patients will receive
      standard-of-care treatment. Additionally, some patients will receive treatment with topical
      Selinexor gel and some will receive topical placebo gel.</summary>
