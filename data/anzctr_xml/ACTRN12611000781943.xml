  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Standard Arm - Adjuvant Radiotherapy. Radiation: Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) commenced within 4 months of Radical Prostatectomy (RP). 64Gy in 32 fractions to the prostate bed, radiotherapy will be delivered 1 fraction/day over approx 6.5 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: Experimental - Active Surveillance with early salvage radiotherapy. Radiation: Early Salvage Radiotherapy. Active surveillance with early salvage RT (SRT). 64Gy in 32 fractions to the prostate bed, radiotherapy will be delivered 1 fraction/day over approx 6.5 weeks. The trigger for SRT is PSA (Prostate Speicific Antigen) level &gt;= 0.2ng/ml. RT should commence as soon as possible )no later than 4 months) following the first PSA measurement &gt;= 0.2ng/ml.</comparator>

A patient will not be reported to have died unless there is source data confirming the patient?s death.  Examples of potential source data are the patient?s medical records, obituaries, public records, death certificate, or information provided by a GP, hospice staff, or patient family members.  If a patient is lost to follow-up, death will not be assumed unless confirmatory source data is available.  The trial forms have been designed to allow sites to report lost to follow-up and death as separate events.</outcome>

To register a patient, complete electronic case report forms (CRFs) to document eligibility and stratification fators. Prior to patient registration, the investigator should ensure that
all of the following requirements are met:
- Informed consent has been obtained prior to performing any study specific procedures
- The patient meets all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria should apply.
- All pre-registration assessments and investigations have been performed.
- The eligibility checklist has been completed, signed and dated.

Once registered, patients will be randomised to one of two treatment arms via a web based randomisation using the minisation technique.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare two different radiotherapy regimes following radical prostatectomy in men with prostate cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you a male aged 18 years or above who has undergone a radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer, and are able to start radiotherapy within 4 months of RP. Study details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive the current standard of care treatment, which consists of adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) commenced within 4 months of radical prostatectomy. Participants in the other group will instead undergo active surveillance, where salvage radiotherapy (SRT) will not commence until Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) reaches a level greater than 0.2ng/ml. Both radiotherapy regimes will be delivered once per day over approximately 6.5 weeks. Quality of life self-assessment questionnaires, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score and toxicity will be assessed at baseline, the end of radiotherapy and annually for 5 years. Patients will be seen by their doctor 6 monthly for the first 5 years, then annually for the next 5 years. A blood test measuring PSA is done 3 monthly for the first 5 years for patients randomised to early SRT, than 6 monthly from years 5-10.</summary>
