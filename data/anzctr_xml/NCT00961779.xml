                  clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination, which includes
                  an electrocardiogram (ECG), which in the opinion of the Investigator would
                  jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact on the validity of the study
                  results.

          -  Venous Access: Volunteers with adequate venous access in their left and right arm to
             allow collection of blood samples and drug administration.
