Test foods: 
1. Visual manipulations
a. Visible fat  energy-matched butter on toasted French bread
b. Visible sugar  energy-matched jam on toasted French bread
c. Visible protein  energy-matched ham on toasted French bread
d. Visible protein  energy-matched cream cheese on toasted French bread
2. Olfactory manipulations
a. Natural odour  plain mashed potato with Italian herbs
b. Fat odour  herbs + butter or bacon essence added to mashed potato
3. Food form manipulations
a. Solid  apple 
b. Liquid  apple juice 

Participants will be screened at baseline to confirm eligibility and baseline measurements will be obtained. If qualified, participants will attend eight 45-minute sessions to undergo all study conditions in a random order. Participants will be asked to avoid vigorous activity and drinking alcohol on the previous day, and fast for 10  12 hours prior to each session. Participants will arrive at the laboratory between 8am and 9am, and overnight fasting will be verbally confirmed by the researcher. Upon arrival, participants will be asked to drink 200ml of plain water (as a control for thirst and baseline hunger), and baseline appetite ratings will be assessed using validated visual analog scales (VAS) (Flint 2000) 5 minutes after water consumption. Test foods will be presented in large portion sizes (to avoid portion bias and to prevent plate-cleaning), and participants will be asked to take a portion of the test food that is expected to help them achieve a fullness level of 8 out of 10. Participants will also be asked to rate the appearance and intensity of smell of foods. Following that, the portioned food will be removed, and an identical plate of food will be presented to participants again. They will be given 30 minutes to consume the same food until a fullness level of 8 is achieved. After 30 minutes, participants will be asked to rate the palatability of the test foods, how often they will consume the same food again, and VAS again before leaving the lab. Participants will return until all conditions are completed.

    <statisticalmethods>Based on our previous study with similar study design where food form was manipulated (beverage vs. solid) (Houchins 2012), consumption of challenge meals were 186 +/- 163 kcal for solid and 326 +/- 169 kcal for beverage preloads. Based on these, to detect an effect of similar magnitude in this proposed study at 80% power will require 12 participants (a=0.05) to complete the study. However, we anticipate the difference to be smaller between other test conditions (visual and olfactory manipulations). Food consumption data from other studies is not available, but a difference of 75 kcal between test meals within each manipulation is considered appropriate since it represent a difference of approximately one serving size of the test foods (bread and mashed potato). Using this expected difference, 40 participants are required to achieve statistical power of 80% at a=0.05.

* One-way ANOVA
* Correlation

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will provide useful data on the importance of three sensory characteristics possibly used by humans in meal planning. Knowledge in this area will then be incorporated as part of the overweight and obesity treatment, or in the prevention of weight gain. We hypothesize that visual, olfactory, and food form cues are important determinants of expected satiation and food portion size selection.</summary>
