  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Deferred cord clamping

No Intervention: Early cord clamping (Control Arm) - Immediate cord clamping (&lt; 10 seconds after birth). The cord is clamped 6 cm from the umbilicus within ten seconds of delivery of the baby.

Experimental: Deferred cord clamping - Deferred cord clamping. Investigator/Research personnel holds the baby as low as possible below the level of the introitus or placenta for 60 seconds and not to exceed 80 seconds, then clamps the cord about 6 cm from the umbilicus.


Treatment: surgery: Deferred cord clamping
Deferred cord clamping (for 60 seconds or more with the baby held below or at the level of the placenta)

    <summary>To establish if placental transfusion, using deferred cord clamping for 60 seconds or more
      while holding the baby at or below the level of the placenta, will improve survival without
      disability compared with standard early cord clamping in preterm babies less than 30 weeks of
      gestation.</summary>
