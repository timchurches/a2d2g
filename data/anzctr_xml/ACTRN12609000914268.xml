  <interventions>
    <interventions>Insertion of SLIPA
Insertion technique is based on manufacturer's recommendation.
To insert the device, the mouth is opened and the toe of the SLIPA is put into the mouth and advanced towards the posterior pharyngeal arch. At this stage, a 'jaw thrust' is applied by left hand and SLIPA is advanced caudally until the SLIPA slip into correct position.
Insertion may takes about 30 second and SLIPA may be used during the operation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Insertion of LMA-P
Insertion technique is based on manufacturer's recommendation.
To insert the device, the mouth is opened and the toe of the LMA-P is put into the mouth and advanced towards the posterior pharyngeal arch. At this stage, a 'jaw thrust' is applied by left hand and LMA-P is advanced caudally until the LMA-P slip into correct position.
Insertion may takes about 30 second and LMA-P may be used during the operation.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>incidence of gastric insufflation
After creation of pneumoperitoneum, and head down-tilt position, and at the end of surgery, gastric air insufflations will be monitored using stethoscope positioned over the patients stomach and through a direct visualization of stomach through a laparoscope.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after creation of pneumoperitoneum, and head down-tilt position, and at the end of surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>stability
We will asses stability of SLIPA and LMA-P by checking the difference between inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume and leakage sound when move patients head flexion or extension, turn the patient?s head to left and right.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after insertion and after pneumoperitoneum and head-down tilt position</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>sealing pressure
Maximum airway sealing pressure will be measured by closing the expiratory valve of the breathing circuit and noting the pressure at which a leak developed with a fixed fresh gas flow of 3L/min.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after insertion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>respiratory mechanics
Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), plateau pressure(Ppla), inspiratory tidal volume(VT), expiratory VT, static respiratory system compliance(Cst,rs), inspiratory resistance(RI, rs) will be measured using spirometry module (S/5TM Compact anaesthesia monitor; Datex-Ohmeda, Tewksbury, MA, USA). All manipulations of the patients will be halted during the measurement, and respiratory mechanics variables will be measured in triplicate and averaged for each measurement, such that each measured data will be used as a single observation and contribute only once to each overall data set.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after insertion and after pneumoperitoneum and head-down tilt position</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ease of insertion
Anesthesiologists who insert SLIPA and LMA-P will be asked to relate whether they found it ,very easy, easy, difficult, very difficult to insert.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after insertion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>severity of sore throat
30 min after arrival in the recovery room, patients will be asked by the independent investigator to score throat pain on an eleven-point visual analogue scale(0-10)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Streamlined linear of the pharryngeal airway(SLIPA) is a new type of supralaryngeal airway(SLA), use of which has increased because it is inexpensive, disposable and easy to insert.
Although other SLA(eg, laryngeal mask airway(LMA), laryngeal tube) have been used safely in elective gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery, there are few reports compare the characteristics of the SLIPA or proseal LMA(LMA-P) when used in paralyzed patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery.
We wish to provide the incidence of gastric insufflations, stability, sealing pressure and respiratory mechanics of SLIPA when used in the paralyzed patients receiving elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, to compare it with LMA-P. We also wish to compare the SLIPA with LMA-P in a clinical setting with regard to ease of insertion, number of repositioning attempts, and incidence or severity of sore throat.</summary>
