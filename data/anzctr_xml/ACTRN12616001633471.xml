  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects in this study will be asked to visit our clinical facilities either at the University of Newcastle (Callaghan campus, NSW, Australia) or at Massey University (Turitea campus, Manawatu, New Zealand), four times. At their first appointment they will go through a screening process. They will be asked to complete a brief medical questionnaire, a physical activity questionnaire, a food frequency questionnaire and an eating attitudes test. They will also have their blood tested using finger prick and have their anthropometric measurements (weight, height, body muscle mass, etc.) and blood pressure taken.
The day before their second appointment they will be asked to refrain from physical activity and alcohol consumption, to consume a low fat standard evening meal and fast overnight (10 hours). The low fat meal will be provided by the research team and will contain less than 15% fat.
In the morning of their second appointment they will have two blood samples collected (one using finger prick and one using single venepuncture) and will be asked to complete an appetite sensations questionnaire and a 24 hour food recall. The 24 hour food recall involves recording all the food and beverages consumed over the 24 hour period prior to their appointment. They will be given instructions on how to record this information on arrival. After that they will consume a high fat food product (biscuits, a flan or a beverage) designed by the research investigators to deliver 40g of fat and provide about 790 calories. They will then have six blood samples collected (30, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 360 minutes after meal consumption) using finger prick and will answer to an appetite sensations questionnaire every 2 hours. During this period they will remain at our clinical facilities (about 7 hours in total).
After a week period they will be asked to visit our clinical facilities again for their third appointment and repeat the procedure consuming a different food. At this appointment blood samples will be collected using only finger prick. After another week they will come to their forth appointment and repeat the procedure consuming a third food product. 
They may also choose to participate in our internal validation group. This involves donating 2 extra blood samples collected using single venepuncture in one of your appointments.</interventions>
    <comparator>This intervention involves active controls. Three food products containing similar nutrient composition and different structure (liquid, semi-solid and solid) designed to deliver 40g of fat will be used. The liquid product will be a beverage, the semi-solid will be a product with flan like consistency and the solid product will be biscuits.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Paired t-test was used for calculating sample size (Formula 1). The sample size calculation was based on an anticipated 130% (88.8) difference in incremental area under the curve (iAUC) between test meals for plasma triglycerides with level of significance 0.05 and 80% power. Using a standard deviation of 114.09 in iAUC (Berry et al, 2008), a minimum of 13 subjects would be required in each interventional treatment. Allowing for 10% dropouts and non-compliant subjects, and aiming for an equal number of males and females we will recruit n=30 (15 males and 15 females).

The incremental area under (iAUC) the post-prandial curve (hourly measurements) will be calculated, using the trapezoid rule, for the standard or reference meal and all the test meals. The lipemic load of a test meal will then be calculated based on the iAUC of the standard meal, as a percentage of the iAUC of the standard meal (OOi et al, 2011).
Curves for different test meals will also be compared using repeated measures Analyses of Variance to determine difference in peak triglyceride in plasma and return to fasted state. In addition, maximum postprandial concentration (peak concentration) and the time length for its appearance as well as the total change from fasting to peak concentration will be measured.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fasting plasma triglycerides are currently one of the most used measures to determine the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, we spend 18 hours or more of our day in the post
absorptive state and elevated postprandial plasma triglyceride levels have also been linked with increased risk for atherosclerosis and consequently cardiovascular disease. Dietary choices have been demonstrated to modulate postprandial lipemia. Furthermore, manipulation of food structure and composition has the potential to increase or reduce postprandial triglycerides. Therefore, food choices are important targets in the improvement of postprandial lipemia. In this project we aim to determine the effect of three food products with different structures and similar nutrient composition on postprandial blood triglyceride levels. This is a pilot project for the development of a tool to measure the effect of different food products on postprandial lipemia. Healthy adults will be recruited from the community in Newcastle (NSW, Australia) and in Palmerston North (Manawatu, New Zealand). Following an overnight fast participants will attend our clinical facilities and have blood samples collected using finger prick; subjects will then consume a single high fat test meal. Blood samples will be collected again 30, 60, 120,
180, 240 and 360 minutes after meal consumption. After one week wash out, participants will attend our clinical facilities again and repeat the procedure following consumption of the alternative test meal. Blood samples will be assessed for glucose levels and lipid profile (triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol) using a portable whole blood test system. Participants will also
provide information on their medical history, physical activity, usual food consumption and
eating attitudes at the start of the intervention.</summary>
