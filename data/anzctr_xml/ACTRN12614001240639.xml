  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional product, ZYAN1, will be administered as an oral tablet.

The first part of the study (Plan I) is an single ascending dose (SAD) cohort (panel) design in which different patient panels will receive ZYAN1 1001 as a single dose. The starting dose in first panel will be 10 mg. Subsequent doses will be 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg for panel 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The subsequent panels will be conducted in new healthy males provided the previous panel is well tolerated.

The second part of the study (Plan II) is a multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohort (panel) design in which different patient panels will receive the same single dose of ZYAN1 1001 on Day 1, Day 3 and Day 5. The starting dose in first panel will be x1 mg where "x" stands for starting dose which will be decided based on the results of the SAD study. Subsequent doses will be x2 mg, x3 mg and x4 mg for panel 2, 3 and 4. The subsequent panels will be conducted in new healthy males provided the previous panel is well tolerated.

In the third part of the study (Plan III), ZYAN1 1001 will be administered once in fed and fasted conditions to healthy males and healthy females. The dose for this part will be decided based on the results of the first part of the study.

The IP will be administered to the volunteer at site under the supervision of a trained study personnel. IP accountability will be documented in a log and verified by an unblinded monitor.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After informed consent has been obtained, all screening tests establishing subject eligibility will be performed within a period of 14 days before dosing. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility on Day -1. 

For Plan I and Plan II - In order to avoid risks, subjects will be randomised in 2 blocks. 

For Plan III - Males and females will be enrolled. All subjects will be administered a single oral dose of ZYAN1 to assess the effects of food and gender difference on safety and pharmacokinetics effect.

Randomization was carried out by an independent statistician. Allocation was concealed by use of pre labelled drug boxes containing subject randomization numbers and use of sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>The investigational product (test or placebo) received by each volunteer will be determined according to the randomization schedule.

In Plan I and II, randomization will be done in such a way that in each panel volunteers will receive ZYAN1 or placebo. In Plan III, all volunteers will receive ZYAN1.

The randomization will be generated using SAS software.</sequence>
