  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aims of the trial are (within the context of the RCT A*STEROID)
1)	To evaluate the effects of betamethasone and dexamethasone on fetal cardiovascular status as assessed by the ultrasound parameters of umbilical artery Doppler, middle cerebral artery Doppler, ductus venosus Doppler, uterine artery Doppler, and myocardial performance index.
2)	To evaluate the effects of betamethasone and dexamethasone on fetal cardiovascular status as assessed by computerized cardiotocograph (cCTG) using Dawes-Redman criteria.
3)	To evaluate the effects of betamethasone and dexamethasone on placental weight, morphology and histological evidence of villous maturation postpartum, and correlate this with placental ultrasound and uterine artery Doppler findings.</summary>
