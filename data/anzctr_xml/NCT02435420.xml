    <summary>This is a retro-prospective, single arm, sequential enrolment study to collect relevant
      clinical and radiological data in at least 156 subjects, at up to 10 sites in Australia, who
      have been implanted with the EMPERION Modular Hip System in primary THA procedures to assess
      its safety and efficacy over 5 years post-surgery.</summary>
