  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Average Daily Normalized "Off" Time - Based on the Parkinson's Disease Symptom Diary. "On" time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. "Off" time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. The diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected clinic visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e. 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. Negative change from baseline for "off" time indicates improvement.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Normalized "On" Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesia at Week 12 - Based on the Parkinson's Disease Symptom Diary. "On" time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. "Off" time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. "On" time without troublesome dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movement) is defined as "On" time without dyskinesia and "On" time with non-troublesome dyskinesia. The diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected clinic visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e. 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. Positive change from Baseline for "on" time without troublesome dyskinesia indicates improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Summary Index at Week 12 - The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson's disease patients. These include: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. The PDQ-39 Summary Index is the sum of all answers divided by the highest score possible (i.e. number of answers multiplied by 4) which is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a 0-100 scale. Higher scores are associated with more severe symptoms.</outcome>

      <outcome>Clinical Global Impression - Status (CGI-S) Score at Baseline and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Score at Week 12 - The CGI-S is a global assessment by the Investigator of current symptomatology and impact of illness on functioning. The ratings of the CGI-S are as follows: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, and 7 = among the most extremely ill. The CGI-I is a global assessment by the Investigator of the change in clinical status since the start of treatment. The CGI-I ratings are as follows: 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, 7 = very much worse.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in EuroQual Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Summary Index at Week 12 - The EQ-5D is a participant answered questionnaire scoring 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. EQ-5D health states, defined by the EQ-5D descriptive system, are converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches values (also called QOL weights or QOL utilities) to each of the levels in each dimension. EQ-5D Summary Index values range from -0.11 to 1.00 with positive change indicating improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) Total Score at Week 12 - The ZBI is a 22-item questionnaire regarding the caregiver/subject relationship and evaluates the caregiver's health condition, psychological well-being, finances and social life. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (0=Never, 1=Rarely, 2=Sometimes, 3=Quite frequently, and 4= Nearly always). The caregiver burden is evaluated by the total score (Range 0 to 88) obtained from the sum of the answers to the 22 questions. Higher scores are associated with a higher level of burden for the caregiver.</outcome>

The sum is divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) and the quotient is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</outcome>
