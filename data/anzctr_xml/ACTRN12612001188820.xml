  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will enrol 200 participants with gout.  Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatments lasting three months:
1.	Intervention groups: Immediate opon presentation of an acute flare oral allopurinol given at a dosage depending on the participants kidney function level (calculated at 1.5mg/unit eGFR) (maximum dose 150 mg daily) will be given for 10 weeks and then doubled for the next 4 weeks. . Also for the control of acute attacks Prednisone will be given as following: 40mg of prednisone for four days and 20 mg for four days followed by 10mg for three days and 5mg for three days. All together Prednisone will be given for 14 days starting on day 1. 500 micrograms of colchicine will be given twice daily to prevent flares for three and a half months from the start of the study. All medications are in a tablet form.</interventions>
    <comparator>2.	Control group: Delayed (by two weeks from the end of the flare i.e. when pain score &lt; 3 ) allopurinol given at a dosage depending on the participants kidney function level (calculated at 1.5mg/unit eGFR) will be given for 8 weeks and then doubled for the next 4 weeks.  Also for the control of acute attacks Prednisone will be given as following: 40mg of prednisone for four days and 20 mg for four days followed by 10mg for three days and 5mg for three days. It will start at the beginning of a pain flare. All together Prednisone will be given for 14 days .500 micrograms of colchicine will be given twice daily to prevent flares for three and a half months from the start of the study.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will conduct a clinical trial comparing the starting of allopurinol in an acute attack with a two week delay to see if there are any differences in pain, likelihood of staying on allopurinol and getting to their recommended blood urate levels. Once achieved acute attacks of gout are extremely unlikely and patients will no longer need to have pain and loss of work. Our study is one of the top priorities of the EULAR group (European Union League against Rheumatism). A randomised controlled trial is the best way to evaluate an intervention and this will be the first trial to be started in the world.</summary>
