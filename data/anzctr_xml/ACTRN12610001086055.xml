  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, single group, daily wear (DW) study where 90 participants will wear NIGHT &amp; DAY [Registered trade mark] lenses bilaterally on a daily wear (DW) basis in conjunction with OPT-FREE [Trade mark] RepleniSH [Trade mark] solution for 4 months. There will be a minimum of 5 scheduled visits: baseline, 1 month visit, 2 month visit, 3 month visit and 4 month visit. These visits will involve assessment of visual acuity and examination with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (a specialised microscope for viewing the eye). Lenses will be worn a minimum of 5 days per week, and 6 hours on the day lenses are worn.</interventions>

-Be at least 18 years old, male or female;
-Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the investigator;
-Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses;
-Is correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses; 
-May be experienced or inexperienced at wearing contact lenses.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
-Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
-Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the study;
-Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the study;
N.B.: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before study product is used;
-Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
-Previous corneal refractive surgery;
-Contraindications to contact lens wear;
-Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the study products;
-Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
-Pregnancy: Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient

-The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, exclude anyone who they believe may not be able to fulfil the study requirements, or if it is believed to be in the participants best interests.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> This study will examine whether a correlation exists between contamination of contact lens cases with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and CIEs, when contact lenses and worn on a daily wear basis. The hypothesis is case contamination with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia does not correlate with CIEs.  </summary>
