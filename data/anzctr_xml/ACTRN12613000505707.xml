  <interventions>
    <interventions>  1. When patients are randomly allocated to the conservative oxygenation arm, then the target arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) during the period of mechanical ventilation (MV) would be 88-92%. When FiO2 is &lt;0.50, we suggest 90-92% SpO2 target; and when FiO2 is 0.50 or more, we suggest 88-90% SpO2.
   2. In all recruited patients, PEEP will be applied at the discretion of the treating clinician. The bedside nurse will then titrate FiO2 to achieve the assigned arterial oxygen saturation targets. In addition, the bedside nurse will set lower alarm-limit for SpO2 at 87% and the higher alarm-limit for SpO2 at 93%. The oxygen saturation goal in the protocol is for SpO2, but when required it may be used interchangeably for SaO2 as per routine practice in the participating centres. For example, if the perfusion is poor or SpO2 becomes less reliable, then the target may be based on SaO2.
   3. When FiO2 requirements are &gt;0.80, oxygen saturation targets will be determined by the treating clinicians as per their usual practice.
   4. The current standard of care management will be instituted in the event of any clinical deterioration or hemodynamic instability. The treating intensive care physician may alter oxygenation targets if deemed necessary according to patients current clinical status.
   5. The oxygenation goals are the long-term SpO2 target for the participants entire stay in ICU while on invasive MV. Temporary measures to improve oxygenation for planned procedures involving upper airways such as tracheostomy, bronchoscopy etc will follow standard practices in the participating centres. Such temporary adjustments in oxygenation parameters will be limited to shortest duration possible.
   6. Patients who are re-intubated will continue in the same study arm and data collection will proceed as if the index MV episode is uninterrupted. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>   1. When patients are randomly allocated to the liberal oxygenation arm, then the target SpO2 during the period of MV would be at least 96%. 
   2. In all recruited patients, PEEP will be applied at the discretion of the treating clinician. The bedside nurse will then titrate FiO2 to achieve the assigned arterial oxygen saturation targets. In addition, the bedside nurse will set lower alarm-limit for SpO2 at 95%. The oxygen saturation goal in the protocol is for SpO2, but when required it may be used interchangeably for SaO2 as per routine practice in the participating centres. For example, if the perfusion is poor or SpO2 becomes less reliable, then the target may be based on SaO2.

    <concealment>Enrolled patients will be randomly allocated using opaque sealed envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Using a web-based computer program, two non-clinical staff members (third party) generated a randomization list stratified for each site. Number of patients per site, number of blocks and the number of patients within each block were all decided by the third-party at their discretion. Thus, the list generated for each site has varying size blocks in random order, with random patient allocations within each block. After generating a sequence list for each site, the third party prepared sealed envelopes for each patient per site. An A4 page with patient randomization number and the corresponding allocated arm was printed for each patient. The allocated arm is typewritten in a lighter font on a coloured page. When examined closely, nothing could be made out on holding that folded-page against a bright light. This folded-page was then inserted in a sequential opaque envelope for each patient. All envelopes were then sealed and securely stored in a locked cabinet. The randomization-key list is securely stored in a password-protected folder and the hard copy is in a locked drawer of one of the department professors who is not involved in the study. The envelope-set for each site will be posted when all sites have obtained final ethics/local site regulatory approval. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>An independent senior biostatistician will perform all analysis using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Baseline comparisons will be performed using chi-square tests for equal proportions or fishers exact tests where numbers are small and reported as n (%). Continuously normally distributed variables will be compared using student t-tests and reported as means (standard deviation) whilst non-normally distributed data will be compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and will be reported as medians (interquartile range). All variables will be assessed for normality and log-transformed if appropriate. Event-free days till day 28 will be compared using Poisson regression analysis. Multivariate models adjusting for baseline imbalances and known covariates will be performed using logistic or linear regression where appropriate. Sub-group analysis will be performed for patients with baseline PaO2/FiO2 &lt;300. All analyses will be according to intention-to-treat principle. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinicians consider arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) of at least 88-90% as an acceptable target for most patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV). Although several experimental and clinical studies report that high levels of oxygen (O2) may be injurious, and recent RCTs show that O2 therapy titrated to lower SpO2 targets (88-94%) improves clinical outcomes in some patient groups, major observational studies show that ICU patients often receive much higher levels of oxygenation in the first 24 hours of ICU admission. 
   
Indeed, in a recently completed observational study in ICU patients on MV, we observed that high oxygenation levels were usually achieved with the use of liberal amounts of O2 in routine practice. At a teaching hospital, the 95% confidence interval for the mean time-weighted average SpO2 for the first 7 days of ventilation was 96.8-97.4% and the mean FiO2 of 0.40 or more was used to achieve mean SpO2 of &gt;95% on 40% of the ventilated days. There are no data in literature, for adult ICU patients receiving MV, to demonstrate whether or not higher oxygenation targets (SpO2 &gt;95%) lead to different outcomes than the alternative lower targets (SpO2 88-94%).
   
We aim to systematically evaluate whether liberal O2 therapy is beneficial or harmful compared to a more conservative O2 therapy in critically ill patients. To help us determine the optimal size and design of a suitable trial, a pilot study will be first performed to assess feasibility of the two oxygenation strategies. 
   
Our hypothesis for this pilot study is that in critically ill patients on invasive MV, an effective separation of SpO2 levels can be achieved between the two (conservative vs. liberal oxygen targets) groups, without any significant problems or safety concerns in implementing the study protocol in different critical care settings.
   
100 eligible patients, will be randomly allocated to either a liberal oxygenation strategy with target SpO2 of at least 96% or a conservative oxygenation strategy with target SpO2 of 88-92%. The treating team will set PEEP as per usual practice. When FiO2 requirements are &gt;0.80, SpO2 targets will be determined by the treating clinicians. The pragmatic nature of the trial allows flexibility in management decisions and allows the treating clinicians to alter oxygenation targets if necessary according to patients current clinical state. Other co-interventions such as sedation, nutrition and weaning from ventilation will follow standard practices.
   
This pilot study will provide crucial preliminary information on the likely effects of two different target levels of oxygenation in ICU patients on invasive MV. If feasibility and safety are demonstrated, we will follow this study with a definitive RCT, the results of which will have the potential to substantially influence clinical practice in relation to O2 therapy in critically ill patients. </summary>
