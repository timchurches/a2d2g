  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend the New Zealand Centre of Integrated Health Clinic for an initial consultation with the Co-ordinating Investigator, where a Patient Information Sheet (PIS), Consent form and Quality of Life Survey (SF36), Pain Scale and Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS2) questionnaire will be completed and signed. A Registered Nurse will assess and review all documentation to ensure the inclusion criteria is met.  If the participant meets the criteria they will be entered into the study and assigned a Candidate ID.  At this time the candidates will be randomised to an intervention or placebo group.  
Participants in the intervention group will have a Shuzi sports bracelet inserted with the technology.  The Shuzi sports bracelet is a nylon bracelet embedded with a 2mm x 0.5mm metal disc composed of gold, nickel, zinc, and copper.  Prior to embedding the metal disk into the bracelet, the disk is exposed to audio frequencies which were determined over a year of research and experiments to provide a proprietary range that is between 20Hz and 20kHz for 60 minutes, using a computer program.  The volume of the audio is 85dB, Participants will wear it continuously for six weeks including sleeping and showering.  A diary will be issued to the participant to complete each day.  This will record if they have worn the bracelet or removed it for any reason.  
Participants will, at the end of week 1 and again at the end of week 3, complete the Pain Scale and AIMS2 questionnaires which will be available online via Survey Monkey software.  
After the participant has worn the bracelet for 6 weeks they will return to the clinic for a final consultation with the Co-ordinating Investigator and completion of another SF36 questionnaire, Pain Scale, AIMS2 and Bracelet comfort questionnaire and return the bracelet and diary.

    <comparator>All participants wear a bracelet. 1/2 of the group will wear a nylon bracelet with the technology inserted in the bracelet and 1/2 will wear a nylon bracelet without the metal disk.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A study Capsaicin trials for osteoarthritis both in 1994 and 2000 found a difference in the number of participants, defined if the trial was of low quality.  200 candidates provided a solid research outcome.
Analysis:
NUMERIC RATING SCALE (NRS) FOR PAIN 
The NRS for pain is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults, including those with chronic pain due to rheumatic diseases. The number that the respondent indicates on the scale to rate their pain intensity is recorded. Scores range from 010.  Higher scores indicate greater pain intensity.

ARTHRITIS IMPACT MEASUREMENT SCALES 2 (AIMS2) 
The AIMS2 is an arthritis-specific health status measure that assesses physical functioning, pain, psychological status, social interactions and support, health perceptions, and demographic and treatment information. The total AIMS2 has 78 questions. High scores indicate poor health. No cut off values or normative values are available but scale scores may be adjusted to account for comorbidities. AIMS2 scales were originally discussed as 3 or 5 dimensions of health status. However, many studies discuss the measure using 5 dimensions: physical function, symptom, affect, social interaction, and role.

Quality of Life (SF36):
For each of the eight domains that the SF36 measures an aggregate percentage score is produced. The percentage scores range from 0% (lowest or worst possible level of functioning) to 100% (highest or best possible level of functioning).  You calculate these scores through using a two-step system. These translated scores are taken and the mean average for each of the eight scales is worked out. Translated scores for each of the scale items are added up to calculate the average. 

BRACELET COMFORT:
This questionnaire consists of three questions, using a simple yes or no response.  These will be added up to calculate an average.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Shuzi bracelet has been available for a number of years on the market place and reported changes to date are reduced pain, a sense of calmness and reduction of arthritic symptoms. In order for the Shuzi technology to be recognised as a product that can provide support to people living with arthritis conditions, a robust research trial showing the effects of the technology to pain and quality of life is required. 200 participants will be recruited from the Tauranga area.  To be eligible for enrollment individuals will be diagnosed with either Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis or Arthritis.  At the initial consultation the participant will fill out and sign a Patient Info Sheet, Consent Form, SF36 Quality of Life Survey (QOL), Pain Scale and Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS2).  All documentation will be reviewed to ensure inclusion criteria is met. If met, the participant will receive a Shuzi bracelet.  This study does have a control group of 100 candidates and therefore only 100 will receive a bracelet with the technology built into the bracelet and the remaining 100 candidates will have a bracelet with no technology.  Participants will wear the bracelet for 6 weeks including sleeping and showering.  A diary will be provided to record if the bracelet has been removed. At week one and week three another QOL, Pain Scale and AIMS2 will be completed via Survey Monkey or attendance at the NZCIH Clinic.  At 6 weeks the participant will return to complete the QOL, Pain Scale, AIMS2 and Bracelet comfort questionnaire and return the bracelet and diary.  Analysis will of be completed of the questionnaires completed as outlined in the protocol.
