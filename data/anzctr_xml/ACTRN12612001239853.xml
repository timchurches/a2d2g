  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nebulised verapamil used as a treatment agent is associated with a reduction of Pulmonary Arterial Pressure (PAP).
Patients will undergo transthoracic Echocardiographic examination with evaluation of systolic PAP by echocardiography equipment</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and 1 hour after the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of EF (Ejection Faction) by  transthoracic echocardiography equipment</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and 1 hour after the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of RV (Right Ventricular) size and  RV TAPSE (Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion) by transthoracic echocardiography equipment</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and 1 hour after the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nebulised verapamil used as a treatment agent is associated with a  reduction of Spirometric Parameters (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC) that evaluated by spirometry equipment</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and 30 minutes after the intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nebulised verapamil used as a treatment agent is associated with a  reduction of O2 Saturation that evaluated by pulse oximetry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and immediately after the intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure is measured by blood pressure cuff because of possible hypotension as the side effect associated with the intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and immediately after the intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Heart rate is measured because of possible bradycardia as the side effect associated with the intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and immediately after the intervention</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We could not find any study that has examined the use of verapamil in PH secondary to COPD. The proposed study will provide scientifically valid data to date on whether nebulised verapamil (10 mg) is effective in these cases or not.</summary>
