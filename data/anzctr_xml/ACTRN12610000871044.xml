  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three formulations of the dermal implant ELAPR are to be evaluated in the study. All three formulations are based on the protein tropoelastin which is the building block of elastin - a major structural component of the skin providing it with its ability to stretch and recoil. The three formulations differ in the presentation of the tropoelastin: formulation 1 is the tropoelastin alone; formulation 2 contains a combination of tropoelastin and hyaluronic acid; formulation 3 contains tropoelastin cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. 

Each of the 12 participants will receive a 0.1ml implant of each of the three formulations of ELAPR and one of a saline control (total four implants) in the medial aspect of the upper arm. All four implant sites will be subject to a single biopsy at three separate time points - four participants will have their implants biopsied at Day 8, four at Day 15 and four at Day 29.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety and tolerability of a single course of intradermal injections of ELAPR when administered to healthy subjects. This will be assessed by clinical observation of the implant sites throughout the duration of the study; haematology and blood biochemistry analysis; and, histopathology and immunohistochemistry of a tissue biopsy sample from each implant site to evaluate implant persistance and identify any cellular responses to the implant material.</outcome>
      <timepoint>- Clinical evaluation of the implant sites will occur for 60 minutes after implantation and on Days 4, 8, 15, 29 and 43.
- Blood haematology and biochemical analysis will occur during screening and at Day 1, 4 and 29.
- Biopsies for histopathology will be taken on Day 8, 15 and 29 (four participants each).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine implant persistence by histopathology and clinical observation</outcome>
      <timepoint>- Clinical evaluation of the implant sites will occur for 60 minutes after implantation and on Days 4, 8, 15, 29 and 43.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Elastin is a major structural component of the skin which enables the skin to stretch and recoil.  The loss or damage of elastin in the skin results in a range of skin abnormalities including, the symptoms of skin aging such as wrinkles, scars and the signs of sun damage. ELAPR is a dermal implant which is made from a synthetic form of human elastin and is being developed as a product which may be injected superficially into the skin using very fine needles to treat skin abnormalities associated with the loss of elastin. The synthetic human elastin which is the basis of the ELAPR dermal implant is a completely new product and the purpose of the current clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of the product in humans. The trial will involve the implantation of a small volume of the product in the skin of the upper arm of study participants. The implant will remain in the skin for a period of up to 29 days. The implant will then be removed by a needle biopsy to allow studies to be carried out on the tissue surrounding the implant to see how the body responded to the presence of the implant in the skin. The results of this study will provide a good understanding of how well the body tolerates this new synthetic human elastin material. If the synthetic elastin is well tolerated by the body then further studies will be undertaken to study its use in the treatment of skin abnormalities resulting from aging, scarring and sun damage.</summary>
