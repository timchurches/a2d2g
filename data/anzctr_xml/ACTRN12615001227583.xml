    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children attending Grade one and two at schools in the Metro South and Metro North Oral Health catchment will be recruited at standard dental examination. At recruitment participants will be randomised to either the CPP-ACP toothpaste, placebo toothpaste or the commercial fluoridated toothpaste group through central randomisation by computer. Participation group will be unknown for the CPP-ACP toothpaste and placebo toothpaste groups as this is a double-blinded group.

Participants recruited to the commercial fluoridated toothpaste group will be informed at the recruitment appointment after the allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>At the completion of the recruitment appointment, all participants will be randomised to the CPP-ACP toothpaste, placebo toothpaste or the commercial fluoridated toothpaste group by computer generated randomised allocation.

The CPP-ACP toothpaste and the placebo toothpaste will be pre-marked with a digital code. The codes will be provided to the chief supervisor of the study. Only after the statistical evaluation is completed will the decoding occur.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: To be 80% certain of detecting a significantly difference at the end of the study, with an expected caries prevalence of 60% and 75% in the treatment versus either of the two control groups respectively, a sample size of 165 per group is required, according to a power analysis. This is based on using a Chi-squared test with a two-sided 5% significance level and allowing for a Fisher Exact test if numbers are small. Anticipating a dropout rate per year of 15% in the treatment and control groups, the target sample size is 195 in the CPP-ACP toothpaste group and 195 in the two control groups. Therefore there will be 3 groups of 195 participants (total 585). The groups are rounded up to 200 participants per group (600 in total) for ease of purchasing etc.

Analysis: At each timepoint, the CPP-ACP toothpaste group versus the placebo control group or the community control group will be compared using Chi-square tests for categorical variables (presence of caries, plaque and bacteria), and independent t-tests for continuous variables  (mean number of caries, mean plaque score, mean bacterial load). Chi-square tests will also be used to examine the associations between caries and the presence of plaque and/or bacteria.  

Mixed modelling will be used to assess the changes in caries incidence over time, and to examine the relationship between caries and the presence of plaque and/or bacteria over time. 

All analyses will be carried out in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.  Statistical significance will be set at 5%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine 
- the effectiveness of using a CPP-ACP toothpaste in preventing dental caries in children
- the microbial changes in plaque such as the reduction in decay causing  bacteria

Participants will attend routine dental examination appointments at public oral health services. In addition to standard examination  a sample of plaque will be taken by swabbing selected teeth with a small brush.  A questionnaire will be completed by the participant's parents regarding medical, social, toothbrushing and dietary histories. Dental radiographs will be taken at the recruitment appointment. All identified treatment will be undertaken. 

At the first appointment, a participant's toothbrushing group will be randomly allocated. The allocation is either the CPP-ACP toothpaste or the placebo toothpaste (blinded groups) or commercial fluoridated toothpaste (non blinded). For the blinded groups (CPP-ACP and placebo), the toothpaste packaging will be marked with a digital code, but the content will not be known to the participants, the clinicians or the investigator. The codes will be provided to the chief supervisor of the study. Only after the statistical evaluation is completed will the decoding occur. 

All the toothbrushes and toothpaste will be provided free of charge for the duration of the study. Participants are asked to brush twice daily will the allocated toothpaste. Compliance will be monitored by a phone call questionnaire at 3 and 9 months and in person at 6 and 12 month . The examination appointment will be repeated at 6 months and 12 months. Dental radiographs will be taken at 12 months.
