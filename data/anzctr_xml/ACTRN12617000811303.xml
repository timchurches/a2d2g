    <interventions>This study will be a multi-center, double-blind, semi-sequential group, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK/PD of glutazumab in subjects with T2D. 
After Screening, subjects will undergo a 4-week single-blind, placebo run-in period as a separate part of the study, the purpose of the run-in period is to provide the subjects a period of adaptive phase, and to collect baseline data . Subjects will receive placebo 0.5 mL once weekly via subcutaneous injection . All background diabetes medication will be kept constant. At the end of the single-blind run-in period, subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive either glutazumab or placebo, and the 8-week double-blind treatment period will begin.
During the 8 weeks double-blind treatment period, each subjects will receive sc injection of glutazumab or placebo once weekly for 8 weeks .  
Four sequential cohorts, each with 6 subjects receiving glutazumab and 2 subjects receiving placebo, will be given increasing doses of glutazumab once weekly for 8 weeks (8 SC injections). The doses administered will be 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg once weekly for the four cohorts, respectively . Prior to each dose escalation a Safety Review Committee (SRC) will meet to confirm the next dose level. A next dose level can only be started when the preceding dose group is fully enrolled and at least 50% of the subjects in the preceding dose level have completed 4 weeks of dosing. Based on the safety and PK/PD data of these subjects subjects, a fifth cohort with 9 subjects receiving glutazumab and 3 subjects receiving placebo, will be treated with a dose of glutazumab that will be determined by the SRC to be the most promising based on a risk benefit evaluation, and will be also given glutazumab once weekly for 8 weeks (8 SC injections ).
During the study, subjects will be reimbursed for their meals, parking during their visits, and investigator and research nurses will keep in close contact with subjects by weekly phone call and regular email to ensure the adherence to the study .</interventions>
