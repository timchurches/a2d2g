Other interventions: Certolizumab Pegol
Prefilled syringes containing an injectable volume of 1 ml of solution for injection CZP for single use at a dosage strength of 200 mg/ml.
Injections will be given subcutaneously. CZP 400 mg at Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 Weeks until Week 50.

Other interventions: Placebo
2 syringes Placebo at Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4, followed by 1 syringe Placebo every 2 Weeks.

Other interventions: Methotrexate
The MTX treatment is to be initiated at a dose of 10 mg per Week (oral tablets at the strength of 2.5 mg/tablet). The MTX dosage should be escalated by 5 mg every 2 Weeks such that the maximum dosage of 25 mg per Week is achieved by Week 6 to Week 8. Patients who could not tolerate = 15 mg/week MTX by Week 8 were withdrawn while the maximum tolerated dose per patient (optimized dose) was maintained to Week 52.

      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects in Sustained Remission at Week 52 - Sustained remission is defined as a Disease Activity Score [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate] (DAS28[ESR]) &lt; 2.6 at both Weeks 40 and 52.
DAS28[ESR] is calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula:
0.56 x v(TJC) + 0.28 x v(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x PtGADA, where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.</outcome>
