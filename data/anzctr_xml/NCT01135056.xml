  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - SIR-Spheres
Treatment: drugs - Sorafenib tosylate

Active Comparator: Sorafenib, Multikinase Inhibitor, Tablet - Sorafenib tosylate:
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that decreases tumor cell proliferation.
Sorafenib was shown to inhibit multiple intracellular (c-CRAF, BRAF and mutant BRAF) and cell surface kinases (KIT, FLT- 3, RET, VEGFR-1, VEGFR- 2, VEGFR- 3, and PDGFR- ß). Several of these kinases are thought to be involved in tumor cell signaling, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Sorafenib inhibited tumor growth of the human hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, and several other human tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice. A reduction in tumor angiogenesis and increases in tumor apoptosis was seen in models of human hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally a reduction in tumor cell signaling was seen in a model of human hepatocellular carcinoma.

Active Comparator: SIR-Spheres, Microspheres, Device - SIR-Spheres:
SIR-Spheres consist of biocompatible resin microspheres containing yttrium-90, with a size between 20 and 60 microns in diameter. Yttrium-90 is a high-energy pure beta-emitting isotope with no primary gamma emission. The half life of yttrium-90 is 64.1 hours. In clinical use which requires the isotope to decay to infinity, 94% of the radiation is delivered in 11 days leaving only background radiation with no therapeutic value.
SIR-Spheres is implanted into hepatic tumours by delivery via either the common hepatic artery or the right or left hepatic artery using a catheter or implanted port . Once SIR-Spheres is implanted into the liver, it is not metabolised or excreted and it stays permanently in the liver.


Treatment: devices: SIR-Spheres
One time treatment. Dose administered based on tumour volume. Each vial is 3.0GBq.

Treatment: drugs: Sorafenib tosylate
Oral Tablet, 400mg B.i.d, until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death due to any cause. All patients will be followed up until death to compare the overall survival between the two treatments. 2 years is an estimated time frame.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression free survival in the liver - Progression-free survival in the liver is defined as the time interval between randomisation and the date of tumour progression in the liver or death, whichever is earlier. Tumour progression in the liver will be determined from serial CT scans. Diagnosis of tumour progression of disease should be made using the RECIST guideline version 1.1. 2 years is an estimated time frame.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression free survival overall - Progression-free survival overall is defined as the time interval between randomisation and the date of tumour progression at any site in the body or death, whichever is earlier. Tumour progression at any site in the body will be measured by any definitive imaging technique including CT scan, MRI study or other nuclear medicine scan. The Investigator should clearly indicate the site of tumour progression (hepatic or extra-hepatic) at the time of recurrence.
2 years is an estimated time frame.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tumour Response Rate - Tumour response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1) [European Journal of Cancer (45): 228 - 247, 2009] (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/recist_guideline.pdf).
2 years is an estimated time frame</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity and Safety - Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4.02. Patients for both treatment arms will be followed-up for safety and toxicity from the time of study entry (randomisation day) until 30 days post study conclusion or until commencement of the next alternative therapy, which ever is earlier.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health Related Quality of Life (QoL) - Quality of life (QoL) will be measured by using the EQ-5D questionnaire over the study period. QoL for patients will be measured until their first disease progression up to 2 years (estimated) which ever is earlier.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Liver resection rate - Patients will be assessed for suitability for liver resection every 12 weekly until their study conclusion up to 2 years which ever is earlier.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Liver Transplantation Rate - Patients will be assessed for suitability for liver transplantation every 12 weekly until their study conclusion up to 2 years which ever is earlier.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of SIRT as compared with
      Sorafenib in patients with locally advanced liver cancer in terms of overall survival (OS).

      The Study null hypothesis is, there is no difference in overall survival between patients
      receiving SIRT and those receiving Sorafenib therapy.</summary>
