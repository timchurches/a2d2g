Overall survival is the time from the patient's randomisation of treatment to the date of death from any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All subjects all followed until death, or at least 5 years.  Follow up intervals are every 4 months for the first 2 years, the every 6 months for the remaining 3 years.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Disease-specific survival.

This is the time from the patient's randomisation until the date of the patients death due to non melanoma skin cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All subjects all followed until death, or at least 5 years.  Follow up intervals are every 4 months for the first 2 years, the every 6 months for the remaining 3 years.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life in both patient groups will be assessed using the QOL tools EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 and EORTC QLQ-C30.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients in both groups will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires prior to randomisation, and at the 4 months and yearly after their surgery until 5 years reached.

Mean individual changes in quality of life will be compared between treatment arms.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the effect of sentinel lymph node biopsy on survival in people with high risk non melanoma skin cancer. 

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are aged 18 years or more, have high risk non melanoma skin cancer, and will be available for a 5 year follow-up assessment. 

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Both groups will undergo removal of their skin cancer.  In addition, participants in one group will receive sentinel lymph node biopsy. This is a procedure in which the local lymph node ("gland") that drain the patch of skin containing the tumour are excised.  These lymph node(s) are examined under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present. If cancer cells are found, patients will undergo completion lymphadenectomy (i.e. surgical removal of the rest of the regional lymph nodes). 
Participants in the second group will undergo observation of regional lymph nodes, and those that develop cancer cells will undergo completion lymphadenectomy.

All patients will undergo continued observation for a period of 5 years to determine survival and quality of life.</summary>
