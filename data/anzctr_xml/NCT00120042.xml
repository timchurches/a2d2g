  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Interruption of a pregnancy after 14 weeks gestation may be required when the fetus is dead,
      severely malformed or in cases of maternal illness. This process is usually conducted
      medically in Australia, using the prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol. This prostaglandin,
      although not specifically licensed for use in pregnancy termination, is now a common
      abortifacient with a lot of accumulated experience both within Australia and internationally.

      Since 1996, misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin, has been used at King Edward Memorial
      Hospital as the principal agent for second trimester pregnancy termination. This agent is
      administered vaginally, and in its current form and dosage regimen results in 75-80% of women
      delivering within 24 hours. As experience with this agent has grown, it has been observed
      that in approximately 40% of women the placenta is either completely retained or incompletely
      delivered, necessitating operative removal and an increased potential for maternal blood
      loss. In this study, it is planned, in a randomized controlled clinical trial, to evaluate
      three regimens for the management of placental delivery in women undergoing second trimester
      pregnancy interruption. The primary intention of this study is to develop a third stage
      management protocol to reduce the incidence of placental retention in second trimester
      medical pregnancy termination.

      The secondary aim of this study is to assess the ultrasound appearance of the uterus and its
      cavity within 24 hours of second trimester pregnancy termination. The ultrasound appearances
      of the uterus following second trimester pregnancy loss have not been previously investigated
      in detail. Previous ultrasound studies of the term postpartum uterus have demonstrated a high
      incidence of echogenic material within the uterine cavity soon after an uncomplicated vaginal
      delivery. These findings have been of concern as the ultrasound appearances may erroneously
      imply a need for operative intervention. The investigators wish to ascertain if this high
      incidence of echogenic tissue presence is also true in the second trimester. Ultrasound is
      frequently used by clinicians to define placental completeness and the potential requirement
      for surgical curettage. The data from this single sonographic examination of the uterus will
      provide baseline data for a planned longitudinal study of uterine appearances following
      second trimester pregnancy loss and their correlation with clinical symptoms.</summary>
