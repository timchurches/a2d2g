  <interventions>
    <interventions>The ambulance service tends to transport the majority of patients they see to emergency departments.  This places a burden on emergency departments and inconveniences the patient.  The Extended Care Paramedic (ECP) model of care is based on training standard paramedics with a broader range of assessment and treatment skills that enables them to treat a large group of these patients at home and in their local community.  The training is given to a small group of 6 Paramedics to enable a 24hr roster.  The training is over a month with monthly ongoing clinical training days.  This model requires formal evaluation through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to establish whether this is an improvement in patient outcome.  The RCT will then be assessed after training and will last unitl 1000 patients have been treated or 1 year whichever comes first.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ambulance service tends to transport the majority of patients they see to emergency departments for definitive assessment and treatment, despite the fact that many of these patients are not in need of emergency department care. This places a burden on the emergency department in terms of workload, and adds inconvenience to the patient due to transport to a hospital. The Extended Care Paramedic (ECP) model of care is based on training paramedics in acute assessment and treatment, so that they can recognise patients who do not require hospital admission, and treat these patients at home.  This model of care has not been formally evaluated to ensure that the correct patients are identified to be treated in the community, and that this treatment is satisfactory.</summary>
