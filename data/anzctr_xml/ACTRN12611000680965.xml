  <interventions>
    <interventions>SCENAR electrical stimulation therapy.
1 X 30 minute treatment sessions on the shoulder joint per week for 12 weeks. SCENAR is administered in a setting similar to massage therapy, with the patient sitting or lying on a massage table. The device is then placed on the patients skin and moved around the area of the injury. During this the patient may feel a slight tingling sensation.

SCENAR Placebo stimulation therapy.
1 X 30 minute treatment sessions on the shoulder joint per week for 12 weeks. This treatment will be exactly the same as SCENAR therapy, excpet that the patient will not feel a slight tingling sensation, this is a custom made placebo device that turns on but does not emit any electrical signal. The patients be assured that some people are more sensitive than others and may or may not feel anything during treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Previous research conducted on the conventional therapies for the rehabilitation of frozen shoulder will be used as a control for the average recovery time.
Conventional therapies include:
Acupuncture
Massage
Arthroscopy/Manipulation Under Anaesthesia
Historial data was obtained from a literature undertaken using studies invloving conventional therapies that were completed between 2000-2011</comparator>

    <concealment>After initial contact is made with the potential participant a meeting is then arranged. During the meeting the research project is explained to the participants, what their role is and what they are required to do. If they wish to proceed then the participant then completes the informed consent and medical forms. Once the individual meets with the practitioner they will be allocated to a randommly assigned. Allocation is not concealed from the practitioner.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated to groups using a sequence of numbers generated by www.random.org.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>What is the effect of 12 weeks of SCENAR electrical stimulation therapy on glenohumeral range of motion in subjects with frozen shoulder?
As no literature exists relating specifically to SCENAR therapy, the null hypothesis is supported. This is that the device does not cause any changes to glenohumeral ROM.</summary>
