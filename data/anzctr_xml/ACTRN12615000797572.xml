  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to evaluate the effect of anthocyanins, an antioxidant derived from fruits and vegetables, as an anti-thrombotic prophylaxis in normal healthy individuals versus obese pro-thrombotic individuals (predisposed to heart attacks and stroke). Increased platelet activity is an important contributor to thrombosis in vascular diseases. Antioxidants have been shown to act on several platelet activation pathways, reducing inflammatory responses thereby mimicking antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory drugs. We have previously shown that antioxidants in the form of a plum juice have potential to alleviate thrombotic risk in normal healthy population by reducing platelet aggregation, platelet activation and improving coagulation profile. Furthermore it has been demonstrated that anthocyanins target similar platelet activation pathways as aspirin (cyclooxygenase-1 pathway) and clopidogrel (ADP P2Y12 pathway), the commonly used antithrombotic drugs. In spite of the effectiveness of these drugs, prolonged usage has been associated with a number of side effects. We believe that anthocyanins have the potential to be used in the pro-thrombotic, drug resistant/non-responsive patient population either as a replacement or complementary therapy in prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The outcome of this project will significantly support a therapeutic alternative to currently used therapeutics, leading to effective prevention and treatment of oxidative stress induced metabolic syndrome conditions, providing fiscal and health benefit to society.</summary>
