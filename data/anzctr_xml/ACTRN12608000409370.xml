    <studytitle>Sleep Apnea CardioVascular Endpoints study  An investigation of continuous positive airway pressure for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea to prevent cardiovascular disease.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>SAVE (Sleep Apnea cardioVascular Endpoints) study
An international, multi-centre, open, parallel group, prospective, randomised, controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of treatment with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) in addition to standard care in reducing cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in patients with co-existing CV disease and moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients allocated to the CPAP group will be commenced on fixed level CPAP (90th centile of pressures determined during a 1 week treatment period using auto CPAP).  Adherence will be monitored using the in-built monitor in each CPAP device. Treatment with CPAP involves a mask placed over the nose, or both the nose and mouth during sleep.  The mask is attached via a hose to a CPAP machine, which gently pushes air into the lungs opening the obstructed airways. Treatment will continue for 2-7 years post randomisation depending on the patients date of enrolment.   In addition, patients will receive standard care of their CV co-morbidities as directed by their regular doctor(s).   Patients who continue to use CPAP (even on an intermittent basis) will have the treatment continued indefinitely.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be a composite of the CV endpoints of CV death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for heart failure, and new hospitalisation for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack.  These reported events will be verified from investigator reports, hospital records (including where applicable results of serial ECGs and cardiac enzymes, CT brain scans, chest radiographs and other investigations) and post-mortem or death certificates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Reviewed 6-monthly; average patient follow up, 4.5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcomes will include: a) a composite of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke, b) the individual components of the primary composite endpoint, c) re-vascularisation procedures, d) all-cause death, e) new onset atrial fibrillation, f) new onset diabetes, g) OSA symptom scores, h) mood i) health-related quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Reviewed 6-monthly; average patient follow up, 4.5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In a sub-sample of 600 subjects pathophysiological mechanisms of CPAP-induced CV event reduction will be explored by assessing various intermediate markers of CV risk (blood pressure, serum lipids and glucose, Haemoglobin A1C, N-terminal fragment of the prohormone Brain-type Natriuretic Peptide and new onset atrial fibrilationand diabetes).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at 6-months, 2 and 4 years following randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In a sub-sample of 150 participants (75 from the CPAP plus standard treatment and 75 from the standard treatment arms) the effect of CPAP on cardiac and vascular function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be investigated. The sub-study will evaluate left and right ventricular mass, volume and systolic/diastolic function, compliance of the aorta, pathophysiological markers of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction/atherosclerosis (N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP)) and, traditional CV risk factors (blood pressure (BP), serum lipids, glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)).</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Once CV eligibility criteria are confirmed the subject wil be sent home with a sleep apnea diagnostic device (ApneaLinkTM, ResMed)  to make an overnight measurement.  Data from the ApneaLink will be reviewed by expert sleep technicians for verification of the OSA diagnostic criteria for entry in the study. 
Eligible subjects will undergo a 1-week run-in phase using sham CPAP to determine their level of treatment adherence to the device and study protocol.  Subjects who do not accept or adhere to CPAP mask therapy, will be excluded from further participation in the trial. 
After eligibility in the study has been confirmed, subjects will be randomised via a centralised web-based system.  The treatment group is concealed until assigned.</concealment>
    <sequence>A minimisation program will stratify treatment allocation by type of CV disease (cardiac or cerebrovascular) and by a measure of OSA severity( minimisation cut off for OSA severity on the Epworth sleepiness scale is &gt;=11 and &lt;11).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>OSA is a condition in which a person stops breathing for several seconds at a time due to relaxation of the throat muscles.  This can occur many times over during sleep.  It is known to cause sleepiness and poor concentration during the day.  Research indicates that OSA may be a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to its association with hypertension,  stroke, heart attack and sudden death. The standard therapy for symptomatic OSA is CPAP. CPAP has been shown to effectively reduce snoring, obstructive episodes and daytime sleepiness and to modestly reduce blood pressure and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  The overall aim of SAVE is to determine if CPAP can reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or heart failure for people with OSA.</summary>
