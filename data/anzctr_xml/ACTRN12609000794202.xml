  <interventions>
    <interventions>Methylphendiate -In single patient trials each patient undergoes 3 pairs of treatment periods.  Each treatment period is 3 days (thus each pair is 6 days). The order of Methylphenidate and placebo will be determined by random allocation, blinded to both clinician and patient.  The dose will be 5mg bi-daily (oral capsules). The drug will be capsules administered bi-daily by the patient.  The drug and placebo will be packaged for patients ease of use.  Methylphenidate has a short half life, so there is no wash out period between pairs.  The data from the first of each 3 day period will be removed from analysis in case of any carry over effect of the drug.  The intervention will be a total of 18 days.</interventions>

    <concealment>In a single patient trial the patient acts as their own control.  Patients are randomly allocated to receive methylphenidate or placebo first for 3 days within a 6 day pair (Pair 1). Random allocation of treatment occurs for Pair 2 and Pair 3 as well. Allocation is centrally randomised by computer, pharmacy, and cheif invesitgator are aware of allocation, however trating physician and patient are unaware.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives:  A) To determine a population estimate of the efficacy of Mehtylphenidate in alleviating fatigue in patients with advanced cancer.   B) To provide process evaluation on the feasibility of Single Patient Trials as a routine means of conducting clinical trials in palliative care. C) To develop, employ and recommend appropriate statistical techniques for the analysis of Single Patient Trial data derived from patients with advanced cancer;  specifically, to develop and evaluate a method that estimates the effect of patient deterioration over the conduct of clinical trials and, where appropriate, provides a means of adjusting for illness progression.</summary>
