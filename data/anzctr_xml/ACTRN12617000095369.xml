  <interventions>
    <interventions>Training
intervention group: Dual-task treadmill training, 3 times/week, total 12 weeks (under physical therapist supervision)

each is an individual one-on-one sessions

The treadmill training include a treadmill to walk on it and a exergame system to provide subjects a dual-task challenge. The training will be supervised under physical therapist at study site. Whole training need about 1 hour to complete.

The content of exergame: When participant is walking on the treadmill they will watch the screen and used their upper extremity to touch the target on the screen. The exergame is made up by x-box kinect system. We used this system to design dual-task training.

Each time when participants of intervention group come we will record it, and make sure the participants complete the required training.   



</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group: multi-component exercise 3 times/week, total 12 weeks (home program with video)

These sessions include
1. Warm-up 10 min
2 Aerobic exercise 20 min: 
   Marching in place, alternate toe touches to front, alternate heel touches, and alternate
   toe touches to sides, alternate heel touches to sides, alternate kicks, alternate
   knee lifts, and alternate double knee lifts
3 Resistance exercise 10 min: 
   Sitting: arm side raise, biceps curl, and arm horizontal abduction with elastic band;
   double hip abduction with elastic band tied at mid-thigh
4 Balance training 10 min: 
   Standing: lifting leg forward, backward, sideways, tiptoeing, heel-stand; toe-walking;
   side-walking, sitting to standing while holding balls, throwing balls to partner
   while standing
5 Cool-down 10 min

the test is complete by using timed up and go test
two kinds of test
1. motor type: when doing timed up and go test, the subjects hold a cup of water simultaneously
2. cognitive type:when doing timed up and go test, the subjects is given a number by the researcher, and subjects need to calculate this number minus 3 continuously.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Aging progressively decreases executive function, which results in a reduction of dual-task performance and impacts the ability of older adults to engage in everyday dual-task scenarios. Previous studies reported that multicomponent exercise program improved physical performance in elderly. However, few literatures presents that dual-task training with exergame enhances executive function and dual-task performance which are more close to activities of daily living in older adults.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate effects of dual-task training with exergame on executive function and dual-task performance in community-dwelling older adults.

Methods: Forty community-dwelling people older than 65 years without neurological disorder, heart disease, bone fracture or receiving exercise training in 6 months will be recruited in the present study. They are allocated randomly into either the experimental group accepting dual-task training with exergame three times a week for 12 weeks or control group accepting multicomponent exercise home program three times a week for 12 weeks. Participants receive assessment of executive function, Timed Up and Go with dual-task (motor and cognitive), community walking test, and walking ability questionnaire before and after the intervention.

Statistical analysis: Two-way analysis of variance will be used to analyze dependent variables. The significance will be accepted for values of p&lt;0.05.
