  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive the Study Drug, Vessel Dilator peptide ('VSDL' or Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)[31-67]). A lead-in group of two participants will receive a subcutaneous (SC) infusion for six hours targeting a steady state plasma concentration of VSDL of 10 ng/mL. Following review of the results in the lead-in group, a cohort of eight participants will be infused at the same rate, or a lower or higher infusion rate as determined by the results from the lead-in group, to achieve the same target steady state plasma concentration. Following evaluation of results in the first cohort, a second cohort of eight participants will subsequently be infused subcutaneously with VSDL for six hours at an infusion rate that is targeting a steady state plasma concentration of 20 ng/mL.</interventions>
