    <statisticalmethods>For this non-inferiority trial, the null hypothesis is stated as- HO: p2 - p1 &gt; delta (inferior); where p1 is the overall proportion of participants expected to experience the outcome if the treatments are non-inferior, and delta is the smallest change in proportions between groups (p2 - p1) which would still be clinically important (delta = 2%)- non-inferiority limit. The  maximum size of delta of 2% was agreed adopting the Delphic principle of agreement amongst clinical experts. An absolute increase in risk of infection of 2% produces a number needed to harm (NNH) of 50. This was considered the maximum acceptable increase in infection that could be permitted to conclude  non-inferiority. The sample size calculation is based primarily on our own data and other published studies. With an infection rate of 9%, 4303 patients per intervention arm are required to detect the non-inferiority margin of 2% with 90% probability (power), where non-inferiority is concluded if the upper endpoint of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in infection rates is less than 2%.  As recommended, both intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses will be done as ITT analysis is typically anticonservative in non-inferiority trials. Target recruitment will be set at 8880 to account for 2% losses to follow up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The PADDI Trial is a large (8,800 patients) international, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel assessment, stratified, non-inferiority safety and effectiveness study. Its purpose is to establish the safety of the administration of 8mg of dexamethasone to adult patients undergoing non-urgent surgical procedures under general anaesthesia of at least two hours duration and requiring at least one nights stay in hospital postoperatively. Patients will be stratified according to whether or not they are known to have diabetes. The primary outcome is the incidence of surgical site infection at 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes include infection at other sites, rate of malignancy recurrence and the incidence of chronic post-surgical pain at one year postoperatively. The influence of diabetic status and the quality of control of diabetes on all outcomes will be specifically explored. </summary>
