  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) including thromboembolic, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), systemic hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactoid events - Incidence and severity of AEs will be monitored throughout the study to assess the safety and tolerability of emcizumab.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Numbers of bleeds over time - To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic administration of emicizumab, the number of bleeds over time will be recorded for all of the enrolled participants. The final analysis will be conducted when all participants have completed 2 years of treatment or have withdrawn, whichever occurs sooner. Participants, or their legally authorized representative, will be asked to report bleed information, including site and type of bleed, time of each individual bleed (day, start and stop time), and treatment for bleed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hemophilia Adult Quality of Life Questionnaire (Haem-A-QoL) (&gt;= 18 y) - The Haem-A-QoL (&gt;= 18 y) was designed for adult participants with hemophilia. It comprises 10 dimensions (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, sports and leisure, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, treatment, future, family planning, and partnerships and sexuality).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hemophilia Quality of Life Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) (12-17 y) - The Haemo-QoL-SF (12-17 y) was designed as a series of age-related questionnaires to measure HRQoL in children and adolescents with hemophilia. This version covers nine dimensions considered relevant for children's HRQoL (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, family, friends, other people, sports, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EuroQoL Five-Dimension-Five Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) - The EQ-5D-5L is a generic, self-reported, preference-based health utility measure that consists of six questions and is used to assess health status and inform pharmacoeconomic evaluations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant preference for the emicizumab regimen compared with the previous regimen, as measured by the EmiPref questionnaire - The EmiPref questionnaire asks participants to specify the treatment they would prefer to continue to receive after receiving treatment with their previous episodic or prophylactic regimen and subcutaneous (SC) emicizumab.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 3</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence and clinical significance of anti-emicizumab antibodies - Immunogenicity will be monitored by incidence and clinical significance of antibodies to emicizumab. For the assessment of anti-FVIII antibodies, functional assays for FVIII inhibitors that utilize a clotting readout (classic Bethesda or Nijmegen assay) cannot be used for participants on emicizumab therapy as emicizumab drives clotting even in the presence of FVIII inhibitors, causing a false-negative test result. After the first dose, local measurement of FVIII inhibitors, if indicated, requires use of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay- (ELISA-) based test or a chromogenic Bethesda assay. At the discretion of the local investigator, any additional urgent request to assess FVIII inhibitors will need to be sent to a central laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ctrough of emicizumab - Ctrough is a measure of plasma concentration of a study drug at the end of of the dosage interval.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, and Week 5, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, at safety follow-up (up to approximately 2 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clearance of emicizumab - Clearance is the rate at which a study drug is removed from the body.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, and Week 5, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, at safety follow-up (up to approximately 2 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Volume of distribution of emicizumab - Volume of distribution is the theoretical volume that would be necessary to contain the total amount of an administered drug at the same concentration that it is observed in the blood plasma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, and Week 5, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, at safety follow-up (up to approximately 2 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of emicizumab - AUC reflects the actual body exposure of a study drug after dosing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, and Week 5, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, at safety follow-up (up to approximately 2 years)</timepoint>

    <summary>This is a phase IIIb, single arm, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of emicizumab in participants with congenital hemophilia A who have documented
      inhibitors against Factor VIII (FVIII) at enrollment. Approximately 200 participants, aged 12
      or older, will be enrolled in this study and are expected to be enrolled at approximately 85
      sites globally. Participants will receive an initial weekly dose of prophylactic emicizumab
      subcutaneously for 4 weeks, followed by a weekly maintenance dose subcutaneously for the
      remainder of the 2-year treatment period.</summary>
