  <interventions>
    <interventions>Thermoregulation bedding (under sheet, over sheet, pillow cover) made of Outlast thermoregulation fabric, with cotton cover; to be used every night for 4 consecutive weeks.
Activity logs, kept by parent or caregiver, will be used to monitor adherence to use of this intervention.
There will be a wash out period of one week, with the child using their own, usual bedding, between use of the intervention bedding and the sham bedding.</interventions>
    <comparator>The sham bedding (undersheet, oversheet, pillowcover) will be made of the same cotton material as the intervention bedding covers, without the thermoregulation material in place. This will be used every night for 4 consecutive weeks.

    <statisticalmethods>Measures of dependant variables (sleep, body temperatures, thermal comfort) will be compared between the bedding intervention and control conditions over consecutive nights and the entire 4 week period using separate two-way repeated-measures ANOVAs. Where a significant interaction effect is found, Bonferronis post-hoc test will be used to determine where the differences lie. Statistical tests will be conducted using SPSS version 17.0 (Chicago, Illinois). All results will be expressed as mean +/- SD. The alpha level will be set at p&lt;0.05.
Measures of childrens and caregivers activity, participation and quality of life will be compared between the bedding intervention and sham conditions using separate Friedman two-way ANOVAs by ranks. These non-parametric statistics will be performed due to the nature of the assessments (ranked scores and categories). Where a significant interaction effect is found, Bonferronis post-hoc test will be used to determine where the differences lie. Statistical tests will be conducted using SPSS version 17.0 (Chicago, Illinois). In addition, the individual % change between control and intervention conditions, as well as the clinical change, measured as change of 2 points in COPM, and as change in scored level in GAS will be examined. All results will be expressed as mean +/- SD. The alpha level will be set at p&lt;0.05.
Because there is currently no reported information on which to base power analysis for number of participants, this has been decided on the basis of clinical samples. A post hoc power analysis will be undertaken of the first 10 participants of the study, to determine if additional subjects and/or time points are required.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) have complex sleep issues and a higher incidence of sleep disturbance than typically developing children. Sleep disturbance has serious impact on their physical and mental health, development, daytime function and well-being, and that of their caregivers. Although management of body temperature is frequently identified as an issue affecting sleep of children with CP, there is no reported information to guide clinical practice in this area.

The primary purpose of this research is to determine the effects of thermoregulation materials which are used to manage body temperature during sleep of children with CP. 

This study will measure the effects of specialised bedding on thermoregulation during sleep of children with CP and will be conducted as an intervention study.  In a cross over randomised design, children with CP who have sleep and thermoregulation problems will be randomly assigned to begin a four week trial period using either the intervention bedding or the control (sham bedding). This will be followed by an immediate reversed sham or thermoregulation intervention period for four weeks. Measures of body temperature, thermal comfort, perspiration, and sleep, will be taken during each phase. Measures of childrens and caregivers activity, participation and quality of life will be taken at the start and at the end of each phase. </summary>
