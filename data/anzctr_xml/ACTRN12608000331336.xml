  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study involved 30 young people, (15 male/15 female), equally divided into three groups: (G1) control, only-stretching group; (G2) stretching group, preceded by heat using short waves diathermy in the origin 
(ischial tuberosity) and insertion (popliteal fossa) of the back thigh muscles (20 minutes); (G3) stretching group, preceded by heat using a cycle ergometer (15 minutes). Every session involved the heat preceding the stretch (except G1, not heated). 10 interventions sessions per subject were made, with the same stretching mode between the groups, to evaluate the influence of the muscle heating by short waves and aerobic activity before the stretching on the back thigh muscles flexibility in the young healthy population. Every stretching was repeated 3 times, with 30 seconds duration and 30 seconds relax between the stretches. The intervention sessions were conducted 5 days per week, with 24 hours interval, during 2 weeks, totaling 10 intervention sessions per subject. The stretches involved static mode, with maximum flexion of the hip joint (limited for the maximum stretching sensation for the subject), knee joit in total extension and the ankle joint in neutral position. The evaluation, heating and stretching procedures (in all subjects) was conducted only in the dominant side of the subject (i.e. if subjects writes with left hand, receive the procedures in the left side; if subjects writes with right hand, receive the procedures in the right side).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is controversy in the literature about the previous heating on the realization of stretching. When heated, the muscles relax and the stretching easier, making the manoeuver more pleasent for the patient, with potentialization on range of motion (ROM) increase, however this is not a consensus. The aim of study, is evaluate the influence of the muscle heating by short waves and aerobic activity before the stretching on the back thigh muscles flexibility in the young healthy population. The study involved 30 young people (15 male/15 female), equally divided into three groups: (G1) control, only-stretching group; (G2) stretching group, preceded by heat using diathermy (20 minutes); (G3) stretching group, preceded by heat using a cycle ergometer (15 minutes); 10 interventions sessions per subject were made, with the same stretching mode between the groups; Every stretching was repeated 3 times, with 30 seconds duration and 30 seconds relax between the stretches. The intervention sessions were conducted 5 days per week, with 24 hours interval, during 2 weeks, totaling 10 intervention sessions per subject. The back thigh muscles flexibility was assessed by the popliteal angle and the extended leg elevation test. The results found was there is no significative statistical differences when the heated groups (by active or passive mode) are compared with the only-stretching group. We concluded the previous heating on the realization of stretching with the effect potentialization goal its not necessary, because its considerably increase the session time and enlarge the expenses with the treatment.</summary>
