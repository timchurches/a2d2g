    <concealment>Potential participants will be assessed by the pre-operative cardiac education nurse for inclusion or exclusion into the study. Following identification for inclusion the pre-op education nurse will randomly remove an envelope from a box provided, this envelope will have an ID Number printed on it  which will become the participants ID No for the study.  Participants will be required to complete the questionnaires inside the envelope and at various stages throughout the study process . Participants will be provided with an information sheet which outlines the studies purpose and aims. Participants will be required to sign a consent form in the presence of the pre-op education nurse who will also witness this form. ID numbers will be used on all documentation and drugs thorughout the trial process to assure anonymity and confidentiality of data. The participant (if in the intervention group) will begin drug (NRT) treatment following surgery and transfer to the cardiac step-down unit (approximately 24 hrs or more following surgery).</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation of participant ID numbers  will be achieved by a computer generated randomisation sequence using Microsoft Excel. The envelopes that contain the questionnaires will have the ID number printed on the exterior. These envelopes will be placed within a box for the cardiac pre-op education nurse to randomly remove during recruitment. The ID number of which has already been randomised to either the control or intervention group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the post operative efficacy and safety of NRT initiated in patients admitted to hospital for coronary artery bypass surgery. We hypothesise that commencing NRT in the immediate post operative phase will be well tolerated by patients, lead to fewer withdrawal symptoms and greater quit rates at 6 months. This pilot randomised control trial is expected to validate the feasibility of conducting a larger scale multi-centre trial that will generate evidence to support the use of NRT as an inpatient initiated secondary prevention strategy in post-operative bypass patients.</summary>
