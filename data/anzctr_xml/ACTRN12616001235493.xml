  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adolescents from the experimental group will take part in obligatory PE classes whose plans will be identical for all of them and will consist of general fitness exercises and music therapy. They will additionally take part in a 24-week dual-task intervention programme and will attend 45-minute training session three times per week, working individually with the same physiotherapists. The programme will comprise dual-task exercises in which on unstable surfaces (stability balls, sensory air cushions and soft mattresses) participants will perform functional tasks consisting of ADLs. All exercises will be accompanied by the physiotherapists verbal instructions about focusing on the task accomplishment, the direction and target of the movement and proper postural control. 
The effectiveness of the applied exercise programme will be assessed by examining the quality of balance and gait. 
Before commencing the intervention (test 1), after 12 weeks (test 2), after another 12 weeks (test 3) and after the 8-week summer holidays (test 4) postural balance will be assessed in all participants of the project on the stabilometric platform Alfa and the quality of gait by means of a BTS G-WALK. All measurements will be performed by the same independent resercher.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with intellectual disabilities have commonly reduced sense of balanced posture. Optimalisation of the quality of life is the superior objective in the process of rehabilitation and that is why our original intervention programme will focus on improving postural stability of the trainees during the work out consisting of ADL-based exercises. The aim of this study is to examine balance and gait in adolescents with moderate intellectual disabilities aged 12-18 years under the influence of a 24-week programme of dual-task functional exercises on unstable surfaces. We would also like to assess static, dynamic balance and gait upon completion of the project.</summary>
