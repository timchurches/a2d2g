Experimental: ChimeriVax-JE - Participants received dose each of saline placebo on Days 0 and 7. On Day 30, participants received vaccinations of ChimeriVax-JE vaccine and saline placebo into different arms.

Active Comparator: JE-VAX® - Participants received 1 dose each of JE-VAX® vaccine on Days 0, 7, and 30, and a dose of saline placebo into a different arm on Day 30.


Other interventions: ChimeriVax-JE
