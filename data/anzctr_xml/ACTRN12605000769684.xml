  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to further evaluate the safety of natalizumab monotherapy by:
i) evaluating the risk of hypersensitivity and immunogenicity following re-exposure to natalizumab</outcome>
      <timepoint>The objective will be analysed at the end of the study by looking at the data from when subjects completed the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to further evaluate the safety of natalizumab monotherapy by:
ii) confirming the safety of switching from IFNb, GA, or other MS therapies to natalizumab.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The objective will be analysed at the end of the study by looking at the data from when subjects completed the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>i) the feasibility of a methodology for early detection and differentiation of PML from MS in subjects who develop new neurological symptoms or signs while on natalizumab therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ii) whether serial blood testing can be used for monitoring the presence of JCV in the MS population</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Must be an MS subject who completed Study C-1801 or C-1802 and completed a Dosing Suspension Safety Evaluation (neurological examination and an MRI scan); must be considered by the Investigator to be free of signs and symptoms suggestive of PML based on medical history, physical examination, or laboratory testing (results from the Dosing Suspension Safety Evaluation from Study C-1808 may be used); must be willing to discontinue and remain free from concomitant immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment (including IFNb and GA) for the duration of the study.</inclusivecriteria>
