  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Halo pin re-tensioning
Treatment: surgery - Placebo Re-tensioning

Placebo Comparator: Control - No fortnightly re-tensioning. Placebo treatment utilises the re-tensioning procedure, pt experiences clicking sensation, however, the pin is not tightened.

Experimental: Treatment (Re-tensioning) Group - Pins are re-tensioned fortnightly back to initial fitting tension of 8lb/inch.


Treatment: surgery: Halo pin re-tensioning
Re-tensiong every 2 weeks with torque driver. Pins are re-tensioned to 8lb/inch

Treatment: surgery: Placebo Re-tensioning
Pts undergo re-tensioning procedure with torque driver set at zero to elicit the same clicking sensation with no tightening of the pin.
