  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo a standard hip replacement procedure. The MACNAV system will be used to align the acetabular cup into the acetabulum using an electronic module which can be programmed to the surgeons pre-defined angles of inclination and angulation. The femoral component will be implanted using standard techniques. The device is used during initial implant only and is anticipated to take no more than an additional 5 minutes of operation time.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard operative technique for implanting the acetabular component. Standard operating techniques include impacting the acetabular cup using other navigation systems or no navigation i.e. by hand where the surgeon estimates the correct angles, however, may vary depending on the surgeon.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acetabular cup position. Cup positioning will be evaluated by post operative CT scan examination by one blinded radiographer (blinded to treatment).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post procedure follow-up visit. Scheduling of this visit may occur anytime between 2 and 6 weeks post procedure and will be a single follow-up visit only.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of acetabular cups implanted within 10 degrees of the optimal angle (defined by each surgeon). Cup positioning will be evaluated by post operative CT scan examination by one blinded radiographer (blinded to treatment).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post procedure follow-up visit. Scheduling of this visit may occur anytime between 2 and 6 weeks post procedure and will be a single follow-up visit only.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse event rates. Adverse event rate that may occur with this type of surgery include infection and deep vein thrombosis. Adverse event rates will compared between control and active (MACNAV groups) and to those rates commonly seen in hip replacement surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between surgery and 6 months post surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Surgical feedback regarding ease of use of the system. The surgeon will be asked to complete a tailored questionnaire to assess this outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to assist surgeons in aligning the acetabular cup in the acetabulum. By having a better alignment there is a potential for a reduction in post operative complications such as hip dislocation, and loosening of the prosthesis. The study hopes to show that by using the navigation device, surgeons are able to align the device with more accuracy than by using standard operative techniques.</summary>
