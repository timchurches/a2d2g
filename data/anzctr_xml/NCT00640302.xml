  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in patients
      who have a clinical diagnosis of pandemic influenza infection. The study is observational
      only. The primary measure used in this study will be mortality. Symptom severity and
      duration, treatment limiting side effects, demographic information and resistance will also
      be examined. This project will commence upon pandemic influenza being declared in Australia,
      Hong Kong or Singapore. Data will be analysed as quickly as possible to help inform the
      continued use of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy as a cornerstone of the public health agency
      response to pandemic influenza.</summary>
