  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised, controlled, cross-over (Latin square) designed trial will be performed to investigate the acute effects of apples (rich in flavonoids) and green leafy vegetables such as spinach(rich in nitrate) on nitric oxide status, blood pressure, endothelial function and cognitive function. 

Each participant will complete 4 visits (one treatment at each visit) one week apart in random order. The 4 treatments are: 
1. Apple puree containing the apple skin (high flavonoid [~100 mg]) + spinach (high nitrate [~200 mg]) 
2. Apple puree containing the apple skin (high flavonoid [~100 mg]) + no spinach (low nitrate [0 mg]) 
3. Apple puree without the apple skin (low flavonoid [&lt; 5 mg]) + spinach (high nitrate [~200 mg]) 
4. Apple puree without the apple skin (low flavonoid [&lt; 5 mg]) + no spinach (low nitrate [0 mg]) 

Prior to each visit participants will be asked to consume a standard low flavonoid, low nitrate meal for breakfast. With each breakfast the participants will consume either: 1. Apple puree with apple skins (for treatments 1 and 2 above); or 2. Apple puree without apple skins (for treatments 3 and 4 above). 

Participants will then attend the School of Medicine and Pharmacology Research Unit at Royal Perth Hospital where they will be provided with lunch consisting of a low flavonoid, low nitrate sandwich with one of the treatments. The total energy intake at each lunch will be the same: energy from the salad will be matched with rice milk (for treatments 2 and 4 only).</interventions>

      <timepoint>Plasma measurements performed at 2.5 hours after lunch.
Urinary measurements performed in a single 8 hour urine collection. (This is a single 8 hour urine collection which begins just prior to the breakfast meal and is completed late afternoon. The collection is a pooled collection so that individual spot urine sampels will not be analysed separately.)

Salivary measurements performed at 1.5 hours after lunch.</timepoint>

    <concealment>The treatment order for eligible individuals will be randomly assigned using computer generated random numbers. The treatment order allocation will be sealed in numbered envelopes. The envelopes will be used for randomisation by opening an envelope, in consecutive order, as participants are entered into the study. The envelopes will be held by an independent person within the University of Western Australia. The study coordinator will contact the independent person to obtain the next available envelope once an individual is deemed eligible. The envelope will be opened and the code will be recorded.</concealment>
