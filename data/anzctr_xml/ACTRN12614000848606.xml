  <interventions>
    <interventions>A package of activities for early detection of deterioration:
1.            Two-hour Theoretical and bedside practical training sessions to ward staff individually or in small groups by an ICU hospital trainer covering interpretation of vital signs trends for earlier identification of deterioration will be delivered over a 4-week period.
2.            One-week practical demonstrations by a trained facilitator in the use of a patient-worn mobile device and remote visual display for their introduction on the wards. This will include demonstrations and practice on the technical aspects; troubleshooting; interpretation of data shown on the screen; and application of the mobile device on all consenting newly admitted patients in the target wards following a protocol.
3.            Installation of hardware on nurses station for remote visual displays on the wards, and introduction of the mobile devices (recording heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, skin temperature and ECG) applied to patient's wrist and chest. Each newly admitted patient to wear the mobile monitor day and night including during sleep for the first three days or until discharge if this occurs earlier. Patient recruitment over  2 years or less if sample size recruited earlier.
4.            Technical support, refresher training as required and adherence monitoring by a group trained as super trainers
5.            Verbal and written information provided to patients at the time of recruitment on the device purpose, instruction on alerting nurses on alarms and potential benefits of continuous monitoring  

Overal duration of intervention: 2-month 5 weeks clinical and technical training followed by two years of monitoring device implementation. </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care of spot-checks of vital signs (3 times/day) using routine electronic ward equipment as per hospital policy.

Two control groups will be used to compare outcomes with the intervention groups: 
1- Patients in same target wards before the intervention (matched by age-sex and ICD chapter for primary diagnosis) 2- Patients in other hospital general wards hospitalised during the study period and matched by age-sex.</comparator>

    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATES:
Based on 2013 data for the target wards, length of stay is 8-12 days in the target wards and transfers to ICU occur in 14%-21% of patients receiving a rapid response call. A sample of 264 patients in each ward (and corresponding controls from other hospital wards) will give us 80% power at the 0.05 significance level to detect: (a) an absolute reduction of 7%  in ICU transfers and (b) a reduction of 2 days in length of stay. If feasible depending on recruitment pace, a larger sample will be recruited to detect smaller impacts. 


ANALYSIS
The effect of the intervention will be presented as the odds ratio (OR with 95% confidence intervals).

Differences in estimates between hospital wards will use the Mantel-Haenszel test and paired comparisons (before-after) within wards will use the McNemars test. The null hypotheses will be evaluated as 2-sided significance level of 0.05. Multivariable random effects logistic regression models will be used for predictor analysis, i.e. the binary  outcome variable in model would be unplanned transfer to ICU.

Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve  will be used as a tools to measure the performance of the device by testing several thresholds to select the optimal model and discard suboptimal thresholds for triggering the use of the rapid response team service and for predicting outcomes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Vigilance with Vital Signs Study  aims to establish a system for early identification of high-risk patients through the continuous electronic monitoring of vital signs (respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, ECG and oxygen saturation) to trigger a response and prevent adverse events in general wards. Our hypothesis is that a continuous monitoring system including clinical training, the mobile device and pre-defined alarm thresholds can reduce adverse events,deaths and unplanned admissions to intensive care by detecting earlier deterioration and prompting earlier intervention by ward staff. </summary>
