  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised to standard treatment, Low Dose Ara-C, versus one of four alternative novel treatment approaches. The available treatment arms are thus:

Arm1: Low dose Ara-C and AC220 (quizartinib)
Arm 2: Low dose Ara-C combined with ganetespib
Arm 3: Low dose Ara-C combined with tosedostat
Arm 4: Low dose Ara-C + Selinexor 
Arm 5: Low dose Ara-C combined with Lenalidomide

During the course of the Programme other novel therapies (Drug X) are expected to become available, and will be considered for inclusion in this comparison.

The current treatment arm available in Australia is Arm 3: Low Dose Ara-C combined with Tosedostat. 

Arm 1: Low Dose Ara-C and AC220 (Quizartinib)

Ara-C 20 mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection daily on days 1-10 (20 doses) to be repeated at 28 to 42 day intervals. In some patients it may be necessary to extend the intervals to up to 42 days. A minimum of 4 courses should be administered. If it is considered appropriate, further courses can be administered (with no limit to the number given). 

AC220 will be taken in a dose of 90mg (three 30mg tablets or oral solution) orally, daily for 21 consecutive days commencing on day 1 of each Low dose Ara-C treatment.

Arm 2: Low dose Ara-C combined with Ganetespib

Ara-C 20 mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection daily on days 1-10 (20 doses) to be repeated at 28 to 42 day intervals. In some patients it may be necessary to extend the intervals to up to 42 days. A minimum of 4 courses should be administered. If it is considered appropriate, further courses can be administered (with no limit to the number given). 

The dose of ganetespib (120mg/m2) will be given as a 1 hour intravenous infusion commencing on day 1 of each Low dose Ara-C treatment, irrespective of when each course of the Low dose Ara-C is started. This will be repeated on days 8, 15, 22 and 29 of each Low dose Ara-C course. Four courses will be given at 4 to 6 week intervals.

Arm 3: Low Dose Ara-C combined with Tosedostat 

Ara-C 20 mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection daily on days 1-10 (20 doses) to be repeated at 28 to 42 day intervals. In some patients it may be necessary to extend the intervals to up to 42 days. A minimum of 4 courses should be administered. If it is considered appropriate, further courses can be administered (with no limit to the number given). 

Tosedostat will be taken in a dose of 120mg (2 capsules) orally once a day with a glass of water after food, preferably in the morning at about the same time every day to ensure an even dose interval. Treatment should commence on day 1 of the first course of Low dose Ara-C and continue daily for 6 months. Patients may stay on treatment if they are deriving benefit.

Arm 4: Low Dose Ara-C and Selinexor

Ara-C 20 mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection daily on days 1-10 (20 doses) to be repeated at 28 to 42 day intervals. In some patients it may be necessary to extend the intervals to up to 42 days. A minimum of 4 courses should be administered. If it is considered appropriate, further courses can be administered (with no limit to the number given). 

For each course of Low Dose Ara-C, selinexor dosing will take place on days 1 &amp; 3 of each week between Low Dose Ara-C courses. The dose of Selinexor will be 30mg/m2, starting at day 12, where day 1 is the first day of Low Dose Ara-C. Four courses of Low Dose Ara-C + Selinexor are intended. The interval between the courses can vary, but it is intended that Selinexor will be given on 2 days per week for each week between Low Dose Ara-C. On completion of the Low Dose Ara-C courses Selinexor will continue once weekly at 40 mg/m2 to be given on the same day each week. The aim is to give 6 months of maintenance treatment but patients will be permitted to continue if it is thought that they are deriving benefit.

Arm 5: Low dose Ara-C combined with Lenalidomide

Ara-C 20 mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection daily on days 1-10 (20 doses) to be repeated at 28 to 42 day intervals. In some patients it may be necessary to extend the intervals to up to 42 days. A minimum of 4 courses should be administered. If it is considered appropriate, further courses can be administered (with no limit to the number given). 

Lenalidomide is administered orally once daily in a flat 10mg dose for 21 days, where day 1 is day 1 of LD Ara-C. This course will be repeated after a 2 week rest period and continue for four courses. Patients who are considered to be benefiting after having received the planned four courses i.e. continue in remission or have stable disease, should continue to receive treatment until disease progression in the following schedule:
- Low dose Ara-C + lenalidomide at 4-6 weekly intervals, or
- Lenalidomide only, at 4 weekly intervals, if patient has experienced significant Low dose Ara-C toxicity (equivalent to ongoing grade 3 haematological toxicity)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess a number of new treatments over time. The aim is to continue to improve treatment by comparing a number of new drugs which have shown some benefit in early stage trials with the existing standard treatment. The current treatment option which will be tested in Australia is standard treatment, low dose Cytarabine alone compared with standard treatment, low dose Cytarabine in combination with Tosedostat in elderly patients with either acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 60 years or over and have been diagnosed with AML or MDS. You must have received no previous treatment for AML.

Trial details

Additional experimental treatments may be added or removed from the study as further information becomes available. The current treatment option which will be tested in Australia is standard treatment, low dose Cytarabine alone compared with standard treatment, low dose Cytarabine in combination with Tosedostat in elderly patients with either acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

All participants in this trial will undergo chemotherapy for four cycles. Participants will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will receive the  together  subcutaneous injections of low dose cytarabine  together with Tosedostat tablets in a dose of 120mg (2 capsules) orally once a day with a glass of water after food, preferably in the morning at about the same time every day to ensure an even dose interval. Treatment should commence on day 1 of the first course of Low dose Ara-C and continue daily for 6 months. Patients may stay on treatment if they are deriving benefit.  The other group will receive low dose cytarabine by subcutaneous injection alone. Participants will be assessed at regular timepoints until the end of the trial to determine the safety and clinical benefit of tosedostat treatment in combination with low dose cytarabine, compared to the current effective treatment of low dose cytarabine alone.

Treatment Duration will be a minimum of 4 courses between 28 and 42 days each. 

This Phase II/III study will: 

Investigate the survival benefit, the rate of remission and safety of the patients allocated to each group and compare the groups to each other
