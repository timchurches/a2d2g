  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Apixaban
Treatment: drugs - Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA)
Treatment: drugs - Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)

Experimental: Apixaban - Children aged 2 to &lt; 18 years of age randomized to the apixaban arm of the study weighing less than 35 kg will be administered apixaban 0.14 mg/kg twice daily (BID) with the 0.4 mg/ml oral solution.
Children aged 2 to &lt; 18 years of age randomized to the apixaban arm of the study weighing greater than or equal to 35 kg will be administered apixaban 5 mg BID as a tablet. Children randomized to the apixaban arm of the study weighing greater than or equal to 35 kg who cannot swallow the tablet or prefer to take the solution will receive 12.5 ml of the 0.4 mg/ml oral solution BID.
The apixaban solution (0.4 mg/mL) or tablets (5 mg) will be administered BID orally or by nasogastric/gastric tube at a fixed dose, with no monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) or anti-Xa level required to adjust dose.

Active Comparator: LMWH/VKA - The standard-of-care (SOC), vitamin K antagonist (VKA), or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) will comprise the active comparator group. VKA or LMWH will either be commercial products labeled as per country requirements and provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb or sourced locally according to the SOC. Dose regimen and monitoring for VKA (including INR control) and LMWH will follow the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 2012 guideline for thromboembolism (TE) prophylaxis.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A composite of adjudicated major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding events per the Perinatal and Paediatric Haemostasis Subcommittee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria - Major bleeding is defined as bleeding that satisfies one or more of the following criteria:
fatal bleeding
clinically overt bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 20 g/L (ie, 2 g/dL) in a 24 hour period
bleeding that is retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial, or otherwise involves the central nervous system
bleeding that requires surgical intervention in an operating suite, including interventional radiology
CRNM bleeding is defined as bleeding which satisfies one or both of the following criteria:
overt bleeding for which blood product is administered and that is not directly attributable to the subject's underlying medical condition
bleeding that requires medical or surgical intervention to restore hemostasis, other than in an operating room</outcome>
