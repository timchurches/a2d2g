  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine  (given twice a day for 3 days) and artesunate-amodiaquine (given daily for 3 days) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Doses of artemether-lumefantrine  (20/120) will be administered according to the recommended weight bands as follows: 1 tablet to those weighing 5 to 14kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg;3 tablets for 25 to34 kg and 4 tablets for equal or greater than 35 kg. For the artesunate-amodiaquine, 4 mg/kg artesunate and 10 mg/kg amodiaquine will be give daily. The treatment will be given in tablets by oral under direct supervision. Eligible subjects will be treated for three days and followed up for 28 days. </interventions>

Patients aged between 6 month and 12 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with either artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine and monitored for 28 days. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations.

    <designfeatures>Patients will be enrolled sequentially to the two drugs: they will enrolled first in the artesunate+amodiaquine until the sample size is reached and subsequent patients will be enrolled in the artemether+lumefantrine.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>As the treatment failure rate to artemether+lumefantrine and artesunate+amodiaquine in the area is 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 10%, a minimum of 50 patients must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 60 patients per test drug will be included in the study.
Analysis of data
The WHO Excel software programs last version will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artesunate+amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum in Lambarene Gabon.
Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of the first-line and second-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria.
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate+amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.
Study Sites: study will be conducted in Lambarene in Gabon. 
Study Period: The study will be conducted from December 2016 to July 2017.
Study Design: A one arm prospective study for each drug combination. The patients will be assigned to the drugs sequentially.
Patient population: Febrile patients aged 6 months to 12 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection will be enrolled.
Sample Size: 60 patients per drug. 
Treatments and follow-up: artesunate+amodiaquine (daily dose for 3 days) and artemether+lumefantrine (twice daily for 3 days) will be given. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined.
Secondary endpoints: 
1. The frequency of adverse events.
2. Frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13)
