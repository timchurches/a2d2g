  <interventions>
    <interventions>Heel lifts (experimental group): participants randomised to the heel lift group will be provided with three pairs of Clearly adjustable [Registered Trademark] heel lift shoe inserts at the baseline assessment. The heel lifts are 12 mm in height and made from a firm multi-layered vinyl that conforms to the shape of the foot. Three sizes are available (small, medium or large) and will be issued according to the participants' shoe size. The heel lifts are commercially available and will be covered with an 3.2 mm PPT [Registered Trademark] with an Ultralux top cover to maximise comfort and adherence. Participants will be advised to wear the heel lifts as much as possible during the study (12 weeks). A handout containing instructions about the heel lifts will also be provided to participants. 

Both groups will receive a modified activity program where participants will be allowed to continue with the activities that they normally have been doing provided that the amount of pain they experience in the Achilles tendon(s) does not exceed level 5 on a pain scale, where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst pain imaginable - during the exercise/activity. The pain after activity is allowed to reach 5 on the pain scale but should have subsided by the following morning.  During activity, if the pain in the Achilles tendon increases to 6 or more on a pain scale, the participant will need to reduce their activity (if possible) so that it is less then level 6 on a pain scale.

Adherence to the intervention will be measured at 2, 6 and 12 weeks, where participants will provide information regarding the average number of hours per day and number of days they have worn the heel lifts in the last 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively. </interventions>
    <comparator>Exercise program: participants randomised to the calf muscle eccentric exercise group will perform a rehabilitation therapy program for the duration of the study (12 weeks). 

Participants will be instructed to do calf muscle eccentric exercise 2 times daily, 7 days/week, for 12 weeks. Two types of calf muscle eccentric exercise will be used. The calf muscle will be eccentrically loaded both with the knee straight and, to maximise the activation of the soleus muscle, also with the knee bent. Each of the two exercises will include 15 repetitions performed in 3 sets (3 sets of 15 repetitions). Participants with bilateral Achilles tendinopathy will be instructed to perform the eccentric exercise on both lower limbs. The participants will be told to go ahead with the exercise even if they experience pain. However, they will be advised to stop the exercise if the pain becomes disabling. When the exercise can be completed with no pain or discomfort, participants will progress to use of a back-pack with 5 kg of weight. 

Both groups will receive a modified activity program where participants will be allowed to continue with the activities that they normally have been doing provided that the amount of pain they experience in the Achilles tendon(s) does not exceed level 5 on a pain scale, where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst pain imaginable - during the exercise/activity. The pain after activity is allowed to reach 5 on the pain scale but should have subsided by the following morning.  During activity, if the pain in the Achilles tendon increases to 6 or more on a pain scale, the participant will need to reduce their activity (if possible) so that it is less then level 6 on a pain scale.

During the baseline assessment, participants will be instructed to perform the exercises correctly and this will be reviewed at 2 weeks. A handout containing instructions about the exercises will also be provided to participants in addition to a link to a video demonstrating the correct procedure. Adherence to the intervention will be measured at 2, 6 and 12 weeks, where participants will provide information regarding the average number of days per week they have performed their exercises during the past 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed using the most recent version of SPSS version using the intention-to-treat principle for all randomised participants. In participants with bilateral symptoms, the more painful side will be analysed (or the right lower limb if they cannot define the more painful side) to maintain independence of data. Multiple imputation will be used to replace any missing data using five iterations, with sex, age, baseline scores, and group allocation as predictors. The exception will be for the variables use of rescue medication, adherence, adverse events, co-interventions, Achilles tendon structure and global change in symptoms where no data substitution will be applied. Standard tests to assess continuous data for normal distribution will be used and transformation carried out if required. Differences in the primary and secondary outcome measures between the two groups will be compared. Continuous-scaled outcome measures will be analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline scores, and intervention group entered as independent variables. Dichotomous-scaled outcome measures will be compared using relative risk, risk difference, and number needed to treat. Both 95% confidence intervals and p-values will be generated where appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this research project is to compare the effectiveness of heel lift shoe inserts versus rehabilitation therapy (calf muscle eccentric exercise) for the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy. 

This study is a parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial with a 12 week follow-up.  Participants will be randomised to receive treatment with heel lift shoe inserts (Clearly Adjustable®) or a calf muscle eccentric exercise program.

Primary and secondary measures will be collected at baseline and at 2, 6 and 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the total score of the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment - Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire. Secondary measures will include Achilles tendon structure (assessed using ultrasound imaging), calf muscle function, self-reported global change in symptoms, severity of pain at the Achilles tendon during the previous week, self-reported physical activity, health-related quality of life, as well as use of paracetamol rescue medication and co-interventions.</summary>
