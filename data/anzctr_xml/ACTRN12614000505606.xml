  <interventions>
    <interventions> The cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program for the sensation of breathlessness (BREVE) was developed as a sequential series of eight modules (one hour for each of the eight weeks of the comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program (CPRP).  Each week participants attended a group session facilitated by a psychologist, supported by a program manual.  Each weeks module included a brief educational component (15 minutes presentation maximum), discussion of a key concept, individual reflective activity, and explanation of homework tasks including examples / demonstration and clarification of the task to be practiced during the supervised exercise sessions for the week. The psychologist also attended the supervised exercise sessions in order to coach individuals while breathless in key tasks and techniques relevant to each module.

Each week of the standard eight week CPRP included two , one hour group exercise sessions supervised  by a physiotherapist (circuit training; only one supervised session in week 8) and two hours of knowledge-based group education provided by  a variety of health professionals (physiotherapist, psychologist, occupational therapist, respiratory nurse, and dietician) . Participants were also encouraged to exercise daily at home (walking program). The total number of face to face sessions for the CPRP was 31 (16 education and 15 exercise sessions).

The cognitive behavioural therapy program commenced in the first week of the eight week comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program. 

The BREVE program manual included specific sections for recording activities completed within the group class and for completion of homework tasks.</interventions>

For both groups (BREVE pilot and historical control) the comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program and health professionals (physiotherapist, psychologist, occupational therapist, respiratory nurse, and dietician) were the same.  

The fifty eight participants with COPD in the historical control group   completed the comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program at the Repatriation General Hospital, Adelaide in 2006/2007.</comparator>

The sensation of dyspnoea was assessed at rest using a structured interview which records descriptors volunteered by subjects in their own words (Williams et al 2010) and the best three descriptors selected from a pre-existing list of breathlessness descriptors (Mahler et al 1996).

    <statisticalmethods>For primary outcomes, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess within-group intervention effects (pre to post) and differences in intervention effects between groups (BREVE pilot or control). Effect sizes were calculated (Cohens d). For secondary outcomes, McNemars test was used to assess proportional changes within each descriptor category for the pilot and control groups  and percentage of participants who changed or did not change descriptors within each category calculated. Responses were collated for the feedback form and analysed descriptively for both categorical and opened ended text based items. Categorical options were collapsed into agree or disagree.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, psychological interventions usually target generalised anxiety and depression rather than the sensation of breathlessness. The objectives of this pilot study were to develop and implement a cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) program specific to the perceptual experience of breathlessness, estimate any beneficial effect of combining the CBT program with comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation and identify any practical issues in the study protocol. </summary>
