  <interventions>
    <interventions>Healthy Babies Infant-centered feeding from birth - 1 year old. Intervention implemented through 6 in-home lessons before infant is 6 months old
In-home lesson content for infant-centered feeding involves - interpreting hunger and satiety cues and introduction to solid foods
Duration of lessons - 60-80 minutes
Sessions occur weekly or monthly form birth to 6 months of age (based on age of infant at enrollment)
Mode of Administration - Lessons are taught be trained paraprofessional nutrition instructors</interventions>
    <comparator>Healthy Families - Active control 
Standard treatment of 6 in-home nutrition lessons
Duration of Lessons - 60-80 minutes

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infant weight/length - standardized measurements will be done according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines.  An infant's weight will be obtained with a scale measuring mass to the nearest ounce, a recumbent length will be used where the infant will be lying down on a flat surface and measurement taken from the top of the infant's head to heel and measured in inches.  A z score will be computed for the infant's weight-for-length plotted over time.  Categories will be created according to CDC age/sex-specific growth charts, normal (5th through 84th percentile) versus not normal (either below 5th or above 85th or higher of weight-for-length)</outcome>

    <summary>Healthy Babies
The goal of this research study is implementation of a relationship skill-building and educational intervention, Healthy Babies (HB) through Infant-Centered Feeding that promotes the development of healthy infant feeding and grwoth through mothers' engagement in infant-centered feeding.  objectives are to evaluate effectiveness of the Healthy Babies intervention in the development of infant-centered feeding (defined as maternal responsiveness, feeding style, and feeding practices) as infants transition to solid foods, and infant growth.  Healthy Babies, implemented be trained nutrition paraprofessional instrutors, consist of 6 lessona and 3 telephone  contact.  we expect intervention participants will demonstrate greater increases over time in responsiveness and infant-centered feeding style and feeding practices compared to control participants.  The long-term goal of this study is to improve low-income, at risk infants' nutrition and health by addressing childhood obesity through effective intervention promoting the development of healthy eating habits at an early age.</summary>
