  <interventions>
    <interventions>Uncemented Oxford Medial Unicompartmental knee replacement involves replacement of the arthritic medial compartment of the knee with an uncemented metal tray on the medial tibial plateau, an uncemented metal replacement of the medial femoral condylar articular cartilage, and a layer of mobile polyethylene inserted between the 2 components. The duration of the operation will vary, but will be in the vicinity of 60 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Total knee joint replacement with patellar resurfacing involves removal of the cartilage surfaces of the femur and the tibia at the knee, and their replacement with metal, cemented to bone, and a layer of polyethylene in between. This operation is the most commonly used procedure for arthritis of the knee, and is the standard of care. The duration of the operation is typically about 80 minutes.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients evaluated in clinic for anteromedial knee osteoarthritis meeting the above criteria will be provided with verbal and written information about the study, and offered participation. Patients who wish to enrol in the study will be asked to sign a consent form. On the day of surgery a sealed envelope will be opened allocating patients to either unicompartmental knee arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty. The patient will not be informed of their allocation, and a standardised skin incision will be used for both patient groups.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arthritis of the inner part of the knee is common. The most commonly used surgical treatment for this condition is total knee joint replacement. This is effective, however a knee replacement is inferior in function to the non-arthritic knee. An alternative to total knee replacement is replacement of the inner part of the knee only, thus preserving the non-arthritic parts of the knee (termed a unicompartmental replacement). Possible advantages of this include more normal motion and feeling of the knee after surgery. Possible disadvantages include durability inferior to total knee replacement. There have been few good studies comparing the 2 alternatives. This study aims to compare patient satisfaction and durability of unicompartmental knee replacement and total knee replacement.</summary>
