  <interventions>
    <interventions>GEM OS2 is applied to the bone void(s) and is contained within the fracture void(s) it physically fills bone defects providing a biocompatible, osteoconductive scaffold for new bone formation and promoting
cellular ingrowth into the osseous defect. 
This device is composed of two components: a beta
tricalcium phosphate (ß-TCP) / collagen matrix, and becaplermin, which is a highly purified recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF-BB).-derived growth factor (rhPDGF-BB). The GEM OS2 device is supplied as a single use kit, with sterile individual components of ß-
TCP/collagen matrix and a separate syringe containing a solution of rhPDGF-BB (becaplermin).
At the time of surgery, the clinician fully saturates the ß-TCP/collagen matrix with the rhPDGF BB solution. After mixing, the hydrated graft will have a putty consistency which may be injected percutaneously, or manually packed into the osseous defect dependent on the method of fixation. As this device is surgically implanted it will remain and be taken up by the body as the fracture heals.  

The GEM OS2 device is supplied as a two component kit.  Each kit consists of:  one (1) brick containing 3 cc of b-TCP/ collagen; and, one (1) syringe containing 3 mL solution of 0.3 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB (becaplermin) in sodium acetate buffer.  When combined there is a total of 0.9 mg rhPDGF-BB in the 3 mL that may be implanted at the fracture site.  It has been estimated that each patient will receive approximately 1mL at minimum and no more than 3 mL at maximum which equates to 0.3mg rhPDGF-BB at minimum and no more than 0.9mg rhPDGF-BB at maximum.</interventions>
    <comparator>All subjects will be treated by percutaneous reduction, minimally invasive or non-invasive fixation techniques, including casting, external fixation, external fixation with percutaneous pins. Only the patients randomised to the GEM OS2 group will receive the bone filler.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Grip strength will be assessed with three measures averaged using a Jamar
Dynamometer (Bechtol et al, 1954). The grip strength score will be the ratio of the grip strength of the injured side to that of the uninjured side.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measurements will be made at all posttreatment after permanent removal of the cast. (Weeks 6, 9, 12 and 24)</timepoint>

      <outcome>Range of Motion: Measurement: 
Movement of the wrist (flexion/extension, pronation/supination, radial/ulnar
deviation) will be measured using a goniometer.
Determinations of both active and passive range of motion will be made. Movement of the unaffected wrist will be taken as the normal range for each subject.</outcome>

Consent Form specific to this study prior to enrollment

    <concealment>Enrollment in the study begins at the time written consent is obtained. The Investigator is responsible for verifying that the subject meets all inclusion and has none of the exclusion criteria prior to randomisation of the subject.  Each clinical site will be provided with a set of sealed randomisation envelopes containing the treatment assignment.  The randomisation schedule will be determined electronically under the supervision of a statistician. The The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups in a 1:1 ratio: Group I: GEM OS2 or Group II: No bone graft material. Randomization assignments will not be re-used in the event that the subject withdraws from the study prior to treatment, or becomes an intra-operative treatment failure. It is suggested that randomization occur within 48 hours of the scheduled surgery.</concealment>
