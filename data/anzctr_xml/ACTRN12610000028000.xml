  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>cancer. We are recruiting patients with a known primary cancer of the following types: lymphoma, lung, gastrointestinal tumours, genitourinary tumours, hepatocellular cancer, breast, nasopharyngeal cancers). Adjustment for cancer type in the statisticall analysis will be  done by including cancer type in the regression model.</healthcondition>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>We are registering the first part of the research program which is an observational phase where differences in outcome between patients with at least one short allele of the 5HTT gene are compared to patients with long aleles. Patients will be observed for two years. Assessment of response rate, progression-free survival, quality of life outcomes and overall survival will be conducted at baseline, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. A planned  second stage is an interventional stage where patients with at least one short allele are randomised to an intervention arm that starts their treatment with a concurrent comprehensive psychiatric care program and a control arm that receives standard treatment (without the psychiatric intervention)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to progression will be the primary endpoint, where progression is defined as one or more of the following: death attributable to cancer, appearance of new lesions, unequivocal increase in size of existing lesions, persistent elevation in levels of tumour markers. Decline in performance status or increase in tumour-related symptoms are not going to be accepted as indicators of progression unless supported by objective evidence of tumour progression obtained by radiological and/or laboratory assessment.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>objective response rate at 6 months , 1 year and 2 years measured according to Response Evaluation criteria for solid tumours (RECIST) criteria. At baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized according to RECIST criteria as follows: "measurable (lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension [longest diameter to be recorded] as  20 mm with conventional techniques or as  10 mm with spiral computerized tomographic scan) or non-measurable (all other lesions, including small lesions [longest diameter &lt;20 mm with conventional techniques or &lt;10 mm with spiral computerized tomographic  scan] and truly non-measurable lesions). Lesions considered to be truly non- measurable include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/ pulmonis, and cystic lesions."  All measurements will be recorded in metric notation. Baseline assessment will be performed as close as possible to the start of treatment. Patients with non-measurable disease, or who develop non measurable or truly non-measurable lesions subsequently over the two years of follow up, will be recorded as such for the purpose of statistical analysis. For those non-measurable lesions in which response to treatment cannot be mapped to the RECIST response criteria either by complete disappearance or obvious progression, response will be recorded as non measurable for the purpose of analysis.  
     The same method of assessment and the same technique will be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Methods of assessment will be:
-Clinical examination
-Computerized Tomography (CT) scan
-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
-Tumour marker level 
    The method of assessment used for each patient will be the method that is clinically appropriate for the patient's condition, type of cancer and tumour site(s). This is to avoid, from the ethical perspective, exposing the patient to investigational procedures that would not normally be part of their clinical follow up protocol. For the same reason, patients who are assessed at baseline with endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures will be considered ineligible unless preoperative CT/MRI evaluation is available and their clinical follow up plan includes further evaluation with CT or MRI. This is because it will be difficult, on ethical grounds, to justify the repeat endoscopy/laparoscopy at the 6 month , 1 year and 2 year follow up points.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cancer patients with curable/controllable disease who deteriorate without clinically detectable physical cause have led researchers to investigate the relation between depression and cancer progression. Studies showed an association between depression and cancer outcomes as decreased compliance, decreased desire for life-sustaining treatment and increased mortality. Lab studies show that neurotransmitters are capable of altering immune function  whereas  immune-derived mediators regulate neuroendocrine and autonomic outflow from the brain. Host cellular defenses against cancer involve immune mediated mechanisms that can be influenced by neurotransmitter activity. Caspi et al demonstrated that polymorphism of the 5-HTT gene explains why some individuals develop psychological morbidities on exposure to stressful life events while others exposed to the same conditions don't. This offers a screening criterion for identifying patients at risk for psychological morbidity that might be detrimental to their treatment outcome and may be used as a prognostic indicator in which case, starting anti-cancer treatment of this group of patients with concurrent psychological intervention may improve their treatment outcomes. AIM: To study the role of 5HTT gene as a prognostic indicator in cancer and its utilization for clinical selection of patients for concurrent psychotherapy with anticancer treatment. METHOD: A longitudinal observational study in which cancer outcomes are compared in two independent cohorts of cancer patients grouped by 5HTT genotype (patients with two long alleles versus those with at least one short allele). OUTCOMES: Primary outcome measure is progression free survival. Secondary outcomes are response to treatment, functional and psychological status of the patient as expressed by Quality of Life (QOL) measurement using FACT-G questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, and overall survival.</summary>
