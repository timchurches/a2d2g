      <outcome>Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Area Under the Curve (AUC) (0-3h) Response on Day 169. - FEV1 AUC(0-3h) was calculated as the area under the FEV1- time curve from 0 to 3 h post-dose using the trapezoidal rule, divided by the duration (3 h) to report in litres. FEV1 AUC(0-3h) response was defined as FEV1 AUC(0-3h) minus baseline FEV1. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 2 pre-dose measurements performed 1 h and 10 min prior to administration of the first dose at visit 2 (day 1).
The adjusted means (SE) were obtained from fitting an Mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed effects of treatment, planned test day, treatment-by-test day interaction, baseline and baseline-by-test day interaction, patient as random effect, and spatial power covariance structure for within-patient errors and Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom. Number of participants analyzed are the number of patients contributing to the MMRM model in each treatment group.</outcome>

      <outcome>Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score on Day 169 From the Two Twin Trials, Present 1237.5 (NCT01431274) and 1237.6 (NCT01431287) - The SGRQ is designed to measure health impairment in patients with COPD. It is divided into 2 parts: part 1 produces the symptoms score, and part 2 the activity and impacts scores. A total score is also produced. Each subscale score is the sum of the weights for the items in the subscale as a percent of the sum of the weights for a patient in the worst possible condition. The total score uses the same calculation except that the weights are summed over the entire questionnaire. The individual subscales as well as the total score can range from 0 to 100 with a lower score denoting a better health status. Number of participants analyzed are the number of patients contributing to the mixed effect repeated measures model (MMRM) in each treatment group.</outcome>

The Mahler Dyspnoea questionnaire is an instrument which measures change from the baseline state The TDI focal score was used to measure the effect of Tio+Olo FDC on patients' dyspnoea after 24 weeks of treatment (Day 169). The focal score is the sum of the subscale scores for Functional Impairment, Magnitude of Effort and Magnitude of Task. Scores for each subscale range from -3 to 3 so that the Focal score ranges from -9 to 9. For all subscale scores and the Focal score a higher value indicates a better outcome. Number of participants analyzed are the number of patients contributing to the mixed effect repeated measures model (MMRM) in each treatment group.</outcome>

FVC AUC(0-12h) response was defined as FVC AUC(0-12h) minus baseline FVC. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 2 pre-dose measurements performed 1 h and 10 min prior to administration of the first dose at visit 2 (day 1).
The adjusted mean (SE) were obtained from fitting an ANCOVA model with categorical effect of treatment and baseline as covariate. Number of participants analyzed are the number of patients contributing to the ANCOVA model in each treatment group.</outcome>

It is divided into 2 parts: part 1 produces the symptoms score, and part 2 the activity and impacts scores. A total score is also produced. Each subscale score is the sum of the weights for the items in the subscale as a percent of the sum of the weights for a patient in the worst possible condition. The total score uses the same calculation except that the weights are summed over the entire questionnaire. The individual subscales as well as the total score can range from 0 to 100 with a lower score denoting a better health status. Number of participants analyzed are the number of patients contributing to the mixed effect repeated measures model (MMRM) in each treatment group.</outcome>

The Mahler Dyspnoea questionnaire is an instrument which measures change from the baseline state The TDI focal score was used to measure the effect of Tio+Olo FDC on patients' dyspnoea after 24 weeks of treatment (Day 169). The focal score is the sum of the subscale scores for Functional Impairment, Magnitude of Effort and Magnitude of Task. Scores for each subscale range from -3 to 3 so that the Focal score ranges from -9 to 9. For all subscale scores and the Focal score a higher value indicates a better outcome.
