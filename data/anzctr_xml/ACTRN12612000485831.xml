  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tamsulosin is currently prescribed for the symptoms associated with a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia. In lay terms this is known as an enlarged prostate (benign). This condition is common in men over the age of 70. The condition can become symptomatic (meaning that symptoms appear) with urinary tract infections and signs of obstruction (of the urine pathway) reported. Symptoms are reported in about 10-30% of men aged in the early 70s. 
Tamsulosin is currently prescribed for these symptoms. An oral capsule containing tamsulosin has been approved in Australia and other countries and has been on the Australian market for several years.  The tablet is taken daily by patients. The current study will test the safety and effectiveness of administering tamsulosin by an alternative method  a patch will be applied once to the skin and is designed to provide 7 days of doses. This patch is called a transdermal delivery system (TDS).</summary>
