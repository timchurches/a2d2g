  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group is the 'continuous infusion" group. This group will receive  250 mg of erythromycin in 50 ml of saline as a continuous intravenous infusion (2ml/hr) and in addition, intermittent single dose infusion of 50 ml of saline (placebo) every 8 hours. This will be given with single dose metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously every 8 hours. The criteria for stopping the infusion are: A. Home team decides to stop. B. Patient / Family wishes to stop. C. QTc &gt; 500 msec. D. Diarrhoea (as defined by more than 3 loose bowel stool a day). E. After 7 days of treatment. All the medications which will be given to the patients will be logged in the patient chart.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive continuous intravenous infusion of 2 ml/hr of saline and in addition, intermittent single dose infusion of 125 mg erythromycin in 50 ml saline every 8 hours, as per unit protocol. This will be given with single dose metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously every 8 hours. The criteria for stopping the infusion are: A. Home team decides to stop. B. Patient / Family wishes to stop. C. QTc &gt; 500 msec. D. Diarrhoea (as defined by more than 3 loose bowel stool a day). E. After 7 days of treatment.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is feeding tolerance, as assessed by proportion of participants with Gastric Residual Volume equal or less than 250 ml. This is measured every 4 hours, by the patient's nurse aspirates the nasogastric tube and measuring the total volume.   </outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary time point is assessed every 4 hours for the duration of erythromycin/placebo administration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients who experience QT prolongation, assessed by 12 hourly ECG.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 12 hours by ECG, up to 7 days, or termination of the infusion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A report of vomiting by the treating team / patient's nurse.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any time after the commencement of the infusion and up to stopping the infusion. This will be until day 7, if the infusion wouldn't have been stopped before.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The median and mean of the erythromycin plasma levels, as assessed by specific assay. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Three blood samples will be taken 30 minutes after the first 50 ml intermittent  infusion, at 8 hours just before the next 50 ml intermittent  infusion and at 24 hours just before the fourth 50 ml intermittent  infusion.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients whom admitted to the intensive care unit commonly suffer from feeding intolerability. This can cause malnutrition and even increase their chances of dying.
Erythromycin which is a kind of antibiotics has been shown that in low doses it can induce feeding tolerance, by acting on a specific targets in the stomach and gut.
This study is intended to research whether a continuous infusion of lower dose of erythromycin is better than intermittent administration of the drug.    </summary>
