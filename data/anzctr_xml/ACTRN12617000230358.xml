  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective randomized controlled study. The population to be included as part of this study will be patients already undergoing (having had cycles previously) or about to commence fertility treatment for the first time at Westmead Fertility Centre. 
This study will focus on the oocytes collected from these women following ovarian hyperstimulation, which is part of a normal treatment cycle. We will only analyse oocytes from women who have greater than or equal to 8 eggs collected (so that eggs can be randomly assigned to the two different culture pH treatment groups).
Patients undergoing either IVF (in vitro fertilisation) or ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) treatment cycles will be considered for this study. The treatment route (IVF vs. ICSI) is predefined in accordance with the Westmead Fertility Centre protocol, and based on a series of tests (semen analyses etc.) before entering into the study.
The duration of participation is relatively brief as it will be within their treatment cycle, from the point of egg collection that the study commences, and runs until the fertilisation check (approximately 16-19 hours later). 
For participants undergoing an IVF cycle, their eggs (in the form of cumulus-oocyte-complexes) will be washed and split evenly between two separate dishes containing different pH G-IVF labelled with A and B. pH of solution A is 7.3 and pH of solution B is 7.45
The eggs will be maintained in the incubator at 37 degrees centigrade and 5 percent CO2 (as standard) until insemination with her partners sperm 3-4 hours after egg collection.
Insemination will be using 100,000 sperm (as standard) overnight in the incubator. Fertilisation check will be carried out early morning the next day. Results will be recorded in the WFC database initially, then transferred to the results table for this study.
For participants undergoing an ICSI cycle, the process differs slightly. After egg collection oocytes will be denuded of their surrounding cumulus cells (as standard), split evenly into two separate dishes containing different pH G-IVF labelled A and B (pH of solution A is 7.3 and pH of solution B is 7.45) and left in the incubator at 37 degrees centigrade and 5 percent CO2 for 1 hour to rest (as standard).
After 1 hour, oocytes from dish A will be transferred into ICSI dish A (containing GMOPS media of the same pH, solution A is 7.3 and pH of solution B is 7.45), the spindle will first be visualised and its retardance measured using the Oosight polarised light microscope, before being injected with the partner sperm. The eggs will then be transferred back to a new dish A containing GIVF of the same pH. The same process will be repeated for dish B oocytes. The same embryologist will carry out the ICSI for type A and B eggs.
The eggs will then be placed in the incubator overnight to allow for fertilisation. Fertilisation check will be carried out early morning the next day. Results will be recorded in the WFC database initially, then transferred to the results table for this study.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be the eggs from the patient which are placed in solution A, as this is at pH 7.3, and the standard pH of media used in our clinic. The eggs which are placed in solution B will act as the treatment group, with the results being compared to those from solution A.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of eggs fertilised in solution A (control group) will be compared with the number of eggs fertilised in solution B (treatment group). Fertilisation will be compared by positively identifying the presence of two pronuclei inside the egg the day after it has been exposed to sperm (either via in vitro fertilisation or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection).</outcome>
      <timepoint>16-19hrs post exposure to partner sperm</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The fertilised eggs will be kept in the lab for upto 5 days for pre-implantation development before they are transferred back to the patients uterus. 
The eggs which were fertilised in solution A (control) will be kept separately from the eggs fertilised in solution B (treatment group) throughout the pre-implantation development period. Embryo grading will be performed on all embryos on the day of transfer (as standard) this could be day 2, 3 or 5 of embryo development. Grades will be recorded per embryo to allow for retrospective analysis to understand if pH at the time of fertilisation has an impact on embryo quality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Embryo grades are awarded on the day of embryo transfer - this may be either 2, 3 or 5 days after fertilisation has taken place (routine practice). The grade will be recorded in the patient notes and then transferred to our secure database.
Embryo grading is carried out using the Gardner Scoring System, which is used universally to score embryos.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>For IVF cases, allocation is not concealed as the eggs will be split evenly between solution A (control) and solution B (treatment). In cases where there is an odd number of eggs the embryologist will randomly decide whether the extra egg goes in solution A or B.
For ICSI cases, allocation concealment will be applied when the embryologist has to divide the eggs into either solution A (control) or solution B (treatment pH). Eggs will be washed first and all placed together in a single dish, eggs will then be denuded using hyaluronic acid (as per standard treatment).
After denudation eggs will be randomly split into dish A or dish B based on the number of MII (mature). 
MI eggs (not yet mature) will be assigned a number from a random generator (www.random.org) and if an even number is generated then they will be assigned to dish A, if odd then dish B. From this point eggs will remain either A or B and left for one hour in the incubator prior to injection with partner sperm.
ICSI will be carried out in either an A or B dish, with eggs being transferred to either an A or B GIVF dish for incubation overnight to allow for fertilisation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is being undertaken to test the hypothesis that the pH of the media used to hold human eggs during IVF treatment can impact fertilisation rates
We propose that pH has a profound effect on the assembly and functioning of a component of the egg called the spindle. We have already demonstrated this in mice.
We believe that incorrect spindle function can cause lower than expected fertilisation rates, and should fertilisation occur the resulting embryo is of poorer quality. Therefore if pH can effect the spindle, it could have an effect on overall fertilisation. 	
This has significant relevance for the culture systems utilised in IVF clinics worldwide.
pH is the term used to describe the balance of acidity (+) and alkalinity (-) of a liquid. The pH scale is from 1-14. If a liquid produces more hydrogen (H+) it is an acid, if it produces more hydroxide (OH-) it is an alkaline. 
A liquid with a low pH value (less than 7) has lots of hydrogen and is described as acidic, an example of an acidic liquid is lemon juice.
A liquid with a high pH value (more than 7) has lots of hydroxide and is described as alkaline, an example of an alkaline substance is bleach or most cleaning products.
A liquid which has an equal amount of hydrogen and hydroxide is described as neutral, with a pH of 7. Pure water is usually neutral.
The pH inside the human body varies, however the pH of the environment in the ovaries and reproductive tract is slightly alkaline. This is the usual pH of the liquid in which we keep eggs in when they are outside the body. 
In our laboratory we use media and products from a company called Vitrolife. We will be investigating 2 of their solutions which have been specially manufactured by Vitrolife to be at 2 distinctly different pHs  one at pH 7.2 (the normal pH used in our laboratory), the other will be pH 7.4 (this level is used by some other clinics around the world). 
We intend to determine which is the optimum pH level to give us the highest rates of fertilisation so that we can try and achieve better results for our patients in the future.
