  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves providing relatively small, intermittent incentives in the form of points exchangeable for gift vouchers, offered over a 4-month period, to participants who successfully increase their physical activity or decrease their sitting time. Participants will be awarded one point per minute (capped at 30 points/day) of physical activity, and one point per minute (capped at 30 points/day) reduction of sitting time. Weight reduction is NOT a points incentive in this study but rather will be monitored as an outcome. Incentives are supplemented with a one-on-one motivational interview with a member of the research staff, for around 20 minutes duration, focused on goal-setting and addressing barriers at intervention commencement; and weekly SMS text messages providing encouragement/support. Participants also receive a Fitbit One device and Bluetooth weighing scales.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on our previous physical activity studies, a sample of 80 adults was calculated to provide 80% power at a=0.05 to detect an effect size in the primary outcome, physical activity duration, of at least 0.3 (equivalent to 60 minutes of physical activity/week, an increase that is feasible but significant in this initially sedentary sample), allowing for up to 10% attrition over the 4-month study period. Study effects will be evaluated using t-tests and regression models predicting change in key outcomes from pre- to post-test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to test the feasibility and effectiveness of incentives for promoting increased physical activity, decreased sedentary behaviour, and improvements in heart health risk factors among adults. We hypothesised that an intervention involving relatively small, intermittent incentives in the form of points exchangeable for gift vouchers, offered over a 4-month period, and supplemented by an initial motivational interview and regular motivational text (mobile-phone SMS) messages, will lead to significant increases in time spent in physical activity; decreases in time spent in sedentary behaviours; and decreases in BMI and blood pressure, among middle-aged (40-65 year old) adults.  Participants receive one point per minute, capped at 30 minutes per day, for engaging in physical activity; and one point per minute, also capped at 30 minutes per day, for reducing their sedentary time. Physical activity and sedentary time are monitored using a Fitbit One device provided to participants and linked to a purpose-designed study website that records points. </summary>
