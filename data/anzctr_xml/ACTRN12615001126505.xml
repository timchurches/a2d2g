  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers will be inoculated intravenously on Day 0 of the study with 3 x 10^6 purified human red blood cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum 7G8.  One hour after inoculation they will commence doxycycline treatment which will be administered under direct supervision (in the study clinic) as a single capsule (100mg of doxycycline) daily for 7 days.  This will be undertaken in one group (n=3)..  

Blood will be drawn at set time points: every day from D1-D8 and every four days after that until D28, to measure parasite densities in the blood using quantitative PCR. If there is any evidence of a developing malaria infection, the individual will immediately commence standard anti-malarial treatment with Riamet.  

Duration and dosage of Riamet (if required) Riamet tablets: Artemether (20mg) and Lumefantrine (120mg): 4 tablets orally as a single dose twice a day with fatty food at time 0, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 60 hours, making a total of 24 tablets in 6 doses.  These doses will be administered under direct supervision in the study clinic.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study involves examining the persistence and immunogenicity of P. falciparum 7G8 blood stage parasites following commencement of anti-malarial treatment with doxycycline.  Participants will receive a single inoculum of purified malaria parasites followed one hour later by commencement of doxycycline treatment.  Following this, we will measure the level of parasites in the blood-stream of the participants.  We will also be assessing the way the immune system responds to the inoculum and the safety and tolerability of the inoculum.  Characterising the persistence, immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of the malaria parasite following commencement of doxycycline treatment is important as this data may contribute to the development of novel malaria vaccine strategies.    </summary>
