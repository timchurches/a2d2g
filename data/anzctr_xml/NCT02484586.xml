Other: Presbyope group - 40 years and over with a reading add.
Control lens: Etafilcon A, Nelfilcon A, Nesofilcon A, Somofilcon A, 58% Poly-HEMA
Test lens: Etafilcon A
Up to 10 prototype contact lens designs and at least 1 commercially available contact lens designs will be worn by each participant for up to a week on a daily disposable modality. Participants will attend separate fitting and assessment visits for each lens type (Fitting Visit on Day 1, and Assessment Visit as late as Day 7, but may be as early as 6 hours after the Fitting Visit). There will be a minimum 1 night washout period between lens designs, i.e. after an assessment visit but before the next fitting visit.

Other: Non-Presbyope group - 18-39 years with no reading add.
Control lens: Etafilcon A, Nelfilcon A, Omafilcon A
Test lens: Etafilcon A
Up to 10 prototype contact lens designs and at least 1 commercially available contact lens designs will be worn by participants for up to a week on a daily disposable modality.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual acuity on a LogMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) scale - For each lens, visual acuity will be measured at distance with a computerised LogMAR chart and at near with a near LogMAR chart. Data will be summarised as means +/- standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Visual acuity will be compared between each lens design and control lens types. The significance of lens design will be determined for each visit.
Repeated effects linear mixed model with subject random intercepts or paired t tests will be employed for the analysis of visual acuity. Analysis will be performed within each study arm namely presbyopes and non-presbyopes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 1 week after lens fitting</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective rating of vision on a 1-10 visual analogue scale - For each lens, subjective ratings of vision will be assessed with a questionnaire based on a 1 to 10 scale in steps of 1. The questionnaire has been designed specifically for this study. Data will be summarised as means +/- standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Subjective ratings will be compared between each lens design and control lens types. The significance of lens design will be determined for each visit. Repeated effects linear mixed model with subject random intercepts or paired t tests will be employed for the analysis of subjective ratings. Analysis will be performed within each study arm namely presbyopes and non-presbyopes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 1 week after lens fitting</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by
             signing a record of informed consent.

          -  Be at least 18 years old, male or female.

          -  Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by
             the Investigator.

          -  Have ocular health findings considered to be "normal" and which would not prevent the
             participant from safely wearing contact lenses.

          -  Is correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses.

          -  Be suitable and willing to wear contact lenses.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>70</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or
             disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens
             fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.

          -  Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves
             disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis,
             Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic
             hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.

          -  Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment.
             Ocular medication can be prescribed during the course of the trial as per standard
             optometric practice.

          -  Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter
             normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participant's ocular health /
             physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at
             enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. Note: Systemic antihistamines are allowed
             on an "as needed basis", provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial
             and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.

          -  Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.

          -  Previous corneal refractive surgery.

          -  Contraindications to contact lens wear.

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.</exclusivecriteria>
