  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: People of Asian descent are at much greater risk of poor metabolic health and diabetes at a younger age and a lower body weight than those of European Caucasian descent. The reason why some individuals are more susceptible than others and what controls their diabetes risk may lie in the storage of body fat, and may be identified through early changes in serum metabolite profile. Gaining even small amounts of body weight can lead to the fat spilling over from adipose tissue and into important organs such as the muscle, liver and pancreas, which in turn may significantly increase risk of disease. Often known as the TOFI profile  Thin on the Outside, Fat on the Inside  people who appear ostensibly slim and/or mildly overweight can develop diabetes whilst those who are very overweight and/or obese may not. Few predictive biomarkers of early diabetes risk and propensity to susceptibility or resilience have yet been determined.
Objective: To investigate diabetic risk profile, susceptibility and resilience to weight gain and increasing adiposity in a population of overweight Asian Chinese  and overweight Caucasian adults; using body composition and metabolomic techniques.
Design: This is a cross-sectional study, 400 participants, aged 18-70 years, of Asian Chinese (n=200) or Caucasian European (n=200) ethnicity. A fasting blood sample will be collected to assess diabetic profile based on HbA1c concentration, and also for untargeted metabolomics profiling; whole body and segmental fat free mass and adipose tissue fat mass will be measured on a single occasion using DEXA scanning; and in a subset of ~50 individuals ectopic lipid storage in key organs including liver, pancreas and muscle will be measured using MRI.
Findings: This is a program conducted within the National Science Challenge High Value Nutrition (HVN) program which aims to determine novel prediabetic biomarkers which, in future studies may be shown to be responsive to nutrition intervention.
