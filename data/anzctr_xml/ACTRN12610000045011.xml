  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent evidence shows an ethnic variability in tolerance of anticancer drugs between Asian and Caucasian breast cancer patients. Pharmacogenetic differences in drug metabolising enzymes have been proposed as the cause of these differences, however they have not been associated with altered cytotoxic drug pharmacokinetics (PK). Other possible explanations include differences in dietary/concomitant medicine intake and inflammatory status. The aim of this study was to investigate inter-ethnic differences in cytotoxic drug metabolism, inflammatory/nutritional status, genotype and outcomes between Asian and Caucasian breast cancer patients.</summary>
