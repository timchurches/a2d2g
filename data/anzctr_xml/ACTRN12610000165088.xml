  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Green Prescription (GrX) programme is designed to increase the uptake of physical activity among individuals with physically-limiting medical conditions.  A script (GrX) prepared by general practitioners or practice nurses is faxed to Regional Sports Trust GrX teams to typically provide  advice and support around increasing physical activity and improving nutrition.  In this research the GrX is delivered by a GrX kaiwhakahaere/support person based at Sport Waikato.  This person helps and supports the participant to set and achieve small achieveable goals with the GrX kaiwhakahaere through contact once a month for six months. The contact time is typically less than a hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be randomised within ethnicity and sex (Maori or European; male or female)  to receive either the kanohi-ki-te-kanohi (face-to-face) or telephone intervention.  At baseline, six month and one year measurements will be made. Effectiveness of each intervention will be measured by reported uptake of physical activity, fitness, reduction in waist circumference and weight loss as well as glucose homeostasis. The outcomes will be examined in terms of treatment, ethnicity and sex. Qualitative information will undergo thematic analysis and explore attitudes, behaviours and motivational factors to physical activity uptake by ethnicity and gender in the context of quantitative outcomes. Case studies and testimonials will be used to enrich the information and triangulate the findings.</comparator>
