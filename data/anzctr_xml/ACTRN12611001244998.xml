    <interventions>One arm propective evaluation with artesunate+sulfadoxine+ pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Eligible subjects will be treated with artesunate+sulfadoxine+pyrimethamine. All patients will be followed up for 28 days.

Dose regimen: 
artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine tablets: artesunate 4 mg/kg body weight per day for 3 days plus a single dose of sulfadoxine 25/1.25 pyrimethamine mg/kg body weight.
All treatment will be orally taken tablets.</interventions>

Enrolled patients will be assessed for parasitological (using microscopy), clinical responses during the 28 days follow-up and treatment outcomes will be classified according to the latest WHO protocol (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241597531/en/index.html).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% of adverse events (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache and dizziness) in the artesunate+sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine treated patients. All patients will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form.</outcome>

    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and a parent/guardian consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment doses will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in four sites of Pakistan.

Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in Somalia to assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate+ sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The participants will be febrile people aged between 6 months and 60 years except female minors aged 12-17 and umarreied women aged 18 years and above. Patients will be treated with tesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine once a day over 3 consecutive days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Pakistan in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum.</summary>
