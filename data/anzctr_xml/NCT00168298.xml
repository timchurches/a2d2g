  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Patients With 15 or More Letter Improvement in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved. The numbers of patients with at least a 15 or more letter improvement in BCVA in the study eye are presented.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 180</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Retinal Thickness in the Study Eye - Retinal thickness is assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the study eye. The retina is the light-sensitive part of the eye. OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system providing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 90, Day 180</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a Change From Baseline in BCVA by Category - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved. Data are grouped into the following 5 categories based on change from baseline: =15 Letters Improvement, =5 and &lt;15 Letters Improvement, No Change (Between -5 to +5 Letters), =5 and &lt;15 Letters Worsening, and =15 Letters Worsening.</outcome>
