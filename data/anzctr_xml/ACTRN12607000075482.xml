  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomized in a double-blind fashion by the pharmacys central randomization service at The Repatriation General Hospital.
Each patient will be randomized to receive either a once-daily single 20mg KapanolTM capsule for 4 days followed 4 days of a once-daily single placebo capsule or vice versa.  Patients will also receive 1-2 coloxyl with sennaTM tablets daily as prophylactic measure against constipation. Patients will be instructed that they can adjust the quantity and type of laxative according to response and preference.  Medications will be dispensed from the central pharmacy according to the blinded randomization scheme.
Patients may continue any other ongoing dyspnoea management program that has been prescribed for them prior to entering the study, including oxygen, physical therapy, and non-opioid medications.
Since the steady state of five-times Tmax will be reached at 45-60 hours, the maintenance of the study drug for four days will allow sufficient washout time.  Analysis will be on days 4 and 8 of the study.
Patients will be reviewed by the study investigators at randomisation, at the cross-over point, and at completion of the study (i.e. Days 0, 4, and 8).  In addition, patients will be contacted by phone every 2 days when they are not seen by study investigators (i.e. Days 2 and 6) to follow their progress on the study and to monitor for adverse reactions.
 At the completion of the study or if the patient withdraws early, the patient will revert to their previously prescribed dyspnoea management program as they were receiving prior to beginning of the study.</interventions>

    <concealment>The study will be explained verbally and in writing, and will require the written consent of the involved individual.  This will happen within 72 hours of identifying a potentially eligible patient.  If, after the study has been explained, the patient later decides not to participate, they can withdraw with no detriment to his/her care. Once enrolled, patient Id number will be supplied to the central pharmacy for treatment allocation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sometimes drugs such as morphine help people who have severe lung disease feel less breathless when the course of the disease cannot be treated.  Although morphine is frequently prescribed, there are limited data to quantify the benefit in this setting.  There is growing evidence that different causes of breathlessness can lead to a variety of uncomfortable sensations (for example, feeling tight vs. feeling suffocating).   Because of the recent availability of once daily morphine capsules, we are now able to do this important study and answer questions that will affect the quality of life of tens of thousands of people.</summary>
