  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a randomised controlled trial that aims to examine the efficacy of an
      established online bulletin board for depression. It has been estimated that millions of
      people worldwide use peer-to-peer bulletin boards, forums or internet support groups (ISGs)
      for health conditions. However, little is known about the effectiveness of these groups in
      terms of symptom reduction or improvement in quality of life. The current project
      investigates the effectiveness of an established online bulletin board for depression
      available to the public. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial of
      the effectiveness of a pre-existing, well-established online bulletin board for depression in
      the community. The aims of the project are to determine whether the bulletin board improves
      mental health, quality of life, and related outcomes among members of the community with high
      levels of self-reported psychological distress and previous history or current experience of
      depression.</summary>
