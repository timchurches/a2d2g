  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Sham control
Treatment: drugs - Ranibizumab

Experimental: Ranibizumab - A 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injection was given to the study eye at baseline, and then as needed based on evidence of disease activity.

Sham Comparator: Sham control - Sham injection was given to the study eye at baseline, and then treatment was given based on evidence of disease activity. At month 1, if treatment was needed, sham was administered. At month 2, participants switched to open-label ranibizumab on an as needed basis.


Other interventions: Sham control
The sham vial did not contain active drug (empty sterile vial). The sham injection was an imitation of an intravitreal injection using an injection syringe without a needle touching the eye.

Treatment: drugs: Ranibizumab
Ranibizumab 0.5mg/0.5mL was administered intravitreally to the participant.
