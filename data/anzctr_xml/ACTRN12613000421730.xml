  <interventions>
    <interventions>The currently used device name is the KineSpring PEEK System.  The device is a permanent implant that is fixed on the femoral and tibial components of the knee.  The implant is achieved in a single surgery (which should take approximately two hours) and left permanently in place.  Each subject will undergo a surgical procedure to implant a permanent knee support device that is and alternative to traditional surgeries to treat osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.</interventions>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on all patients enrolled and implanted with the KineSpring PEEK System.  The efficacy analysis will be based on a repeated measures model that will be used to test for treatment efficacy, as quantified by the WOMAC LK 3.1 Section A pain subscore over 26 weeks (6 months).  

Missing efficacy data will be imputed using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.  

The primary efficacy analysis may be repeated on the Per-Protocol Population, which will exclude all patients with major protocol violations. 

The safety analyses will be performed on the safety populations defined as all patients who undergo the KineSpring PEEK System implant procedure.  Treatment  emergent AEs will be summarized and categorized by severity and relation to the study procedures.  If a patient has more than 1 occurrence of the same AE, he/she will be counted only once within that category in the summary tables.  The most severe occurrence of an AE, as well as the most extreme relationship of the AE to the study device or implant procedure will be indicated in cases of multiple occurrences of the same AE.  All AEs will be presented in a listing.  Additionally listing of serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs leading to discontinuation will be generated. 

The number of anticipated and unanticipated adverse events that occur in the study population will be tabulated and summarized.  In addition, the incidence of all types of adverse events will be reviewed during the course of the study for any indications that use of device confers any unanticipated significant risk. 

The null hypothesis is that there will be no change in WOMAC pain scores from Baseline (pre-op) to Week 26.  The alternative hypothesis is that WOMAC pain scores will be improved (reduced) at Week 26 compared to Baseline.

Preliminary data from a previous study (OAKS) showed improvements from baseline WOMAC pain scores ranging from 26.8 to 36.4 from 6 Weeks to 12 months after treatment.  Standard deviations of those improvement scores ranged from 17.3 to 21.6.  Conservatively assuming pain score improvement (Mu) of 26 with a standard deviation (Dev) of 22, a two-sided alpha level (Alpha) of 0.05 and a beta level (Beta) of 0.10 (90% power), sample size was calculated using the usual formula

		N = (tAlpha + tBeta)^2 x Dev^2 / Mu^2

with t scores rather than the more usual Z scores because of the relatively small sample size required.  Because t scores depend on sample size, an iterative recalculation procedure was necessary.  Based on these calculations, a sample size of 10 patients was required.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a multi-center, prospective, openlabel, safety/efficacy study enrolling up to 10 patients. Safety and efficacy are the primary objectives based on analysis of reported and observed adverse events and the WOMAC validated OA questionnaire (pain component). A series of validated subject-completed questionnaires, a visual analogue scale for pain and formal orthopaedic examination, will be performed over the course of the 60 months at the following intervals: baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6, 12, 18, 24,36, 48 and 60 months. X-ray data will be collected pre-operatively and the following post operative intervals 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.</summary>
