  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether acupuncture can reduce symptoms of lymphoedema (chronic swelling) in women recovering from breast cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and have had chronic swelling (lymphoedema) on one arm present for at least 6 months following treatment for breast cancer. Trial details Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive 12 acupuncture treatments over a period of 8 weeks in a schedule of twice weekly for four weeks then once weekly for four weeks. Participants in the other group will continue to receive their usual care and will not undergo any acupuncture treatment. Participants will be assessed at regular intervals to determine how lymphoedema is affected by acupuncture over a course of treatment. This study will also determine the feasibility and safety of acupuncture.</summary>
