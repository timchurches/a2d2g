  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a small simple pilot study to identify any practical and acceptability issues with conducting this kind of trial which aims to replicate the trial design of Morgan et al published in the New England Journal of medicine in 2004, which found a significant reduction in asthma symptoms days by reducing allergen levels in the home enviromnet through allergen avoidance measures that were tailored to the child's skin prick test status.  In New Zealand we have a somewhat different prevalence of the kinds of allergens found in the United States and we have a much higher prevalence of childhood asthma, hence it is important to pilot the Morgan study design in the New Zealand setting before undertaking a full study.</summary>
