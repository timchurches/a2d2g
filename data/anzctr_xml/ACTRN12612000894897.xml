  <interventions>
    <interventions>Provision of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program consisting of rehabilitation medicine, occupational therapy and physiotherapy. 
Twice daily therapy with one group therapy session and one individual therapy session as well as three weekly case  conferences to discuss the rehabilitation as well as discharge plan.
Rehabilitation medicine component provides coordination and medical review of rehabilitation program for each patient.   
Daily group therapy session; duration 45-60 minutes (dependent on the length of time patient takes to perform activities and number of patients in the group);  maximum of 7 total sessions per patient. Facilitated by Occupational therapist (OT), Physiotherapist (PT) and allied health assistant (OT and PT are part of investigational team).The execution of the sessions is aided by an allied health assistant, who is not a member of the investigative team.
Daily individual treatment sessions provided by PT in addition to the group session and OT intervention as indicated by individual patient needs. Duration 30minutes with a total 7 sessions per patient.
Occupational Therapy provides assessment and treatment of deficits in activity performance and participation. Treatment is individualized  to specific patient needs and may included such things as dressing retraining or energy conservation. Treatment includes an ADL activity practice component in the daily group therapy session.
Physiotherapy provides assessment and treatment of of deficits in activity performance and participation.  The treatment is individualized to specific patient needs but will include balance, strengthening and gait retraining during the group session. Individual treatment sessions are comprised of gait retraining, mobility assessment, stair practice and general strengthening. A individual exercise program is provided to each patient to perform independently.</interventions>
    <comparator>Provision of standard care which involves physiotherapy treatment and occupational therapy treatment as directed by the treating team. Patient receive one individual physiotherapy session daily, which may include mobility practice, stair practice or strengthening exercises. Length of session varies from 10-15 minutes (dependent on therapist judgement).
Occupational therapy assessment and treatment is initiated by the treating team and usually involves assessment and discharge planning, equipment prescription and home visits as needed. Length of session will be individualized to patient requirements. Discharge planning by treating team. Most patients will be referred to inpatient subacute rehabilitation. Standard treatment is coordinated by different groups in different wards and patients get various levels of therapy (nil occupational therapy, physiotherapy treatment daily or second daily) waiting for a subacute rehabilitation bed.</comparator>

    <concealment>Rehabilitation Coordinator will receive referrals via email, pager, phone or in ward meetings from allied health, nursing or medical teams. Patients will then be screened by the rehabilitation coordinator or rehab physician as to their suitablility to SMART in acordance to standing SMART inclusion criteria.
Recruitment:
All patients referred to the SMART program will be  considered potential participants.Once identified as suitable for SMART the research project officer will be visiting the patient to recruit patients and complete baseline data collection (FIM, TUG, MMSE)

ENROLMENT PROCEDURE
The participant will be enrolled into the study after the informed consent process has been completed and the participant has met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  The physcian or coordinator enrolling the patient are unaware, when this decision is made, to which group the patient will be allocated.  Central Randomization schedule is performed via computer by staff affiliated with the northern sydney clinical school and provided to investagatory team in sealed opaque envelopes at central administration site.
The participant will receive a study enrolment number and this will be documented in the participantâ€™s medical record and on all study documents. 
INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS
Written informed consent will be gained from the potential participant during the recruitment process. The research project officer will provide written and verbal information on the study and obtain consent from participant or his/her guardian as appropriate. The patient will be provided with a copy of the signed consent form and the original consent form will be kept in the researchers department. 
For participants with an appointed guardian/enduring guardian written informed consent will be obtained from the  legally appointed person.</concealment>
    <sequence>RANDOMISATION PROCEDURE
Randomization will be computer generated .
The participant will be randomized prior to move to ward 8D after they have met the inclusion criteria and provided consent to study.  At that point in time the participant will be randomised to Intervention group or Control group, and receive a Randomisation Number allocated by a computer.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research project is to investigate the efficacy and benefits of an in-reach multi disciplinary rehabilitation program. Patients will be assessed for egibility to attend rehab program by rehabilitation coordinator or rehab physician after referral received via medical/surgical teams. This will be done in accordance with SMART inclusion/ referral criteria. Research Project officer will enroll patients in study, complete informed consent and perform baseline data assessments. 
Participants will then be randomized into intervention and control group via a computer generated program.
Intervention group will receive rehabililtation on ward 8D and the intervention group will receive standard care on any acute ward within RNSH.
Functional measures will  be conducetd by the research project officer in both control and intervention group at 7 day post enrollment or prior to discharge if this should be earlier.
Hypothesis: Provision of a short term multi-disciplinary acute rehabilitation program to patients in acute care will lead to reduced length of stay, improved mobility and ADL function as well as improved quality of life.</summary>
