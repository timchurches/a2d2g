    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated using G*Power and a total of 88 subjects was required for a 90% power and an alpha of 5% for the T test.
Based on the known prevalence of osteoporosis, a total of 150 women aged 55 to 70 years (for phase 1) will be sought after. Amongst these women, 100 women (allowing for 10% dropout) would be selected based on their bone health status. We will therefore have 50 women with poor bone health and 50 healthy women which will be enrolled for Phase 2. 

Statistical analyses will be carried out using SAS statistical software. The Schofield equation will be used to calculate the metabolic rate. The ratio of energy intake (EI) to basal metabolic rate (BMR) will be used to evaluate relative accuracy of reported energy intake using the Goldberg cut-off. The ratio EI:BMR as defined by WHO/FAO/UNU:- 1.27 for minimum survival level, 1.56 for sedentary level and 2.0-2.4 for maximum sustainable lifestyle level will be used to compare the degree of underreporting and overreporting in the subjects. 
Factor analysis will be used to derive dietary patterns which will be based on the weight of food consumed in grams (summing of intakes) by factor loadings using the principal component analysis method and orthogonal transformation (varimax rotation) from the food intake data (3-day diet record and FFQ) to facilitate interpretability. A criteria of eigenvalues will be used for the factor analysis. 
Factors will be divided into quintiles; sample means and frequencies will be calculated. Any association will be adjusted for age, height, smoking, physical activity, education and energy intake. Any correlations with the dependent variables will be calculated using partial correlation coefficients. A P value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered as significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoporosis is a health problem in the elderly with hip and spine fractures occurring commonly after the age of 70. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk factor for osteoporosis, with early detection allowing precautionary measures. There are many modifiable factors that increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures including diet, physical activity, hormones, alcohol intake, smoking and body weight. 

The primary purpose of the study is 
1. To determine the pattern of diet of women in the age group between 55-70 years.	
2. To assess the relationship between patterns of diet and diverse gut microbiome in this group of female volunteers with or without low bone mass.
3. To determine the diversity and density of the gut community.
4. To evaluate the relationship between patterns of diet and rate of inflammation. 

Study hypothesis
1.	Individuals with characteristic dietary patterns will be associated with similar/particular gut bacteria, for example, high fat (high LDL-c) and sugar dietary patterns.
2.	The regular consumption of certain diets, for example, Mediterranean-style diets will indicate a desirable bone health status in this age group.
3.	Individuals identified as having high fat and sugary diets will have an increased inflammation compared to a high fibre dietary pattern.
