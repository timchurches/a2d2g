    <concealment>Patients will be randomised to active or placebo groups with stratification for sex. Recruitment into mild CKD will be limited to 20 (one third) using allocation concealment. The person who will determine if a subject is eligible for inclusion in the trial will be unaware, when this decision is made, to which group the subject will be allocated. Allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who will be “off-site” at a central administration site.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies have consistently shown that low trauma fractures are widely prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the management of this condition remains controversial because the safety and efficacy of most currently available treatments for the prevention of fractures have not been adequately tested in patients with CKD. Further, many of these treatments are potentially toxic to kidneys and may also have deleterious effects in certain types renal bone disease. Therefore, there is a need for investigating new therapies for bone protection in CKD, using drugs that are safe and effective in patients with CKD. Recent evidence suggests that nitrates have all the attributes to be a potential candidate for bone protection in CKD. They  have been shown to have bone protective properties in postmenopausal women, although not specifically in patients with CKD, and their safety in CKD, including in patients with advanced CKD,  is well established. The current study is arandomised, placebo-controlled trail designed to assess the efficacy of isosorbide dinitrate, a commonly available oral nitrate preparation in Australia, versus placebo in the prevention of spinal bone loss in patients with moderately severe kidney disease (CKD stage 3 and 4). </summary>
