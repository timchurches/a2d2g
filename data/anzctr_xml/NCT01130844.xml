  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of MMX Mesalamine (5-ASA) at Steady State - AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 hours post-dose on day 7</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of MMX Mesalamine (5-ASA) at Steady State - Cmax is a term that refers to the maximum (or peak) concentration that a drug achieves in the body after the drug has been administrated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over a 24-hour period starting on day 7</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of MMX Mesalamine (5-ASA) at Steady State - Tmax is the time after administration of a drug when the maximum plasma concentration in the body is reached.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over a 24-hour period starting on day 7</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total Body Clearance (CL) of MMX Mesalamine (5-ASA) at Steady State - Clearance of a substance from the blood by the kidneys.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over a 24-hour period starting on day 7</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AUC of MMX Mesalamine Major Metabolite (Ac-5-ASA) at Steady State</outcome>
      <timepoint>2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 hours post-dose on day 7</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cmax of MMX Mesalamine Major Metabolite (Ac-5-ASA) at Steady State</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tmax of MMX Mesalamine Major Metabolite (Ac-5-ASA) at Steady State</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Dose Absorbed For MMX Mesalamine (5-ASA) in Urine at Steady State - The percentage of the dose absorbed was calculated as: 100 x (Xu0-24h 5-ASA + [0.7847* Xu0-24h Ac-5-ASA])/dose, where 0.7847 is the ratio of the molecular weight of 5-ASA (153.14) to the molecular weight of Ac-5-ASA (195.15). Xu0-24h is equal to the cumulative amount recovered in urine in the time interval of 0 to 24 hours.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cumulative Amount of MMX Mesalamine (5-ASA) Recovered in Urine at Steady State</outcome>
