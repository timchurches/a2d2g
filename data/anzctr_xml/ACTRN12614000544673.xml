  <interventions>
    <interventions>The project intervention will consist of an initial pilot phase of n=30 participants to gain initial efficacy data for probiotics and orotic acid by first taking probiotics for 4 weeks, and then adding orotic acid for 4 weeks. A single group trial will be conducted to identify the strength of signal for probiotics as opposed to orotic acid based on our previous research.  A range of psychiatric measures will be used, with weekly scoring of symptom response. 
The study duration is 8 weeks with 8 week follow up based on our previous studies this is the typical time point were maximum treatment effect, or early signs of relapse occur in this group. For 4 weeks participants will take 2 x probiotic capsules a day and 2 x prbiotic capsules and 4 x orotate tablets a day.

The products to be used:  1. A daily dose of 2 x probiotic capsules daily taken orally with food . Each capsule contains 50 billion colony-forming units (CFU) of live organisms (Lactobacillus acidophilus +Lactobacillus casei +Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1.). the probiotic will be taken in addition to a prescribed dose of SSRI medication for participants with a demonstrated history of chronic treatment resistant depression.
2.  A daily dose of 1600mg  of Orotic acid in the magnesium orotate form taken with food 4 x daily. Magnesium orotate will be taken in addition to a prescribed dose of SSRI medication for participants with a demonstrated history of chronic treatment resistant depression.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot research is a simple test of probiotics to improve dysbiosis  as a hypothesised casual factor in resistant depression and orotic acid as a treatment in conjunction wit SSRI medication. The signal group design is to establish signals for these approaches to provide preliminary efficacy data.
