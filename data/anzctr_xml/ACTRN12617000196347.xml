  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a multi-site, prospective, open-label PrEP demonstration project that aims to assess the uptake, acceptability, safety, and feasibility of a single tablet of emtricitabine 200mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg as PrEP, administered orally, once daily to enrolled participants who engage in high risk sexual practices over a period of 30 months. Refill based assessment and dried blood spot testing will be utilised to monitor adherence.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>VicPrEP is a demonstration project investigating the adherence, behavioural change, acceptability, safety, and feasibility of the use of HIV PrEP in the Victorian community. 
The nature of a demonstration study is to study patients who can feasibly be recruited. Based on Australian research undertaken by members of our study team regarding the likelihood of PrEP use in HIV negative gay or bisexual men and the likely uptake of healthy, fertile HIV serodiscordant couples we have estimated that approximately 100 patients willing to accept PrEP could feasibly be recruited into the study over a two year period. This number of patients may reasonably allow us to undertake regression analyses to determine whether a number of baseline covariables are associated with PrEP adherence, behavioural change and acceptability. However the study sample size was necessarily chosen based on feasibility of recruitment and not based upon power calculations.</summary>

    <publicnotes>Since the late 1990s, Australia has witnessed a steady increase in the number of HIV diagnoses, which have stabilised at approximately 1,000 cases annually. In the past decade, 84% of new HIV infections have occurred in gay men. In June 2014, Australias first HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) demonstration study opened in Melbourne, Victoria. </publicnotes>
