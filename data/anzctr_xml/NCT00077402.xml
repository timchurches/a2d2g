  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fenretinide, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fenretinide works in treating patients with
      advanced or metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.</summary>
