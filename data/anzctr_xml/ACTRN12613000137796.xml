  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised crossover trial involves two single-day treatment conditions separated by a one week wash/out period. Intervention: Sitting + light-intensity activity bouts: Following an initial steady-state period (150 mins  initial 2 hours + 30 mins) of being seated, participants will complete a 3 min bout of light-intensity walking on the treadmill (level, firm surface, slow pace  3.2 km/hr). They will then return to the seated position. This procedure will be repeated on another 9 occasions every 30 minutes. Total duration and intensity of activity: 30 minutes at light-intensity. </interventions>
    <comparator>One day of prolonged sitting without activity breaks: Participants will sit quietly in a comfortable chair for a 7 hour period</comparator>

    <concealment>Interested volunteers will receive written information about the study in lay terms and a full description of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent and background information, the potential participants will be screened to confirm eligibility. Once a potential subject has been deemed eligible, the subject will be randomised to the order of experimental conditions. The method for allocation concealment is closed envelopes. The allocation information will be placed in numbered envelopes (1 allocation per envelope) by an independent researcher. After a subject has been enrolled in the study, the study co-ordinators will contact an independent staff member to ask for the sequence of experimental conditions. The independent staff member will keep a log of the date and time the envelope was opened, the envelope number, the initials and gender of the participant and the order of experimental conditions. The study co-ordinator will also keep a record of this information.

Using the randomization schedule, the independent researcher will, after data collection, create a dataset containing outcome, other relevant variables and the random unique code but will not include overt information on the experimental conditions, subject initials, and date of data collection. Data collected under the experimental conditions will be assigned a code (e.g., 0 and 1) unknown to the data analyst and the research team (they would be blinded to the randomization process and condition). Once the data are analysed, the experimental-condition codes will be revealed and the dataset will be checked for errors.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recently, data from observational (AusDiab) and experimental (IDLE breaks study) research indicates people who break up their sitting time throughout the day with light-intensity activity (such as light walking) may have better blood glucose and blood fat levels than people who sit for prolonged periods without activity breaks. This experimental study will examine the acute effect of prolonged sitting with and without light intensity activity bouts on memory functions (long-term and short-term memory and executive functions) in adults. Nineteen sedentary overweight/obese adults aged between 45-75 years will be recruited to attend two separate trial days interspersed by a one week washout period: control condition (sitting  7 hours), a similar duration of sitting but with 3 minute light intensity activity bouts every 30 minutes. Cognitive testing, measurements of neurotrophic, metabolic, inflammatory, cortisol and catecholamine markers will be conducted. The proposed study will provide initial insights into whether breaking up sitting time with intermittent light-intensity activity has the potential for cognitive benefits whilst also describing the acute cognitive effects of prolonged sitting.</summary>
