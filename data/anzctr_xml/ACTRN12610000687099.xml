  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the educational group will complete 8 online lessons in 8 weeks. Lessons include an educational component in the form of a comic telling the story of 2 individuals who had previously undergone treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder. The online lessons take approximately 30 minutes to read through, with homework exercises taking a further hour per day. The lessons are based on current best practice cognitive and behavioural techniques and include exposure and response prevention, and cognitive techniques. The participant is phoned twice weekly by a clinical psychologist (these days are determined by the participant) and may also be contacted at other times by the participant by email or phone. A printable information summary will also be provided, and some homework assignments will be set.</interventions>
