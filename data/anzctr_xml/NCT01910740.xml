  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Enhanced Physical Activity
Other interventions - Usual Care
Other interventions - Social Interaction

Experimental: Enhanced Physical Activity - Participants in the Enhanced Physical Activity group will receive a program of enhanced physical activity in addition to the usual care.

Active Comparator: Usual Care - The Usual Care group will receive usual therapy provided by a multidisciplinary team and social interaction.


Other interventions: Enhanced Physical Activity
Individually tailored programs focused on increasing the amount of time participants spend performing mobility activities, particularly standing and walking in the late afternoons and evenings and on weekends. These participants will be provided with one or two extra sessions on weekdays and two extra sessions on weekend days for the duration of their rehabilitation stay.

Other interventions: Usual Care
Therapy provided by a multidisciplinary team which includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy on weekdays with other allied health input (eg speech pathology, social work) as indicated. Medical and nursing care is also provided seven days a week.

Other interventions: Social Interaction
To control for the extra hours of physical activity that the experimental group receives, participants in the control group shall have additional activities such as card and board games, conversation or reading as well as upper limb exercises and other physical activities that have minimal impact on ambulant mobility.

    <summary>The main aim of this study is to investigate whether increasing the amount of physical
      activity in frail older people during hospital based rehabilitation is associated with better
      mobility outcomes compared to usual care. A second aim is to investigate whether this
      physical activity intervention is associated with improvements in health related quality of
      life. Finally we plan to investigate whether increasing the amount of physical activity
      during rehabilitation is cost effective, measured from a health system perspective, compared
      with usual care.

      Older people receiving inpatient rehabilitation will be randomly assigned to an intervention
      group, who will receive extra physical activity on weekdays and weekends or a control group,
      who will receive additional activities based on social interaction. The activity sessions
      will be individualized to the particular participant. Both groups of people will be assessed
      at baseline, discharge from hospital and at 6 months following discharge. The intervention
      group will be provided with one or two extra sessions on weekdays and two extra sessions on
      weekends for the duration of their rehabilitation stay. To account for the extra
      physiotherapy time that the intervention group receives, the people in the control group will
      spend the same amount of time performing other activities, such as cards, board games or
      reading, whilst seated. To ensure the safety of the participants in this study, each physical
      activity session will be supervised by either a physiotherapist or allied health assistant.

      Hypothesis 1: The primary hypothesis is that, compared with usual care, increasing the amount
      of physical activity in frail older people during rehabilitation will lead to more optimal
      mobility at discharge, as measured by gait speed.

      Secondary hypotheses are that, compared with usual care, increasing the amount of physical
      activity during rehabilitation will:

      Hypothesis 2: lead to significantly greater improvements in mobility and function both at
      discharge and six months following discharge.

      Hypothesis 3: lead to better quality of life six months following hospital discharge,
      measured using the EuroQol Health (EQ5D) Questionnaire and the EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale
      (EQ-VAS).

      Hypothesis 4: be cost effective compared to usual care</summary>
