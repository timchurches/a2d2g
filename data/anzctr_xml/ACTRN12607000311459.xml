  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot project which aims to test the feasibility of a larger trial in this area.  This project is designed as a pilot randomised trial (RCT) to evaluate a group-based nutrition and exercise weight loss program supported by standardized self-management education.  It is hypothesised that promoting modest, realistic weight loss in overweight older adults with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee will improve function and slow disease progression.</summary>
