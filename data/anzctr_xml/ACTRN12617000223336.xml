    <interventions>This study aims at investigating the association between Vitamin B12 status and sleep quality in healthy people aged between 18-65 years in a community based seting in Melbourne. With the aid of activity monitor and food diary, a one week sleep and food consumption data will be collected. Moreover, blood samples will be collected to measure plasma B12 levels. Participants are required to make 2 visits at Latrobe Bundoora campus. First visit takes about 30 minutes and second take about 10 minutes. Besides, participants will be asked to wear activity monitor on their wrist for 7 days. Additionally, a 7 days food and sleep diaries as well as sleep quality and depression questionnaires will be completed in one week trial period. At the first visit, blood samples, anthropometric measurements and whole body composition (DEXA scan) data will be collected. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Associations between vitamin B12 and Sleep Quality parameters will be drawn. Plasma B12 markers will be measured using LCMS methods and sleep quality data will be collected using ActiGraph activity monitors. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for vitamin B12 assessment will be collected at first visit only.
ActiGraphs should be worn continuously for 7 days from first visit. 
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determining the links between sleep quality and depression based on objective (activity monitor) and subjective (sleep diary, depression screening questionnaire) data collected from participants.  
CESD- R, a revised depression screening questionnaire developed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies. It measure symptoms of depression in nine different groups as defined by the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fifth edition. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Food and sleep diaries are recorded for 7 days starting from first visit similar to activity monitor. 
Depression and sleep quality questionnaires can be completed any time with in the 7 days period.. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aimed at examining the association between vitamin B12 status and sleep quality of healthy people in Melbourne between age of 18-65 years with diverse dietary plans and life style at a community-based setting. Based on the known roles of B12 on proper neuronal functions and the fact that one of the symptoms of its deficiency is tiredness, we hypothesis that B12 plays crucial role in maintaining good sleep quality in humans. </summary>
