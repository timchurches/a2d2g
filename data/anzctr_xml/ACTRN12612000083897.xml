    <interventions>The B4 School check is the final Well Child Check. It is offered to all children in New Zealand when they turn 4 years of age. The B4 School Check comprises 9 health screens: Child Health, Dental, Growth, Immunisation, Parental Evaluation of Development (PEDS), Strengths and Difficulties (SDQ) Parent &amp; Teacher, and Vision and Hearing testing. The B4 school check was introduced in mid 2008 and has been offered since this time. Data from this has been collated in the National B4 school check data base since commencement of the check. This time period incorporates the period before September 2010, and data has continued to be collected  since this time including across the Canterbury region since the earthquakes. 
This is an observational study of changes in the scores on the SDQ of children in Canterbury region pre and post the Canterbury earthquakes using data from the National B4 school check database.</interventions>
    <comparator>Data for the Canturbury region from the National B4 school check database will be analysed with comparisons of data from prior to the Canterbury earthquakes (data from january 2009 until september 3 2010) made with data from time periods following each of the major earthquakes (4/11/2010 and 22/02/2011). Scores on both the parent and teacher SDQ will be considered.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary aim of this study is to use the already collected National database information to provide a global community measure of emotional and behavioural wellbeing in Canterbury 4 year olds  before, during and after the 2010/2011 earthquakes. This will be measured by changes in the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total score and impact scores over time.  Both teacher and parent versions will be compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary timepoints considered will be baseline (from january 2009- 3 september 2010)
Following major subsequent earthquakes 
4 september 2010- 22 february 2011
23 February - December 2011</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary aims of this study are to investigate changes over time in domains of functioning using the SDQ subscores; Emotional symptoms score, Conduct problems score, Hyperactivity scale, Peer problem score</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary timepoints considered will be baseline (from january 2009- 3 september 2010)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>On September 4 2010 Canterbury experienced an earthquake of magnitude 7.1. Since this time there have been over 7500 aftershocks, with this period including the devastating earthquake of February 22 2011, and June 13 magnitude 6.2 quake. Exposure to large-scale natural disasters is associated with enduring mental health problems in children and adolescents  with the most frequent post disaster stress reactions including depression, anxiety, complicated grief and, at the pathological extreme, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . 
The B4 School check is the final Well Child Check. It is offered to all children in New Zealand when they turn 4 years of age. The B4 School Check comprises 9 health screens: Child Health, Dental, Growth, Immunisation, Parental Evaluation of Development (PEDS), Strengths and Difficulties (SDQ) Parent &amp; Teacher, and Vision and Hearing testing.
