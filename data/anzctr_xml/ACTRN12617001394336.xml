  <interventions>
    <interventions>This single-centre, open-label study will compare the response of the Plasmodium falciparum isolates Cam3.II^R539T (referred to as K13, artemisinin-resistant) and 3D7 (artemisinin-sensitive) to a single dose of the antimalarial drug artesunate in healthy subjects using the induced blood stage malaria model. The study will be conducted in up to 9 subjects per cohort, with up to 3 cohorts. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomised to receive either the K13 or 3D7 challenge agent, in a 2:1 ratio.

Subjects randomised to receive the K13 challenge agent will be inoculated on Day 0 with approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum K13 parasite-infected red blood cells (RBCs). Subjects randomised to receive the 3D7 challenge agent will be inoculated on Day 1 with approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum 3D7 parasite-infected RBCs. On an outpatient basis, subjects will be monitored daily via phone and then will attend the clinical unit daily from 4 days post-inoculation  Day 4 for K13 subjects and Day 5 for 3D7 subjects  until positive for presence of malaria parasites by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the 18S rRNA gene. Once qPCR positive, subjects will be monitored twice daily until artesunate treatment for parasitaemia, symptoms or signs of malaria, and adverse events. The threshold for commencement of artesunate treatment will be when all subjects reach a parasitaemia of greater than or equal to 5,000 parasites/mL. If the parasitaemia of any subject is greater than or equal to 5,000 parasites/mL, and is accompanied by a malaria clinical score greater than 6 before all subjects have reached the treatment threshold, then treatment of that subject will begin within a 24 hour period. Subjects may also receive artesunate treatment at any time based on parasitaemia and/or clinical symptoms at the Investigators discretion. 

Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit (approximately Day 9), administered a single dose of approximately 2 mg/kg artesunate (as oral tablets), and confined for 72 hours to monitor for tolerability of therapy and to ensure adequate clinical response. Once clinically well, subjects will be followed up on an out-patient basis for monitoring of safety and parasite clearance. If artesunate does not clear parasitaemia, subjects will be administered piperaquine phosphate as a single dose of 960 mg (as oral tablets). All subjects will receive compulsory rescue treatment with atovaquone/proguanil hydrochloride on Day 26+/-3 or earlier at the Investigators discretion. A treatment course consists of 4 tablets of atovaquone 250 mg/proguanil hydrochloride 100 mg once daily, orally for 3 days. Subjects may also be treated with a single dose of 45 mg primaquine (as oral tablets) at the time of atovaquone/proguanil hydrochloride treatment, if gametocytaemia is suspected from parasite lifecycle stage reverse transcriptase qPCR or by the presence of stable low level parasitaemia, or at the Investigators discretion, to ensure complete clearance of gametocytes. Follow-up for safety assessments will be performed on Day 28+/-3 (End of Study).
</interventions>
    <comparator>The 3D7 challenge agent will act as an active control group in order to compare the parasite clearance of the K13 and 3D7 challenge agents. The 3D7 challenge agent has been used extensively in previous induced blood stage malaria clinical trials. The 3D7 challenge agent will be given at the same dose as the K13 challenge agent i.e. approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum parasite-infected red blood cells, given intravenously. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The parasite clearance profiles of P. falciparum K13 and 3D7 after administration of artesunate will be characterised by the parasite reduction ratio and parasite clearance half-life as determined using qPCR. A t-test will be used to compare the slope of the clearance curves for K13 and 3D7 isolates. </outcome>
      <timepoint>qPCR: prior to artesunate treatment and at approximately 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48 hours after artesunate treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of P. falciparum K13 and 3D7 infection will be evaluated from adverse event and serious adverse event recording (including severity and causality), physical examinations, vital signs, biochemistry, haematology, and urinalysis. 

Adverse events consistent with the symptoms of early malaria infection include headache, fever, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia and gastrointestinal upset. The medical assessment of AE severity of the study will be recorded in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03 published 14 June 2010.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse event recording: at all clinic visits from parasite inoculation to Day 28+/-3.

Physical examinations: complete physical examinations at screening and Day 28+/-3; abbreviated physical examinations prior to parasite inoculum, on clinic admission prior to artesunate treatment, and prior to exit of clinic confinement; abbreviated physical examination will also be performed when signs or symptoms of malaria are identified if clinically indicated. 

Vital signs: screening, and at all clinic visits from parasite inoculation to Day 28+/-3.

Biochemistry and haematology: screening, Day -3 to Day -1 safety visit (if required), on clinic admission prior to artesunate treatment, prior to exit of confinement, Day 14+/-2, Day 18+/-2, prior to piperaquine phosphate treatment (if required), 3 days post-piperaquine phosphate treatment (or next scheduled visit), prior to atovaquone/proguanil hydrochloride treatment, after completion of atovaquone/proguanil hydrochloride treatment (or next scheduled visit), and Day 28+/-3. 

Urinalysis: screening, Day -3 to Day -1 safety visit (if required), on clinic admission prior to artesunate treatment, Day 14+/-2, Day 18+/-2, and Day 28+/-3.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size required to complete the primary objective of comparing the artesunate parasite clearance profiles of K13 and 3D7 isolates was estimated. Background information used to estimate the required sample size for this study came from previous induced blood stage malaria studies with the 3D7 isolate and fast acting antimalarial drugs, as well as artesunate clearance data from artemisinin-resistant isolates. nQuery Adviser was used to calculate the sample size required. Satterthwaite t-test of equal means but unequal variances was used with a 2-sided a=0.05, an estimated 30% mean difference in decay rate between the K13 and 3D7 isolates, and a power of 80%. The estimated sample size using a 2:1 ratio of K13 to 3D7 was 18 to 9 subjects. To achieve this sample size, subjects will be challenged with K13 or 3D7 in a 2:1 ratio in up to 3 cohorts of n=9.

The study will use parallel group comparison. Continuous data will be summarised using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation, or median and interquartile range). Categorical data will be presented using N and percent sign  (using the number of subjects without missing data in the calculation).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare the ability of the antimalarial drug artesunate to kill 2 different P. falciparum malaria parasites administered to healthy subjects: the artemisinin-resistant K13 isolate and the artemisinin-sensitive 3D7 isolate. P. falciparum K13 was isolated from a person with malaria infection, and responds more slowly to artemisinin antimalarial drugs such as artesunate. However, P. falciparum K13 is still sensitive to other antimalarial drugs including piperaquine phosphate and atovaquone which can be used to completely kill the parasite. P. falciparum 3D7 is sensitive to the artemisinin antimalarial drugs such as artesunate. We expect that subjects randomised to receive the P. falciparum K13 isolate will clear the parasites more slowly after artesunate treatment than those subjects who receive the 3D7 (drug sensitive) isolate. The safety of the K13 and 3D7 isolates in healthy subjects will also be further assessed. Once the P. falciparum K13 isolate is properly characterised in this malaria infection model with respect to resistance to an artemisinin drug, it can then be used in future studies to investigate the activity of novel, antimalarial drugs in clearance of artemisinin-resistant parasites. This is important because artemisinin-resistant parasites are a growing problem and threaten to spread across the world.</summary>
