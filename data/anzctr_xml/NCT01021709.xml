Experimental: tDCS with alternative electrode montage - Treating major depression with either alternative tDCS electrode montage.


Treatment: devices: tDCS (Eldith DC-Stimulator (CE certified))
tDCS session lasting continuously for 20 minutes at 2 mA. Conductive rubber electrodes (7 x 5 cm = 35 cm2 &amp; 10 x 10 cm = 100 cm2) covered by sponges soaked in saline will be used, held in place by a band. The current will be gradually increased to the level of 2 mA over 30 seconds (to avoid the sensation of a flash).

    <inclusivecriteria>1. Subject met inclusion criteria for study HREC 07305 (a sham controlled study of
             transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a treatment for depression).

          2. Subject completed study HREC 07305.

          3. Subject either did not reach remission at the end of trial (defined as MADRS score of
             = 10) or suffered an early relapse (within a month of finishing the trial).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Diagnosis (as defined by DSM-IV) of: any psychotic disorder (lifetime); bipolar
             disorder; eating disorder (current or within the past year); obsessive compulsive
             disorder (lifetime); post-traumatic stress disorder current or within the past year);
             mental retardation.

          2. History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (as per DSM-IV criteria) within the
             last 3 months (except nicotine and caffeine).

          3. Inadequate response to ECT in the current episode of depression.

          4. Subject is on regular benzodiazepine medication which it is not clinically appropriate
             to discontinue.

          5. Subject requires a rapid clinical response due to inanition, psychosis or high suicide
             risk.

          6. Neurological disorder or insult, e.g., recent stroke (CVA), which places subject at
             risk of seizure or neuronal damage with tDCS.

          7. Subject has metal in the cranium, skull defects, or skin lesions on scalp (cuts,
             abrasions, rash) at proposed electrode sites.

          8. Female subject who is pregnant, or of child-bearing age, sexually active and not using
             reliable contraception (urine test for pregnancy will be used).</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Among antidepressant treatments, ECT stands as the most effective in treating acute
      depression. However, patient concerns with the cognitive side effects of ECT have encouraged
      the development of new and more focal forms of brain stimulation such as transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (tDCS). Our current study of tDCS as a treatment for depression suggests
      that this technique has antidepressant effects and is safe, painless and well tolerated.
      However, not all patients may respond to this treatment in the way that it is currently
      administered and the concern of possible relapse in some patients who respond to tDCS has
      raised interest in finding alternative, possibly more optimal ways of administering tDCS.
      This study will investigate whether using alternative electrode montages can improve the
      antidepressant effects of tDCS in people suffering from depression.</summary>
