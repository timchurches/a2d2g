  <interventions>
    <interventions>Early childhood educators in the intervention arm will undertake the Let's Read professional development. This professional development aims to up-skill educators to enhance their emergent literacy promoting practices, and their capacity to engage with families about emergent literacy promotion. 

The professional development will involve two stages; 
(1) educators will complete a 4x1 hour Let's Read eLearning course online. 
(2) ongoing support will be provided to educators by a trained literacy skills coach within their early childhood education and care centre, who will assist them in the implementation of Let's Read strategies in their work for six months duration. 

The eLearning is to be completed in one sitting within a two week period prior to the start of the six month coaching intervention. The eLearning software monitors educators' course progress and completion. The specific learning objectives of the eLearning course are:
1) Increased understanding of early literacy and the rationale for supporting the development of an emergent literacy framework
2) Increased familiarity with the Lets Read framework, including key messages and resources.
3) Increased understanding of the importance of working in partnership with families when supporting the development of early literacy skills.
4) Increased ability and confidence to facilitate conversations with families about early literacy
5) Increased awareness of strategies for implementing Lets Read in early childhood education and care services and the community.

Coaches are educational leaders already supporting educators in the participating centres. Coaches will receive training in the form of a two day face-to-face group workshop on the specific requirements of the coaching intervention delivered by a trained Let's Read facilitator. Coaching support sessions provided to educators by coaches will comprise at least once monthly individual one-on-one coaching sessions of 5-20 minutes, as well as additional small group, face-to-face, email and telephone support sessions scheduled at the discretion of the coach as required.      </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lets Read is a professional development program for early childhood educators that aims to improve their emergent literacy promoting practices and help them talk to families about their child's emergent literacy. This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Let's Read professional development program through a cluster randomised trial. 

Participants will be educators working with children aged birth to five years in the Early Childhood Education and Care centres taking part in the study, and parents/guardians of children attending the participating centres who speak and understand English.

Educators working in centres who are allocated to receive the Let's Read professional development will complete a Let's Read eLearning course, and then they will receive ongoing support from a literacy skills coach who will assist them in carrying out Let's Read strategies in their work. Coaches will also receive training on how to support educators to carry out Lets Read. 

Pre and post intervention measures of changes in educators' emergent literacy promoting practices, and their knowledge, understanding, skills, values, and confidence in relation to emergent literacy and engaging with families about emergent literacy, will be taken. Pre and post intervention measures of changes in parents'/guardians' attitudes towards emergent literacy and engagement in literacy promoting activities with their children will also be taken. These results will be compared with a control group of educators and parents/guardians from centres who did not receive the intervention.      
    
We hypothesise that the Let's Read professional development program will enhance the emergent literacy promoting practices of educators working in Early Childhood Education and Care centres, compared to standard practice.</summary>
