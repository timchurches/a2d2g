  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase of =5 letters at the 5-year study visit on a LogMAR chart compared with (a) the initial baseline level and (b) the level at the 2-year study visit. - Changes from Baseline to 5 years: Improvement of =5 letters after 5 years was found in 14/33 (42%) eyes initially treated with triamcinolone compared with 11/34 (32%) eyes initially treated with placebo (zGEE=0.81, P=0.4).
Changes from 2 to 5 years (open-label extension):Improvement of =5 letters of best-corrected visual acuity was found in 8/29 (28%) eyes initial-triamcinolone compared with 7/28 (25%) initial-placebo eyes (zGEE=0.20, P=0.8).</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 year extension, total 5 years study from baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of moderate or severe adverse events over the 3 years of the open-label extension - The incidence of cataract surgery declined in the third year: 5/11 (45%) eyes from the initial-triamcinolone group that were phakic at the beginning of the 3rd year required cataract surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 year extension study, total 5 year study from baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in macular thickness by OCT - Changes from Baseline to 5 years: Foveal thickness had decreased by 30µm (95% confidence interval, -47 to 107µm) less in the initial-triamcinolone group than in the initial-placebo group at 5 years (zGEE=0.76, P=0.45).
Changes from 2 to 5 years (open-label extension):Foveal thickness had actually increased slightly on average in the initial-triamcinolone group, but decreased in initial-placebo eyes. Overall it had decreased by 70µm (95% confidence interval, -1 to 140µm) more in the placebo group than in the treatment group between 2 and 5 years (zGEE=1.93, P=0.05).</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 year extension, total 5 year study from the baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Any change in visual acuity - Loss of ten or more letters was found in 6/33 (18%) initial-triamcinolone eyes compared with 8/34 (24%) initial-placebo eyes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 year extension, total 5 year study from the baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of laser treatments required. - During the third to fifth years of the study, a similar proportion of eyes from the 2 groups had macular edema that warranted laser treatment: initial-triamcinolone, 5/29 (17%); initial-placebo, 6/28 (21%).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open label extension will treat all the eyes of study participants with active study
      medication (intravitreal triamcinolone) as well as standard laser treatment where
      appropriate.

      The specific aims will be to test the following hypotheses:

        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone for diabetic macular oedema that persists or recurs
           after laser treatment remains efficacious over five years

        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone for diabetic macular oedema that persists or recurs
           after laser treatment retains a manageable and acceptable safety profile over five years</summary>
