  <interventions>
    <interventions> Intervention duration is 12 weeks and is comprised of one face-to-face consultation session (1 hour in week 1) and five telephone calls (10-20 minutes each in weeks 2, 3, 5, 8, 12). The intervention is delivered by a research assistant working in geriatric medicine who has training in delivering behaviour change interventions. The intervention is based on content contained in a workbook given to participants in the face-to-face session. This workbook contains six modules: 
1. Sitting and your health
2. Taking action
3. Using your sitting influences to your advantage
4. Don't take set-backs sitting down!
5. 8 Lifestyle Habits to boos your brain health further!
6. Reflection and forward planning
Modules are designed to be completed during each contact point, e.g. the face-to-face session and telephone calls. Participants will be asked to complete homework (10-20 minutes) during the face-to-face session and prior to each telephone call. 

The two key guidelines of the intervention are:
1. Stand for 3 @ 30. Participants are encouraged to stand up and move for 3 minutes after every 30 minutes of uninterrupted sitting.
2. Sit less throughout the day. Participants are encouraged to replace activities done while sitting down for those that can be done while standing.
Participants will set action plans to try and achieve the intervention guidelines. They will also complete trackers to monitor their progress. 

During the face-to-face session conducted in the home of the participants, they will receive information about sitting time and health, the potential benefits of reducing prolonged periods of sitting and feedback on their objectively measured sitting time. They will also receive a device (Jawbone UP2) to wear on the wrist for the duration of the intervention. This device will prompt them to move after 30 minutes of uninterrupted sitting. 

During the telephone calls, participants will be asked about their program, and their progress in reducing their sitting time. Their action plans and trackers will be reviewed and they will receive feedback on their homework.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group (or program materials only group) will undergo assessments at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks. During the intervention period they do not receive any program materials or contact with the researchers. At the completion of the intervention period and after the 12-week assessment, they will be sent the intervention materials, i.e. workbook, feedback on their objectively measured sitting time and Jawbone Up2.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome will be change in performance accuracy (words recalled) on the CVLT-II between baseline and the 12-week assessment. Sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: power = 0.80; 2-sided alpha = 0.05 based on pilot data from the AusDiab3 dataset. Mean CVLT scores between the lowest and highest quartiles of self-reported sitting time [lowest: 3-34 hours sitting per week, mean (SD) = 5.65 (2.17); highest: = 60 hrs per week, mean (SD) = 6.81 (2.23)] were compared. Based on these data, 57 participants are required in each group. Allowing for a 20% drop out rate, the target sample size is 72 participants per group. 

Further statistical considerations include:
- intention-to-treat basis (with baseline values carried forward for missing data) to determine whether the intervention group differs from the control group in changes over time on all primary and secondary outcomes;
- Repeated measures regression models, using generalised estimating equations (GEE) with the treatment group as the main effect and the group by time interaction, for the primary outcome (verbal learning and memory from the CVLT II) and each of the secondary outcomes;
- Potential confounders specific to each dependent variable will be identified and controlled via statistical adjustment;
- Statistical significance will be set at the conventional 5% level (two-tailed).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a novel approach we propose a randomised controlled trial to investigate the cognitive benefits of reducing prolonged sitting in adults aged 60 years and older with two risk factors for cognitive decline: being frail and not meeting physical activity guidelines. The 16-week theory-informed sitting reduction program will include one face-to-face session and five telephone calls. Participants will receive normative feedback on their objectively measured sitting time, work through a series of activities in a workbook and set goals which they will integrate incrementally. 144 older adults will be randomised to receive either the sitting reduction program or a control condition. Participants will be assessed at baseline, at end of intervention at 16 weeks and at 32 weeks to assess maintenance. Primary outcome is cognitive function assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test with secondary outcomes of objectively measured sitting time, executive function, mental wellbeing (anxiety and depressive symptoms, and quality of life), and body composition (waist circumference, weight, and % body fat) and sleep (duration and quality).</summary>
