Experimental: Stribild - Participants will switch from their baseline treatment regimen to Stribild for up to 96 weeks, and may continue to receive Stribild in the extension phase.

Active Comparator: NNRTI+FTC/TDF - Participants will stay on their baseline treatment regimen antiretroviral regimen consisting of an NNRTI plus FTC/TDF for up to 96 weeks, and may switch to Stribild in the extension phase.


Treatment: drugs: NNRTI
NNRTI agents administered according to prescribing information; allowed NNRTIs include efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine, or rilpivirine.

Treatment: drugs: FTC/TDF
FTC/TDF (200/300 mg) administered according to prescribing information

Treatment: drugs: Stribild
Stribild® (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; E/C/F/TDF) (150/150/200/300 mg) STR administered orally once daily with food

    <summary>This study will evaluate the noninferiority of Stribild®
      (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/TDF))
      single-tablet regimen (STR) relative to regimens consisting of a nonnucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus Truvada® (FTC/TDF) in maintaining HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50
      copies/mL at Week 48 in virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected adults. This study will also
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the two regimens through 96 weeks of
      treatment.</summary>
