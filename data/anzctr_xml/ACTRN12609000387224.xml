  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group awake
The children of group awake will have their laryngeal mask airway (LMA) removed awake.  The LMA will be removed when the children have demonstrated facial grimace, adequate tidal volume and respiratory rate, coughing with open mouths or opening of their eyes and purposeful movements.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group anesthetised
The children of the group anaesthetised will have their LMA removed during the surgical stage of general anaesthesia when the end-tidal sevoflurane level is greater than 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). Sevoflurane is administered via an anaesthetic vaporiser. At induction of anaesthesia it is slowly increased to a dose of greater than one MAC and then left constant throughout surgery.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary endpoint will be the total of respiratory complications in the perioperative period. 
Presence of perioperative respiratory complication as defined one or more of the following:
Bronchospasm, laryngospasm, severe coughing, desaturation &lt; 95%, airway obstruction and/or stridor.
Laryngospasm is defined as a complete airway obstruction associated with muscle rigidity of the abdominal and chest walls. Bronchospasm is defined as the occurrence of an increased respiratory effort, especially during expiration, and wheeze on auscultation. Airway obstruction is defined as the presence of partial airway obstruction in combination with a snoring noise and respiratory efforts. Assessement via clinical examination and observation.  </outcome>

Written consent consisting of parental permission and also child assent when applicable, will be obtained. The person determining if a child is eligible for inclusion in the trial is unaware when the decision is made to which group the child would be allocated. Following inclusion into the study protocol, the children will be randomly assigned to group “awake” or group “anesthetised” by computer generated block randomisation. Allocation will be concealed in sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>The patients will be randomised by computer generated block randomisation. Following written informed consent, the participant will be assigned the next available Participant Number. The Participant Number will correspond to a numbered randomisation envelope. The randomisation is concealed in the closed envelope and will only be opened by the anaesthetist in charge of the patient at induction of anaesthesia. The participant number will be used to identify the patient for the duration of the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Removal of the laryngeal mask airway can be performed while children are still deeply anesthetized or when they are awake (as defined by eye opening, grimacing, coughing, and purposeful movements). Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. In healthy children, it has been shown that there are no clinical differences between removal of the laryngeal mask airway in the awake state vs anesthetized state. In patients with a high risk of developing a postoperative respiratory problems (e.g. coughing) such as those with asthma, it may be preferable to remove the laryngeal mask airway while the patients are still anesthetized to avoid airway stimulation and consecutively bucking, coughing and bronchospasm. The results of a recent large prospective cohort study at our institution with over 9000 children allow to identify children with a high risk for developping postoperative respiratory complications. 
The aim of this present randomized controlled trial is to assess whether children at a high risk for respiratory problems benefit from anethetized removal of the laryngeal mask airway as compared to awake removal of the laryngeal mask airway following adenoidectomy. We hypothesize that children with a high risk for respiratory problems defined by the presence of either airway susceptibility, eczema or a positive family history who have their laryngeal mask airway removed deeply anaesthetised will demonstrate less respiratory problems compared with high risk children who have it removed awake.</summary>
