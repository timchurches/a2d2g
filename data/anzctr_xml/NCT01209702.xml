Placebo Comparator: Part 1: Placebo - Participants received intravenous infusions of placebo once every 4 weeks until Week 12. Following the Week 12 visit, participants who completed Part 1 of the study received open-label 8 mg/kg tocilizumab through Week 208.

Experimental: Part 1: Tocilizumab - Participants received intravenous infusions of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab once every 4 weeks until Week 12. Following the Week 12 visit, participants who completed Part 1 of the study received open-label 8 mg/kg tocilizumab through Week 208.

Placebo Comparator: Part 2: Placebo - Participants received intravenous infusions of placebo once every 4 weeks until Week 24. Participants who did not attain an ASsessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis-20 (ASAS20) response at Week 16 were, at the investigator's discretion, eligible to receive open-label escape therapy consisting of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab. After Week 24, participants were to receive open-label treatment with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab every 4 weeks until Week 104. At the completion of Week 104, all Part 2 participants were to receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in the common open-label extension phase, however the study was terminated prior to any participants reaching this stage.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) - The BASDAI is a patient-administered assessment of 6 parameters specific to AS. The following parameters were assessed on a 100-mm horizontal visual analogue: fatigue, spinal pain, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, intensity of morning stiffness, and duration of morning stiffness. For questions 1 to 5, the left-hand extreme of the line (0) represents "none" (symptom-free) and the right-hand extreme (100) represents "very severe" (maximum severity). For question 6, a time axis was used, with the left-hand extreme of the line representing "0 hours" and the right-hand extreme representing "2 or more hours". The BASDAI score was calculated as follows:
BASDAI = [Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + (Q5 + Q6)/2]/5. The total score is tabulated on a scale from 0 (best) to 10 cm (worst).</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) - The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is an assessment of function in AS patients. The participant provides their assessment of their ability to perform 10 activities on a 100 mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (easy) to 100 (impossible). The BASFI score is the mean of these values and is tabulated on a 0 (best) to 10 (worst) cm scale.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) - The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index linear function is a combined index of 5 clinical measurements (performed by the Joint Assessor) which reflect axial mobility in the AS patient. The measurements to assess mobility are:
Tragus-to-wall;
Modified Schober (lumbar flexion);
Cervical rotation;
Lateral spinal flexion;
Intermalleolar distance.
The BASMI linear result is the average of the 5 assessments and ranges from 0 to 10. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their AS.</outcome>

    <summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have
      failed treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and are na√Øve to tumor necrsos
      factor (TNF) antagonist therapy. In Part 1 of the study, patients will be randomized to
      receive either RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously (IV) or placebo every 4 weeks for 12
      weeks. In Part 2, patients will be randomized to receive RoActemra at either 8 mg/kg or 4
      mg/kg IV or placebo every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The double-blind treatment period will be
      followed by open-label treatment with RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks until Week
      208 for all patients. Anticipated time on study treatment is 208 weeks.</summary>
