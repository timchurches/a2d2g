          -  Patients who have received treatment with an inhibitor of HBV polymerase for at least
             the 3 months immediately preceding study entry (Day 1),

          -  Patients with undetectable HBsAg and HBV DNA concentrations on two consecutive tests
             at least 1 week apart during the screening period,

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the use of HepeX-B versus HBIg, two anti-viral drugs,
      in patients who have received liver transplants due to liver failure caused by Hepatitis B
      infection. Patients will be evaluated over a 6 month to 1.5 year period to evaluate whether
      or not the drugs prevent the Hepatitis B virus from infecting the new liver.</summary>
