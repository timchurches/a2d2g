  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be asked to take one capsule of either of the following every day for 6 months:
1) Vitamin D-enriched Button mushroom solids (500 mg, including 600 IU of Vitamin D) in a cellulose carrier
2) 600 IU of Vitamin D in a cellulose carrier
3) Standard Button mushroom solids (500 mg) in a cellulose carrier
4) Placebo (cellulose carrier alone)

Participants will present to the CSIRO Clinic at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months to donate a blood sample and undergo cognitive testing. In addition, a buccal cell scrape will be performed at baseline. Prior to presenting to the clinic at the nominated time points, participants will be asked to complete mail-out questionnaires.

Adherence will be monitored as follows: participants will be provided with a calendar to mark any days they forget to take a capsule and will be asked to return the capsule bottle (containing any remaining capsules) at the end of the intervention.</interventions>

    <concealment>Screening: Recruitment will proceed for 3-6 months prior to commencement of the study in order to achieve required participant numbers. Those meeting self-reportable inclusion criteria (by questionnaire responses) will be asked to attend CSIROâ€™s cognitive laboratory (Cog Lab) undertake the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).  The MMSE is a widely used and validated screening tool for dementia. Those scoring 24 or less, the traditional cut-off score for possible dementia, will be excluded.  Those with acceptable MMSE test scoring will be asked to submit a blood sample for screening to select for normal levels of: HBA1c, thyroid stimulating hormone, kidney function using biochemical tests (MBA20) and Vitamin B12.  Finally, those meeting self-reportable, cognitive and biochemical inclusion criteria will be included in the RCT.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the elderly and Vitamin D status has been correlated with cognitive performance in a number of epidemiological studies.  However, the potential benefit of correcting Vitamin D status on cognition is unknown.  The Vitamin D content of mushrooms can be increased to biologically useful levels by a short exposure time to UV light.  The aim of this study is to determine if increasing vitamin D status by consumption of either Vitamin D2-enriched mushrooms (VDM) or Vitamin D3 supplement, will improve cognitive function and affect depressive symptoms in healthy aged people (Primary Outcomes).  Controls will include a placebo and also standard mushrooms (low Vitamin D) so as to resolve the effects of Vitamin D2 per se from other mushroom-derived nutrients, including micro-nutrients and neurotrophic factors, which have some evidence for benefits to cognition per se.  </summary>
