    <interventions>Arm 1: Brief Intervention = 1 session (1 hour/session) of motivational interview + Goal setting + Relapse prevention  
(The intervention is one-on-one therapy with a psychiatric nurse). 
Arm 2: Brief Intervention + Family Session = Brief Intervention plus 1 session (30 minutes/session) of family psychoeducation (The intervention is one-on-one therapy with a psychiatric nurse). 

More explaination about Brief ASSIST linked Brief Intervention: 
The brief-ASSIST scores can divide the clients into three categories including low, moderate and high risk categories and the brief-ASSIST has its specific brief intervention for the clients in moderate risk category (no intervention for low risk category and more intensive intervention for high risk category).</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment:
