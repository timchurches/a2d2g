  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>The study is looking at ethnic differences in metabolic activity of CYP1A2 between people of European and South Asian Ancestry</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single dose of caffeine (100 mg via NoDoz tablets available over the counter) will be administered to participants. Saliva samples will then be collected at 2 and 4 hours after the participant takes the caffeine dose to estimate CYP1A2 activity.

Recruitment will take place over a year between April 1/2010 and April 1/2011</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare the CYP1A2 activity of South Asians and Europeans using the 4 h paraxanthine/caffeine concentration ratio in saliva</outcome>
      <timepoint>THe outcomes measured will be after recruitment which will take one year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlate the CYP1A2 activity of all subjects to CYP1A2 polymorphisms for the total cohort and after stratifying by ethnicity.

When stratifying groups into SOuth Asian and European, independent samples t-test will be used to assess differences. For more than two groups ANOVA will be used. Calculations will be conducted using excel 2003-2007 and Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS) V 16.0</outcome>
      <timepoint>THe outcomes measured will be after recruitment which will take one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlate dietary/lifestyle factors with CYP1A2 activity;

Linear regression will be used to assess factors which affect CYP1A2 activity. Calculations will be conducted using excel 2003-2007 and Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS) V 16.0</outcome>
      <timepoint>THe outcomes measured will be after recruitment which will take one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Only those people of European and South Asian ancestry can take part in this study. Ethnicity of a person will be assigned based on the ethnicity of a persons four grandparents (i.e. all four grandparents need to be of the same ethnicity and have the same country of birth).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Subjects who will be excluded from the study include if they are 
Under 18 years of age, 
suffering from an acute illness (hospitalised), 
pregnant or breast-feeding women, and 
being too ill (or where illness compromises the ability to produce uncontaminated saliva (e.g. gum disease such as gingivitis)).
