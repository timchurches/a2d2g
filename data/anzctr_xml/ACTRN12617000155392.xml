    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Group allocation will be conducted in a double-blind, randomised fashion. Allocation concealment will occur through the use of numbered containers where both the participant, and primary researcher responsible for conducting the study, will be unaware of its contents.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated into placebo and treatment groups. These groups are named group 1 and group 2 and the primary investigator and participants will be unaware of which treatment these groups represent. Each participant will be allocated a participant number (1 to 80) based on the order of inclusion in the study. A computer-generated software will randomly assign the numbers 1 to 80 into either group 1 or 2.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In previous studies examining the antidepressants effects of saffron in adults, effects sizes of 1.5 have been observed. 

If we assume a smaller effect size of 0.8, a sample size of 50 will be necessary. This gives an 80% chance of finding an effect at a statistical significance of 0.05. In this study will be using a sample size of 80, which should give us necessary power to find an effect, even after drop outs.  

Pre and post analyses will be conducted to determine changes in the following:
1. Scores in the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) (self-report)
2. Scores in the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) (parent-report)

Comparisons will be made between the two conditions to determine if changes in symptoms are significantly different. 

These analyses will be conducted via a repeated measures analysis of variance via SPSS</statisticalmethods>
