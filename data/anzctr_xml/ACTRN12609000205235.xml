  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten sessions of physiotherapy functional restoration (30-minute sessions at variable frequency) over a 10-week period. This will involve core stabilising exercises, progressive functional exercises, and condition-specific education and advice.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers who respond to advertising, or who are referred by a medical practitioner or health care professional, will undergo a phone screening and baseline physical assessment to determine eligibility. Eligible volunteers who consent to participate will complete baseline outcome measures prior to being randomised to the functional restoration or advice group. This will be done by the assessor contacting an off-site trial administrator who will hold the randomisation schedule, and will not be involved in assessing, enrolling or treating participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher at La Trobe University who will have no contact with participants will generate a randomisation schedule prior to trial commencement. Permuted block randomisation with random block sizes will be undertaken using a web-based randomisation program. Randomisation will be stratified by developing a separate schedule for each of the 14 physiotherapy treatment clinics.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>All participants who are allocated to the functional restoration group will be invited to attend a one-on-one semi-structured interview at the completion of the 10-week intervention period to gain their perspectives on the treatment program.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this trial is to compare the outcomes and adverse events of two different physiotherapy treatment approaches for people with clinical and radiological confirmation of lumbar disc herniation with associated radiculopathy.
A secondary aim is to determine the perspectives of participants on the functional restoration program utilised in the trial.</summary>
