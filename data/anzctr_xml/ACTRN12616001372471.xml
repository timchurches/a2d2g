  <interventions>
    <interventions>GP-OSMOTIC is a 2-arm individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) in general practice comparing collaborative retrospective Continuous Glucose Monitoring (r-CGM) to usual care in people with T2D on maximum non-insulin hypoglycaemic therapy and/or insulin whose HbA1c is out-of-target. 

All General Practitioners (GPs) and Practice Nurses (PNs) will take part in an off-site 2 hour group-based, face-to-face training session. The training will be provided by a GP with a special interest in diabetes with minimum 5 years experience,  a Registered Nurse-Credentialed Diabetes Educator with minimum 5 years experience and a health psychologist with expertise in diabetes  self management and education. The training will involve a presentation about the rCGM device being used in the study (Abbott Libre Pro (c)), how to use the device and interpret the output, and will include a case-based discussion with role-playing vignettes )provided as short video clips) modelling a collaborative approach to  consulting with patients and using the rCGM output in discussing treatment intensification.

Patients randomised to the intervention will attend an individual  one-to-one, face-to-face Education Session of 60 minutes with the study Registered Nurse-Credentialed Diabetes Educator (RN-CDE). This will be held on-site at the patient's General Practice. This session will include instruction on how to wear the  rCGM device being used (Abbott Libre Pro (c)) and how to interpret the glucose reports from the device  in understanding diabetes self-management and in discussing treatment intensification with their GP. Brief supportive information about the device and about diabetes self-management (as commonly provided in diabetes education sessions) will be provided to patients. 

Intervention patients will be asked to wear the rCGM device for a period of 2 weeks every 3 months ie at baseline, 3,6,9 and 12 months, as well as having  an HbA1c at those times, and to consult with their GP and discuss the rCGM output glucose reports. This 3 monthly interval is  in keeping with clinical practice guidelines about step wise regular consideration of treatment intensification. The rCGM  device will be applied at  those 3 monthly intervals by the  GP clinic staff (ie the GP or Practice Nurse who have attended the health professional training). Patients and practices will be sent reminders to undertake this 3 monthly monitoring.

The training session for both health professionals and patients will cover collaborative interpretation of rCGM data in guiding treatment intensification. The aim of the training is to ensure that health professionals and patients have the knowledge, confidence and skills to work collaboratively to: 
1. support the use of r-CGM; 
2. interpret glucose patterns with a focus on 
*fasting &amp; postprandial levels, 
*detecting hyper- and hypoglycaemia, and 
*understanding glycaemic variability; 
3. discuss behaviour change &amp; 
4. discuss treatment intensification, drawing on current evidence-based clinical guidelines. 

Referral or consultation with an endocrinologist, CDE or any other appropriate health professional will be management options for GPs managing study patients.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomised to the control group will be managed  according to usual clinical care. IE this means that following the baseline data collection these patients will be managed in the way their GP staff usually and routinely manage people with diabetes in that practice. GP and patient will however be prompted to undertake 3 monthly diabetes reviews in keeping with clinical practice guidelines about step wise regular consideration of treatment intensification

Patients randomised to the control group will also attend an education session with a local CDE  (funded by the study if necessary to ensure financial barriers do not exist). We will assist with scheduling this for control group patients.

The  3-monthly review prompts and the one hour Diabetes Educator session for control patients  will standardise these exposures across both arms allowing us to isolate the effect of the rCGM device used in the intervention group</comparator>

    <concealment>Allocation is concealed. 

Eligibility is determined by study staff after meeting with potentially eligible patients at their General Practice. Patients will not be allocated until after study consent is obtained, baseline data is collected and baseline r-CGM trace is started (i.e. sensor attached) at that meeting. 

At that point, using  an electronic radio-button in RedCAP (c) electronic contact is made with an allocation schedule developed  "off-site" ie held at the University of Melbourne Deportment of General Practice.

</concealment>
    <sequence>We will use block randomisation at the practice level. ie  block randomisation sequences of 2,4 and 6 will be computer generated by the study statistician for each practice who participate and individual participating patients  at each practice site will be randomised. .  

Following completion of baseline data collection and attachment of the r-CGM sensor, patients will be allocated by clicking on an allocation button in the data collection form (using a tablet device).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size has 80% power to detect a difference in mean HbA1c of 0.5% with a standard deviation of 1.3 and an alpha of 0.05. The required number of participants in each arm is therefore 108 ie a total of 216.  Assuming a 20% attrition rate, this inflates to 270 (135 in each arm). Allowing for 10% clinic attrition and assuming 6 participants per clinic, this inflates to 50 clinics with 6 participants per clinic (150 in each arm). The minimum allowable number of participants in each clinic is 4.  

Clinic, GP and patient characteristics at baseline will be summarised for each study group and assessed for imbalance.  Mean HbA1c levels at baseline and 12 months will be plotted for each study arm. 

A linear mixed effects model (i.e. with both fixed effect for treatment effect and baseline outcome measure and random effect for clinic) will be used to estimate the group difference in HbA1c using restricted maximum likelihood estimation with adjustment for baseline Hba1c. The adjusted model will include age, history of hypoglycaemia and duration of diabetes as fixed effects in the model.  Any baseline characteristics that are imbalanced between study groups and associated with the outcome will also be adjusted for.  The secondary analysis will examine whether the intervention effect differs between those with and without a history of hypoglycaemia.  The same approach will be used to determine whether the intervention effect varies for those with a general HbA1c target compared to those with a personalised HbA1c target.  

An intention to treat approach will be utilised where participants will be analysed according to the group they were assigned and in using a mixed effects model all participants will be included in the analysis.  Reported measures will include the estimated mean HbA1c at 12 months for each study arm, the estimated mean difference in HbA1c between the two study arms, the estimated mean difference from target for each study arm and the estimated mean difference from target between the two groups.  

Sensitivity analysis
Under the mixed effects model, the missing data are assumed to be missing at random.  Under this assumption, the difference between the mean of the missing data and the mean of the observed data d, is zero. To test the robustness of the regression results in the absence of randomly missing data, a sensitivity analysis will be performed whereby plausible values for d other than 0 will be considered.  Positive values of d indicate that on average, participants with missing data have higher (worse) HbA1c than observed participants and negative values of d assume participants with missing data have lower (better) mean HbA1c than observed participants.  Regression results for plausible values of d will be analysed to determine whether study conclusions change in the absence of the missing at random assumption.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our aim is to test the effect of a new wearable device (a continuous glucose monitor) on the achievement of evidence-based targets for overall glucose levels (glycemic targets).

The general way of measuring glycaemic targes is to measure HbA1C in the blood, which gives an average of the glucose levels over the last 3 mths. Based on this measure about half of people with T2D in the community are not in the glycemic target of 53 mmol/mol.. We think knowing more about the day-to-day variation in glucose levels may be important, because that sort of information might help GP and patient to make more personalised and rational changes in treatment (including lifestyle changes and medicines).

Our research question are:
1. Does the judicious use of intermittent retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (r-CGM) in primary care improve glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c?
2. Is intermittent r-CGM cost-effective?

This is an individually randomised controlled trial set in General Practices in Victoria. Up to 60 practices and up to 300 patients will participate. Eligible patients are people with T2D who are out of glycaemic target despite moderately intensive therapy. People will be asked to complete a survey and have a blood test at the beginning and at 12 months. Patients randomised to the intervention group are asked to wear the r-CGM device every three months for a period of 2 weeks then to meet their GP to discuss it. Patients in the control group just continue to have usual diabetes care.</summary>
