  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study group patients will be provided with a Very Low Energy Diet (VLED) for 6 weeks (providing 1890-3192 kJ per day). Instructions and support will be given to each patient by a dietitian. Thereafter a hypocaloric diet will be introduced. According to VLED protocol, a physician will monitor patients electrolytes, liver function and pregnancy status. If a patient becomes pregnant they will switched immediately to a diet suitable for pregnancy. Patients will be given a pedometer and encouraged to increase their current activity level with the goal of reaching 10,000 steps 5 to 6 days a week. Patients will also be offered weekly group sessions for 12 weeks. These sessions will cover a wide range of weight and reproduction related topics, including diet and nutrition, the role of physical activity, psychological factors, and education regarding the reproductive consequences of obesity</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive the standard nutrition counselling provided by the Fertility Unit physicians and nurses. Subject will be encouraged to seek additional weight loss advice from their General Practitioner or if their BMI is = 35 kg/m2 from the Metabolism and Obesity Services at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is being undertaken because compared with normal weight women, obese women have lower fertility both in natural and ART cycles. Obesity is a risk factor for many maternal and fetal morbidities. Maternally these include an increased miscarriage rate, increased rates of pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, hypertension), increased operative delivery rates and increased thrombotic events. Fetal risks include increased congenital anomalies and birth injuries.</summary>
