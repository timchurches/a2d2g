    <interventions>Part 1

Bevacizumab plus carboplatin versus bevacizumab alone.

In Part 1, patients will be randomised as follows:

Arm A: Bevacizumab 10mg/kg given intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks until disease progression
Arm B: Bevacizumab 10mg/kg given intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks + carboplatin AUC 5 given IV every 4 weeks until disease progression

Part 2 

Effects of continuing or stopping bevacizumab after disease progression.

Following disease progression in Part 1 patients who are able and who consent to continue onto Part 2 of the study will receive further treatment as follows:

Patients who were in Arm A of the study will commence carboplatin chemotherapy AUC 5 IV every 4 weeks until disease progression. If a patient decides with their doctor that they are not suitable for further chemotherapy, they will receive best supportive care rather than carboplatin. Best supportive care involves treatments to assist with controlling the symptoms of cancer such as antibiotics and pain medication. Patients will then be randomised to cease bevacizumab (Arm C) or continue bevacizumab 10mg/kg, 2 weekly until disease progression (Arm D). 

Patients who were in Arm B of the study will cease carboplatin and choose between two chemotherapy agents (temozolomide or etoposide) in consultation with their doctor. As above, patients who are not suitable for additional chemotherapy may elect to receive best supportive care rather than etoposide or temozolomide. Patients will then be randomised to cease bevacizumab (Arm E) or continue bevacizumab 10mg/kg, 2 weekly  until disease progression (Arm F).</interventions>
    <comparator>Not applicable. There is currently no standard care for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. As such, neither treatment option can be considered a comparator/control treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival (PFS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary criterion for assessment of efficacy will be progression-free survival. PFS will be assessed by gadolinium-enhanced MRI (Gd-MRI), neurological examination, and steroid use. The decision on disease progression will be made based on: 1. Clinical history and physical examination prior to study entry and 4-weekly while on study treatment 2. Modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and modified Macdonald criteria to assess Gd-MRI scans at baseline, then 8-weekly or as clinically indicated until disease progression. 3. Steroid dose will be assessed at baseline, then every 2 weeks while on study treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective radiological response rate (according to modified RANO criteria and modified Macdonald criteria)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Gd-MRI scans will be performed at baseline, day 1 of cycle 2 (part 1 only), day 1 of cycle 3 (part 1 and 2) then 8 weekly at day 1 of alternate cycles (e.g. 5, 7, 9) during treatment (part 1 and 2). In addition, a Gd-MRI scan will only be performed every 2 months during followup (until objective radiological disease progression) on patients who have not previously demonstrated clinical or radiological disease progression (e.g. patients who have withdrawn due to toxicities).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cogstate neuro-cognitive function testing)</outcome>
      <timepoint>MMSE will be assessed at screening, at week 4, then every 4 weeks during treatment for both parts 1 and 2 of the study, as well as at the end of treatment visit and monthly during followup. 

Patients will do a practise CogState test before completing a formal test at screening, another test will be completed at baseline. Patients will then complete a formal CogState test every 4 weeks during treatment and monthly throughout followup.

Patients will attend followup assessments monthly for life.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life-Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Brain Cancer Module (QLQ-BN20), and the EuroQol Group EQ-5D questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening, every 4 weeks during treatment and at the end of treatment visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Corticosteroid dose will be obtained from the patients medical records by site staff and reported in the case report forms. At the time of each disease assessment the corticosteroid intake will be compared to corticosteroid intake at the time of the last disease assessment. The changes will be recorded as increased, unchanged or decreased. Increases and decreases in corticosteroid intake should be clinically justified and significant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening,  every 2 weeks during study treatment, end of treatment visit, then monthly during followup (until objective radiological disease progression)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening,  every 2 weeks during study treatment, end of treatment visit and 30 days after last study drug dose</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) is calculated from date of patient study randomisation to date of patient death from any cause. Survival follow-up information will be collected via telephone calls and/or clinic visits every 4 weeks until death, loss to follow-up, or study termination by the Sponsor. If the patient withdraws from study treatment but not from study follow-up, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., death registry records) to obtain information about survival status only.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monthly during followup.  Patients will attend followup assessments monthly for life.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to treatment failure</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time to treatment failure is calculated from the date of first (Part 1) or second (Part 2) randomisation to cessation of drug (separate for part 1 and part 2) due to progression, toxicity, death, patient refusal or any other cause.

Cessation in this context refers to the situation when the adminstration of a drug has been stopped due to disease progression, toxicity, death, patient refusal or any other cause.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of bevacizumab when combined with a type of chemotherapy called carboplatin in treating recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (a type of brain tumour).  

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you are a person with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (brain tumour) which has been previously treated with both radiotherapy and the drug temozolomide. 

Trial details
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group (Arm A) will receive bevacizumab intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression. The other group (Arm B) will receive bevacizumab intravenously every 2 weeks and carboplatin every 4 weeks until disease progression. Following disease progression, people in Arm A will receive carboplatin or best supportive care and either stop bevacizumab (Arm C) or continue bevacizumab (Arm D). People in Arm B will receive temozolomide or etopside or best supportive care and either stop bevacizumab (Arm E) or continue bevacizumab (Arm F). Best supportive care involves treatments to assist with controlling the symptoms of cancer such as antibiotics and pain medication. 

The study aims to measure the effectiveness of the different treatment regimes in terms of survival and well being.</summary>
