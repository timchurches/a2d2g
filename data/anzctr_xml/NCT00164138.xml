  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women with chronic lung disease characterised by chronic cough report urinary incontinence.
      Recently there have been reports of increased urinary incontinence in girls and women with
      cystic fibrosis. While coughing is a known risk factor for stress incontinence, other risk
      factors and causes are poorly understood in this population. Treatment of incontinence for
      patients with chronic lung disease is also poorly addressed, adding to the burden of disease
      for women with chronic lung disease, carers and the health system. This project will estimate
      the prevalence of women with CF and COPD compared to healthy age matched controls and will
      evaluate the effect of a specific treatment and management program for these patients. The
      results will be disseminated to respiratory health professionals. We hypothesise that women
      with chronic cough will have a higher incidence of urinary incontinence than healthy controls
      and that a specific treatment program will result in alleviation of the problems and improved
      quality of life.</summary>
