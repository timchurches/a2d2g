    <interventions>The study uses a randomized controlled trial design, with people in the treatment condition (active enrichment group) compared to those in the non-treatment condition. (passive enrichment group). The enrichment programme is for a period of 8 months.
Those allocated to the active enrichment programme will complete various physical exercise activities, on a weekly basis, done in small groups, tailored to ability and preference (See #1 below). These will be supervised by a registered physiotherapist. These physical exercise  sessions will be 40-50 mins long and will normally take place at the same time each week in the same place. The physiotherapist will assess movement skills and monitor progress. Participants will also complete a set of thinking and memory exercises (see #2 below). These thinking exercises will be given to participants fortnightly by members of the research team from the New Zealand Brain Research Institute. Progress on these exercises will be monitored by the researchers and new cognitive exercises will be provided as the previous ones are completed.. These thinking and memory exercises will be completed with a caregiver/spouse or research staff member in the participants own home. We anticipate the cognitive exercises will take around 40-60 minutes on a weekly basis.. Cognitive tasks will include different types of pencil and paper exercises or tasks that require a verbal response.  The level of difficulty of each cognitive task will be tailored to maximise improvements on each of them. A research team member will also talk with participants about common events in the past (e.g. family life and weddings). With permission, they will also record these descriptions of the events (a copy will be available to participants).

#1 Physical Activities:
Participants physical abilities were assessed by a qualified physiotherapist. On that basis they engaged in a suitably tailored circuit of activities consisting of aerobic, balance and strengthening exercises after a warm-up. Examples of each of these exercises include a exercise bike (aerobic), use of hand weights (strength) and walking a beam for balance. The participants are encouraged to work at an intensity that is Somewhat hard using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Emoticon Chart. 

#2 Cognitive Activities:
Examples included elaborating vivid memories of personal events using personal prompts and reminders; envisioning a future event; visual-spatial puzzles; selective attention, mental rotation.

Adherence to the programme was assessed by records of attendance at the physiotherapy sessions (physiotherapists) and by return of completed cognitive activities folders. (Psychology PhD students and Research Coordinator).</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care group, described as a passive enrichment group because they will be asked to continue with usual activities and usual medical care for 8 months, but in addition they will  receive contact from the research team, maintain weekly diaries and receive various disease-relevant questionnaires. Purpose of the contact was to approximate the contact made for those in the intervention group. Phone contact occurred at 4-6 week intervals with additional contact when needed (Email or postal) and at least 3 face-face contacts during the intervention period.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be collected from ~200 PD patients (from a pool of ~400 patients in Chch and ~350 in Otago/Southland) over 16 months using the screen, followed by in-depth data from a minimum of 40 PD participants. This feasibility trial will provide measures of variability to power larger phase II/phase III studies. We will recruit 20 pre-MCI patients per arm assigned by random stratification on key variables into each arm to balance variables of initial cognitive screening score, age, years of education and PD duration. The inital screen is expected to enrol 40 Pre-MCI PD patients. Achieving 80% power would require an extra 30/arm if our trial indicated a clinically relevant standardised RCT difference on the primary outcome of 0.4 (ANCOVA, with adjustment of R-sq of 0.5 for baseline x retest cognition). Additional analyses will test the association, across all patients, between cognitive change in the trial and (a) pre-existing factors (premorbid IQ; education; engagement in cognitive activities), (b) cognitive and physical activity during the trial, irrespective of group allocation; and (c) a composite measure, excluding cognition, of non-dopaminergic PD features. An a priori minimum protocol compliance of 4 months (or equivalent) will be used for the intention-to-treat analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine whether a lifestyle programme is beneficial in people who have been diagnosed with Parkinsons disease (PD). The lifestyle programme will use a combination of (1) physical exercises and (2) thinking-based exercises over an 8 month period. If you agree to take part, you will be randomly assigned to either the lifestyle programme or the standard care group. Please note that you will have a fifty-fifty chance of getting into either group. You will not be able to choose which group you want to be in.</summary>
