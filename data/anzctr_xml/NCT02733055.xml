  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stability Score - The Stability Score (calculated as percentage ratio of the actual sway and the theoretical limit of stability) will be used to investigate if there is any difference between the test without and with oculomotor task. Statistical tools such t-tests and correlation coefficients will be used to assess if there is a difference between the two tests</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after data collection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>average velocity moment [mm^2/s] - The average velocity moment (calculated as as the product of sway velocity path length) will be used to investigate if there is any difference between the test without and with oculomotor task. Statistical tools such t-tests and correlation coefficients will be used to assess if there is a difference between the two tests</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after data collection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>sway path length [mm] - The sway path length (the distance traveled during the test) will be used to investigate if there is any difference between the test without and with oculomotor task. Statistical tools such t-tests and correlation coefficients will be used to assess if there is a difference between the two tests</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after data collection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>frequency content [Hz] - The frequency content (calculated using FFT) will be used to investigate if there is any difference between the test without and with oculomotor task. Statistical tools such t-tests and correlation coefficients will be used to assess if there is a difference between the two tests</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after data collection</timepoint>
