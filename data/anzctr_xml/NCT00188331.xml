    <exclusivecriteria>-  Any major pre-existing psychiatric history or dementia, alcohol abuse, or currently

             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Active cancer within the last 5 years other than squamous or basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin or cervical cancer in situ (except for CRC)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study to evaluate fatigue and cognitive function
      in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with chemotherapy, and in patients with the
      same malignancy, that do not receive chemotherapy. A self-report questionnaire for fatigue
      (the FACT-F), and validated tests of cognitive function, will be applied at predetermined
      times before, during and after chemotherapy, to determine the incidence, severity and
      duration of these symptoms. Comparisons will be made in changes in cognition for individuals,
      as well as between the chemotherapy and the control group. Mechanisms that might lead to
      fatigue and/or cognitive decline will be investigated.</summary>
