  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dopamine vs dobutamine by continuous intravenous infusion. Two dosage steps for each drug. 10 and 20 micrograms/kg/min. If Doppler ultrasound measures of systemic blood flow increased on 10 microgram/kg/min then they remain on that dose. If no increase in systemic blood flow at 10 micrograms/kg/min then they increased to 20 micrograms/kg/min. If they increased systemic blood flow on 20 micrograms/kg/min then they remain on that dose. If no increase in systemic blood flow at 20 micrograms/kg/min then crossover immediately to the other drug with no washout period and the dose escalation process repeated with the other syringe (drug). The infusion was maintained until 24 hours of age then weaned at the discretion of the treating medical staff.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low systemic blood flow in the early hours after birth is a common problem in very preterm babies. It is associated with a range of adverse outcomes. This trial aims to test the efficacy of the two commonly used inotropes in preterm babies. Inotropes are drugs that improve the pumping performance of the heart.</summary>
