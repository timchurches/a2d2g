  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises 8 modules of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to be delivered weekly online PLUS treatment as usual.  Each module takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.

The 8 CBT modules incorporate standard CBT approaches commonly used with young people: engagement and agenda setting; emotional recognition and distress tolerance; identification of negative automatic thinking; behavioural activation - help-seeking and activity scheduling (including relaxation techniques); problem solving, with a specific focus on managing suicidal ideation; detecting and challenging problematic thinking, and cognitive restructuring.

The website also comprises: 2 activities per week (for example completing a mood or activity diary), a message board via which the participant can communicate with the research-therapist; a series of factsheets covering a range of related topics; plus downloadable MP3s.  In addition the website lists a range of local and national helplines and services that the participant can access if in crisis.

Practitioner involvement is two-fold. First, the school counsellor will facilitate delivery of the program and will check responses to a weekly 'suicide screen'. Second, there will be involvement from a research-therapist who will remain un-blinded. She will check completed activities and respond with personalised but standardised messages. She will also check the message board and respond accordingly. </interventions>

    <concealment>Participants (n=170) will be recruited over a 2-year period via each schoolâ€™s student wellbeing coordinator (SWC).  Following obtaining written consent, a baseline assessment will be conducted to ascertain eligibility. If eligible, the participant will be randomised into the treatment or control group by using a randomisation list prepared by an independent statistician. The randomisation list (generated using random number generator computer software) is stratified by school and is incorporated into an online randomisation computer program. After each randomisation, the project manager will inform the SWC concerned, who will then administer the appropriate treatment to the participant.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation:The primary outcome of interest is changes in suicidal ideation from baseline measured at ten and 20 weeks. This will be measured by the SIQ. No previous studies have tested the effects of an Internet-based CBT intervention on suicidal ideation, however one previous study has reported moderate to large effect sizes in terms of reduced suicidal ideation, for face-to-face CBT among young people. If we assume that alpha is set at 0.05 and power at 0.80, then a sample size of 58 is required for each of the two groups (total n = 116) to detect a medium effect size. This is based on using the general linear model to compare the intervention and control groups with the baseline values of an outcome measure as the covariate. It is assumed (conservatively) that the covariate would explain 10% of the variance in the dependent variable. Using data from the pilot study, the intra-cluster correlation corresponding to the schools is estimated to be 0.023, which in turn gives an estimate of 1.1 for the design effect. So in order to take account of the clustering effect of the schools, the sample size needs to be inflated to 128 (116 x 1.1).
A previous RCT conducted by the study team with a similar population had a dropout rate of 24%. The proposed study differs in that the intervention will be delivered by school staff and all follow-up assessments will be conducted at school. It will also employ a shorter follow-up period, however we have estimated a dropout rate of 24% meaning that we need to recruit 169 students (128/0.76) into the study. We estimate that we can get about 6 students from each school, so we need to recruit 28 schools.


Statistical analysis:  At each follow-up time point the general linear model will test for the treatment factor, i.e. to compare the intervention and control groups for each outcome measure. Corresponding baseline values of each outcome measure will be used as the covariate. In addition, possible effect of site will be examined by introducing a school factor in the analysis. Multi-level modeling will be used to compare the two groups in terms of the trend over time for each outcome. Both last observation carried forward and multiple imputation techniques will be considered if missing data are substantial. Interim analysis will be conducted twice yearly, or upon request to facilitate the safety monitoring of the project. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test the efficacy of the Reframe-IT program in
reducing suicidal ideation, hopelessness and depression in school students.  The study also aims to determine if the program leads to increased confidence and perceived skill, and / or changes in practice among school wellbeing staff who are implementing the program.

The program is a personalised and interactive website which delivers 8 modules of cognitive behavioural therapy over approximately 8 weeks. The program is delivered via a series of videos depicting an adult 'host' and 4 young people who post a weekly video
diary reflecting on their experiences. There are weekly activities, a message board and adjunctive therapist involvement. 
The program differs from existing Internet-based programs in that it: has been purpose-designed for young people; is interactive rather than text-based; and is designed to be a tool for
student wellbeing staff to use specifically with suicidal students. 

The program has been subject to a pilot study (ACTRN12611000866909) which used a before-and-after design. Findings have shown an overall reduction in suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and hopelessness among participants over the course of the program. 

We will now test its efficacy in a randomised controlled trial with 170 students from up to 28 Melbourne high schools. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks) and 12-week follow-up. 

Hypotheses are that, when compared to treatment as usual, the program will lead to:

1. Reduced suicidal ideation
2. Reduced depressive symptoms
3. Reduced hopelessness
4. Reduced symptoms of anxiety
5. Increased problem solving skills
