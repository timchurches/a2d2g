  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be exposed to three 1-h conditions in random order: watching television, sedentary video game play, and computer game play. Television is considered the exposure condition. During each condition the subject will have access to a variety or food and drink. Each subject will undergo a 1-week washout period between conditions.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Between-group difference in energy intake (kcal consumed) during the 1h exposure (TV versus sedentary video game, and TV versus computer game).
Energy intake will be calculated by multiplying the grams/mLs consumed by the energy density (kcal/g or kcal/mL) for the different food and drink types. Energy densities will be those provided by the food manufacturers (as stated on the labels) or from standardised nutritional values (FOODfiles).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1h (immediately after exposure).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Amount of food (g) consumed.
Food will be weighed before and after the exposure period, with differences in weights being the number of grams of food consumed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1h (immediately after exposure).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite
Appetite will be assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>0h (before exposure) and 1h (immediately after exposure).</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hunger 
Hunger will be assessed using a VAS, which ranges from 0 (I am not hungry at all) to 10 (I have never been hungrier).</outcome>
      <timepoint>0h (before exposure) and 1h (immediately after exposure).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satiety
Satiety will be assessed using a VAS, which ranges from 0 (I am completely empty) to 10 (I cannot eat another bite).</outcome>
      <timepoint>0h (before exposure) and 1h (immediately after exposure).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

Fullness will be assessed using a VAS, which ranges from 0 (not at all full) to 10 (totally full).</outcome>
      <timepoint>0h (before exposure) and 1h (immediately after exposure).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prospective food consumption (i.e. how much do you think you can eat?)
Prospective food consumption will be assessed using a VAS, which ranges from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (a lot).</outcome>
      <timepoint>0h (before exposure).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Desire to eat something sweet (i.e. would you like to eat something sweet?)
This will be assessed using a VAS, which ranges from 0 (yes, very much) to 10 (no, not at all).</outcome>

      <timepoint>0h (before exposure) and 1h (immediately after exposure).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Memory for food consumed.
Subjects will be asked to list the food and drinks they remember eating/drinking during the previous hour and whether they ate/drank the whole portion or not.</outcome>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified from the list of ineligible subjects from the SWITCH (Screen ­time Weight­loss 
Intervention Targeting Children and Home) trial. The SWITCH trial, which is currently being conducted in our department, requires participants to be overweight or obese. There is a list of boys whose caregivers/parents were interested in taking part in SWITCH but who were ineligible due to their body weight. SWITCH researchers will ask the caregivers of ineligible boys for permission for an ESSAY researcher to 
contact them. If they agree, participants will be contacted by phone by trained study personnel and the ESSAY 
study will be explained in detail. If they express interest, the child will be screened for eligibility. A baseline 
assessment appointment will be arranged with eligible participants. At the baseline 
appointment the researcher will go through the information sheets and consent forms and ensure that the 
participant and parent/caregiver understand that participation is voluntary, this will also be outlined in the Consent 
Form. Subjects will then be randomised using a central computer system. Allocation concealment will be maintained up until the point of randomisation using this method.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>More than one third of NZ children and young people are overweight or obese. Young people spend an average of 3h 40 min/day engaged in screen-based sedentary activities, such as watching TV, which have been linked to overweight. Proposed mechanisms to explain this relationship include the effects of advertising and displacement of physical activity; however, the adverse effects of screen­-based activities on food intake provide the strongest evidence to explain the relationship. Recent research suggests that children may eat more while watching TV and playing video games compared with sitting quietly. However, no studies have compared the effects of different screen-based activities on food intake. This study aims to compare the effects of television viewing, sedentary video game play, and computer game play on food and drink intake in children and adolescents. A better understanding of how food consumption differs between these activities will help inform future programs aimed at decreasing sedentary behaviours and body weight.</summary>
