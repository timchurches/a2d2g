    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participant identification numbers were marked onto opaque sealed envelopes containing group allocation. The envelopes were opened in sequential order by an external clinical trials pharmacist as participants enrolled in the study. Once baseline assessments were complete, those who consented were randomly allocated to either of the four treatment groups.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocations to the four treatment arms were computer-generated, stratified by admission accommodation (community; residential care), and randomized in blocks</sequence>
