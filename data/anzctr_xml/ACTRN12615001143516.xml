    <designfeatures>When all subjects in a single-dose dose cohort have completed the Day 5 visit, the Sponsor and the investigator(s) will review the available safety data. In the multiple-dose cohort, safety will be reviewed during the dosing period, after Day 8 and Day 15. If 2 or more subjects administered RA101495 in a dose cohort experienced a dose-limiting toxicity, then escalation to the next dose level will not proceed. The Sponsor and the investigator together may choose one of the following alternative actions:
*De-escalate, i.e., initiate an additional cohort either at the prior dose level or at an intermediate dose between the current and prior levels
*Terminate the study

If dose escalation is permissible, then based on the review of the data, the Sponsor and the investigator may choose one of the following actions:
*Escalate to the next planned dose level
*Escalate to an intermediate dose below the next planned level
*Repeat one of the completed dose levels

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a first in human, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single dose, escalating dose and Multiple-Dose study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of RA101495 in healthy volunteers to evaluate safety of RA101495. There will be up to 5 single dose cohorts with doses of 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40 and 0.80 mg/kg. There will be up to 2 multiple dose cohorts with doses of 0.20 and 0.40 mg/kg. Study drug will be administered on Day1 for single dose cohorts and on Day1-7 for multiple dose cohorts  as a single SC injection and the amount of drug given will depend on the dose of the cohort and the weight of the subject. Each cohort will be dosed a minimum of 7 days for single days cohorts and 14 days for multiple dose cohorts after the first subject in the previous cohort received the last dose. If 2 or more subjects administered RA101495 in a dose cohort experience a dose-limiting toxicity, dose administration in that cohort will stop and escalation to the next dose level will not proceed.</summary>
