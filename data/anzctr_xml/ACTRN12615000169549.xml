  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pilot RCT - 20 patients who have not previously been diagnosed with CRS and are on the waiting list for endoscopic sinus surgery, but have not yet undergone surgery. Patients will not undergo surgery during the study period. Patients will have not had antibiotics or oral steroids for at least 4 weeks.

To assess the effect of doxycycline and prednisone on the microbiome of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Patients will be swabbed before and after therapy. Drug monitoring will be by patient recorded journal and drug tablet return.

Arm1
100mg doxycycline orally, twice daily for one week.

Arm2
30mg prednisone orally, once daily for one week.</interventions>
    <comparator>As swabs are taken before and after therapy, each patient will serve as their own control. Doxycycline will be considered to be the comparator treatment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study is to investigate and compare the microbiological effects of two types of medications which are used routinely by patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (antibiotics and oral steroids). In current practice around the world both drugs are commonly used either separately or together, however the effect of each drug on the complex microbial communities is not known.

We anticipate that better understandings of the effect of our current medical management on the microbiome will help us in the future to develop and deliver more targeted therapy to our patients.</summary>
