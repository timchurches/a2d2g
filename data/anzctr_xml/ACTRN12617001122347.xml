  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hysterectomy (removal of womb and ovaries)considered the most common treatment for symptomatic adenomyosis. However due to its  association with perioperative , postoperative morbidity, decreased quality of life and high healthcare costs,it looks wise to find another non surgical  treatment. Hysterectomy is also not appropriate for women who wish to preserve their fertility and  availability of  a noninvasive approach for the treatment of adenomyosis may be preferable for most women and could reduce the burden on healthcare systems by a major reduction in surgical intervention.  Untill now no proved evidence for any mode of treatment. this study tried to find appropriate medical treatment for this problem.</summary>
