  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. HD patients who are randomized into the treatment group will receive 40 minutes of far infrared therapy (FIR  therapy) during hemodialysis three times per week for a year. 
2. A Wide Spectrum (WS) TY101 FIR emitter (WS Far Infrared Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) will be used for FIR therapy. Its generated wavelengths range between 3 and 25 microm (a peak between 5 and 6 microm). The top radiator will be set at a height of 25 cm above the surface of the AV fistula with the treatment time set at 40 minutes during HD thrice a week for a year.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary end point was the survival time of the AV fistula with unassisted patency, which was defined as the time from the commencement of the study to the first episode of fistula malfunction. We defined AV fistula malfunction as the need for any interventional procedure (surgery or angioplasty) to correct an occlusive or malfunctioning fistula which can not sustain an extracorporeal blood flow greater than 200 ml/min during HD after excluding the following stenosis-unrelated events, such as infectious complication, progressive aneurysmal formation, or steal syndrome.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Access blood flow: The access flow (Qa) was measured during HD by ultrasound dilution method using the Transonic hemodialysis monitor (HD02, Transonic Systems, Inc., Ithaca, New York). The technique uses two ultrasound sensors attached to the two HD tubing lines, one to the arterial and the other to the venous catheters, approximately 3 to 5 inches from the connection of the tubing to the dialysis needles. Initially, tubing lines are reversed, and ultrafiltration is turned off. A measured bolus of saline (10 ml) is injected into the venous catheter, resulting in changes in sound velocity that are measured by the transducers on the catheters. This change is then calculated by the Transonic software, giving the result of Qa (ml/min). If Qa could not be obtained by this method, it would be measured by the variable pump flow-based doppler ultrasound method.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vascular access malfunction, usually presenting with an inadequate access flow (Qa), is the leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization in hemodialysis (HD) patients. A shorter length polymorphism with Guanine Thymine repeat number [(GT)n] &gt;30 in the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene was associated with better prognosis of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Many methods of thermal therapy have been tried for improving Qa but with limited effects. This randomized trial is designed to evaluate (1) the effect of far infrared therapy (FIR) on access flow and patency of the native arteriovenous  fistula (AVF) and (2) the interaction between HO-1 length polymorphism and FIR therapy on access flow (Qa) and patency of arteriovenous  fistula (AVF) in HD patients.</summary>
