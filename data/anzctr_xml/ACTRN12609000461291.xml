    <interventions>Goal Management Training.  Briefly, in this instance, the training involves one hour sessions once per week over a period of three weeks.  The training is conducted with the clinician using the personal digital assistant to set the goals and their relevant tasks.  The patients then use these programmed tasks in their training.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Goal setting is a core strategy in rehabilitation. However, engagement in goal related processes is complex and difficult for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Interventions to prevent goal failure are urgently required.   


The aim of this study is to test the utility and acceptability of a Goal Management Training Personal Device (GMT-PD). In the first phase, six healthy participants evaluate the device.  In the second phase, six TBI sufferers evaluate it.  Observational, interview and questionnaire data will be collated to explore the utility, functionality and acceptability of the GMT-PD. 


Novel goal management strategies appear to have potential to facilitate goal directed behaviour and enhance the self regulation skills, thereby improving mood, motivation and a sense of self. Given that rehabilitation resources are limited, it is crucial we find new ways to enable people to learn and practice these skills that are so impacted on by brain injury.</summary>
