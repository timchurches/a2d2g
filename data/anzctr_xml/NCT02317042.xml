Other: Phase I: Intellgent Volume Assured Pressure Support (iVAPS) - iVAPS is a type of respiratory support ventilation. It is used to treat people with respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure or hypoventilation. It is commercially available. iVAPS is the predicate therapy for the Experimental therapy: Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (AutoEPAP) iVAPS.
iVAPS delivers two air pressures (one for inspiration and a second for expiration) and provides a back-up breathing rate. Collectively, this optimises ventilation and ensures a target alveolar ventilation is achieved.

Experimental: Phase I: AutoEPAP iVAPS - AutoEPAP iVAPS is a proposed new type of respiratory support ventilation. It is used to treat people with respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure or hypoventilation, AND introduces the treatment of upper airway obstruction (i.e. sleep apnea). It is being developed by AutoEPAP iVAPS delivers two air pressures (one for inspiration and a second for expiration) and provides a back-up breathing rate. It is similar to iVAPS, but it introduces an auto-adjusting expiratory pressure to treat airway obstruction.

Other: Phase II: Spontaneous Timed (ST) mode - ST mode is another type of respiratory support ventilation, and is, historically, the commonly used ventilation therapy. It is used to treat people with respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure or hypoventilation. It is commercially available.
ST mode delivers two air pressures (one for inspiration and a second for expiration) and provides a back-up breathing rate. Collectively, this optimises ventilation using pressure ventilation.

Experimental: Phase II: AutoEPAP iVAPS - AutoEPAP iVAPS is a proposed new type of respiratory support ventilation. It is used to treat people with respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure or hypoventilation, AND introduces the treatment of upper airway obstruction (i.e. sleep apnea). It is being developed by AutoEPAP iVAPS delivers two air pressures (one for inspiration and a second for expiration) and provides a back-up breathing rate. It is similar to iVAPS, but it introduces an auto-adjusting expiratory pressure to treat airway obstruction.


Treatment: devices: Juno
'Juno' is the ventilator unit. It will have a flow generator which will deliver air pressure to the participant during sleep. It will have a water tub for humidification, and a single tube circuit which will be connected to a vented face mask. It will have the ventilator programs: Spontaneous Timed (ST) mode, Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (iVAPS) and Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (AutoEPAP) iVAPS programed into the software. It is also compatible with &lt;4 L/min oxygen therapy. It is for people who weight at least 13 kg (when in ST mode), or at least 30 kg (when in iVAPS or AutoEPAP iVAPS modes).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new therapy (Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway
      Pressure with intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (AutoEPAP iVAPS)) designed to treat
      respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure and/or nocturnal hypoventilation with upper
      airway obstruction. The study will be performed in two phases: In a sleep unit and in the
      home environment. The new therapy will be compared against two existing ventilator therapies:
      "Spontaneous Timed (ST) mode" and "Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (iVAPS)".</summary>
