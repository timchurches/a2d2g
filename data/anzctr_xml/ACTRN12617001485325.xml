  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project will be a single centre, one-armed interventional trial. 15 patients will undergo an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) procedure. During the procedure, a small tube (the endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and passed down the oesophagus into the stomach and proximal small bowel for visual examination of the upper gut by the physician. The endoscope will be removed and provided the endoscopic examination of the upper gut is normal a stitching device (Overstitch, Apollo Endosurgery) will be attached to the endoscope tip. Then the endoscope will be re-inserted and used to stitch the walls of the stomach together to create a smaller volume residual stomach in the form of a tube. This usually requires between 3 and 5 stitches to be placed. These stitches will remain in the stomach indefinitely but can potentially be removed if required. After the procedure the physician will assess and decide if a patient can be discharged the same day or if they may need to stay overnight in hospital so the physician can monitor and treat potential post-procedural symptoms (e.g. nausea, discomfort). 
Investigations will be performed at baseline, immediately prior to their ESG and following their ESG procedure. Patients will follow our protocolled testing as well as medical and allied health protocolled review as per our follow up schedule over a 12 month follow up period. </interventions>
    <comparator>The data will be compared to the study group baseline characteristics and to the results of a currently still ongoing trial conducted at our Department. In this ongoing trial a group of 15 patients underwent a temporary duodenal-jejunal bypass sleeve insertion (Endobarrier; GI Dynamics Inc., Lexington, Massachusetts, USA) (HREC/QPAH/15/246), which is a different endoscopic bariatric therapy.
The comparator study commenced on 16/11/2015 and will be completed 01/07/2018.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to observe the effects of an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty utilising the overstitch procedure for the treatment of obesity and diabetes which is an increasing problem in our community.
During the procedure, a small tube (the endoscope) is inserted through your mouth and passed down your oesophagus into the stomach and proximal small bowel for visual examination of the upper gut by the physician.
The endoscope will be removed and provided the endoscopic examination of your upper gut was normal a stitching device (Overstitch, Apollo Endosurgery) will be attached to the endoscope tip. Then the endoscope will be reinserted and used to stitch the walls of the stomach together to create a smaller volume residual stomach in the form of a tube. This usually requires between 3 and 5 stitches to be placed. These stitches will remain in the
stomach indefinitely but can potentially be removed if required.
This study will also look to assess the following outcomes
	Weight loss - assessed via weight on digital scales at each appointment
	Health related quality of life as measured by the SF-36v2
	Psychological wellbeing measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
	Pancreatic exocrine functional testing as measured by a 13C labeled mixed  triglyceride breath test as measured by a 13C labeled mixed  triglyceride breath test
	Fasting insulin measured via blood assay
	Composite secondary outcome measure of cardiopulmonary reserve and exercise capacity measured by a 6 minute walk test
	Fasting Blood glucose measured by blood assay
	Stool microbiome community profiling will enable characterisation of the bacterial diversity of the gastric and duodenal mucosa-associated microbiome.
	Gastric emptying as measured by 13C Octanoid breath test 
	Liver function measured by non-invasive hepatic elastography.
	Body composition assessment as measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
	Visceral sensitivity as measured by a Standard Nutrient challenge test.
	Self reported diet quality as measured by diet history and 24 hour recall
	Gastrointestinal 
This study will enroll 15 obese type 2 diabetic patients (males and females) recruited from the Obesity clinic run by the Department of Endocrinology, general practice referrals or on the waiting list for another study HREC/QPAH/15/246. Patients will be followed up for a period of 1 year from the time of procedure and assessed for changes in the above mentioned variables throughout the follow up period.
The data will be compared to the study group baseline characteristics and to the results of a currently still ongoing trial conducted at our Department. In this ongoing trial a group of 15 patients underwent a temporary duodenaljejunal bypass sleeve insertion 
(HREC/QPAH/15/246).</summary>
