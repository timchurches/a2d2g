  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies have shown that high protein diets containing lean cuts of meat can improve body composition. Lean pork as part of a high protein diet has not been studied. 

Data from our previous trial demonstrated that regularly eating lean fresh pork was not detrimental to cardiovascular health and in fact improved indices of body composition.  These improvements were evident after only 3 months of eating pork (compared with habitual diets) and were achieved without restricting energy intake and while total protein intake (from all dietary sources) remained the same for both groups throughout the intervention.  These data indicate that the changes in body composition seen are unlikely to be solely a protein related effect however we are unable to say if the changes in body composition were specific to pork or to pork protein or whether consumption of other high protein meat diets may have had the same benefit.  

Therefore the aim of the current project is to conduct a 3 month dietary intervention trial to compare the effect on body composition of regular consumption of lean pork with that of two other commonly consumed meats in the Australian diet, namely chicken and beef.  

We aim to demonstrate that regular consumption of pork is no worse, and possibly better, than the main alternative meat options in terms of improving indices of body composition.</summary>
