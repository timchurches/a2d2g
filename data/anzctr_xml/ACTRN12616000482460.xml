    <interventions> The first 30 participants will be randomised to receive a once daily oral administration of placebo, 200mg or 400 mg BGP-15.  After exposure for 3 months, the DMC will assess safety and recommend a single daily oral dose (200mg or 400mg) of BGP-15.  For the first 30 participants, if the recommended dose is 200mg BGP-15, all those on 400mg are reduced to 200mg daily doses for the remainder of the 12 months of treatment.  The 200mg dose group and the placebo group stay on their respective doses for the remainder of the 12 months of therapy.  If the recommended dose is 400 mg, all treatment groups remain the on the same dosage for the remainder of the 12 months of treatment.  This results in the 200 mg dose group staying at this dosage for the entire 12 months of treatment.  For Part B, the final 60 participants will receive either placebo or the recommended dose of BGP-15 for the entire 12 months of treatment.  Adherence will be assessed by self reporting of the quantity of remaining capsules.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability compared between placebo and drug treatment.  Safety will be assessed by blood tests (FBE, LFT, UEC) and the total number and severity of adverse events as well as the number and severity of treatment related adverse events. Tolerability refers to the ability of the participant to tolerate the adverse events. Tolerability will assessed by analysis of dropout rates specifically due to adverse events. Given the small number of previous studies and adverse event profile has not yet emerged from the recorded incidences of AEs and SAEs.  The side effects previously reported in studies with placebo and BGP-15 include mild to moderate increases in appetite and weight gain, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea and diarrhoea, fatigue or sleepiness. Less common side effects include mild changes to ECG rhythm and moderate increases in liver enzymes.  </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the safety and effect of 12 months of BGP-15 treatment on heart function in people with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.  This is a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive design study of orally administered BGP-15 in patients with evidence of increased cardiac fibrosis as suggested by cardiac MR imaging.  Safety monitoring will be conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months of drug therapy.  Efficacy will be assessed by cardiac MR, echocardiography and exercise capacity tests at baseline, 6 months and 12 months.  The adaptive design study has 2 parts.  Part A involves treatment of 30 participants with placebo and 2 doses of BGP-15.  Safety analysis by an independent DMC will recommend an on-going dose for Part B (or termination if required).  Part B involves 60 patients treated with placebo and one dose of BGP-15. </summary>
