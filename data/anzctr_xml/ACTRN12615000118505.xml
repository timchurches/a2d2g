  <interventions>
    <interventions>0.7mg intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) administered during cataract surgery. Followup will be offered monthly, with Ozurdex retreatment up to 4 monthly as clinically indicated. The overall intervention period for this trial will be 12 months. The implant does not need to be removed (it dissolves over time).</interventions>
    <comparator>1.25mg/0.5ml intravitreal Bevacizumab administered during cataract surgery. Followup will be offered monthly, with Bevacizumab retreatment up to monthly as clinically indicated. The overall intervention period for this trial will be 12 months. </comparator>

      <outcome>Adverse events. Known adverse effects specific to this drug include increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. IOP will be measured at each visit and treated as required. Development of cataract will not be of concern in this study as the implant will be administered at the time of, and subsequent to cataract surgery. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of visual loss in people with diabetes. Regular injections with the anti-VEGF agent Bevacizumab remain the current standard of care for DME involving the fovea, but this regimen is impractical in central Australia. Limiting injections to 4 monthly with Ozurdex may be as effective as the currently used Bevacizumab injections. </summary>
