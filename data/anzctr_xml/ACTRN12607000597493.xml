    <concealment>Researchers will screen potential participants for eligibility, using the stated inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Eligible volunteers will then provide their written informed consent.  The researchers will then contact the study coordinator, who is at a central administration site.  The study coordinator will then randomise the session order for each participant, using custom computer software.  The session order will remain concealed from the researchers and participants.  Participants will receive anodal TDCS, cathodal TDCS, and sham TDCS in 3 separate sessions, at least one week apart.</concealment>
    <sequence>The session order for each participant will be randomised and counterbalanced by the study coordinator using customised software.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The type of intervention delivered in each session will be controlled by customised software, programmed by the study coordinator, in such a way that the other researchers and participant cannot know which intervention is being delivered.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Following stroke, the side of the brain affected by the stroke is often under-active.  This may limit its ability to recover function.  The purpose of this study is to see whether the activity of the stroke-affected side of the brain can be increased, using a technique called Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS).  TDCS is a safe, non-invasive and painless way of altering the activity levels of neurons in the brain.  This study will trial 3 different TDCS protocols, to see which is the most effective at producing a short-term increase in the activity of the stroke-affected side of the brain.  In particular, the speed and skill of hand movements will be measured before and after a 20 minute period of TDCS, in addition to other neurophysiological measures of brain activity.  Our hypothesis is that TDCS can be individually targeted, based on the parts of the brain affected by stroke, in a way that may enhance the benefits of physical therapy. If we find that TDCS is effective, this may lead to a larger scale trial, integrating TDCS with physical therapy, where it may improve functional outcomes.</summary>
