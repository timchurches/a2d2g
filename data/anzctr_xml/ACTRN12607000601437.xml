    <interventions>The main objective of this prospective randomised study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the two Intraocular Lenses (IOL) (Alcon IOL and Tecsoft IOL) in human eyes for the treatment of cataracts. The Tecsoft IOL will be the intervention IOL and the comparator will be the Alcon IOL. The assessment of the IOL results will be based on a comparison to the patients preoperative condition (i.e. best spectacle corrected visual acuity and uncorrected vision) and the achieved versus expected visual and refractive outcomes, as well as an analysis of reported complications. 
The patients will be followed for a one year period at intervals of 0-2 months before surgery, day of surgery (day 0), 1 week postoperative, 1 month postoperative, 6 months postoperative, 12 months postoperative.
The benefit from the two IOLs studied being equivalent is that the very significantly cheaper Tecsoft IOL could confidently be used in cataract surgery with IOL implantation saving the Australian community millions of  health dollars that could more usefully be directed to fund other new and cost effective medical technology.</interventions>
