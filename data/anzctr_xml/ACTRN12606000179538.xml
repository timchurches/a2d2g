  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The reported incidence of painful Achilles tendinosis is 6-17% amongst adult athletes. This condition results in considerable impairment of training and performance in athletes. To date, evidence suggests that of the treatment strategies investigated, exercise programs that involve mildly painful eccentric contractions of the muscles of the calf are the most effective at reducing pain and improving function for people suffering from this condition.  Although the underlying mechanism conferring improvement is unknown, there is now some evidence suggesting a link between the presence of newly formed blood vessels (neovascularisation) and painful tendinosis.  With a program of mildly painful eccentric loading exercises, there is a sustained reduction in pain with disappearance of these new vessels. Similar sustained reductions in pain have been shown with prolotherapy injections of hypertonic glucose and local anaesthetic.  Prolotherapy involves the repeated injections of an irritant solution with the intention of sclerosing neovessels and stimulating inflammation and subsequently new collagen formation.  With respect to Achilles tendinosis, the relative efficacy of these two approaches, individually and in combination, has not been tested. This project aims to conduct a pilot randomised clinical trial comparing prolotherapy injections eccentric loading exercises singly and in combination. It will be conducted in research clinics to be set up at Logan and in Christchurch, New Zealand.  It will be a single blinded trial with the assessor being the blinded person.  Experience and information from this pilot trial will be used to inform an adequately powered randomised clinical trial of prolotherapy injections and eccentric loading exercises for painful Achilles tendinosis.</summary>
