  <interventions>
    <interventions>24 hour ambulatory impedance-pHmeter monitoring. A thin catheter (diameter 2.1 mm) which have attached a data logger (a walkman-sized portable electronic recording device) passed through a nostril and positioned according to lower esophageal sphincter's upper border. Patients then returned home with instructions to press buttons which are located on the data logger for symptoms, meal intake times and sleeping. They were encouraged to carry out normal daily activities without dietary restrictions. At the completion of the study (that is 24 hour), the catheter is removed and the data logger is uploaded to the computer for analysis.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Describe optimal time window for reflux-symptom relationship analysis. Patients underwent esophageal manometry and 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring.  MII-pH signal data was divided into various consecutive time windows (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min) that were evaluated for the presence of reflux and symptom. The SDT parameter (d') values were calculated for each  time window. Time window which provides highest d' value was considered as optimal time window.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Signal Detection Theory (SDT) provides a method that measures discriminability (d) of any stimulus (signal) without response bias (c) effect .  The aim of the study was to adapt SDT approach to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) diagnosis in order to develop a new analysis method for temporal relationship between reflux and symptom for 24 hour impedance-pHmeter monitoring data. We have considered reflux and symptom as signal and response respectively in this context. In conclusion, SDT approach using 1 min time window to GERD diagnosis provides us a simple, quantitative measure of reflux-symptom relationship that appears to more accurate than  SAP index for MII-pH monitoring analysis.</summary>
