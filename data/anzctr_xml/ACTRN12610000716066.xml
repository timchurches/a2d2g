  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention program - Group program, 4 weeks duration, with two sessions (2 hours) each week.  Program is conducted by trained Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist and/or Speech Pathologist. Program consists of physical therapy exercise program, cognitive and speech activities.  Physical therapy exercise program consists of activities aimed to improve balance and mobility, cardiovascular function, upper limb strength and coordination.  Cognitive element focuses on executive functioning, attention, memory and visuospatial skills.  Speech element consits of activities aimed at improving breath support and speech clarity.  Education is based on self management principles.

    <concealment>Neurologists that provide services to Parkinson's disease client's residing within the Metro South Community Health District will be invited to refer community dwelling individuals with a diagnosis of Ideopathic Parkinson's disease.  Following receipt of referral, staff from the Community Rehabilitation Service (CRS) will contact client to arrange initial assessment.  

A joint home based interview by either an Occupational Therapist and Physiotherapist or Speech Pathologist will determine whether the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Consent for participation in the study will be obtained.  Subjects will be informed that they will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate quality of life, physical, cognitive and language outcomes for a holistic new model of care for people living in the community with Parkinson's disease.  The model incorporates physical, cognitive and speech activities into one program and compares outcomes between the enhanced multifactoral program with a traditional exercise program.  Longer term outcomes will also be assessed at intervals up to six months with an aim to evaluate the optimum time for introduction of a maintenance program to people with Parkinson's disease.</summary>
