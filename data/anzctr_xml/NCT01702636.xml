  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients presenting with an acute ICH

          -  Contrast extravasation within the haemorrhage, "spot sign", evaluated from the CTA
             according to three criteria, all of which must be present:

               1. Serpiginous or spot-like appearance within the margin of a parenchymal haematoma
                  without connection to an outside vessel;

               2. The density (in Hounsfield units) should be greater than that of the background
                  haematoma (site investigators are not required to document the density); and

               3. No hyperdensity at the corresponding location on non-contrast CT.

          -  Age =18 years

          -  Treatment can commence within 1 hour of initial CT and within 4.5 hours of symptom
             onset (or in patients with unknown time of symptom onset, the time patient was last
             known to be well)

          -  Informed consent has been received in accordance to local ethics committee
             requirements</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Glasgow coma scale (GCS) total score of &lt;8

          -  Brainstem ICH

          -  ICH volume &gt;70 ml as measured by the ABC/2 method

          -  ICH known or suspected by study investigator to be secondary to trauma, aneurysm,
             vascular malformation, haemorrhagic transformation of ischaemic stroke, cerebral
             venous thrombosis, thrombolytic therapy, tumor, or infection

          -  Contrast already administered within 24 hours prior to initial CT or contraindication
             to imaging with CT contrast agents (e.g. known or suspected iodine allergy or
             significant renal failure)

          -  Any history or current evidence suggestive of venous or arterial thrombotic events
             within the previous 12 months, including clinical, ECG, laboratory, or imaging
             findings. Clinically silent chance findings of old ischemia are not considered
             exclusion.

          -  Hereditary or acquired haemorrhagic diathesis or coagulation factor deficiency.

          -  Use of heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, GPIIb/IIIa antagonist, or oral
             anticoagulation (e.g. warfarin, factor Xa inhibitor, thrombin inhibitor) within the
             previous 14 days, irrespective of laboratory values

          -  Pregnancy (women of childbearing potential must be tested)

          -  Planned surgery for ICH within 24 hours

          -  Concurrent or planned treatment with haemostatic agents (e.g. prothrombin complex
             concentrate, vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, or platelet transfusion)

          -  Participation in any investigational study in the last 30 days

          -  Known terminal illness or planned withdrawal of care or comfort care measures.

          -  Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator could impose hazards to the
             patient if study therapy is initiated or affect the participation of the patient in
             the study.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to test if intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) patients who have contrast
      extravasation on computed tomography angiography, the "spot sign", have lower rates of
      haematoma growth when treated with tranexamic acid within 4.5 hours of stroke onset, compared
      to placebo.</summary>
