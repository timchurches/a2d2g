  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a trial to test two regimen of griseofulvin administration. Each of the two regimen will be performed on different volunteers. 
This is done in healthy volunteers. 

Blood will be used to measure griseofulvin levels in red cells and to measure haematological and clinical biochemical parameters. Blood will also be used to test infection rate using malarial parasites (In vitro).

The first regimen a unique (once-off) dose of 2g griseofulvin.

The second regimen is 500mg griseofulvin twice daily for 5 days.

Griseofulvin will be administered orally, by tablet.</interventions>
    <comparator>Neither of these is a comparator arm. This is a pharmacokinetics trial only. We are testing for half life of griseofulvin in the red cells of treated people. The two regimen will give two different profiles.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ability of griseofulvin to inhibit the growth of malaria in blood taken from volunteers given the drug. Blood is taken from the volunteers and a portion added to infected red cells in culture. The kinetics of parasite growth is an indication of the ability of the erythrocytes taken from the volunteer to support infection. Parasitaemia is assessed by either fluorescent activated cell sorting or by counting Giemsa-stained thin smears.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Kinetic endpoints. Study to be done over 7 days. Endpoints are Days 1 through 7 for the malaria inhibition.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Griseofulvin inhibits ferrochelatase (FECH). Inhibition of FECH in the red cell prevents the growth of malarial parasites. We plan a trial using griseofulvin to treat volunteers infected with malaria. This current proposed trial is a pharmacokinetics trial with two different regimen of griseofulvin, 500mg bd or a one-off bolus of 2g. The concentration of griseofulvin in red cells will be measured daily as will the ability of malarial parasites to infect cells taken from griseofulvin-treated volunteers. Haematological and clinical biochemical parameters will be followed.</summary>
