  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is characterising the bio-availability of  plant microRNAs following ingestion of a single 300 g serving of either kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis var. Sungold)), apple (Malus domestica var.'Scifresh'), cooked rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) verses a control (water) in healthy male volunteers with a minimum of 7 days washout between treatment arms of the study. Small RNAs will be isolated from blood samples collected at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after the treatment meal intervention (0900 h, Day 1) and sequenced using next generation sequencing.  Food diaries will be used by participants to record all food consumed 24 h prior to and during each treatment arm of the study. In addition, participants are to be maintained on a standardised plant-free diet during each treatment arm of the study starting at 1800 h on the day prior (Day -1) to the treatment meal intervention, through to the completion of the 24 h sample (0900 h, Day 2), so as to minimise contamination from other plant sources.  Standardised plant-free meals will be provided to the participants for the prior evening meal (1800 h, Day -1) and the subsequent mid morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and evening meal on the treatment day (Day 1).  Participants will return the following morning (0900 h Day 2) in a fasted state to provide the final 24 h blood sample.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The identification of microRNAs in plasma from specific dietary plant sources following ingestion using next generation sequencing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline (time 0) and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours after consumption of plant dietary sources of microRNA </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Next Generation Sequencing (HiSeq 2000) techniques will be used to characterise the bio-availability of specific plant microRNAs.  miRNAs in the treatment foods will be quantified and then compared with the levels observed in human plasma following consumption.  Plasma samples will be collected at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 h after consumption of the treatment food and total small RNAs isolated using a Qiagen miRNeasy serum/plasma kit.  Barcoded libraries of isolated small RNAs will be generated and sent to Macrogen for Next Generation Sequencing (HiSeq 2000). A range of bioinformatic tools will be used to identify miRNAs present in the samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>To gain a temporal profile of the absorption of plant miRNAs, plasma samples will be collected at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 h after consumption of the treatment foods</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eight healthy male participants will be recruited into the study via advertisement in the local media, electronic advertisements and posters in the Auckland area. Each participant will receive all treatments in a randomized order according to a Latin square design with a minimum of 1 week washout between treatments. Allocation is not concealed</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be carried out using a 4 x 4 Latin Square balanced for order of presentation and carry-over effects (Williams et al., 1949, Wakeling and MacFie 1995).The design was generated in R 3.0.2 using the Williams function in the crossdes package.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The study utilises a randomised, controlled, cross-over treatment design with 4 treatment arms. The four treatment arms comprise a 300 g serving of Kiwifruit, apple, cooked rice or water for breakfast.</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis was performed to provide estimates of variance components using data from the published literature (Zhang et al., 2012). Based on this study, the mean and standard deviation of the total number of reads of plant miRNA per 1,000,000 mammalian reads, based on 8 samples, were 14,063 and 8,882 respectively. The 8 samples were each made up of pools of 10 individuals and it is assumed that the counts for each pool are made up as the sum of the counts for the each individual at 1/10th the volume of blood. This implies that the mean and variance of the pooled samples are an unbiased estimate of the individuals mean and variance had they been sampled at the full volume needed for individual readings, assuming that the counts are distributed in a Poisson like process. 
An estimate of the within subject variation based on this total variation can be calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). An estimate of the ICC was not found in the literature for this type of measure, in this case it is assumed that the variation between subjects is 3 times greater than the variance within a subject i.e. ICC=0.75, and therefore the estimate of within subject standard deviation =4,041. 
Based on Zhang et al., 2012, the rice fed mice had an increase from baseline to 6 hours in miRNA of approximately 40%. Assuming that the estimated mean in human is of 14,063 reads per 1,000,000 is equivalent to the 6 hours time point in mice, it would imply that the baseline mean read would be approximately 14,063/1.4=10,045. This would be an expected difference from baseline of 4,000 reads per 1,000,000. 
Using the estimate of within subject standard deviation of 4,041 and a specified 4 treatment crossover design with 5 time points for each treatment, a sample of 8 subjects gives a power of 80% to detect a difference in counts of 4,000 amongst the time points using Tukeys HSD to account for multiple testing. All power calculations were conducted using Russ Lenths power and sample size java applets</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will investigate if naturally occurring compounds in food called microRNAs are absorbed by the body when eaten. MicroRNAs are produced by all plants and animals and are present in most of the foods we eat. Our own bodies produce over a thousand different microRNAs that play important roles in regulating the activity of our genes. Until recently it was thought that microRNAs present in our food were destroyed during cooking or digestion. However, recent research suggests that some of these microRNAs, particularly those from plants, may survive and be absorbed into the blood.  What role these plant microRNAs  have on human health if absorbed is not yet known, but since diets high in fruits and vegetables have been shown to be beneficial for ones health there is a possibility that plant microRNAs play a role in this. 
Our hypothesis is that miRNAs from specific plant dietary sources are bioavailable following ingestion.  </summary>
