    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - ruxolitinib tablets
Other interventions - Best Available Therapy (BAT)

Experimental: ruxolitinib tablets - Starting dose of 10 mg BID with individualized dose titration ranging from 5 mg once a day (QD) to 25 mg BID based on safety and efficacy

Other: Best Available Therapy - Best Available Therapy (BAT) will be selected by the Investigator for each subject. BAT may not include experimental agents (i.e. those not approved for the treatment of any indication) as well as a limited number of other selected drugs in accordance with the protocol-defined requirements.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Subjects Achieving a Primary Response at Week 32 - Primary response was defined as having achieved hematocrit control (the absence of phlebotomy eligibility beginning at the Week 8 visit and continuing through Week 32) and Spleen Volume Reduction (a greater than or equal to 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at Week 32).</outcome>
      <timepoint>32 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Subjects Achieving a Durable Primary Response at Week 48 - Durable Primary Response was defined as any subject who achieved the primary outcome measure and who maintained their response up to 48 weeks after randomization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Subjects Achieving Complete Hematological Remission at Week 32 - Complete Hematological Remission at Week 32 was defined as any subject who achieved hematocrit control with a platelet count less than or equal to 400 X 10^9/L and a white blood cell count less than or equal to 10 X 10^9/L.</outcome>
      <timepoint>32 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved a Durable Complete Hematological Remission at Week 48 - Durable Complete Hematological Remission was defined as any subject who achieved Complete Hematological Remission at Week 32 and maintained their response up to 48 weeks after randomization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved a Durable Hematocrit Control at Week 48 - Durable Hematocrit Control was defined as any subject who achieved phlebotomy eligibility independence from Week 8 to Week 32 and maintained hematocrit control up to 48 weeks after randomization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved Durable Spleen Volume Reduction at Week 48 - Durable Spleen Volume Reduction was defined as a subject who achieved at least 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at Week 32 and maintained that response 48 weeks after randomization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimated Duration of the Primary Response - Duration of the primary response is defined as the time from the first occurrence when both components of the primary endpoint are met until the date of the first documented disease progression (end of response).
Kaplan-Meier estimates are provided for duration of primary response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through study completion, analysis was conducted when all patients had completed the Week 80 visit or discontinued the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved Overall Clinicohematologic Response at Week 32 - Overall Clinicohematologic Response is defined as any subject who achieved a complete or partial clinicohematologic response per the European LeukemiaNet modified criteria for response in polycythemia vera (PV). A Complete Response (CR) is defined as: hematocrit control, spleen volume reduction at least 35% from baseline, platelet count less than or equal to 400 x 10(9)/L, and white blood cell count less than or equal to 10 x 10(9)/L.
