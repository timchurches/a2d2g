      <outcome>DB; Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Day 197 in Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 Score (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR]) For ABA Versus PLA (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Analysis) - The DAS28 is a continuous disease measure which is a composite of 4 variables: the 28 tender joint count, the 28 swollen joint count, ESR or C-reactive protein (CRP), and participant assessment of disease activity measure on a visual analogue scale. The DAS28 has numeric thresholds that define high disease activity (&gt; 5.1), low disease activity (&lt; 3.2) and remission (&lt; 2.6).

The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0=without any difficulty, 1= with some difficulty, 2= with much difficulty, and 3= unable to do. Higher scores= greater dysfunction. A disability index was calculated by summing the worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered.

      <outcome>DB; Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Day 365 in HAQ-DI (LOCF Analysis) - The disability section of the full HAQ includes 20 questions to assess physical functions in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0=without any difficulty, 1= with some difficulty, 2= with much difficulty, and 3= unable to do. Higher scores= greater dysfunction. A disability index was calculated by summing the worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered. Clinically meaningful HAQ response=an improvement of at least 0.3 units from baseline in HAQ disability Index.</outcome>

It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores (1) physical component summary=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; (2) mental component summary=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score.
