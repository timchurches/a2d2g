  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 10-week walking program began by requiring participants to engage in 20 minutes of moderate intensity walking, defined by a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 12, 3 days per week. RPE is a validated scale for self-regulation of exercise intensity. An RPE rating of 12-13 corresponds with "somewhat hard" exercise, and approximately 60% Heart Rate Reserve.  On alternating weeks, the required walks increased in either intensity (RPE 14) or duration (5 minutes). By the of the 10 week program, participants were walking for 45 minutes a day,  4 days per week, at an RPE of 14. 

The intervention group had a face-to-face meeting with the researcher once a week. During these small group meetings (3-4 participants plus the instructor), the subjects completed one of their weekly walks with the researcher and were provided with verbal feedback based on a physical copy of a weekly workout log returned to the instructor. They were also provided with verbal encouragement and instruction for the next week.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group was subject to the same walking progression. However, they received the same weekly motivational and instructional material through e-mail only. Weekly workout logs were submitted to the researcher via e-mail.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>WHOQOL-BREF score and sub-scores. The WHOQOL-BREF is a questionnaire which assesses overall quality of life, and breaks it into the following domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 and Week 10</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rockport Walk Test. Based on the time to completion and Heart Rate upon completion, the Rockport 1-mile Walk Test is used as an estimate of cardiovascular fitness. It has been validated as an accurate tool for estimating VO2max (maximal oxygen capacity).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 and Week 10</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treadmill Test. Subjects walk on a treadmill set at 1% grade and 3.5 mph for 5 minutes, while wearing a heart rate monitor. At the end of each minute, the subject's heart rate is recorded by the researcher. This assessment allows the researcher to study the subject's heart rate response to a standard level of exercise. While the Rockport Walk Test allows each subject to self-select walking speed, this test allows the researcher to control for walking speed, to further isolate heart rate response pre- and post-intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 and Week 10</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight change. Broadly assessed as "loss," "no change," or "gain" on an anonymous post-participation survey.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>E-mail delivery of workplace wellness programming has become an increasingly popular, cost-effective, and efficient means of disseminating information.  In light of that trend, this study compared the effect of face-to-face interventions and email interventions on fitness, quality of life, and maintenance of an exercise program in order to study the effect of communication style on intervention outcomes.</summary>
