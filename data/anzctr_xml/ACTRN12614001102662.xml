  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of four conditions: (1) autonomy support, (2) implementation intention, (3) combined autonomy support and implementation intention, and (4) a control. Intervention components have been developed and written by the researchers, and will be automatically presented to participants as they progress through an online survey tool (Qualtrics). The one-time intervention will be of approximately 30-minute duration, depending on participants' progression through questions and content.

All conditions will receive National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines on alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of harm.

Participants receiving the autonomy support component will be asked to generate their own reasons for pursuing reduced pre-drinking alcohol consumption that are consistent with their needs and perceived as beneficial.

Participants receiving the implementation intention component will formulate their own if-then plans to be enacted in certain pre-drinking contexts, to help attain the goal of reduced pre-drinking alcohol consumption.

Participants in the combined condition will receive the autonomy support component to facilitate autonomous motivation to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption, then the implementation intention component to help translate this motivation into action by generating if-then statements to be enacted in response to certain contextual cues.

Participants' responses to the intervention components (i.e., prompts) will be content analyzed for monitoring adherence to the intervention. Participants will be emailed their respective intervention components following the completion of the intervention, and will complete a brief follow-up, four weeks later, to ascertain the effects of the intervention on reducing pre-drinking alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm. Participants will be send a weekly text message (SMS) reflecting the content they received in the intervention (e.g., participants in the implementation intention condition will receive an SMS each week reminding them of their if-then plans to reduce pre-drinking alchol consumption).</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive two of the National Health and Medical Research Council's guidelines to reduce alcohol-related harm. Specifically, these guidelines state:

(1) For healthy men and women, drinking no more than two standard drinks on any day reduces the lifetime risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury

(2) For healthy men and women, drinking no more than four standard drinks on a single occasion reduces the risk of alcohol-related injury arising from that occasion.

These statements will be delivered to all participants within the online survey tool (Qualtrics) and emailed upon completion of the intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pre-drinking alcohol consumption (in standard drink equivalents) over the past four weeks from baseline, as measured by self-report with aid of a pictorial guide from the National Health and Medical Research Council's standard drink equivalent guide to assist in accurate self-reporting.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Alcohol-related harm experienced over the previous four weeks, as measured by a psychometric scale of alcohol-related harm; the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Scale (B-YAACQ). The B-YAACQ allows participants to respond with a 'yes' or 'no' answer to a series of statements reflecting experienced alcohol-related harm (e.g., "I have taken foolish risks when I have been drinking"). 'Yes' answers are summed to create an index of alcohol-related harm. The measure has been modified to reflect experience of alcohol-related harm in the previous four weeks, as opposed to the previous 12 months, to better ascertain the potential changes in alcohol-related harm as a result of the intervention.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study investigates a psychological theory-based intervention to reduce alcohol pre-drinking - the practice of consuming alcohol at a home or private residence, prior to attending a subsequent event (where alcohol consumption often continues).

The intervention comprises a motivational component that facilitates autonomous motivation to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption, and a volitional component that enables participants to generate their own 'if-then' plans to enact in response to contextual cues surrounding pre-drinking.

The intervention comprises four conditions: an autonomy support only, an implementation intention only, a combined, and control condition. The control condition will receive information from the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines with respect to consuming alcohol in moderation to reduce the risk of alcohol-related harm.

It is hypothesized that the controlled condition targeting both motivational and volitional aspects will be most effective in reducing pre-drinking alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm.</summary>
