  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients underwent two bronchial hygiene techniques, the slow expiration with the glottis open in lateral posture ("expiration lente totale glotte ouverte en infralatéral", ELTGOL) and huff. The patients were their own controls, i.e., patients were submitted to both techniques, at different times. The first technique applied was chosen randomly. After three days of washout, the second technique was applied, following the design of a crossover study. 
Each technique was administered in the morning, in a single session, with an interval of three days between them (washout), i.e., the treatment period was one day and the washout period was 3 days. 
The slow expiration with the glottis open in lateral posture ("expiration lente totale glotte ouverte en infralatéral", ELTGOL)  was applied in the posture lateral right and lateral left. The patient was instructed to relax and exhale through the mouth using a mouthpiece. The physiotherapist did a manual traction in the region infralateral the chest, the ribs toward the line Alba. This tension originated from the functional residual capacity, ending at residual volume. The technique was 15 minutes in each hemithorax. 
The huff was performed with the patient sitting in a chair with armrest and feet on the ground. The patient was instructed to make an inspiration to medium volumes followed by a forced expiration with the glottis and mouth open, holding the contraction of abdominal muscles, reaching residual volume. The technique was performed for ten minutes, going six huff per minute, interspersed with one minute of rest, resulting in a total of five series of huff.</interventions>
    <comparator>Were compared two techniques of physical therapy: the slow expiration with the glottis open in lateral posture ("expiration lente totale glotte ouverte en infralatéral", ELTGOL) and huff. The two techniques are to bronchial hygiene. Slow expiration with the glottis open in lateral posture ("expiration lente totale glotte ouverte en infralatéral", ELTGOL) generates slow flow and huff generates higher flows. 
Each one was applied in only one session at random.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In vitro mucociliary transport was evaluated by the frog palate. The velocity of mucociliary transport of sputum was expressed as relative velocity, which is the velocity of sputum test divided by the average velocity of frog mucus control. Each sputum sample analyzed was about 2mm. This analysis was always performed by a single researcher.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Regarding the collection and analysis of sputum were collected four samples of sputum, one initial (prior to the physiotherapeutic technique selected - baseline), another 0,15 and 30 minutes after termination technique.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In vitro transport of the sputum by cough was studied in a simulated cough machine consists of the following characteristics: pressure 4.2 kg/cm2; opening time of solenoid valve 1s; cylindrical acrylic tube with 4mm inside diameter and 30cm comprimento. For each sputum sample (approximately 2mm) were five measures of displacement, expressed as mean. This analysis was always performed by a single researcher.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Regarding the collection and analysis of sputum were collected four samples of sputum, one initial (prior to the physiotherapeutic technique selected - baseline), another 0,15 and 30 minutes after termination technique.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The contact angle of sputum was measured by microscope to measure the contact angle, equipped with an eyepiece and a goniometer. The contact angle measures the wettability, defined as the ability of mucus spread when placed on a solid surface.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Regarding the collection and analysis of sputum were collected four samples of sputum, one initial (prior to the physiotherapeutic technique selected - baseline), another 0,15 and 30 minutes after termination technique.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this research is to verify if two physical therapy techniques used to eliminate the sputum (Huff and ELTGOL) cause changes in your sputum.
We imagine that the two techniques soften your sputum, making it easier to cough.</summary>
