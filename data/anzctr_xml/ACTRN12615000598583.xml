    <interventions>Intervention is a negative pressure wound care dressing (NPWT). Intervention is administered by the surgeon and remains in place for 7 days.  One dressing change on Day 5 or as close to as determined by level of strikethrough.    This dressing delivers negative pressure to the wound bed to secure the flap and facilitate tissue perfusion. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background

Postoperative delayed wound healing impacts on patient wellbeing and return to normal life and can result in intrinsic and extrinsic complications. Unilateral mastectomy impacts on patient healing as well as body image perspective and is further complicated by the diagnosis of cancer. 

Aim of the study
The purpose of the  study is to determine the effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy on seroma formation following unilateral mastectomy. 

Who is it for?
The study is for females about to undergo an elective unilateral mastectomy that consent to be in the study.  Study participants are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups.  Participants in one group will receive a negative pressure dressing applied to their wound for 7 days, whilst participants in the other group will receive a standard surgical dressing.  Patients will be followed-up for up to 30 days postoperatively to determine seroma formation during the post operative period.
