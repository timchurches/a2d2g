    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ustekinumab IV
Treatment: drugs - Placebo Infusion
Treatment: drugs - Placebo SC
Treatment: drugs - Ustekinumab SC
Other interventions - Concomitant Medication

Experimental: Ustekinumab plus Concomitant Medication - Participants will receive weight-range based dosing of approximately 6 mg/kg of ustekinumab intravenously at Week 0 followed by ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks (q8w) up to Week 40. Participants who meet the study extension inclusion criteria will continue to receive ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w starting at Week 48 or 56 through Week 104. Participants will continue stable concomitant treatment through Week 48, as well as through the study extension although tapering of corticosteroids is encouraged beyond Week 48. Participants who complete or discontinue study treatment will be evaluated for 16 additional Weeks of safety follow-up.

Experimental: Placebo followed by Ustekinumab plus Concomitant Medication - Participants will receive placebo intravenously at Week 0 followed by placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 8 and 16. At week 24 participants will receive ustekinumab SC q8w up to Week 40. Participants who meet the study extension inclusion criteria will continue to receive ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w starting at Week 48 or 56 through Week 104. Participants will continue stable concomitant treatment through Week 48, as well as through the study extension although tapering of corticosteroids is encouraged beyond Week 48. Participants who complete or discontinue study treatment will be evaluated for 16 additional Weeks of safety follow-up.


Treatment: drugs: Ustekinumab IV

Treatment: drugs: Placebo Infusion
Placebo intravenously at Week 0.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo SC
Placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 8 and 16.

Treatment: drugs: Ustekinumab SC
Ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks up to Week 40 and up to Week 104 in study extension (for eligible participants)

Other interventions: Concomitant Medication
Concomitant treatment (mycophenolate, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine and/or chloroquine, oral corticosteroids, NSAIDs, antihypertensive medications, and topical medications) through Week 48, as well as through the study extension although tapering of corticosteroids is encouraged beyond Week 48.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Composite SRI-4 Response at Week 24 - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder index (SRI-4) is defined as a composite endpoint requiring at least a 4 point reduction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score, no worsening (less than [?] 10 millimeters [mm] increase) from baseline in the Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity score (PGA) and no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Domain A and no more than 1 new BILAG Domain B scores. The SLEDAI-2k assessment consists of 24 items with total score of 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity. The BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system, a letter score is given: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. The PGA assess disease activity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) = from 'very well'(0) to 'very poor'(10).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 24</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in SLEDAI-2K Score at Week 24 - Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI - 2k) assessment consists of 24 items. Weighted scores of 8, 4, 2, and 1 are assigned for items 1 to 8, items 9 to 14, items 15 to 21, and items 22 to 24, respectively. A SLEDAI global score is derived by adding all weighted scores. Total possible score range for SLEDAI - 2K is 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) at Week 24 - The Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity will be recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS = 0 to 10 centimeters [cm]). The scale for the assessments range from 'no lupus activity' (0) to 'extremely active lupus' (10).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With BICLA Response at Week 24 - The BILAG-based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) requires participants to meet response criteria across 3 assessment tools and no treatment failure must be recorded: 1) BILAG improvement classified as: a) All BILAG A scores at baseline improved to either BILAG B, C or D b) All BILAG B scores at baseline improved to either BILAG C or D, c) No worsening in disease activity defined as no new BILAG A scores and &lt;= 1 new BILAG B score. 2) No worsening of total SLEDAI-2K from baseline (change &lt;= 0). 3) No significant deterioration (&lt;10 mm increase) in 100 mm visual analogue PGA scale.</outcome>
