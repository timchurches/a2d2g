    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not
      yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating childhood
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing different combination chemotherapy
      regimens to see how well they work in treating children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</summary>
