    <interventions>ELECTROANALGESIA PROTOCOL

The electroanalgesia treatment protocol will consist of applying transregional interferential current to the lower back region. 
The stimulation parameters will be: intensity of 4000Hz, amplitude-modulated frequency of 100Hz, sweep of 50 Hz, and  pulse duration of 130 micros.

The subjects will be placed in a prone position with the lower back area unclothed. 

The electrotherapy treatment will be based on the interferential current and tetrapolar method; that is, with four electrodes and two intersecting channels, with a rectangular stimulus 1/1, with electrodes of 75 cm2 in area, for 25 minutes. The four self-adhesive electrodes will be symmetrically placed onto each subject's lower back region, at the level of L1 and L5, in a crossed pattern. 

The treatment will undergo ten treatment sessions, applied once a day from Monday to Friday over a two weeks period of time</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects in the control group will undergo a classic protocol involving massage therapy, manual mobilization therapy and passive and active kinesiotherapy for the same period of time than subjects in the electrotherapy group</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lumbar self-perceived pain assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 

A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used to measure self-reported pain. The VAS is considered to be a validated, effective, accurate, sensitive, easy to use, and reproducible method to assess acute and chronic pain. 
The subject will be asked to mark in the VAS the current intensity of low back-pain. The result will be expressed in millimeters (mm), ranging from 0 to 100 mm. </outcome>
      <timepoint>After the two-weeks intervention protocol
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lumbar functionality assessed by means of the Oswestry Scale

The Oswestry scale is the most commonly used and recommended clinical tool to measure the functional impact of lower back pain. It is especially indicated in patients with moderate to intense disability, which are common in specialized locomotor system consultations.

This scale is a self-administered questionnaire and specific to subjects with low-back pain, which measures limitations during daily activities. It is comprised of 10 items with six possible answers. Therefore, the degree of disability is classified as minimal disability (0%-20%), moderate (20%-40%), severe (40%-60%), crippled (60%-80%) and bed bound (80%-100%)

The Oswestry scale is one of the most commonly used scales in clinical trials and has served as a reference to determine the validity of other scales.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesize that, after applying the electroanalgesia treatment protocol, subjects with chronic low back pain will experience an imporvement in pain perception and lumbar functionality. Although the use of electrotherapy has been put into question in several studies, we hypothesize that the effectiveness of electrotherapy is strongly related to the parameters used for treatment</summary>
