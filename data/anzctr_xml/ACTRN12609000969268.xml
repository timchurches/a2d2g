    <interventions>Juvederm Ultra Plus (hyaluronic acid-based dermal filler) administered by injection directly into the nasolabial fold (NLF) as a single treatment. Up to 2 syringes can be administered to correct the volume deficit in the allocated NLF, with each syringe containing a volume of 0.8 ml. The concentration of hyaluronic acid in each syringe is 24 mg/ml.</interventions>

Up to 2 syringes can be administered to correct the volume deficit in the allocated NLF, with each syringe containing a volume of 1.0 ml.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients will receive both treatments in either their left or right NLF. Right NLF will be randomly assigned to receive either Juvederm Ultra Plus or Restylane Perlane, with alternate treatment administered into the left NLF. The randomisation will be facilitated using computer-generated treatment assignments provided to each investigational site in sealed envelopes. As commercial products will be used, it is not possible to blind the investigator injectors/evaluators to the treatment allocations. The patients are required to wear a blindfold and thus they will not be aware of the treatments injected into their NLFs.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the differences in the product characteristics of 2 commercially available hyaluronic acid (HA)-based dermal fillers translate to differences in their long term durability in patients with severe age-related nasolabial folds (NLFs), following a single administration.</summary>
