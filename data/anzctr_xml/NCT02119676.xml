Experimental: Ruxolitinib plus regorafenib - 

Active Comparator: Placebo plus regorafenib - 


Treatment: drugs: Ruxolitinib
5 mg tablets to be administered by mouth
Ruxolitinib 20 mg twice a day (BID) (Part 1) (NOTE: The starting dose for the randomized portion of study (Part 2) was 15 mg BID based on results from Part 1.)

Treatment: drugs: Regorafenib
Regorafenib 160mg once daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. (NOTE: Dose interruptions and modifications for regorafenib are expected when toxicities occur in which dose interruptions or modifications are appropriate.)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without death observed at the time of the analysis will be censored at last date known to be alive. The median overall survival time was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Overall survival was compared between treatment groups using log-rank test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline until death due to any cause; up to 16 months or data cut-off 11 FEB 2016.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Progressive Disease (PD) is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 at least a 20% increase in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the appearance of new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through disease progression, or death due to any cause if sooner; up to 16 months or data cut-off 11 FEB 2016.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Response defined per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target and non-target lesions without new lesion; Partial Response (PR)=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, non-target lesion not progressed, and no new lesion; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, or non-target lesion progression, or identification of new lesion; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria. ORR was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best response of either CR or PR. ORR=number of participants with CR or PR/number of participants randomized.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through end of study; up to 16 months or data cut-off 11 FEB 2016.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Duration of response is defined as the time from response (CR/PR) until the earliest date of disease progression determined by investigator assessment of objective radiographic disease assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or death due to any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through end of study; up to 16 months or data cut-off 11 FEB 2016.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Disease Control - Disease control as measured by the percentage of participants whose best response was complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) per RECIST v.1.1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through end of study; up to 16 months or data cut-off 11 FEB 2016.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) - TEAEs were defined as any adverse event (AE) during the study that began or worsened on or after the date of first dose of investigational product.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through approximately 30 days post treatment discontinuation;up to 16 months or data cut-off 27JAN 2016 for Substudy 1 and up to the data cut-off of 11FEB2016 for Substudy 2.</timepoint>
