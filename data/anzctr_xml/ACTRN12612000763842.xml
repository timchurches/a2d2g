  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective study involving the collection of blood samples for the purposes of measuring circulating tumour DNA from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who are planned to undergo surgical resection
Patients will be treated and followed according to standard protocols.
This is an exploratory, prospective study enrolling patients diagnosed with stage I and II pancreatic adenocarcinoma to investigate the potential use of a novel blood-based biomarker (circulating tumour DNA) as a marker of residual disease that predicts later recurrence.  Blood collection will occur at two timepoints as follows:
Timepoint 1: Baseline - Presurgery
Timepoint 2: 4 - 8 Weeks post surgery</interventions>
    <comparator>Uncontrolled.</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate that persistence of tumour derived DNA in peripheral blood following complete resection of the primary tumour is a sensitive and specific marker of subsequent disease recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the completion of analysis of blood, plasma and tissue samples.

Study participants will have 15 mls of blood collected at 2 time points:
Time point 1: Pre-surgery
Time point 2: 4 - 8 weeks post surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate that the disappearance of tumour DNA in peripheral blood is a sensitive and specific marker of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the completion of analysis of blood and plasma samples.

Study participants will have 15 mls of blood collected at 2 time points:
Time point 1: Pre-surgery
Time point 2: 4 - 8 weeks post surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the potential of the appearance or re-appearance of ctDNA of tumour DNA in peripheral blood as a specific and sensitive marker of disease recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the completion of analysis of blood and plasma samples.

Study participants will have 15 mls of blood collected at 2 time points:
Time point 1: Pre-surgery

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to work towards developing a diagnostic technique to determine patients response to chemotherapy and surgery using circulating tumour (ct) DNA biomarkers.  This will reduce the need for excessive chemotherapy treatment therefore reducing the unwanted adverse effects of treatments.

Genes are substances in the body which contain information about characteristics about us as indivuals.  Previous studies have found that the majority (more than 9 out of 10) of pancreataic cancers contain a mutation in KRAS gene which can be detected in the blood.

Identifying biomarkers are important because: they may be linked with disease progression; they may help to identify people who are most likely to benefit from a certain treatment such as chemotherapy and how much treatment they need; and they help to identify people who have partial or complete response to treatment without the need for chemotherapy after surgery</summary>
