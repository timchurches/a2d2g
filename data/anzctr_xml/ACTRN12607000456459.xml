  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises: A cycle of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO) with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance (CMR therapy). The CMR is a biomedical radiofrequency instrument. The protocol used, called Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (ONPF), involves the application of a probe of the CMR on specific points of the auricular pavilion for an activation time of roughly 500 mms. The ONPF protocol is activated in a precise sequence on seven auricular points. The protocol envisages 18 sessions of ONPF treatment on alternating days, for eight (8)weeks. 
Assessment, at baseline and at the end of treatment, with Psychological Stress Measure Test (validated in Italian).</interventions>
    <comparator>The reduction of the subjective perception of stress, pains and physical  problems stress-related after an NPPO cycle with CMR device, shows significant results (P&lt;.05), respect to a control group that was treated with inactivated CMR.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has been shown a relationship between chronic widespread pain and visceral sensations of pain and psychological distress. Chronic stress causes a progressive malfunction in some structures of the nervous system which contribute to generating the symptoms of stress correlated pains and physical  problems. In this study we have use  the Psychological Stress Measure Test (validated in Italian) to test the effectiveness of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO) with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance - CMR Therapy in reducing the subjective perception of stress, pains and physical  problems stress-related.</summary>
