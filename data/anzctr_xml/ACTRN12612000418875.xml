  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will test the primary hypothesis that nebulised heparin ameliorates the severity of lung damage resulting in faster recovery of physical function in critically ill patients with, or at risk of developing, ARDS. Other aims of the study include determining if nebulised heparin improves quality of life, shortens intensive care and hospital lengths of stay and is cost-effective.</summary>
