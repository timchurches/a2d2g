    <interventions>"Cry Baby" presents previously tested advice and strategies in an interactive and informative online program. The program will be offered to parents for a period of 3 months. It provides parents with information and strategies on how to cope with infant crying, strategies to improve infant sleep, and advice on avoiding the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) risk associated with co-sleeping and placing their baby to sleep other than on his/her back. 

The Cry Baby program covers the following content:
a. Parent self care: including information and strategies on taking care of your body, parent sleep, wellbeing, postnatal depression and advice while breast feeding.
b. Crying: Why crying is normal and healthy, the normal crying curve, why babies cry, and how to cope with crying. 
c. Sleeping: Information and advice on how infants learn to sleep, their sleep cycles and cues, how to settle babies, safe sleep conditions, feeding, wrapping and dummies. 

Parents will be allocated to one of two conditions:
a. Cry Baby only condition: participants allocated to this condition will receive log in details to complete the Cry Baby program online, at a time that suits them best. The program only takes an hour to complete but parents can log in or out of the program whenever they please and can move around different areas of the program according to their interests and needs. 
b. The Cry Baby with additional email prompts condition: Participants who are randomly allocated to this condition will receive the Cry Baby program (which takes an hour to complete; ability to log in and out as please) but will also receive weekly, age specific email prompts from the study team until their infant reaches 12 weeks of age. These messages will contain brief age appropriate information on infant sleep and crying that is already provided within the Cry Baby program, and will direct the parent back to the program for more detailed information. Parents allocated to this condition will potentially receive a maximum of 12 emails. Participants are free to withdraw from receiving email contact from the study team at any time and this is made clear in the participant information sheet and weekly additional prompt emails. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Parents are recruited via one of the two following methods (a) Maternal and Child Health, and (b) Raising Children Network. Participants self-enrol into the program by completing the online eligibility criteria and baseline survey. At the end of the baseline survey, participants are allocated to one of the two conditions through a secure computer-generated randomisation system, maintaining allocation concealment. </concealment>
    <sequence>The online survey provider (Survey Monkey) has a 'random assignment' option where a percentage of respondents can be specified to be allocated to one of the conditions. As there are two conditions within Cry Baby, Survey Monkey was specified to split allocation by 50%, thus giving every participant an equal (or 50/50) chance of being allocated to one of the two study conditions.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During the first few months of life, parent reported infant sleep and crying problems are common (20-40% and 20% of infants, respectively; Bayer et al, 2007; Wake et al, 2007), as well as costly to treat (Hiscock et al 2007). Six randomised controlled trials have shown that providing parents with information on normal infant sleep and crying, and strategies to encourage good sleep habits, can improve infant sleep as well as reduce maternal postnatal depression symptoms (Hiscock et al , in preparation). While there is evidence that such strategies are of significant benefit to families and are well accepted by families, dissemination of this information to all families with newborns will be challenging. Our research team, in consultation with other health care professionals, has developed Cry Baby  an interactive online program that draws on prior research findings to provide parents with evidence based strategies for how to cope with infant sleep and crying problems. 

The aim of this research is to: (1) trail two different recruitment processes for providing the Cry Baby program in order to determine the best way to ensure it effectively reaches the families who would benefit; (2) collect data on how families engage with the resource (i.e., when they access it, what they access, how useful they find it) to better refine the program; (3) collect data on whether email support increases program participation, and; (4) collect preliminary data on outcome measures. 

Parents will be recruited from two settings: (1) the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service at the 2 week visit, and; (2) through advertisements on the Raising Children Network (RCN) website. Parents will be randomly assigned to either receive the Cry Baby program with email support from the research team, or to receive the Cry Baby program without additional email support. Data collected from this pilot study will indicate: (1) whether recruitment via online advertising (RCN) or via known health professional (MCH) result in a sample of participants more reflective of the general community (household income, education, socioeconomic status, language); (2) whether providing weekly email support results in parents (a) logging in to the program more often, (b) completing a greater proportion of the program, and (c) increased retention to the program; and (3) whether parents find the program useful/helpful. </summary>
