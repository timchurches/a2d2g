    <interventions>The Glycemic Index is a system of ranking carbohydrate-containing foods according to their immediate effect on blood sugar levels.

Using Australian Standard 4694-2007, The Glycemic index of of foods will be determined.

The test protocol itself is standardised, straightforward and well-defined. Briefly, a set number of participants (minimum of 10) consume the test or reference food (containing 50 g of available carbohydrate). Immediately before, and at designated intervals after food consumption, capillary blood (a few microlitres) is collected by fingerprick and its glucose content measured. Integrated areas under the glycemic response curves are then derived. To calculate the Gycemic Index of the test food, its Integrated Area Under Curve is indexed against that of the average Integrated Area Under Curve for the reference food (mean of three separate tests).

Each participant will consume one test food or one glucose reference item on a single testing day.

The duration between tests will be a minimum of 3 days.

The overall duration of the testing in each participant will be 5 X 3 hour sessions over a period of 5 weeks, with testing occurring once per week.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Blood samples (via finger prick) will be taken at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the first mouthful of test or reference food is consumed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Glycemic Index is a system of ranking carbohydrate-containing foods according to their immediate effect on blood sugar levels. A pool of up to 20 participants will initially need to be formed and maintained (ie have up-to-date glycemic response data for the reference food) for this purpose. If required due to demand for testing, the pool of participants will be increased further. The test protocol itself is standardised, straightforward and well-defined. Briefly, a set number of participants (minimum of 10) consume the test or reference food (containing 50 g of available carbohydrate). Immediately before, and at designated intervals after food consumption, capillary blood (a few microlitres) is collected by fingerprick and its glucose content measured. Integrated areas under the glycemic response curves are then derived. To calculate the Glycemic Index of the test food, its Integrated Area Under Curve is indexed against that of the average Integrated Area Under Curve for the reference food (mean of three separate tests).</summary>
