Duration of each condition - One weekend of testing from Friday night until Monday morning.
Each participant will only undertake 2 of the 3 conditions. They will be randomised to the conditions.
Crossover study. Duration of the 'washout' period - A minimum of 3 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As our lives get busier, it is increasingly common for people to work longer hours and get less sleep during the week. People often rely on weekends to catch-up on the sleep they have missed during the week. There has been some evidence that restricting the amount of sleep we have may predispose to developing glucose resistance and subsequent diabetes. We will also test how sleep deprivation impacts on daytime concentration and brain and memory function. This study will involve 3 study visits, with 2 being conducted over 2 weekends, at least 3 weeks apart.</summary>
