    <statisticalmethods>Considering this is a preliminary exploratory study, a non-probability method of convenience sampling will be used. This will be based on the convenience of sampling according to the PPTA website stating one average class in New Zealand has 25 pupils, but most frequently class sizes are of 28 students, to gain an approximation of the representation of this population (http://www.ppta.org.nz/issues/class-size).

An estimated sample of 140 participants from the year group, consisting of 5 year eight classes, will be recruited,

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mindfulness in schools programmes are increasing in use and aim to provide children and adolescents globally with the education to develop mindfulness skills (Burke, 2009; Harnett &amp; Dawe, 2012; Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz, &amp; Walach, 2014). Research is, however, in its infancy for evaluating the effects of mindfulness on young people. The number of studies are growing, but the enthusiasm of the delivery of programmes currently exceeds the evidence for their effectiveness (Greenberg &amp; Harris, 2012).

A range of outcome effects of mindfulness training on children and adolescents research have evaluated cognitive performance (Semple, Lee, Rosa, &amp; Miller, 2010), emotional regulation (Broderick &amp; Metz, 2009), well-being (Hennelly, 2011; Huppert &amp; Johnson, 2010), depression (Biegel, Brown, Shapiro, &amp; Schubert, 2009), and blood pressure (Gregoski, Barnes, Tingen, Harshfield, &amp; Treiber, 2011). Further research to evaluate specific outcomes may be beneficial to gain a richer understanding of the effects of mindfulness in schools programmes for children and adolescents. Therefore this study aims to evaluate resilience as an outcome measure specifically, to help establish a greater understanding of effects of this education and training with children. 

Resilience is an important process that helps in dealing with disruptive, stressful, or challenging life events, in a way that provides the individual with additional protective and coping skills. The development of children and youth to overcome challenging situations, can be assisted by encouraging characteristics of efficacy, self-esteem and perseverance (Lerner, Brentano, Dowling, &amp; Anderson, 2002).

This study aims to evaluate whether resilience can be increased by learning mindfulness techniques so that in the face of challenge or adversity, the involvement of awareness and control of thoughts and feelings are active, and positive relationships that encompass empathy and kindness are fostered (Hennelly, 2011; Huppert &amp; Johnson, 2010). Beneficial results from this study, in collaboration with similar studies globally, may encourage and strengthen the use 
of mindfulness teaching in the mainstream education system in New Zealand and globally.

This study aims to advance the understanding of the effects of mindfulness training on 11-12 year old children by administering a mindfulness-training course, the globally established nine-week .b (dot be) programme developed in England, taught in a New Zealand school context, measuring resilience as the variable pre- and post-intervention, and comparing changes in resilience within the class. 

The design will employ a quantitative approach using current child specific resilience survey tools the Child Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM) and the Ego Resilience Scale (ERS) pre and post  completion of the course.</summary>
