    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - UX007

Experimental: UX007 (Triheptanoin) - This is a single arm, open label study. All subjects will be on active treatment; no reference therapy or placebo will be administered.


Treatment: drugs: UX007
UX007 is a liquid intended for oral (PO) administration.

             UX007/triheptanoin treatment as apart of clinical studies, ISTs or expanded
             access/compassionate use treatment programs may be eligible at the discretion of the
             Sponsor

          -  Provide written informed consent or verbal assent (if possible) with written informed
             consent by a legally authorized representative after the nature of the study has been
             explained, and prior to any research related procedures

          -  Must, in the opinion of the investigator, be willing and able to complete all aspects
             of the study, and comply with accurate completion of the seizure diary

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             Baseline and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females
             considered not of childbearing potential include those who have not experienced
             menarche, are post-menopausal (defined as having no mensus for at least 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause), or are permanently sterile due to total
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  Participants of child-bearing potential or fertile males with partners of
             child-bearing potential who are sexually active must consent to use a highly-effective
             method of contraception as determined by the investigator from the period following
             the signing of the informed consent through 30 days after last dose of study drug.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Any known hypersensitivity to triheptanoin, that in the judgement of the investigator,
             places the subject at an increased risk for adverse effects

          -  History of, or current suicidal ideation, behavior and/or attempts

          -  Pregnant and/or breast feeding an infant

          -  Unwilling or unable to discontinue use of prohibited medication (barbiturates,
             pancreatic lipase inhibitors) or other substance that may confound study objectives.
             Use of up to 3 concomitant AEDs is allowed, provided dose has been stable at least 14
             days prior to Baseline

          -  Use of any Investigational Product, drug or supplement (other than UX007) within 30
             days prior to Baseline, or at any time during the study

          -  Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the investigator, that
             it warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment

          -  Has a concurrent disease or condition, or laboratory abnormality that, in the view of
             the investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of
             not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or introduce
             additional safety concerns</exclusivecriteria>
