  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women will have access to an online intervention website for a period of 12 months. Women will be directed to the website at measurement points (baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation) and invited to access at her discretion throughout the year. Components of the website include: safety-seeking behaviours, safety decision priorities, danger assessment, and a personalised safety action plan. The website provides automated, individualised feedback about decision priorities and level of danger. The woman develops a tailored action plan with community resources and tips about safety for her and her children.</interventions>
    <comparator>Women will have access to the online control website for a period of 12 months. Women will be directed to the website at measurement points (baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation) and invited to access at her discretion throughout the year. The website includes a resource list with a range of internet and community resources (e.g., Womens Refuge, Its Not OK, mental health services, legal services, housing, drug and alcohol treatment, child health, batterer intervention programmes, and general health and welfare services). Resources are not individualised to the safety needs of the woman.</comparator>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants enrol online and those who meet entry criteria are randomised to one of two groups. Allocation is automatically computer generated centrally. The randomisation algorithm uses two random factors in addition to a stratified block scheme. These random factors greatly reduce the predictability of the next random allocation thereby promoting concealment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised using a minimisation scheme with two stratification factors (severity of violence and children) and 2 random factors each with 2 equiprobable levels. Severity of violence factor is dichotomous, based on one positive response to the current intimate partner violence eligibility items versus two or more. The children factor is also dichotomous, the woman having one or more children versus none. The computerised randomisation is merged with the online application system so that eligible applicants are automatically assigned.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The problem of intimate partner violence (IPV) and its mental health effects on women are significant in New Zealand. Our overall goal is to develop culturally appropriate and accessible interventions for women that limit IPV and its negative consequences. One of the most widely recommended intervention is safety planning. A safety decision aid, weighing the dangers of leaving or staying in a relationship, gives women the opportunity to prioritise and plan safety for themselves and their children.
 
Using an experimental design, we will test the effectiveness of an interactive Internet-based safety decision aid. 340 abused women will be assigned by chance in equal numbers to either a safety decision aid intervention or control website. 

Women will be asked to self-report online their decisional conflict related to an abusive relationship, their safety-seeking behaviours, mental health and exposure to repeat violence when they start the trial and 3, 6, and 12-months later.</summary>
