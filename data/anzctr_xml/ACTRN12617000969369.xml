  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Micronutrient deficiency can occur in adults if their diet is unbalanced or inadequate. The elderly are at a higher risk for nutritional deficiencies. Factors such as changes in digestion, metabolism and absorption of food due to ageing, limited food choices due to weakened teeth and restrictions to physical movement may account for this. Dietary supplements can aid in reaching adequate levels of micronutrient in adults. Among these, the largest category is combinations of vitamins and minerals that are formulated to deliver a large percentage (typically 50-100%) of the recommended daily intake (RDI). Yet, the clear difference in bioavailability of micronutrient from supplements between young and elderly adults have not been established. 
This study aims to investigate whether the bioavailability of a vitamin and mineral supplement is changed in the elderly, and to look at whether changes in bioavailability have an effect on metabolic processes. We hypothesise that the ageing will impair the bioavailability of vitamins and minerals, and that the metabolic profile will reflect these impairments..</summary>
