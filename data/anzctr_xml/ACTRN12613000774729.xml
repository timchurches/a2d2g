    <interventions>What is BART and what does it involve?

Radiotherapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA.

Bladder adaptive radiotherapy (BART) is a specialized technique that utilizes computed tomography (CT) scans to visualize the bladder, and therefore allow optimal matching of a radiotherapy treatment plan on a daily basis. Adaptive radiotherapy is particularly useful in the treatment of bladder cancer, given the significant daily variability in the location and size of the bladder. The technique of daily optimization of treatment plans allows smaller volumes to be treated and therefore less toxicity to surrounding normal organs (such as small &amp; large bowel).

The dosage amount and frequency of radiotherapy administered in this trial will not differ from standard non-adaptive treatment that you would otherwise receive if you declined participation in the trial. These parameters will be determined by your Radiation Oncologist. In the large majority of cases, radiotherapy will be given as 5 treatments per week (daily from Monday to Friday), as part of a 4-7 week treatment course.

BOLART refers to an ongoing study of adaptive image-guided radiotherapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer that is being carried out by the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group. We have adapted the BOLART protocol to allow the adaptive radiotherapy technique to commence from day 1 rather than day 8. This adjustment allows the benefits of adaptive radiotherapy to be realised earlier on in the treatment. We have also modified from BOLART the method of optimization of treatment plans, which we theorise from our experience should allow easier and tighter matching to the best fit of the day.

The duration of radiotherapy treatment will be determined by your Radiation Oncologist, but will generally range from 4-7 weeks. Follow-up review will be conducted by treating Radiation Oncology team at 4-6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-treatment.
