  <interventions>
    <interventions>With the permission of the heads of department of both Rheumatology and Respiratory medicine at Fremantle Hospital, an audit will take place of patients attending the outpatient clinic of both of these departments between 2006 and 2010. At the same time an audit of patients attending the private rooms of one of the investigators will also be carried out. This audit will identify subjects who have had a serum MBL level measured at some part of their disease investigation and who have a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis alone, bronchiectasis alone, or coexisting RA and bronchiectasis. Once the patients have been identified, data including age, sex and details of diagnosis will be collated from the existing patient record. The audit and data collection will take place over a 3 month period commencing September 2011.</interventions>
    <comparator>Serum MBL levels of subjects suffering both RA and Bronchiectasis will be compared with serum MBL levels of subjects suffering RA alone and subjects suffering bronchiectasis alone.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a well established association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and bronchiectasis. It has been observed that patients who suffer RA are between 10 and 30 times more likely to develop bronchiectasis. The aetiology of this association is unknown. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a component of  the immune system which is active in fighting infection. It is thought that a deficiency in MBL may predispose individuals to infection especially if there is coexisting immunodeficiency. This study seeks to find an association between MBL deficiency and the development of bronchiectasis in patients with RA as a means to providing insight into the association between the two diseases.</summary>
