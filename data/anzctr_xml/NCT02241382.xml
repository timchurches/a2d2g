  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Internal Electrocardioversion
Treatment: devices - External Electrocardioversion

Active Comparator: External Electrocardioversion - Cardioversion with an external cardioverter-defibrillator with a step-up energy protocol (100, 150, 200, 360 J biphasic) in antero-posterior orientation, maintaining a &gt; 8 cm distance between shock electrodes and device and complying with a "cool-down" phase of 2 minute between shocks, if more than one shock is required.

Experimental: Internal Electrocardioversion - Cardioversion via the implanted ICD with a maximum energy synchronized shock (41 J, with a RV -&gt; SVC+can shock orientation in pts with SVC leads). After 1 ineffective internal shock, the patient will be counted as internal CV failure and cardioverted externally, following the same protocol as the external CV group.


Treatment: devices: Internal Electrocardioversion
Cardioversion by internal shock application via the implanted ICD

Treatment: devices: External Electrocardioversion
Cardioversion by external shock application via a cardioverter/defibrillator.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Combined Safety Endpoint - Any one of the following as assessed by device interrogation:
a rise in threshold (at constant duration) of &gt;0.5V
exit block of one of the pacing leads
loss of programming of the device
a rise in shock impedance by 50% as compared to prior to CV
a rise in charge time by 50% as compared to prior to CV
a drop in battery voltage of =0.2V within 2 weeks</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks after CV</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy Endpoint: restoration of sinus rhythm - Assessed by ECG, within the first seconds after DC shock application (via external CV or internal shock)
- Restoration of sinus rhythm
In all patients a single p wave after cardioversion counts as a successful shock. Early recurrence of AF does not count as shock failure. In case of early recurrence of AF/AT, the successful shock may be performed once more, according to randomization. Adjunctive antiarrhythmic drug administration is left to the physician's discretion</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 1 minute after CV</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Induction of ventricular fibrillation - Inadvertent induction of VF during CV, assessed by 3 or 5 lead ECG monitoring during the procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>during CV procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lead parameter indicators of impairment - Assessed by device interrogation within 15 minutes after CV and at follow-up after 2 weeks:
Lead impedance &gt; 1000 Ohm
Lead impedance doubled
Ventricular lead sensing &lt; 2mV
Ventricular lead sensing halved, compared to prior to CV
Atrial lead sensing &lt; 1mV
Atrial lead sensing halved, compared to prior to CV</outcome>
      <timepoint>within 15 minutes after CV and 2 weeks after CV</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Troponin - Comparison of Troponin T levels prior to and 3h after cardioversion</outcome>
      <timepoint>3h after CV</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recurrence at follow-up - Rhythm at follow-up assessed by ECG and device interrogation. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia will be counted as recurrence.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Implantation of internal defibrillators, capable of monitoring the heart and shocking life
      threatening arrhythmias back to normal rhythm, for patients with severe heart failure
      increases the probability of survival. Arrhythmias of the atria of the heart are common in
      these patients. Administering a direct current electrical shock under anesthesia
      (cardioversion) is the method of choice to reestablish normal sinus rhythm in this instance.
      Safety and efficacy of external electrical cardioversion (CV) in patients with ICDs was
      demonstrated in several studies. Safety of internal cardioversion (shocking the heart back
      into normal rhythm via the implanted defibrillator) was described in several smaller trials.

      Performing external instead of internal cardioversion in patients with implanted ICDs is more
      feasible for most hospitals, as CV can be performed without a programming computer and an
      additional specialist present, e.g. on the intensive care ward, and device interrogation can
      be done after CV at the remote ICD/pacemaker clinic.

      No scientific data on safety and efficacy endpoints comparing internal vs external CV is
      currently available. The aim of the study is to compare external vs internal electrical
      cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias and establish a safety and efficacy profile for external
      and internal cardioversion in large cohort of ICD patients.</summary>
