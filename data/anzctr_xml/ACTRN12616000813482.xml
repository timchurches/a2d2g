    <statisticalmethods>The survey will be sent to all existing pulmonary rehabilitation programs (based on the current Lung Foundation Australia contact list). This is aiming to capture as many programs as possible in order to understand the current practice of measuring,  using and prescribing oxygen therapy  in pulmonary rehabilitation. 

As this is a survey, The total number of responses will be calculated and then divide by the total number in each category. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise-induced oxygen desaturation is common in people with chronic lung diseases who are not on long-term oxygen therapy. Supplemental oxygen therapy is often used during exercise testing and training in pulmonary rehabilitation programs. However, there are no standard Australian guidelines on the use and prescription of supplemental oxygen therapy during exercise testing and training in this patient population so current practice remains unknown. Consequently, we are interested in investigating the use of supplemental oxygen therapy in pulmonary rehabilitation.

The study aims to evaluate the current pattern of prescribing and using supplemental oxygen therapy in pulmonary rehabilitation programs in Australia.</summary>
