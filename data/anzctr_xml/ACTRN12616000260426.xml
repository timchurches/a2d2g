    <interventions>This study investigates the prevalence and cause of malnutrition among older people living in urban and rural area of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Rigorous parameters will be used to determine nutritional status and frailty, ranging from anthropocentric, biochemical, clinical and dietary, and functional assessments.  Due to the substantial differences in demographic and socio-economic characteristics between urban and rural area, a structured questionnaire will be used to investigate food security and supply at household levels. Participants were assessed at a single timepoint at enrollment.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated with GPower version 3.1.9.2 (Universitat Kiel, Germany). With 95% power, 5% error and inclusion of up to 15 different variables into the regression model, the study requires a minimum sample size of 262 subjects (from both the urban and rural regions) to detect an effect size of 0.05. The details of sample size calculation (GPower output) are as follow:

Linear multiple regression: Fixed model, single regression coefficient
Analysis: A priori: Compute required sample size
Input: Tail(s) = Two
Effect size f^2 = 0.05
a err prob = 0.05
Power (1-beta err prob) = 0.95
Number of predictors = 15
Output: Noncentrality parameter d = 3.6193922
Critical t = 1.9696542
Df = 246
Total sample size = 262
Actual power = 0.9500422

Statistical Analysis will be performed using SPSS version 22.0 for Windows. Results for all parameters will be presented for all areas (total) as well as breakdown by sub-districts and villages. All analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle controlling for the effects of recruitment area. Paired t-test will be performed to measure changes in within areas, while independent t-test will be used to determine differences between subject from urban and rural areas. Multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regression will be used to determine the predictors of nutritional status including gender, age, energy and protein intake, nutritional status, weight, BMI, frailty, physical activity and muscle function, mental status, medications, co-morbidities, and socio-economic status.
Meanwhile, Qualitative data will be recorded and transcribed. Then the data will be analyzed according to response/answers, frequency/percentages of each similar response/answers will be calculated and presented in descriptive statistics.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Malnutrition brings considerable negative consequences to the health and quality of life of older people, as well as significant burden to the health care system. It is anticipated that malnutrition among older people will increase along with the increase in the number of people aged &gt; 60 years. Thus, it is essential to devise an effective intervention strategy to prevent and treat malnutrition among older people. The aim of this project is to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition and determinants of nutritional status among older people living in urban and rural area of Yogyakarta, and to device and recommend potential solutions to improve the nutritional status of older people living in urban and rural area of Yogyakarta.</summary>
