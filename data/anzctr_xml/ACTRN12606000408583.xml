  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to determine whether a water-based exercise training program is effective in improving exercise capacity and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in whom co-morbidities may affect participation in land-based exercise.

Hypothesis: On completion of an eight-week water-based exercise program, subjects with COPD and co-morbid condition/s will demonstrate significant improvements in exercise capacity and HRQoL.  These improvements will be comparable to COPD subjects with co-morbid condition/s completing an eight-week land-based exercise program.</summary>
