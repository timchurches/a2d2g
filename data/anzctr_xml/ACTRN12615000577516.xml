  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the treatment groups will complete 5 lessons in 8 weeks of a self guided internet-delivered treatment program for OCD. All participants will be followed up 24 months after they complete the intervention. The content of the 5 lesson intervention includes:

Lesson One (1 week):
Learn about the physical, cognitive and behavioural symptoms of OCD and the principles of CBT treatment for OCD.

Lesson 2 (2 weeks): 
Learn about the relationship between unhelpful thinking and anxiety. Read examples of how people with symptoms of OCD improve the accuracy of unhelpful thinking styles.

Lesson 3 (1 week): 
Learn about the physical symptoms of OCD and read examples of how people learn to manage them.

Lesson 4 (2 weeks):
Learn about the unhelpful behaviours of OCD (compulsions and avoidance) and how to challenge those behaviours with exposure and response prevention.

Lesson 5 (2 weeks):
Learn about relapse prevention and staying well. 

The immediate treatment group will complete the program immediately, whilst the delayed treatment condition will complete the program after a 8 week delay. Both groups receive the same information and participants will be asked questions about how much time they spent using the skills described in the program. 

The internet-delivered lessons for both groups take approximately 30 minutes to read through, with homework exercises taking a further hour per day. The lessons are based on current best practice cognitive and behavioural techniques and include exposure and response prevention, and cognitive techniques. A printable information summary will also be provided, and some homework assignments will be set.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from Australia and internationally via the eCentreClinic website until the 600 participants are recruited. Potential applicants will read about the study and will be invited to apply. Those interested will read more information and will then complete an online Informed Consent Form. Applicants who do not meet study criteria will be automatically excluded with clear information provided encouraging them to seek support from their primary care provider. All excluded participants will also be provided with the details of an international organization that assists with finding local crisis services (www.befrienders.org). Eligible participants will be sent an email welcoming them to the Course and given details about how to access the Course. 

The website www.random.org will be used to determine a list of randomly generated numbers that correspond to a group. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups after they successfully complete the application process. The process is unblinded. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to recruit and educate participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder using a 5-lesson education program administered via the Internet. Participants in the Internet self-guided group begin the program immediately, and their results will be compared with a waitlist control condition. To understand who responds best to a self-guided education, participants will complete various measures assessing variables such as self-efficacy, reason for compulsion, type of obsession, level of disgust, readiness to change and emotion regulation deficits. Participants in Group 2 will receive access to the education program when Group 1 completes post-education assessments (Week 9). Both groups will be followed up at 3-,12-, and 24-months post-education. </summary>
