  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Osprey Medical CINCOR System utilizes catheter system along with institutional vacuum in which contrast media (CM) injected into the left coronary arteries is retrieved from the coronary sinus (CS). The 
investigational device works by retrieving contrast agent prior to reaching the systemic circulation and the kidneys thereby helping to avoid the development of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN).  
The removal catheter will be in place in the coronary sinus for the duration of the PCI procedure (approximately 1 to 2 hours).  Each collection episode will require that the vacuum is activated for approximately 8-12 seconds.  It is anticipated that up to 12 collection episodes will occur during a PCI procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Single arm study, no comparator.  All patients will undergo standard of care treatment, peri-procedural hydration, for the prevention of CIN.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Retrieval of contrast agent.  Success criterion for this endpoint is 40% or greater retrieval of contrast agent.  This criterion will be assessed by analyzing collected blood for iodine content by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured on the day of the coronary procedure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe the safety of the device by summarising all system- and procedure-related adverse events and estimating the serious system- and procedure-related serious adverse event free rate.  Adverse events evaluated include:

Death, Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), Myocardial infarction, Pericardial hemorrhage/tamponade requiring treatment, Coronary sinus perforation, dissection, or occlusion, Blood loss requiring transfusion, Other events related to partial coronary sinus occlusion and suction.  These events will be evaluated using standard medical techniques including electrocardiogram (ECG), angiography, clinical laboratory tests, and patient interview.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluated through 30 days post-procedure.  This endpoint will be evaluated at all scheduled and unscheduled study visits.  Scheduled post-procedure visits occur at 1, 4, and 30 days post-procedure.</timepoint>

7.	The subject is hypotensive (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg not corrected by intravenous saline) or requiring intravenous pressors and/or intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation.
8.	The subject has decompensated heart failure requiring intravenous diuretic, inotropic, vasopressor or intraaortic balloon support in the previous 7 days.
