  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects will be included if they have a unilateral shoulder problem of local mechanical origin.  This will be defined as pain over the glenohumeral joint or in proximal upper limb during shoulder movements and restriction of greater than 30 degrees active flexion or abduction range or greater than 10cm active hand-behind-back range compared to unaffected side.  </inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Subjects will be excluded if their shoulder problem is due to trauma in last month, if they have an acute inflammatory or local neoplastic disorder, if they complain of a feeling of instability at the glenohumeral joint during active shoulder movements or if passive mobilisation of the joints of the shoulder region is contra-indicated.  Subjects will also be excluded if their shoulder pain is referred from vertebral column structures.  Referred pain will be defined as pain over the glenohumeral joint or in the proximal upper limb during active neck movements or during palpation of cervicothoracic vertebral column or complaining of paraesthesiae in affected upper limb.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>90 volunteers presenting for treatment at a public hospital outpatient department with restricted, painful shoulder dysfunction will be recruited. Following an initial examination to obtain baseline data subjects will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: advice and exercises or advice, exercises and passive joint mobilisations. Subjects will attend between 4 and 8 treatment sessions over a one month period. Outcome measurements will then be re-assessed. Following re-assessment treatment may continue for a maximum of 10 treatment sessions over a maximum of 8 weeks. Re-assessment will be repeated 6 months after recruitment.</summary>
