  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Up to 80% of Australians experience back pain and 10% have significant disability as a
      result. There is a critical need for the development and evaluation of innovative treatments
      that have the capacity to target the multidimensional nature of chronic low back pain. This
      study will compare the effects and mechanisms of Mindfulness Meditation, Cognitive Therapy,
      and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for chronic low back pain. Results will ultimately
      lead to streamlined interventions designed to efficiently maximise benefit.</summary>
