  <interventions>
    <interventions>Error-based learning (EBL) involves the use of systematic feedback and other metacognitive techniques to teach people self-regulation skills (i.e., self-reflection, anticipation, self-monitoring and self-correction of errors) during task performance.

Manualized treatment protocols have been developed for both interventions (errorless and error-based learning) from pilot research. Uniform elements of both error-based learning and errorless learning include: a) 8 weekly treatment sessions of approximately 90-120 minutes conducted in the participants own home; b) use of verbal reinforcement for correct performance; c) learning to prepare a main meal (a stir-fry) for the first 4 training sessions (1-4); and d) development of a set of errands for participants to learn in the home or community as the second multi-tasking training activity for the last 4 sessions (5-8). 

Occupational therapists experienced with working with individuals with brain injuries will administer the face-to-face, in home rehabilitation program.
</interventions>
    <comparator>This RCT is using error-less learning (ELL) as an active control intervention. Errorless learning involves teaching individuals new skills by preventing them from making mistakes, to promote error free performance.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by treating therapists or case managers in three large metropolitan-based brain injury rehabilitation services in Brisbane and Sydney, Australia. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be approached by their therapist or case manager, who will provide a brief summary of the study. If the patient is interested in taking part, he or she will provide their verbal consent for the project coordinator to contact them about the study.

A standard screening process will be employed to help ensure that the intervention targets a homogenous profile of participants with awareness and dysexecutive impairments across the centers. 

Specifically, treating therapists will refer people with severe TBI who exhibit marked difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and awareness deficits. Suitability for the study will be confirmed through tests of executive function at pre-assessment, as conducted by a blind assessor. Participants will receive a brief neuropsychological battery consisting of tests of attention, memory, and executive function. A global neuropsychological function composite will be calculated by summing and averaging age-adjusted standardized scores, and classified as ‘mild to moderate deficit’ (&lt; -2 SD), or ‘severe deficit’ (equal to or &gt; -2 SD). 

Participants' global neuropsychological function (mild-moderate deficit [&lt; -2 SD] or severe deficit [&gt; -2 SD]) will be used to determine their subgroup for random allocation based on matched assignment. </concealment>
    <sequence>The random assignment will be conducted independent of the project staff involved in the interventions and the blind assessor. For each subgroup (i.e., mild to moderate or severe deficit), participants will be randomly allocated to EBL or ELL using sequentially numbered and sealed opaque envelopes. The envelopes will contain group allocation on a written insert, based on a predetermined random computer generated sequence.

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be screened to ascertain any state/site or therapist effects or the effects of demographic and clinical factors on outcome, with any significant variables treated as covariates in respective analyses. Participant attrition will be managed on an intention-to-treat basis. To compare the efficacy of EBL and ELL, a series of mixed 2 x 2 ANOVAs (group by time [pre vs post]) will be run with the error self-regulation dependent variables of: Cooking Task errors and Zoo Map Part 1 score. Mixed 2 x 3 ANOVAs (group by time [pre, post and follow-up]) will examine the long-term impact of each intervention on awareness of deficits, behavioral competency, role functioning and support needs. In each set of analyses, interaction effects will be examined to determine whether EBL is associated with greater gains than ELL relative to pre-intervention functioning. 


In terms of sample size, the number of participants required was based on a previous RCT comparing a metacognitive condition with another treatment condition. Based on the same design and approach to statistical analysis, a conservative power analysis was conducted using an estimated medium effect size, alpha level of .05, and power of 0.8. According to G*Power a sample size of n = 123 is required to detect significant two-way interaction effects. Due to possible attrition, a total sample size of n = 135 will be required.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Poor skills generalization poses a major barrier to successful outcomes of rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Error-based learning (EBL) is a relatively new intervention approach that aims to promote skills generalization by teaching people internal self-regulation skills, or how to anticipate, monitor and correct their own errors. This study aims to compare the efficacy of EBL and errorless learning (ELL) for improving awareness of deficits, skills generalization and long-term social outcomes after TBI. </summary>
