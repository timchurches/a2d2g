  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either prophylactic platelet transfusions if the platelet count is less than 10 x 10e9/L, or no prophylaxis if the platelet count is less than 10e9/L, with therapeutic transfusions given only after documented signs or symptoms of bleeding (World Health Organization [WHO] Grade 2, 3 or 4) or prior to a planned invasive procedure. The duration of the intervention is 30 days from randomisation. Platelet transfusions will be given as a single adult dose for patients who develop WHO Grade 2 bleeds. For patients who develop WHO Grade 3 or 4 bleeds, the platelet dose will be decided by the attending haematologist.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is prophylactic platelet transfusions if the platelet count is less than 10 x 10e9/L, following documented signs or symptoms of bleeding (WHO Grade 2, 3 or 4) or prior to planned invasive procedure. A single adult dose will be given on the same day that a platelet count is recorded as less than 10 x 10e9/L and continued daily until the platelet count is greater than 10 x10e9/L. A single adult dose will be given to patients who develop a WHO Grade 2 bleed. For patients who develop WHO Grade 3 0r 4 bleeds, the platelet dose will be decided by the attending haematologist. 
The overall duration of the prophylactic treatment is 30 days from randomisation.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients are identified. If consent is obtained and once the patientâ€™s platelet count falls below 50 x 10e9/L, the patient is randomised to either treatment arm. An independent central on-line 24 hour internet system is used for randomisation at all centres. A unique trial number and treatment policy is assigned and the randomising centre confirms the allocated treatment to the principle investigator (PI) by email.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer program at the randomising centre will allocate patients using minimisation with a random element. Minimisation will balance the allocation of treatment policy between centres, patients with different diagnosis, and treatment plan.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial hypothesis is that a policy of no prophylactic platelet transfusion is as safe as (or non-inferior to) a policy of prophylactic transfusion, based on a threshold peripheral blood platelet count of less than 10 x 10e9/L.</summary>
