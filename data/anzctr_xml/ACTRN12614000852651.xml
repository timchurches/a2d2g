  <interventions>
    <interventions>We complete an examination of computerised working memory training. The study consists of three conditions, or arms: Active (Arm 1), Placebo (Arm 2), Control (Arm 3).

Active condition: We used the RM (i.e., school age) version of Cogmed Working Memory Training (Cogmed, 2014). Cogmed RM is a computerised training program, which requires children to complete a number of interactive visuo-spatial tasks each day. Each game requires the child to hold and manipulate information in working memory. For example, in one of the games, blocks on the screen will momentarily glow, one at a time, in a certain order. The child is required to remember the order, and then select the lit blocks in the reverse order. 

Trials within the training program are scaffolded to the participants ability, matching the difficulty of trials to the childs ongoing performance. Participants completed the computerised training every school day for five weeks. Each training session took approximately 45 minutes, and was completed in a computer laboratory of the childs school, under the supervision of a teacher. We attempted to train 4 class teachers in the web-based Coach training provided by Cogmed, however, two teachers reported that the training was too difficult and did not complete the program. As a result, teachers were trained as training aides by the first author, who also oversaw the technical administration of training.


</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo condition: A low level, unscaffolded version of Cogmed training was used as a placebo. The training program involves the same tasks as the active version completed and is also completed on a daily basis for five weeks, however, the difficulty of trials remains constant. A much discussed limitation of the placebo version of Cogmed is the discrepancy in training time between active and placebo conditions. Specifically, training time is consistently lower in the placebo version of training (Chacko, Bedard, et al., 2013). In order to approximate the conditions training time and contact with the supportive adult, it has been suggested that the number of trials is increased in the placebo version. As previous attempts to increase training time on a case-by-case basis have been unsuccessful (Chacko, Bedard, et al., 2013), we increased the training weight by 30% for all participants in the placebo condition at the beginning of training. This increases the number of trials completed for each session. 

Control condition: No further contact with researchers during the five-week training time. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We employed a cluster randomised controlled design. After school principals had given consent, each class of students was randomly allocated to control, active or placebo using a random number generation chart. This process was performed by the lead researcher. Trial eligibility for each student was assessed by the class teacher, who was blind to condition allocation. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was determined by calculations of statistical power. Thirty three participants per condition is recommended to detect a medium effect (d = 0.5) with power of .80 (Cohen, 1988; Rosenthal &amp; Rosnow, 2008). We therefore aimed to recruit a minimum of 33 participants per condition to ensure adequate power.

Our hypotheses will be analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVAs). A series of linear regressions using bootstrapping procedures will also be completed to determine the hypothesised mediation effects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Working memory (WM) training programs have received considerable empirical attention in recent years. Evidence for the efficacy of these programs in improving WM capacity is mixed (Gibson et al., 2011; Gibson, Gondoli, Johnson, Steeger, &amp; Morrissey, 2012; Rapport, Orban, Kofler, &amp; Friedman, 2013; Shipstead, Hicks, &amp; Engle, 2012). Current literature has explored whether WM training may be used to improve symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD, for a review of treatment effiacy see Chacko, Feirsen, et al., 2013; Rapport et al., 2013), and academic performance (for review of efficacy see Titz &amp; Karbach, 2014). Although findings suggest some positive impact of training, the strength and clinical significance of the effect is uncertain. In light of the differing results, the need to explore the mechanisms through which WM training impacts outcomes has been highlighted (Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, &amp; Shah, 2012). Indeed, supporters (e.g., Gathercole, Dunning, &amp; Holmes, 2012) and critics (e.g., Shipstead et al., 2012) of WM training alike acknowledge that further understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underpinning WM training is needed.  We sought to close this important gap in the literature by exploring potential mechanisms through which WM training may improve academic skills, specifically, reading comprehension and mathematics. </summary>
