Experimental: MOR209/ES414 - Cohorts 1-3 of the dose escalation stage of the study (Stage 1) will test weekly doses of 0.2 mcg/kg to 2 mcg/kg. Cohorts 4-9 of the dose escalation stage of the study (Stage 1) will test continuous infusion at flat doses of 25 mcg to 300 mcg per day delivered continuously over 24 hours. The maximum tolerated dose from Stage 1 of the study will be further examined in Stage 2. Patients in cohorts 1-3 will receive MOR209/ES414 weekly via intravenous (IV) infusion during the first three 28-day cycles and then on Day 1 and 15 of each subsequent cycle until disease progression, intolerable toxicity occurs, or the patient withdraws consent. Patients in cohorts 4-9 will receive MOR209/ES414 as a continuous IV infusion for 6 months until disease progression, intolerable toxicity occurs, or the patient withdraws consent.


Other interventions: MOR209/ES414
MOR209/ES414 is a novel humanized bispecific antibody which is designed to treat mCRPC by redirecting T-cell cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cells expressing prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will be conducted in 2 Stages. The primary objective of Stage 1 of the study is to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MOR209/ES414 administered intravenously to
      patients with mCRPC. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, cytokine response, and clinical activity of
      MOR209/ES414.

      The primary objective of Stage 2 of the study is to evaluate the clinical activity of
      MOR209/ES414 in patients that have or have not received prior chemotherapy. Secondary
      objectives are to further characterize the safety profile, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of
      MOR209/ES414.</summary>
