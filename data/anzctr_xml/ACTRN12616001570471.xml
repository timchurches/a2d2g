  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients requiring rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department using ketamine and rocuronium in the opinion of their treating doctor will be randomised to one of two arms in a 1:1 ratio.   In addition to the trial medication (described below), each patient will receive either ketamine 1mg/kg + rocuronium 1.5mg/kg (reduced dosing group), or ketamine 2mg/kg + rocuronium 1.5mg/kg (standard dose). The medications will be administered as an intravenous bolus. As the requirement for reduced dosing is multifactorial, and is not readily distilled into an algorithm, the decision as to whether to use standard or reduced dosing will be at the discretion of the treating doctor (who will be at least a senior registrar) using clinical gestalt.

The treatment arm will receive the medication detailed above, preceded by fentanyl 2mg/kg (standard dose) or 1mg/kg (reduced dose) as an intravenous bolus.

The drugs will be adminstered in the order of fentanyl (or placebo), followed by ketamine, followed by rocuronium, in a rapid sequence.  Following the administration of the medications, intubation will proceed in a standardised fashion.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be administered an equal volume of 0.9% saline rather than fentanyl.  The 0.9% saline will be provided in a pre-drawn syringe, identical to those that the fentanyl is provided in.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A prior study by Lyon et al*, comparing etomidate and suxamethonium with fentanyl, ketamine and rocuronium (in a 'before and after' fashion), showed that approximately 80% of the first group and 40% of the second became hypotensive or hypertensive following RSI. Jabre et als** RCT, comparing ketamine and etomidate use for RSI showed that both were associated with similar changes in systolic blood pressure. Consequently, it seems plausible that the addition of fentanyl to an induction regime of ketamine and rocuronium could reduce the proportion of patients meeting the primary end-point from approximately 80% to approximately 40%.  

As it is typical for observational studies to overstate treatment effects, a margin for error has been allowed, and the figures of 70% and 50% have been used. Using these estimates, with a power of 90%, and a significance level set at 0.05, we calculate that a sample size of 134 in each group will be necessary to detect a true difference.

To allow for dropouts, approximately 10% will be added to the planned sample size, meaning that a target of 300 patients (150 in each arm) will be recruited.

Data will be entered into an electronic spread sheet for analysis using Stata version 11 (Statacorp, TX). Normally distributed data will be described as means, with 95% confidence intervals, and non-normally distributed data will be described as medians, with interquartile range.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ketamine is an induction agent to induce general anaesthesia in the emergency department, associated with less frequent episodes of hypotension than other agents such as thiopentone1 or propofol2. However, it is typically associated with increases in blood pressure in stable patients, and can cause hypotension in shocked patients3.

In critically ill patients, avoiding hypotension is important, as its occurrence is known to be associated with poor outcomes4, particularly in the head injured patient5.  However, hypertension is also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly in patients with intracranial bleeds (although cause and effect is not established) 6, and is usually avoided in haemorrhagic shock, due to consensus concern about increasing bleeding7,8.

Co-administration of fentanyl during rapid sequence induction has been advocated as leading to less deviation from baseline haemodynamics9.  

It remains unclear whether in the emergency department and pre-hospital setting, this has any significant impact on mortality, and this exploratory study aims to evaluate whether patients undergoing RSI with ketamine and fentanyl, rather then ketamine and placebo have fewer episodes of adverse haemodynamic effects (systolic blood pressure less to 91 mmHg or greater than 149 mmHg) within the first 10 minutes following induction, and whether there is a subsequent difference in mortality at 3, 7 and 30 days.

The study will be powered to detect a difference in the percentage of patients who meet the primary endpoint of low or high blood pressure, and will be used to inform future work regarding difference in mortality benefit.
