    <interventions>Ipmplantation of penile prosthesis in patients with refractory erectile dysfunction
Penile prosthesis is a three pieces inflatable by normal saline hydraulic device, consisting by two cylinders implanted in the corpora cavernosa, connected by a tube with an operating pump implanted in the scrotum, which is also connected by a tube with a reservoir containing the saline, implanted in Regius space. 
Implantation procedure of three pieces is accomplished through a single penoscrotal incision and it lasts about one hour</interventions>
