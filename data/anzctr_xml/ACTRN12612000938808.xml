  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate/amodiaquine (standard dose of 30mg/kg of amodiaquine (10mg/kg x 3 times per day for 3 days) and 12mg/kg of artesunate (4mg/kg x 3 times per day for 3 days) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. The treatment will be taken orally. Eligibile subjects will be treated for three days and followed up for 28 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Artemether/lumefantrine (20mg artemether and 120mg lumefantrine tablet) twice daily for three consecutive days for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. The treatment will be taken orally. Eligibile subjects will be treated for three days and followed up for 28 days.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of treatment failures (early treatment failure + late clinical failure + late parasitological failure)

Enrolled patients will be assessed for parasitological (using microscopy), clinical responses during the 28 days follow-up and treatment outcomes will be classified according to the latest WHO protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At day 28 following initiation of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of adverse event will be documented. Parents or guardians of all enrolled patients will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients will be evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form.  

Possible medicine related adverse effects include dizziness, itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, headache, bodyache, diarrhoea, tinnitus and increased hair loss, macular rash, reduction in neutrophil counts and convulsions. However, it is likely that many of these effects are disease-related rather than medicine-induced.

A patient can be discontinued from the study if the principal investigator decides so due to an adverse event of adequate nature or intensity. In this case, information on the adverse event and symptomatic treatment given must be recorded on a case report form. If the adverse event is serious, the principal investigator must notify the sponsor or its designee immediately and follow the reporting procedure as indicated in the Protocol.

The study patients will be observed for 30 min after medicine administration for adverse reactions or vomiting. Any patient who vomits during this observation period will be re-treated with the same dose of medicine and observed for an additional 30 min. If the patient vomits again, he or she will be withdrawn and offered rescue therapy.

Adverse events requiring treatment can be treated according to local practice. If there is a clinical indication for any additional medication during the course of the study, including medication given to treat an adverse event related to the study medicine, the name of the medicine, the dosage and the date and time of administration must be recorded on the case report form.</outcome>
