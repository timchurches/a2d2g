Computer based task
The Jansari assessment of Executive Functions, JEF (Copyright), is a novel, computer based virtual reality program. 
In the assessment, a participant is invited to navigate around a Virtual Reality(VR) environment on a computer to complete a set of 10 listed tasks and a further 2 tasks that require creative thinking. The scenes are set in a typical office and meeting room. Participants are guided by a research team member with clear instructions given for the assessment. No prior computer knowledge or use is required. The assessment takes on average 40 minutes to complete.
Paper based tasks
Four standardised measures of executive functions have been chosen based on recommendations by the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force (Wefel et al, 2011) and previous studies in this area. They assess the domains of different executive functions that can be evaluated against standardised norms. The tests comprise of the following:

*Hopkins Verbal Learning Test  Revised (HVLT-R): 5-10 minutes with a 25 minute delay
HVLT-R measures verbal memory. Participants are presented with 12 words over 3 immediate learning trials and 1 delayed recall trial followed by a recognition list task.

*Trail Making Test (TMT) A: 1-2 minutes
TMT A measures sustained attention and working memory. It requires a participant to connect numbered circles consecutively.

*Trail Making Test (TMT ) B: 1-3 minutes
TMT B measures an executive function - cognitive flexibility. Participants are asked to connect alternating numbers and letters in sequence.

*Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWA): 3-5 minutes
COWA is a measure of speeded lexical fluency using letters that correspond to specified word frequencies in the English language.

Participants estimation of pre-morbid intelligence levels will be assessed by the following standardised test
National Adult Reading Test (NART)

The following Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaires will be used in this study to review impact of cognitive function on QoL:
1. EORTC QLQ-C30
2. EORTC PR-25
3. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
4. Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI)
5. Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ)
6. Cognitive Failure Questionnaire-for-others (CFQ-O)

Who will deliver the intervention

The number of times the intervention will be delivered and over what period of time
Two time points-baseline and at 9 months.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Analyses

A sample of 45 participants per group (90 in total) is sufficient to find a 30% difference in the proportion of participants that are cognitively impaired between the control and ADT groups assuming 10% of participants in the control group are cognitively impaired, 33% loss to follow up at 9 months, 80% power and 5% significance.

Chi-square analysis will be used at the second time point to determine whether there is a difference in the proportions of cognitively impaired participants between the control and ADT groups.

A Generalised Estimating Equation will be used to provide an odds ratio of the number of participants in the ADT group who are cognitively impaired compared to the nADT group, with a time by group interaction whilst adjusting for fatigue. The criteria for cognitive impairment will be defined using the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force and is as follows:
-	-1.5 S.D. below the mean on 2 cognitive tests
-	-2 S.D. below the mean on 1 cognitive test

For this study, the 8 constructs of JEF(Copyright) will be treated as one set of tests and the 4 paper based tests (HVLT-R, TMT A &amp; B, COWA) will be treated as another set of tests.

Participants individual performance on the cognitive tests will be evaluated by a repeated measures ANOVA.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on cognitive function in men with prostate cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this study if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with prostate cancer for which you have received no ADT previously. You must either be scheduled to begin ADT in the next month, or have no ADT planned.

Study details
All participants in this study will complete a screening questionnaire and then if eligible, an
 assessment session at enrolment and again 9 months later. Each assessment session is expected to last 45-80 minutes and will involve computer-based testing, pen and paper tasks, plus a number of paper questionnaires. 

It is hoped that this study will improve understanding of the cognitive effects of ADT in men with prostate cancer. </summary>
