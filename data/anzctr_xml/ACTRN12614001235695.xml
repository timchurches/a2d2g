  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Problem Management Plus. Arm 2: Enhanced Treatment as Usual. Therapy is administered once-weekly over
5 weeks on an individual 90 minute basis. Problem Management Plus includes skills in identifying emotional and practical problems that can be managed and strategies to reduce and cope with these problems. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 3-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 4.5 months. Therapy is provided by local health workers.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Enhanced Treatment as Usual comprises normal treatment provided by local physicians who will receive a single 2-day refresher training on identification and management of mental disorders.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 3-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 4.5 months.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations suggest a minimum sample size of 133 participants per group (power =.95, alpha = .05, 2-sided). Taking into account an expected 30% attrition at 3 months follow-up, we aim to include a total number of 346 participants (173 in each group, with an approximate equal number of men as women). The thrust of analyses will be using hierarchical linear models (HLM) to investigate the relative effects of the treatments. Analyses will be conducted using Mplus (version 7.11). The benefit of this approach is that it presumes intent-to-treat analyses as HLM allows the number of observations to vary between participants and effectively handles missing data by using the maximum likelihood estimator, which provides the optimal estimates of model parameter values and standard errors. The Level 1 model will represent within-patient change over time, and the Level 2 model will predict variation in within-patient change over time and encompass between-patient variables (treatment condition, injury characteristics, gender). Primary measures will comprise the HADS and WHODAS. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a low intensity intervention to reduce mental health problems in people in low-resources settings.  This study compares the relative efficacy of (a) Problem Management Plus, and (b) Enhanced Treatment as Usual.  It is hypothesised that Problem Management Plus will lead to greater symptom reduction than Enhanced Treatment as Usual.</summary>
