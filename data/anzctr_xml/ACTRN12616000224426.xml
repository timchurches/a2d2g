  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention aims at (1) encouraging anti-smoking attitudes and beliefs, (2) fostering perceptions of normative support for anti-smoking behaviour, (3) increasing perceptions of control/self-efficacy to resist smoking, and (4) enhancing favourability of non-smoker images. Intervention sessions will be facilitated by a PhD student from Queensland University of Technology. For better understanding of local culture and school settings, this facilitator will be a registered school counsellor, with teaching and counselling experience in middle schools. To comply with Queensland regulations, the facilitator will also have a Positive Notice Blue Card (a safety check card that allows access to work with children). The intervention will be undertaken within middle school students during school hours. Approval of the form teacher of each participating class will be obtained before starting the intervention. All intervention-related activities will be conducted following the directions of the Principal or other senior staff regarding access to student participants and the location of testing. Testing will take place in an accessible area designated by the school principal or other administrative staff, in proximity to normal classroom activities. Assistance will be available from school staff when required. The facilitator will follow the required procedures for visitors to the school (e.g., registering with an ID card at the school gate).

The intervention will be a 1 x 40 minute session (equal to 1 class-time session) per week for 4 weeks. Each intervention session will address a different construct. Session one will be designed to encourage anti-smoking attitudes and beliefs. Session two will focus on fostering perceptions of normative support for anti-smoking behaviour. Session three will aim to increase perceptions of control/self-efficacy to resist smoking. Session four will target enhancing favourability of non-smoker images. Activities for the intervention will include class-based discussions, generic skill training (e.g., culturally appropriate refusal skills), and critical thinking over tobacco packaging and smoker images. At the conclusion of each session, participants will evaluate the program.</interventions>

    <concealment>A convenience sample of schools will be recruited using a maximum variation sampling method to ensure participating schools range in social-demographic status and geographical location. Schools will be approached to participate by the study team using an information package delivered during face-to-face discussions, as this type of communication is more culturally appropriate in China. The information package will include background information about the study, a letter to the form teachers, questionnaire items, and the participant intervention content list. Consenting schools will be requested to identify suitable classes that will be accessible to the research team. Consent will be obtained from the Principals and form teachers. Consenting classes will then be randomised to the intervention or a wait-listed control group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Consenting schools will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or a wait-listed control group using a random number generator app on smart phone.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Information collected will be analysed quantitatively using repeated measure MANOVA and multiple regression analyses. Latent growth modelling will be also considered if any variable contains heterogeneity. 
The proposed sample size is 160 participants. Prospective power calculation suggested that about 130 participants (65 per group) were required in order to operate a 3-time repeated measures MANOVA and multiple regression (alpha = .05, beta = .2; Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013). This sample size also ensured the utilization of latent growth curve models across time (Newsom, 2015). As a longitudinal study, we will recruit more in order to allow for attrition over time.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>China is the largest tobacco consumer and producer in the world. Smoking cessation interventions among teenagers will help China to reduce the number of smoking-related illnesses and deaths, many of which are preventable. This research project will pilot a smoking cessation intervention among about 160 Chinese grade 10 students (15-17 years) based on a common decision-making model, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). It is hypothesised that smoking behaviour, intention, and willingness will reduce after a 4-session intervention by targeting smoking-related beliefs and social images of smokers. The research will include three waves of paper-and-pencil self-reported questionnaire surveys: the pretest is to examine the influence of the extended TPB constructs in relation to individuals' intentions to smoke, the posttest (administered 4 weeks after the first pretest) is to assess actual (self-reported) behaviour in the short-term, and a follow-up questionnaire survey will be conducted 6 months after the intervention, so as to assess smoking cognitive and behavioural changes in the long-term. The study will provide valuable information about the effectiveness of the intervention in improving the anti-smoking attitudes, intentions, and behaviours of Chinese adolescents.</summary>
