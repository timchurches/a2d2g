    <interventions>Panel A: MK-8226 0.1 mg/kg single IV dose
Panel B: MK-8226 0.3 mg/kg single IV dose
Panel C: MK-8226 1 mg/kg single IV dose
Panel D: MK-8226 3 mg/kg single IV dose
Panel E: MK-8226 10 mg/kg single IV dose
In each of the panels above, participants will be randomised to receive either the dose level described for the specific panel or placebo.
