  <interventions>
    <interventions>Name: Oral Health Intervention (for one participant group)
Oral health screening for all resident participants. Four measures to be delivered individually to participants in residential aged care by a dentist and a speech pathologist experienced in working with older adults, including adults with dementia. The measures, listed below, will take no longer than 1 hour:
(a) Oral Health Assessment Tool: "We will look at your face and lips and then ask you to open your mouth so we can look at your tongue, gums, oral tissues, teeth or dentures, and saliva to rate how healthy they are and whether you need any immediate and specific oral or dental care. We will shine a small light into your mouth so we can see. We also may place a soft wooden tongue depressor on the front of your tongue to keep it steady and gently hold your cheek to one side in the oral examination. If we hold your tongue and/or cheeks in place, we will do this for a short time, only seconds.
(b) Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA): We will ask you (or your family member, nurse or carer who knows you well) the following questions to determine your risk for being malnourished:
 Has your food intake declined over the past 3 months due to loss of appetite, digestive    problems, chewing or swallowing difficulties? 
 Have you lost weight unintentionally during the last 3 months?
 How easily are you able to get out of bed and move?
 Have you suffered psychological stress or acute distress in the past 3 months?
 Are you experiencing any neuropsychological problems such as depression and/or dementia?
 What is your height and weight so we can calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI)?
(c) Yale Swallow Protocol: We will give you a cup containing 90 mL (3 ounces) of room temperature water and ask you to drink the water through a straw without stopping. If you begin to cough while drinking, we will ask you to stop drinking. This measure helps us determine how well your swallow is coordinated and any risk for material (food, liquid, or saliva) going into your lungs instead of into your stomach.
(d) The Euro-Qol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-3L) Tool: We will ask you (or a family member, nurse, or carer who knows you well) to rate any difficulty you have with mobility (movement), personal care, usual activities (e.g., housework or leisure activities), pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Then we will ask you to draw a line on a scale (rather like a ruler or thermometer) to show us how good, or bad, you feel your health is."
  
All resident participants: Over a 3-month period, all resident participants will undergo 2 minutes of teething cleaning after each meal up to 3 times per day. Ideally the teeth cleaning will be done using a timed electric toothbrush. If residents cannot adjust to the sound or vibration of the electric toothbrush, we will develop 2-minute strategies for using a regular, soft bristled toothbrush, e.g., brushing to series of enjoyed and selected 2-minute recorded songs. If residents wear dentures, these dentures will be cleaned each day and removed for sleep. Residents will be encouraged to participate as actively as possible in cleaning their teeth or dentures, They will be assisted by care staff or family members to ensure this cleaning is done. 
Adherence to the intervention will be assessed through audits of daily oral care by facility managers, including examination of used toothbrush heads/toothbrushes using a published standardized protocol..

Following the daily intervention period, all resident participants will undergo a repeat of the oral health screening measures.</interventions>
    <comparator>No control group.
Residents will serve as their own controls through baseline data from pre-intervention screening being compared to repeat screening after the 3-month intervention period.
We may be able to have two groups of residents: (a) those with evident cognitive impairment or dementia, and (b) those with no evident cognitive impairment or dementia who live in the same residential aged care community.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>This pilot study will assist in developing an appropriate power determination for future clinical trial studies. We will document instances of unexplained fever, chest and lung infections and other clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia, along with the number of unplanned hospital transfers/admissions related to clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia in the six (6) months prior to the 3-month intervention period, during the 3-month intervention period, and following 3-month intervention period. 
Although the literature reports a range in prevalence rates for aspiration pneumonia for adults in residential care, current 12 month prevalence rates for aspiration pneumonia for adults with cognitive impairment or dementia average 61% when systematic oral health care is not in place. Given 120 residents (60 at each centre), we will anticipate that aspiration pneumonia (or clinical signs of this as it is often not diagnosed until hospitalization) affects up to 72 residents without intervention and that our intervention will reduce this number to 24 (a relative 33% reduction). Assuming a .05 significance level and a moderate effect size, we will have power of 85% for the study. This is feasible based on Japanese studies and accounts for any loss of residents due to death or relocation. We have ample power for the resident-related outcome measures. As an example, a 2-tailed paired t test evaluating the change in oral health of 60 residents, with a moderate effect size of .5, and a significance level of .05, yields a power of 97%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre at the University of Tasmania has received federal funding to conduct a study into how changes in oral care may reduce aspiration pneumonia risk for adults living in residential aged care, especially adults who have cognitive impairment or dementia. Masonic Care Tasmania, through the Fred French and Peace Haven Homes, has agreed to participate in this oral health study. 

Aspiration pneumonia is a lung infection for which people are often hospitalised, and people with dementia seem to be particularly vulnerable. Aspiration pneumonia develops when food, liquid and/or saliva containing harmful oral bacteria is misdirected (aspirated) into the airway and then into the lungs and the lungs cannot clear the aspirated material. Studies show that keeping the mouth clean plays a critical role in preventing aspiration pneumonia. Keeping the mouth clean is best done by conducting an oral health screening to see how healthy each persons mouth is, taking care of any immediate oral and/or dental problems, and then ensuring that people residing in aged care clean their teeth for 2 minutes after each meal or clean their dentures each day and remove them for sleep. 

Our aim is to see if oral health screening followed by a 3-month intervention period of 2 minutes of teeth cleaning after meals or daily cleaning of dentures with removal for sleep reduces clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia, especially for people with dementia who live at Masonic Care Tasmania/Launceston.
