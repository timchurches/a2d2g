    <interventions>A randomised controlled trial will be used to investigate the effectiveness of the iMindTime eHealth program. People taking part in the study will be randomly allocated to either an immediate access to the program, or delayed access (7 week delay).

The iMindTime eHealth program consists of six brief sessions, over 3 weeks, designed to make an individual more mindful or increase awareness of moment-to-moment experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, sensations) and simply accepting what is there without wanting it to change in any way. Participants will spend three days on each session before moving onto the next session. Each session will take 5-10 minutes to read and its user friendly and interactive components are designed to keep the user engaged. To consolidate learning, participants will be given activities (10-20 minutes per day) to complete offline to practise the principles of specific mindfulness exercises (i.e., mindfulness of the breath, mindfulness of body sensations, mindfulness of emotions, mindfulness of sounds, mindfulness of thoughts and loving kindness meditation) and asked to provide simple feedback on this practise at the next session. Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., to remind them to log on, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions during the study period to monitor their progress. The iMindTime sessions include text, graphics, audio, quizzes, and downloads. iMindTime can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. 

Participants randomised to the iMindTime eHealth (immediate access) group will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 2) assessment, post-intervention assessment (Week 4) and a 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 8). Participants randomised to the delayed access group will complete the same assessment phases and will be given access to iMindTime eHealth program following the 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 8). However the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they have completed the iMindTime eHealth program (Week 11). Access to iMindTime will be provided for the entire trial period. Adherence will be measured by the number of sessions completed by post assessment as well as questions regarding engagement levels.

    <concealment>Participants will be invited to register for the study on the iMindTime eHealth website where they will be taken to the Plain Language Information Statement and must provide informed consent to proceed. Following account creation, participants are asked to complete the pre-intervention online questionnaires. Once completed the participant is informed as to which condition they have been randomly allocated too (sent an automated email). The iMindTime eHealth program software randomly allocates (and informs) participants using a block design method.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Pre-, post- and follow-up variables will be subjected to repeated measures ANOVA to determine significant changes over time and between groups 
2. Correlational and multiple regression analyses will be used to determine significant correlates of wellbeing and to determine any potential predictors and discriminators of attrition and adherence.
3. Open ended data obtained from intervention satisfaction and exit questionnaires may be analysed using protocols of content analysis to identify common themes.

Assuming a small-medium effect (i.e., GPower f test = 0.40), significance set at 5% (p = .05), power at 80%, a total sample size of 107 (this figure also accounts for an expected attrition rate of 40%) will be required to demonstrate statistical significance. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised controlled trial will be used to investigate the effectiveness of the iMindTime eHealth program. The iMindTime program will be placed within the Federation eHealth Platform. 

People visiting the website, in response to advertisements or through self interest, will be informed of the availability of the iMindTime program and invited to participate in the study. People who consent to  take part in the study will be randomly allocated to either an immediate access to the program, or delayed access (7 week delay).

The iMindTime eHealth program consists of six brief sessions, over 3 weeks, designed to make an individual more mindful or increase awareness of moment-to-moment experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, sensations) and simply accepting what is there without wanting it to change in any way. Participants will spend three days on each session before moving onto the next session.

However the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they have completed the iMindeHealth program (Week 11). 

It is expected that people who undertake iMindTime will show increases in mental wellbeing and optimism and reductions in negative affect at post and follow-up time points</summary>
