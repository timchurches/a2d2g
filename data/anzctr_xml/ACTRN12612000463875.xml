  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>15 point Global Rating of Change Scale: participants are asked to rate if they are better, same or worse, and if better or worse by how much on a 5 point scale (hence 15 points, 7 worse, 1 same and 7 better). This is a commonly used rating of change scale in clinical trials.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 4 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lower Extremity Function Scale: Is a 20 item scale in which the participant rates the degree of difficulty (extreme to no difficulty over 0 to 4 points) on common weight bearing activities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 4 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure: Is similar to the LEFS above (#2) but has 30 items, in two main parts, one dealing with higher order sports activities. It is used in order to cover the possibility of higher activity levels in our cohort. The clinicometric properties are otherwise similar to #2.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 4 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain Numerical Rating Scale: An 11 point scale anchored by no pain at all at 0 and worst pain imaginable at 10 will be used to rate the worst and average level of pain severity the patient experienced in the past 24 hours and past week</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 4 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Specific Function Scale: The participant choses a maximum of five tasks that they no longer can do unimpeded by their heel pain and scores the level of disability for each of these tasks on a 11 point numerical rating scale, where 0 is no interference to function and 10 is maximal interference with the task (i.e. no function, as in wheel chair bound or non-weight bearing on crutches)</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 4 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Foot Posture Index: This is a scale consisting of ratings of the therapist's observation of foot posture commonly used to score foot posture as pronated, neutral or supinated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 4 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mid-foot height barefoot and in flip-flops will be measured non-invasively with digital calipers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 4 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mid-foot width barefoot and in flip-flops: The mid foot measures are taken in weight bearing and non weight bearing with digital calipers, a non-invasive and non-painful procedure taking under 3 minutes (both feet weight bearing and non weight bearing)</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 4 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are a number of studies that show that wearing an orthosis within a shoe helps resolution of heel pain. These orthoses often are prescribed to control excessive pronation, which is thought to be a mechanical factor contributing to overload and eventual pain of the tissues in the plantar heel region (also known as the planta fascia). Recently flip-flops have been designed with features similar to that of the orthoses, but without the need to be fitted within a shoe. A potential benefit of a flip-flop is that the high pain levels felt on first step in in the morning might be prevented if a flip-flop in the shape of an orthosis is worn. Wearing the flip-flop continually then might help relieve tissue stress of the plantar fascia and aid resolution of the problem. Interestingly, the material that flip-flops are made of might also be responsible for any pain relieving effect, hence the inclusion of a flat flip-flop as a comparator in this study. The aim of this study is to test if there are any differences between an in-shoe foot orthosis, a shaped flip-flop and a flat flip-flop over 12 weeks wear.</summary>
