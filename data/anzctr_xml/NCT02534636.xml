  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to establish if BMS-986165 is safe and effective at treating
      autoimmune diseases. BMS-986165 which has shown some promise in preclinical studies for
      inhibiting autoimmune conditions. This study will be the first time this drug is given to
      humans, and will be conducted entirely in healthy subjects. It will be run in 4 Parts. Part A
      will investigate single oral doses of drug. Part B will investigate giving the drug daily for
      14 days. Part C will investigate daily doses for 14 days in healthy volunteers with Japanese
      decent. Part D will investigate whether food, stomach acidity or giving the drug in a capsule
      makes a difference to the safety and potential use of this drug.</summary>
