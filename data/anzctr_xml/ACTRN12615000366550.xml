    <interventions>The aim of this clinical research will be to assess the effect of laser irradiation at different wavelengths (940, 808, and 658 nm) on the healing mechanisms in human pressure ulcers.

Intervention:
Patients with pressure ulcers from groups A, B and C will receive laser therapy once daily, 5 times per week for 1 month. The equipment will be a gallium-aluminum-arsenide (GaAlAs) diode laser with an output power of 50 mW and continuous radiation emission at separate wavelengths of 940 nm (group A), 808 nm (group B) and 658 nm (group C). The spot size will be 0.1 cm2. The laser will be wired to a cone-shaped applicator (scanner). The duration of a single procedure will be relative to the wound size; the therapy will be adjusted to obtain an average dose of 4 J/cm2 (direct dose measured on a surface of the wound). In group D, the placebo group, a laser will be applied in the same manner, but the device will be turned off during the treatment sessions (only the applicator will be turned on to scan ulcers using non-coherent red visible light).

    <concealment>Participants will be randomly allocated to the groups. Computer-generated random numbers will be sealed in sequentially numbered envelopes, and the group allocation be independent of the time and person delivering the treatment. The physician (research coordinator) who will allocate the subjects to groups have envelopes, each containing a piece of paper marked with either group A, B, C or D. The physician will select and open an envelope in the presence of a physiotherapist to see the symbol and then direct the patient to the corresponding group.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis and evaluation of the results will be based on the comparison of intra- and intergroup results. Statistical analysis of these results will be performed by means of the Statistica 10 software, manufactured by StatSoft (licence of Academy School of Physical Education). All analysed intergroup variables will be checked with respect to their similarity (uniformity; chi2 NW). A critical significance level a (alpha) = 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant. For measurable variables (quantitative), arithmetic mean, standard deviations, medians and range of variability (extreme values) will be calculated. For qualitative variables, the frequency of occurrence (percentage) will be calculated. Comparison of intergroup results in order to determine the significance of the achieved differences, will be performed by means of parametric (ANOVA, Student's t-test, Welch's t test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney`s and Fischer tests, depending on meeting criteria for the specific test. Correlation of variables in the examined groups will also be checked.

To achieve study objectives the absolute minimal number of participants should be 15 in each group (for non-parametric tests). Smaller number of patients will not be enough from both statistical and clinical point of view (the smaller number of patients is not enough for reliable statistical analysis because of too large standard deviations due to characteristics of patients). However, the most reliable number od patients should be 30 in each comparative group (we will be able to use parametric tests). The reliable number of participants was estimated by Statistica 10 software, manufactured by StatSoft.

In calculating our sample size we have allowed for:
1. 30% loss of participants (exclusion criteria)
2. Historical information from our unit that 45% of patients who are offered conservative (standard physical therapy) management for this condition opt for laser therapy within 6 months.

This investigation has 95% power to detect a difference between group mean (SD) in the primary and secondary outcomes of 10 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Laser therapy has been used to accelerate wound healing for over forty years, but its results are still controversial. The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP), National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) and Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance published an international guideline, Prevention and Treatment of Pressure Ulcers: Clinical Practice Guideline, in 2014. According to the guideline (content titled Biophysical agents in pressure ulcer treatment), several forms of energy have been studied for healing pressure ulcers. These include acoustic, mechanical, and kinetic energy, as well as energy from the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). Infrared (thermal) radiation and ultraviolet light (invisible light) are all part of the EMS, as is electrical/electromagnetic stimulation. The recommendation for biophysical agents is supported by direct scientific evidence from properly designed and implemented clinical studies on pressure ulcers in humans, providing statistical results that consistently support the recommendation. One of the proposed physical methods in this document is laser irradiation, but the guideline stated that due to current insufficiency of evidence to suport or refute the use of laser therapy in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Laser therapy is not recommended for routine use at this time. The strength of evidence is only classified for C grade (supported by indirect evidence and/or expert opinion).
The results of our clinical study (Taradaj et al. Effect of Laser Irradiation at Different Wavelengths 940, 808, and 658 nm on Pressure Ulcer Healing: Results from a Clinical Study Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013; 960240: 1-8) showed that the wavelength of the laser beam is extremely important during the wound-healing process (and perhaps this is one reason for the many controversies). In this trial, we found no evidence that justifies using laser therapy at wavelengths of 940 and 808 nm as an adjuvant to the future consensus pressure ulcer treatment. However, in our opinion the wavelength of 658 nm is interesting, and its use yielded in promising clinical results. We cannot agree with a general statement that laser therapy does not accelerate the healing process because the correct parameter settings (wavelength, dose, and method of application) must still be demonstrated in the literature. Future in vitro, animal and clinical studies are necessary, because in literature it is still unknown which processes occur at the cell or tissue level after laser irradiation. The aim of the following study will be collecting the biological material from the wound by biopsy and analysis of angiogenesis, cytometric meausrement of microvasculature density, cell apoptosis, fibroblast activity and collagen concentration, bacteriological and immunology examination.</summary>
