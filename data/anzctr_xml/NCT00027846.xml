Treatment: surgery - therapeutic conventional surgery

No Intervention: GTR1 Differentiated Histology Supratentorial (Group 1) - Patients undergo observation.

Experimental: Radiation (Group 2) - Supratentorial Anaplastic Ependymoma (GTR1, GTR2, NTR) and Anaplastic or Differentiated Infratentorial Ependymoma (GTR1, GTR2, NTR) and Supratentorial Differentiated Ependymoma(GTR2, NTR). Patients undergo conformal radiation therapy to the brain once daily 5 days a week for 6-6½ weeks.

Experimental: Sub-Total Resection Any Histology or Location (STR) (Group 3) - Patients receive an initial course of chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV beginning on day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients then receive a second course of chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and oral etoposide on days 1-21. After completion of chemotherapy, patients are evaluated for second therapeutic conventional surgery. Patients who have unresectable disease undergo conformal radiation therapy. Patients who have resectable disease undergo second surgery followed by conformal radiotherapy.


Other interventions: filgrastim
Given IV or SC (5mcg/kg/day) start on Day 3 and continue until ANC &gt;1500/µl given subcutaneously or intravenously.

Treatment: drugs: carboplatin
Given IV (375 mg/m2/day) Day 1 given as an IV infusion over one hour. For patients with BSA &lt;0.45m2 the dose is 12.5 mg/kg/day.

Treatment: drugs: cyclophosphamide
Given IV (1000mg/m2/day) Day 1 and 2 given as an IV infusion over one hour following carboplatin administration. For patients with BSA&lt;0.45m2 the dose is 33mg/kg/day on Day 1 and 2.

Treatment: drugs: etoposide
Given orally (50 mg/m2/day) orally once daily on Days 1 through 21. For patients with BSA &lt; 0.45 m2, the dosage is 1.7 mg/kg/day on Days 1 through 21.

Treatment: drugs: vincristine sulfate
Given IV or orally (1.5mg/m2/day) (maximum dose 2 mg) Day 1 and 8 given as IV bolus. For patients with BSA&lt;0.45m2 the dose is 0.05mg/kg.

Treatment: other: radiation therapy
Given once daily 5 days a week for 6-6½ weeks

Treatment: drugs: Mesna
Mesna (200mg/m2/dose) Day 1 and 2. For patients with BSA&lt;0.45m2 the dose is (7mg/kg/dose). Combine mesna (200mg/m2) with cyclophosphamide and administer intravenously over one hour followed by mesna (200mg/m2) in 375 cc/m2 D5-1/2NS and run intravenously over 3 hours at 125cc/m2/hr. After 3 hour mesna, administer mesna (200 mg/m2/dose) IV over 15 minutes at hour 5.

Treatment: surgery: therapeutic conventional surgery

      <outcome>Event-free Survival (EFS) - EFS between centrally reviewed differentiated ependymoma and anaplastic ependymoma for the patients who had sub-total resection initially.

      <outcome>Event-free Survival (EFS) - EFS between centrally reviewed differentiated ependymoma and anaplastic ependymoma for the patients who were treated with radiation therapy only. The event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time to disease progression, disease relapse, occurrence of a second neoplasm, or death from any cause, measured from the start of radiation therapy. The product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimate is for estimation of EFS probability at 5 years.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during
      surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of specialized radiation therapy
      either alone or after chemotherapy and second surgery in treating children who have undergone
      surgery for localized ependymoma.</summary>
