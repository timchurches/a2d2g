  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises: A cycle of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO) with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance (CMR therapy). The CMR is a biomedical radiofrequency instrument. The protocol used, called Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (ONPF), involves the application of a probe of the CMR on specific points of the auricular pavilion for an activation time of roughly 500 mms. The ONPF protocol is activated in a precise sequence on seven auricular points. The protocol envisages 18 sessions of ONPF treatment on alternating days, for eight (8)weeks.  Assessment, at baseline and at the end of treatment, with Psychological Stress Measure Test (validated in Italian).</interventions>
    <comparator>The reduction of the subjective perception of stress and stress-related hyperactivity and accelleration, after an NPPO cycle with CMR device, shows significant results (P&lt;.05), respect to a control group that was treated with placebo (inactivated CMR)for 8 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hyperactivity and accelleration are frequent signs of psychological distress. In this study we have used the Psychological Stress Measure (validated in Italian) to test the effectiveness of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO) with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance - CMR Therapy in reducing the subjective perception of stress and stress-related hyperactivity and accelleration. The reduction of the symptomatology of stress and stress-related hyperactivity and accelleration after a NPPO cycle with CMR therapy shows significant results (P&lt;.05) with respect to a control group that was treated with placebo (inactivated CMR).</summary>
