  <interventions>
    <interventions>A comprehensive three-part program of: 1)screening for depression in primary care patients requiring ongoing management of chronic manifestations of ischaemic heart disease; 2) academic detailing of best-practice guidelines for managing depression; and 3) patient-specific psychiatric advice to the treating GP with follow-up screening and advice, relative to usual GP management.
Duration of study: 12 months.
Depression will be determined via the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Arroll (2 question) scale.
All study patients will be screened at baseline and 12 months.  Patients in the intervention group, and depressed, will be rescreened at 3, 6 and 9 months as required.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A major, and related outcome, is the proportion of patients with mild versus moderate to severe depression and the proportion of initially non depressed patients who display depressive symptoms</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Prevalence, severity and natural history of depression in a patient cohort being treated for chronic manifestations of ischaemic heart disease in primary care. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Examined at baseline, 3,6,9 and 12 months and data will be collated and assessed at the completion of 12 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) Effects of a pragmatic GP focussed screening and intervention program on the severity of depression, and effects on the overall management of chronic manifestations of ischaemic heart disease, risk factor profile, angina pectoris (AP) and heart failure (HF) specific clinical health outcomes, patient wellbeing and quality of life, treatment adherence patterns, and morbidity and mortality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 12 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3) Health related quality of life will be reassessed via the SF-12 and EQ-5D, the latter measure providing utility scores and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for a cost utility analysis.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart disease is Australia's biggest health problem, affecting nearly 3.7 million people every year. Recent research has shown that emotional problems such as depression can make heart problems worse.  However, it is often difficult to diagnose depression in people with heart problems. This research aims to improve the general health and wellbeing of people with chronic heart problems and depression by determining whether a special general practitioner enhanced education program, comprising the monitoring of depression, academic detailing of best-practice guidelines and psychiatric advice to the treating GP, will reduce depression in people with chronic heart probalems.</summary>
