                  low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and
                  correctly.

             hypophysitis, nephritis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, but not limited to these

             arrhythmia or ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment or intervention;

          6. History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is
             clinically meaningful:

              For example, a screening QTcF interval that is prolonged (&gt;450 msec in males; &gt;470
             msec in females).

          7. Active infection or an unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C during screening visits or on the
             first scheduled day of dosing (at the discretion of the investigator, subjects with
             tumor fever may be enrolled);

          8. History of immunodeficiency including seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), or other acquired or congenital immune-deficient disease, or any active
             systemic viral infection requiring therapy (e.g., hepatitis B or C);

          9. Any other medical (e.g., pulmonary, metabolic, congenital, endocrinal or CNS disease,
             etc.), psychiatric, or social condition deemed by the investigator to be likely to
             interfere with a subject's rights, safety, welfare or ability to sign informed
             consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation
             of the results.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In many types of human tumors, PD-L1 is highly expressed. Such high expression has often been
      associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. SHR-1316 is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal
      antibody that binds specifically to human PD-L1.</summary>
