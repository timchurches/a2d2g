  <interventions>
    <interventions>We interviewed patients bi-weekly using a standardized protocol across centres, recording duration, dosage, compliance, outcome and side-effects. Severity of depressive symptoms at baseline and the time of the interview were assessed using the HAMD-17 by a trained senior psychiatrist, blind to patients genotype thereafter for 8 weeks. Dose increases of the same antidepressant drugs were allowed if the patient had not achieved Clinical Global Impression (CGI) change scores indicating much improved or very much improved. Concomitant psychotropic medications were not permitted, except for a low dose of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic for the alleviation of insomnia. Drug side effects were assessed with the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS,) every two weeks and drug compliance was also monitored routinely by nursing interview. Remission was defined as an equal to or less than 7 scores in the HAMD-17 total score after 8 weeks treatment . Patients requiring a change in antidepressant drug or demonstrating non-adherence were excluded from the study.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We used the UNPHASED 3.3.13 to analyses single SNP and haplotype associations. we found that CaMK pathway genes were significant associated with remission depression patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 8 weeks  treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs antidperessants.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gene-environment interactions were analyzed by binary logistic regression with SPSS 11.0 software. There were no significant differences in CTQ scores and LES scores between remitters and non-remitters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 8 weeks  treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs antidperessants.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All recruited patients were between 18-60 years old and met criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV) . All subjects were new or recently relapsed patients, drug-free for over two weeks and had a baseline score of 18 or over on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) , having presented depressive symptoms for at least 2 weeks before entry.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria included documented history of diagnoses on Axis 1 (including substance abuse, schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders or obsessive compulsive disorders) of the DSM-IV, personality disorders, mental retardation, pregnancy, lactation, primary organic disease and other medical illnesses impairing psychiatric evaluation, or a history of electroconvulsive therapy within the previous 8 months. Newly-diagnosed patients were also excluded if they had manic episode in the 12 months following entry.</exclusivecriteria>
