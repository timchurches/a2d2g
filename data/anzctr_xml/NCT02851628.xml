    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Alternative sizing model based trial mask
Treatment: devices - Prototype Full Face Mask

Experimental: Alternative sizing model trial mask - In this arm participants who are randomized to the alternative sizing model based mask will be given the alternative sizing model based mask to use in home for the duration of this arm.

Active Comparator: Prototype Full Face Mask (PFFM) - In this arm, participants who are randomized to the PFFM will be given the PFFM to use in-home for the duration of this arm.


Treatment: devices: Alternative sizing model based trial mask
A trial full face mask to be used for this trial for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea using CPAP therapy.

Treatment: devices: Prototype Full Face Mask
A prototype full face mask with previous clinical trial experience used for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea using CPAP therapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigation is a prospective non-blinded and semi-randomized clinical investigation.
      The investigation is designed to assess the alternative sizing model which the trial mask
      concept is based on and how it compares to a conventional sizing present in the Prototype
      Full Face Mask (PFFM) mask.</summary>
