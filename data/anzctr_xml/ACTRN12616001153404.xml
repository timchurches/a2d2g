  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be subjected to both active continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (their usual settings) and sham CPAP while undergoing polysomnography on two separate nights in a randomised  order.  Each night will be separated by at least one week, but no more than 6 weeks between visits. Participants will use their own clinically fitted mask (i.e. nasal mask, full face mask etc).  Each sleep study will be for a duration of  ~8h.  The sleep study will be conducted at The Centre for Sleep Science at The University of Western Australia.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be 'sham CPAP' which provides non effective pressure during sleep.  The sham CPAP has a flow-restricting segment in a connector proximal to the mask. It also has extra air holes in the connector which are not visible. These increase the exhalation flow as they are distal to the flow restricting segment and allow adequate escape of carbon dioxide from the patient while producing sub-therapeutic CPAP pressure..</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nocturnal beat to beat blood pressure measured by a Finapress device throughout the night.
 (Finometer Pro).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured continuously throughout each (active CPAP and sham CPAP) night.  The Finometer will start measuring just prior to "lights out" and will continue measuring until after the three standard morning blood pressures (measured via dinamap) after "lights on" in the morning.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Conduit artery function: Brachial and femoral artery flow mediated dilation (FMD) will be assessed according to best practice guidelines. A cuff is inflated (220mmHg) around the forearm and upper thigh for 5min to induce ischaemic conditions whilst high resolution ultrasound of the brachial and femoral artery are obtained pre-post- artery occlusion. The FMD% increase in artery dilation is an indicator of artery function and independently predicts CV events. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Flow mediated dilation will be performed prior to and after sleep in both conditions.  This will be conducted approximately 30min after arrival into the sleep centre (~3h prior to sleep) and 30 min after wake in the morning.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intracranial cerebral blood velocity: Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) is assessed by combining bilateral measures of middle (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) flow velocities using non-invasive transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound. Blood flow to the brain will also be simultaneously collected using non-invasive duplex ultrasound of the internal carotid artery and vertebral artery (VA).  Cerebral vascular reactivity to carbon dioxide is assessed using breathing mixtures. Participants are asked to breathe the gas mixtures through a non-re-breathing three-way breathing apparatus (i.e., mouthpiece, disposable spirometry filter, spirometer, hans rudolph three way valve) connected to each douglas bag through a sterilised respiratory bore tubing. </outcome>
      <timepoint>CBFv will be performed prior to and after sleep in both conditions.  This will be conducted approximately 1h after arrival into the sleep centre (~2h prior to sleep) and 1h after wake in the morning.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Urinary catecholamines</outcome>
      <timepoint>Urine will be collected in both conditions (active and sham CPAP) over ~12 hours from when participants first arrive at The Centre for Sleep Science (after first voiding their bladder) until their first void the following morning.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is powered on the primary outcome of overnight blood pressure difference between the active and sham CPAP (as determined by Finapress, beat to beat blood pressure).
The standardised difference (i.e., SD of the difference between mean night time blood pressure, based on the Davies et al. study - i.e. between OSA and normal subjects) is 11 mm Hg,
Assume power (1- beta) = 80% and alpha = 0.05.
We consider the minimum clinically significant difference in overnight blood pressure between active CPAP and sham CPAP is 9mm Hg overnight (i.e. equivalent to 3 mmHg over 24 hours).  Based on these assumptions for a cross over design we need 16 completed subjects.

Statistical analysis will be performed with the use of statistical software package (IBM 'Registered Trademark' SPSS 'Registered Trademark' Statistics 21). Paired t -tests will be used for the comparison of the mean blood pressure changes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In order to better assess the role of CPAP in mitigating cardiovascular risk factors of participants with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), this study aims to assess the effect of a night of active and a night of sham CPAP on beat to beat blood pressure and vascular function.  To measure vascular function, non-invasive and benign ultrasound based techniques will be used to assess peripheral artery vascular function in the brachial artery, along with intracranial arterial function utilising transcranial Doppler assessments. Finally, we will measure urinary catecholamines from urine collections pre and post sleep.  Blood pressure will be monitored continuously throughout the night using a finapress device while participants are simultaneously having their sleep monitored by polysomnography.  The results of this study have the ability to further understand the physiological effects of missing one night of CPAP treatment in patients with OSA.</summary>
