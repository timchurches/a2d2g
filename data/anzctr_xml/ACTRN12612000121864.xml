  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Controlled open label randomized monocenter clinical study designed to evaluate, in patients suffering from moderate dry eye syndrome, subjective and objective safety and efficacy parameters during and after three months of treatment (4 drops per day) with arabinogalactan 5% w/v solution or hyaluronic acid 0.2% w/v solution . Hyaluronic acid is a widely used tear substitute prescribed for the same indication. Arabinogalactan is a new class 1 medical device according to the European rules. This study is the first clinical trial using arabinogalactan ophthalmic formulation 5% as test product.</summary>
