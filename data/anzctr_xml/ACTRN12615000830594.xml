  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations of angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines correlate with the change in mean best-corrected visual acuity from baseline to 12 months.

      <timepoint>12 months after first ranibizumab injection or the baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations correlate with the change in mean best-corrected visual acuity from baseline to 6 months. Best-corrected visual acuity will be assessed on a LogMAR chart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after first ranibizumab injection or the baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations correlate with the number of ranibizumab injections administered by 6 months</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after first ranibizumab injection or the baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations correlate with the change in mean central macular thickness, as measured by Heidelberg Optical Coherence Tomography, from baseline to 6 months. </outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after the first ranibizumab injection or the baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations correlate with the number of ranibizumab injections given by 12 months </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after the first ranibizumab injection or the baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations correlate with the likelihood of recurrent diabetic macular oedema after cessation of ranibizumab.  Central macular thickness or macular oedema will be measured by Heidelberg Optical Coherence Tomography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after first ranibizumab injection or baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations correlate with the length of time from baseline to vision stabilization, leading to cessation of ranibizumab.  Whereby vision stabilization is defined as:
-No further BCVA improvement from treatment at the last 2 consecutive follow up visits OR
-BCVA letter score &gt;84 (6/6) at the last 2 consecutive follow up visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after first ranibizumab injection or baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations correlate with the mean change in macular thickness from baseline to 12 months. Central macular thickness or macular oedema will be measured by Heidelberg Optical Coherence Tomography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after the first ranibizumab injection or baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations correlate with the need for rescue therapy.  Participants who fail to demonstrate at least a 10% improvement in central macular thickness from baseline despite at least six, monthly injections or where BCVA worsens and in the investigators opinion, vision loss is secondary to DME, will be considered for rescue treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after the first ranibizumab injection or baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if the change in aqueous and plasma cytokine concentrations from baseline to month 2 correlates with change in central macular thickness from baseline to 12 months. Central macular thickness or macular oedema will be measured by Heidelberg Optical Coherence Tomography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after the first ranibizumab injection or baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesize that the underlying pathogenesis of Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO) may be related to a combination of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines.  Although anti-VEGF agents are commonly used for the treatment of DMO, either as a primary measure or more usually in refractory cases, the response to treatment is unpredictable.
We propose that measurement of known diabetes association cytokines may allow accurate prediction of response to anti-VEGF treatment and allow a more individualised treatment strategy for patients.
