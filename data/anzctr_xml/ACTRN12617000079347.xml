ARM 2 - 2018
Pharyngeal swab collected 12 month prior to and preceding dose one of two doses of 0.5ml of the licensed 4CMenB vaccine administered by intramuscular injection, with an interval of 1 to 2 months between doses in 2018. 

The duration of followup will be 12 months for each participant.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>Randomisation occurs at the school level.. Randomisation will occur in two stages; stage 1 randomisation of schools that agree to participate and are schools associated with large councils (to facilitate program delivery), stage 2 randomisation of remaining schools once consent forms have been returned. Students at schools randomised to receive the vaccine at baseline will receive the 4CMenB vaccine in 2017. Students at schools randomised to receive the vaccine at the 12 month posterior pharyngeal swab will receive the 4CMenB vaccine in 2018. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint of all serogroup carriage is dichotomous and classified as either carriage, or no pharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis based on PCR positive results. Carriage rates following the 12 month pharyngeal swab will be compared between the unvaccinated and vaccinated participants. The difference between two proportions will be assessed using a logistic generalised estimating equation accounting for correlations within clusters and adjusting for baseline carriage rates. 
Secondary endpoints investigating carriage are also dichotomous outcomes of all N. meningitidis serogroups and will be evaluated by the presence of specific meningococcal DNA by PCR. Analysis will consider the endpoint, changes in carriage at 12 months from baseline in the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. Generalised estimating equations (GEEs) will be used to account for clustering at the school level and repeated measures within individuals. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To estimate effect on carriage of Neisseria meningitidis, approximately 45,000 year 10,11 and 12 students will be offered 4CMenB vaccination in South Australia through the existing schools vaccination program.  Posterior pharyngeal swabs will be obtained on all participants at baseline and at 12 months post vaccination to compare the difference in nasopharyngeal carriage of all N meningitides serogroups and serogroup B in years 10 and 11 students in vaccinated and unvaccinated participants,</summary>
