  <interventions>
    <interventions>Regional citrate anticoagulation of a continuous renal replacement therapy circuit. Fluids containing citrate are infused into extracorporeal venous blood pre-blood pump to achieve a final concentration of approximately 3mmol/L (this is the anticoagulant dose). This causes hypocalcaemia and anticoagulation. The patient is prevented from becoming hypocalcaemic by the use of a systemic calcium infusion (hence the anticoagulation is only in one region of the circuit). The citrate is infused continuously during treatment with renal replacement therapy and lasts for the duration of the renal replacement therapy.</interventions>
    <comparator>Regional heparin anticoagulation of a continuous renal replacement therapy circuit using protamine reversal. Heparin is infused into extracorporeal venous blood pre-blood pump at a rate of 1500 units/hour. The patient is prevented from becoming systemically anticoagulated by the infusion of protamine 15 mg/h intot the return limb of the circuit (hence the anticoagulation is only in one region of the circuit). The heparin and protamine is infused continuously during treatment with renal replacement therapy and lasts for the duration of the renal replacement therapy.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>functional filter life. The functional life of
the filter will be determined to be over when the circuit has clotted defined by the presence of one of the following: a) the transmembrane pressure across the filter is greater than 300 mmHg, b) there is visible clot in the circuit obstructing blood flow, c) the blood pump is unable to rotate due to obstruction by clot in the membrane or circuit. The end of the functional filter life will be determined by intensive care nursing staff not associated with the running of the trial.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis that this trial will test is that the citrate/calcium approach for
regional anticoagulation is more effective than the heparin/protamine method at maintaining functional filter life in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). CRRT is the form of dialysis that is used in the intensive care unit for critically ill patients. Blood is removed from the patients body and circulated through a membrane before being returned. This circuit outside the body causes the blood to start clotting unless a drug is used to prevent this happening. We will compare two different methods of preventing this clotting to see which one can prevent the blood clotting for the longer time. Prevention of blood clotting in the circuit is desirable because of the interruptions in treatment that this causes.</summary>
