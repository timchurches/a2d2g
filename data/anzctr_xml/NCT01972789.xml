  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ranibizumab

Experimental: Intensive retinal fluid regimen - Ranibizumab 0.5mg is given monthly for the first 3 months followed by an individualised treatment regimen as determined by disease activity defined by a loss of =5 letters, new retinal haemorrhage, presence of any IRF or SRF on OCT.

Experimental: Relaxed retinal fluid regimen - Ranibizumab 0.5mg is given monthly for the first 3 months followed by an individualised treatment regimen as determined by disease activity defined by a loss of =5 letters, new retinal haemorrhage, presence of IRF or SRF &gt;200 um on OCT.


Treatment: drugs: Ranibizumab
Ranibizumab solution for injection is commercially supplied in vials with each vial containing ranibizumab in the concentration of 10 mg/ml (0.5 mg/0.05 ml, corresponding to a 0.5 mg dose level). It will be prescribed and administered by the investigator or designee.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To evaluate and compare two individualised ranibizumab treatment regimens, differentiated by
      the definition of disease activity which determines the treatment interval until the next
      injection. The results will be used to generate further recommendations about intensive
      versus relaxed treatment approaches and how they can be utilised within an 'inject and
      extend' approach to maximise patient outcomes, while reducing the need for potentially
      unnecessary intravitreal injections. This study will also investigate genotypic expression
      and response to intravitreal injections of ranibizumab between the two treatment arms.

      The study hypothesis is that intravitreal ranibizumab when administered to resolve IRF only
      results in visual acuity benefit that is not clinically worse than intravitreal ranibizumab
      when administered to completely resolve both IRF and SRF in patients with wet AMD.</summary>
