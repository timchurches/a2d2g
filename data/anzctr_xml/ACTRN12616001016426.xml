  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a prospective observational diagnostic accuracy study to compare the test characteristics of the index test (ApneaLink) to the gold standard polysomnography (PSG)  for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with AF.  Additionally, the epidemiology of OSA in this patient group will be examined.
ApneaLink, is a portable, limited channel sleep study device, which will be worn at home by the patient for one night.  This device includes overnight oximetry (worn on the finger), nasal airflow signal detected via a nasal cannula as well as respiratory effort signal detected via a band worn around the chest.  It generates an Apnoea Hypopnoea index (AHI) using total recording time as the denominator.
ApneaLink and in-laboratory sleep study (PSG) will be performed within one week of one another.  All patients will undergo both of these diagnostic tests, though the order will be randomised.  Interpreting physicians of each study will be blinded to the results of the other.  
The Index test (ApneaLink) will be compared to in-laboratory sleep study as the gold standard, and the validity examined.  
The epidemiology of OSA in the AF population examined as per the secondary aims.

</interventions>
    <comparator>In-hospital polysomnography (PSG) is the gold-standard test for obstructive sleep apnoea.  This is a multi-channel test requiring the patient to stay overnight in hospital.  Various leads are attached to the patient including EEG (electroencephalogram) leads, EMG (electro-myelogram) leads on the chin muscles, a thermistor and nasal cannula for airflow and abdominal and thoracic bands to assess respiratory effort, as well as limb leads.  Patients will undergo this test overnight in a dedicated hospital sleep laboratory.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the validityof a portable device as a screening tool for OSA in AF patients.  This includes sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), positive and negative predictive values, as compared with the gold standard of PSG.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Utility of phenotypic characteristics for the prediction of OSA in an AF cohort.  These include:  body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, craniofacial photogrammetry, co-morbidities including hypertension and diabetes, respiratory illness, sleep questionnaires (viz. Epworth Sleepiness Score, Berlin Questionnaire), AF characteristics (ie. paroxysmal vs chronic, and treatments received), echocardiographic parameters, plasma biomarkers (CRP, BNP, others),  This outcome will be assessed by correlation of these characteristics obtained by patient interview, clinical assessment, photography, blood tests and medical records with PSG findings.</outcome>

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>We used a conservatively estimated prevalence of 50%, based on a previous reported prevalence of 65% for OSA in an Australian AF population.  Sensitivity and specificity for the ApneaLink device for the detection of moderate or severe OSA (AHI &gt; 15) have been documented at 0.947 and 1.0 respectively in a different population.

Sample size estimates for the derivation study were obtained by the method of evaluating confidence intervals for likelihood ratios. We hypothesise that ApneaLink will be clinically useful as a screening tool if the upper limit of the confidence interval for the negative likelihood ratio is no greater than 0.4.  Therefore we would require at least 17 patients with OSA and 17 patients without OSA to complete the final analysis, in each of the PVI and ED referral groups, totalling 68 patients.  To offset an expected withdrawal rate of 10% we will aim to recruit a total of 74 patients for the derivation phase. 

To allow prospective validation of the performance of ApneaLink as a predictor of OSA, we will recruit a total of 99 patients to allow a one third split of the sample (25 patients) to be used to validate the model. The validity of the prediction model for predicting treatment outcome will be assessed by measuring its test characteristics (eg sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios etc. in this new sample).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> Mounting evidence highlights the importance of screening for obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with atrial fibrillation.  Treating obstructive sleep apnoea in these patients may improve outcomes, such as improving the risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation after Pulmonary Vein Isolation procedures.  We will examine the validity of a portable sleep study device (ApneaLink) for the diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea in patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
