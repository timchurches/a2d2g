    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation was concealed using a computer generated computer generated, block randomization list. The investigators were blinded to the allocation process. Randomization was performed by the ward clerk, who referred to the computer generated, block randomization list in order to ensure even group sizes. A clearly visible laminated insert was attached to each patientâ€™s file informing staff of their inclusion in the study and the allocated discharge communication method.</concealment>
    <sequence>During the study period, patients were randomly assigned on admission to one of four methods; email, fax, post or hand delivered by patient. Randomization was performed by the ward clerk, who referred to a computer generated, block randomization list in order to ensure even group sizes. The investigators were blinded to the allocation process.</sequence>
