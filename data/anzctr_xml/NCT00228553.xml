  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and Tolerability in This Patient Population (Narcolepsy, OSAHS, SWSD) Over Time (up to 2 Years) - An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study. Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events (SAEs). Serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, inpatient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability, congenital anomaly, or an important medical event. An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed previously will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 and every 3 months for up to an additional year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients are included in the study if all of the following criteria are met:

          -  Men and women (outpatients) of any ethnic origin, between 18 and 65 years of age
             (inclusive) at the beginning of the respective double-blind study, are eligible.

          -  The patient has completed a cephalon-sponsored double-blind study (study
             C10953/3020/NA/MN, C10953/3021/AP/MN, C10953/3022/CM/MN, or C10953/3025/AP/MN), and
             the investigator has recommended they be enrolled.

          -  Patients with OSAHS must continue to be regular users of nCPAP therapy, which the
             investigator considers to remain effective. Patients with chronic SWSD must work 5
             nights/month, with night shifts including at least 6 hours between 2200 and 0800 that
             are no longer than 12 hours in duration.

          -  The patient is considered to be in good health.

          -  Women must be surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or if of childbearing
             potential, must use a medically accepted method of birth control (ie, barrier method
             with spermicide, steroidal contraceptive [oral, implanted, and Depo-Provera
             contraceptives must be used in conjunction with a barrier method], or intrauterine
             device [IUD]).

          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to attend
             regularly scheduled clinic visits as specified in this protocol.</inclusivecriteria>

        criteria are met:

          -  Have any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical conditions (treated or
             untreated).

          -  Have a probable diagnosis of a current sleep disorder other than the primary diagnosis
             of narcolepsy, OSAHS, or chronic SWSD.

          -  Consume caffeine including coffee, tea and/or other caffeine-containing beverages or
             food averaging more than 600 mg of caffeine.

             (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association 1994).

          -  Have a positive urine drug screen (UDS) (subjects enrolling in this open-label study
             within 7 days after completing the double-blind study may be enrolled without UDS
             results).

          -  Have a clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating. Any woman becoming pregnant during the study will be
             withdrawn from the study.

          -  Have any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism,
             or excretion (including gastrointestinal surgery).

          -  Have a known clinically significant drug sensitivity to stimulants.</exclusivecriteria>
