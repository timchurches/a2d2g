  <interventions>
    <interventions>Humidified high flow nasal cannulae are used in many clinical settings including the home and acute care hospital settings such as high dependency units and intensive care units. These cannulae are used to deliver a range of flows up to 60L/min of heated and humidified gases to support patients with compromised respiratory function. It is thought that airborne droplets in the exhaled gases may lead to the spread of respiratory viruses. 
Defining the potential dispersal of viruses via aerosol is essential for the development of prevention measures therefore to determine if the cannula generates more exhaled droplets than compared to natural breathing is vital

High speed photography shall be used to determine the presence or absence of airborne droplets when high flow nasal cannulae are used in six participants at 30 and 60L/min respectively. Duration 5-10 mins.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Droplet trajectory
A region of approximately 4x4cm immediately below the participants nostrils shall be imaged. A Redlake Motion Pro X3 camera shall be used at 1040 frames per second, shutter speed of 40 micro seconds and resolution of 256 x 1024 pixels. The region shall be backlit with four high output LEDs and a diffusing screen of sandblasted PMMA. This will cast a silhouette of the nose and of any droplets onto the camera. A chin and forehead rest of the type used by ophthalmologists ensured that the participant could consistently place their nose in the field of view.
The camera will focuss on first the right, then the left nostril in subsequent imaged sets. The camera shall run throughout the test, and a clip of between 100 and 700 frames showing the greatest number of droplets was obtained from each experimental test.

      <timepoint>The images of the exhaled droplets shall be processed using ImageJ, a  Java image processing and analysis program.  
The digital videos of the droplets shall be converted to grayscale using the Image/Type/8-bit function. The images shall then be thresholded using the Image/Adjust/Threshold menu with the typical threshold value of 25-50 grey levels. 
Droplet number, size and position shall be analyzed using the Analyze/Analyze Particles panel.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Humidified High Flow Nasal cannulae (Optiflow Trademark Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) are in use in many clinical settings including the home and the hospital. These cannulae are used to deliver a range of flows of heated and humidified gases to support patients with a variety of conditions including those with a compromised respiratory status. It is thought that whilst patients are on this therapy that their exhaled gases laden with viral airborne droplets (aerosols) may lead to an increased infection control risk. Determining both the potential dispersal of viruses via aerosol and whether the use of a cannula generates more exhaled droplets compared to normal resting breathing and forced nasal exhalation (snorting), is vital as this shall help inform any control measures. 
The hypothesis under consideration was that Optiflow use does not pose an increased risk of Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs) from an infection prevention and control perspective.
