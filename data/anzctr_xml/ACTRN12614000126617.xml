    <statisticalmethods>A trial comprising 800 participants that are followed until approximately 200 deaths are observed (e.g. over a 2 year recruitment with an additional follow-up of 5.5 years) provides at least 80% power to detect a 33% reduction in the hazard of death with a 2-sided type 1 error of 0.05 assuming a 5-year survival rate of 76% amongst controls.

The primary analysis will be a comparison of overall survival (OS) in the two treatment arms using a log-rank test. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS will also be prepared. An estimate of the hazard ratio will be obtained using Cox proportional hazards regression. The sensitivity of treatment effect estimates to adjustment for baseline covariates will be explored. Other time-to-event endpoints will be analysed in a comparable fashion to the primary endpoint. The QoL scores collected longitudinally will be analysed using appropriate linear models for repeated measures data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will compare the effectiveness of standard deprivation therapy and radiation therapy combined either with enzalutamide or with currently available antiandrogen drugs for improving the survival in men with localised prostate cancer at high risk of recurrence. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 18 years or more who has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, judged to be at high risk for recurrence. You must also be deemed suitable for external beam radiation therapy. Study details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two treatment groups. Participants in one group will be treated with 160mg Enzalutamide daily by mouth for 24 months. Participants in the other group will receive currently available anti-androgen drugs for 6 months. Anti-androgen drugs block testosterone and related androgens from attaching to molecules in the cancer cell called androgen receptors. Blocking this attachment prevents androgens from having their effect. This might provide additional benefit in treating the cancer although this has not yet been proven. Participants will be regularly assessed in order to determine which of these treatments is best at improving the survival of men, as well as the ability of treatments to control prostate cancer, the safety of the treatments, the effects of the treatments on quality of life, and differences in the costs of care.
