  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention employed is that of an algorithm-based approach to the triage, screening, diagnosis and evidence based management of functional gastrointestinal disorders.

The algorithm includes the screening of suspected FGID patients with routine blood and stool tests, the provision of a diagnostic letter to the patient and GP which incorporates current evidence-based management options including the low FODMAP diet and psychological therapy.

The intervention period is 6 weeks. In this 6 week period, patients will be screened via The Rome III Criteria (a validated survey to classify Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders), and undergo a panel of minimally invasive blood and stool tests. These results will be reviewed by a Gastroenterologist and a diagnosis made. Patients and their GPs will be informed of the diagnosis and recommended evidence based management options (via letter). Patients can freely choose to utililise as many or little of these recommendations as wanted.  We will follow them up 6 weeks post intake to assess outcomes.  Likewise, patients may continue or discontinue their chosen management options at any stage throughout this study. We are seeking to understand which options patients avail themselves on, the reasons behind these choices, and how successful the management options were for these patients.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group/treatment is waitlisted patients suspected of having a functional gastrointestinal disorder receiving usual care. Usual care is defined as any treatment commenced or investigations ordered by the patients GP whilst they are waiting for their appointment with the Gastroenterologist. Patients may also use any over the counter medications or alternative therapies during this time.  We do not wish to alter any aspect of a patients normal wait-list experience, including other forms of treatment / management they use during this time.  If this algorithm-based protocol shows good results, then it will be offered to the waitlist patients at the end of this study (i.e. 12 months).

In addition, the outcomes of the treatment group (where the treatment/intervention is participation in the algorithm based approach) will be compared with their baseline measures at intake.</comparator>

    <concealment>One third of the invited patients are being invited to the waitlist control group and two-thirds being invited to the intervention group.

Allocation is not concealed.


Intentional withholding of information from the wait list control group regarding the concurrent treatment arm of this study is planned in order to gain a satisfactory control group who are comparable to the active arm participants. We justify this, on the basis that:

Knowledge of the active arm is likely to reduce control patient satisfaction with their current situation and introduce a bias related simply to performing the study.

Control patients will not receive any less care than would occur if not in study from being on the wait list control group, nor does being on the wait list control put them at any risk of study-related harm

There is genuine equipoise in the proposal, as there is no generally accepted way to deal with this referral group in usual care settings

These patients have a non-progressive disorder and will be offered subsequent study participation after a short delay if results are positive.

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study of a convenience sample to see whether such an algorithm based approach may improve patient outcomes.  If the results are positive then a full RCT would be warranted. For this reason, sample size required has not been calculated.

The statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS 21 and NVivo. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the study population in the two arms at baseline. Groups (the experimental group versus the wait-list) will be compared on the primary outcome measure of global patient satisfaction at 12 months using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with adjustment for baseline measures if the data are normally distributed, and using its non-parametric equivalent if the distribution proves skewed. Similar analyses will be conducted for the secondary outcome variables.
