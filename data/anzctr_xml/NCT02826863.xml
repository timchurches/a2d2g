  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, study to assess the
      efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ZX008 when used as adjunctive therapy in pediatric
      and young adult subjects with Dravet syndrome. Subjects who qualify for the study will be
      randomized (1:1:1) in a double-blind manner to receive 1 of 2 doses of ZX008 or placebo. All
      subjects will be titrated to their randomized dose over a 14-day Titration Period. Following
      titration, subjects will continue treatment at their randomly assigned dose over a 12-week
      Maintenance Period. Total treatment time from the beginning of the Titration Period through
      the end of the Maintenance Period is 14 weeks.</summary>
