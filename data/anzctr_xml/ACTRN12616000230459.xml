  <interventions>
    <interventions>8 week home based stretching program.
The stretching program will consist of a standing static lunge calf stretch, which will be held for 30 seconds and repeated 4 times on each leg during each session. Participants will be required to perform one stretching session per day, five days a week, for the eight week trial period.
Participants will complete a daily stretch diary to record how often they did the stretches.

    <statisticalmethods>To determine the effect of an eight week calf stretching program on the primary outcome of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, and to allow statistical analysis to determine participant factors correlated with an increase in ankle dorsiflexion, a minimum sample size of 34 per group will be required for the randomised controlled trial.
The calculations are based on the following assumptions:
1) an SD of 6.5 degrees and difference of 5 degrees between the control group and the experimental group being clinically meaningful;
2) a power of 0.80 and alpha of 0.05 and;
3) a 20% attrition rate.
All data will be explored for normality prior to inferential analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni-adjusted post-hoc tests will be used to compare pressure measurements under various sites of the foot between the two test groups before and after the stretching program.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world, affecting over 8% of the
global population and is associated with a life-time risk of foot ulcers of 12-25%. Foot ulcers
lead to high morbidity, increased associated healthcare costs and are the most important risk factor for lower extremity amputation. Elevated forefoot plantar pressure is a risk factor for foot ulceration and has been linked to reduced ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (equinus) in people with diabetes.

Calf muscle stretching has been demonstrated to improve ankle joint range of motion across both the young and older adult healthy populations, and a pilot trial has demonstrated a reduction in plantar pressures following range of motion exercises in people with diabetes.

Calf muscle stretching may be a simple, non-invasive and inexpensive method of increasing ankle joint range of motion resulting in decreased plantar pressures and a reduced risk of plantar ulceration in people with diabetes.

The aims of this trial are
1) To determine if an 8 week calf stretching intervention will be effective in increasing ankle joint range of motion in people with diabetes and ankle equinus.
2) To determine if an increased ankle joint range of motion in people with diabetes and ankle equinus results in an associated reduction in forefoot plantar pressures.</summary>
