  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The basic goal for hepatitis B vaccination is to achieve a protective immune response with a minimum of discomfort and without any risk of serious side effects. Current hepatitis B vaccines whilst safe are associated with significant injection site discomfort. In addition they contain aluminium salts which pose uncertain long term risks of toxicity. This study was designed to collect preliminary data on the safety and tolerability of a new hepatitis B vaccine where the aluminium component has been replaced by a natural plant derived sugar which in animal studies has been shown to markedly reduce injection pain while enhancing the protection conferred by the vaccine.</summary>
