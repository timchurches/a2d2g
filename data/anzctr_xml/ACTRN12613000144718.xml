    <studytitle>Pilot study to assess an evidence-based anaesthesia monitoring system</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A pilot study in patients undergoing anaesthesia for major surgery who will be monitored using an additional computer based system (EBMi); whether the EBMi system has any advantages  over conventional monitoring will be assessed by the anaesthetist in charge of the patients care. </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Use of novel software to augment present anaesthesia monitoring.
The software includes the ability to detect / diagnose various adverse events during anaesthesia...including hypovolaemia, age and disease related hypotension, Cushing response, sympathetic response, low anaesthetic concentration, damped arterial trace.  The alerts are presented visually and audibly in plain English. The software will run for the duration of the anaesthetic .</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a pilot study of an auxiliary monitoring system and as such it will be assessed for its 'usability' and ability to detect adverse events; for this pilot study  it is not being compared with any other system</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Early detection / Screening</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.  The software functions without failure / downtime

Failure or downtime  a simple observation that the software keeps running despite artefacts in the monitored data</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2.  The degree of agreement between the clinician and the software using Kappa analysis</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of the pilot study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3  Determination of specificity / sensitivity of diagnoses

Each alert will be assessed by the clinician(s) and will be classified as a True positive or False positive.  This will be done using clinical acumen/experience</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The anaesthesia monitors we now use have not changed significantly over the last 25 years.  We are still presented with simple trend displays of various parameters over time, digital values that are updated every 10s and waveforms of some variables.   There is virtually no interpretation of these variables and it is very easy to miss significant changes that take place slowly over time.
The Evidence-Based monitor software follows trend in key variables and detects patterns of changes in these variable that are associated with 'organised' physiological responses and alerts the anaesthetist to the possibility of an adverse state.
This software has been tested off-line on two patient databases (both had ethical approval for data collection) but has never been tested in real-time in an operating theatre.
Objectives

1.	To show that the software will run continuously without breakdowns
2.	To assess its ease of use 
3.	To assess its usefulness

a)	Did it highlight events that may have been missed because of other factors

b)	Did it stimulate a change in patient management.

4.	To determine the correctness of the advice
a)	Did it suggest diagnoses that were incorrect (False positives)
b)	Did it fail to suggest a diagnosis when the clinician expected a response (False negative)
c)	Did it 'keep quiet' when nothing was happening (True negatives)
d)	Did it correctly diagnose adverse events for which it is designed (True positive)
