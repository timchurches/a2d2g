    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Maraviroc

No Intervention: Standard of care HAART regimen - Participants randomised to this arm of the trial will remain on their usual prescribed HAART regimen.

Experimental: Maraviroc - Participants randomised to this arm will remain on their usual prescribed HAART regimen, with the addition of Maraviroc. Maraviroc will be prescribed according to the Product Information Sheet, with consideration given to background therapy.


Treatment: drugs: Maraviroc
Maraviroc oral tablet. Dosage: 150 mg twice daily, 300 mg twice daily, or 600 mg twice daily. Dosing will be dependent on the participant's background HAART therapy, and will be in accordance with the product information sheet.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Neurocognitive Functioning - Change in overall neurocognitive performance, defined as a global neurocognitive z-score, over the study time-period (baseline, 6-months, 12-months). To derive this score, 1) raw scores obtained from a 5-domain brief neurocognitive battery were converted to age-corrected z-scores (M=0, SD=1) and 2) the set of individual subtest z-scores were averaged to generate a single composite (global) z-score for each subject. Lower (negative) scores therefore indicate greater levels of cognitive impairment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6-months and 12-months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in CSF Neopterin Concentration - Change in concentration of the CSF neuroinflammatory marker neopterin (measured in nmol/L) from baseline to 12-months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 12-months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in MRS Cerebral Metabolite Ratios in Basal Ganglia - Change in major cerebral metabolites in the basal ganglia, as measured by 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), between baseline and 12-months. Spectra were acquired on a Phillips Achieva 3T MRI scanner using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with short echot time (TE). jMRUI/AMARES algorithm was used to process spectra. Metabolite ratios were calculated for the following metabolites: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mIo), in relation to internal water (H20) as standard.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in MRS Cerebral Metabolite Ratios in Frontal White Matter - Change in major cerebral metabolites in the frontal white matter, as measured by 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), between baseline and 12-months. Spectra were acquired on a Phillips Achieva 3T MRI scanner using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with short TE. jMRUI/AMARES algorithm was used to process spectra. Metabolite ratios were calculated for the following metabolites: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mIo), glutamate/glutamine complex (Glx), in relation to internal H2O as standard.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>HIV related cognitive impairment still occurs despite highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART). HIV disease affects the brain in 20-40% of patients with advancing HIV disease;
      leading to varying degrees of cognitive impairment, recently termed HIV associated
      neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND may occur in patients who are virally suppressed in
      both blood and CSF.

      Patients with HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) who are virally suppressed in
      both their blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whilst on a highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) regimen may have significant cognitive improvement with HAART intensification
      with the medication Maraviroc; compared to those who remain on their existing regimen.

      This study will be a prospective, interventional, randomised and unblinded controlled
      clinical trial. The aim of this study will be to determine whether HAART intensification with
      the medication Maraviroc, leads to significant improvement in HIV associated neurocognitive
      disorders (HAND).

      Patients with the recent progression (within 6 months) of HAND (validated by
      neuropsychological assessment) on HAART, who are virally suppressed (&lt;50 copies per ml) in
      blood and CSF will be randomised to have their existing HAART regimen intensified with
      Maraviroc, or not. The control arm will remain on their medication regimen as prescribed. The
      target is to enrol 70 patients into the control group, and 70 patients into the Maraviroc
      intensification group.

      Patients will undergo baseline neuropsychological testing, MRI, blood tests, and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests (via a lumbar puncture). The methods used to determine the
      effectiveness of adding Maraviroc, will include further neuropsychological assessment at 6
      months, and neuropsychological assessment, MRI and CSF assessment again at 12 months.

      Neuropsychological testing completed at 6 and 12 months will be completed by a "blind
      assessor", in that they will have no knowledge of which arm (treatment or control) the
      participant is enrolled in.

      An evaluation (neuropsychological testing) will be performed should the patient deteriorate
      during the course of the study, as recognised by the patient's managing physician.

      At the end of the study protocol (12 months) the patient's HAART therapy will be managed by
      their primary physician.</summary>
