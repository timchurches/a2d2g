  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 3 week intervention is a transfer training program using combined Errorless Learning (EL) and Spaced Retrieval (SR) techniques to improve safety in transfers. It starts with more intensive therapy in week 1 (5 sessions, 30 minutes each session) and gradually decreases the intensity in week 2 (2 sessions, 30 minutes each session) and week 3 (1 session, 30 minutes each session). The sessions are one on one sessions run by either an occupational therapist or a physiotherapist, either on the ward or at the participant's home. The therapist demonstrates the transferring task in 3 steps: initiate walking after standing up from a chair, walk around an object at 3 metre distance, approach the chair and plan sitting. The instruction "take big steady steps" is emphasised at each step by the therapist. Following the demonstration, participants are provided with verbal cues/instructions prior to each step when performing the task to prevent errors (small, shuffly gait) from happening and the time intervals between each transfer practice gradually increase. The adherence of intervention will be monitored on the ward and at home by therapist's visits during the intervention period. Follow-up phone calls (every fortnight) will be carried out during the 3 month follow up period to check on any falls that do occur by participant using a Falls Calendar.</interventions>

      <outcome>The feasibility and acceptability of the transfer training program. This is a composit outcome assessed by a questionnaire designed specifically for this study. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The questionnaire is to be completed at the end of the intervention period. At the end of each session, two brief questions are asked to get participant's feedback. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The potential effectiveness of the program on risk of falls. This is assessed by a Falls Calendar (self-report of number of falls, location and feature of falls), comparison of 3 quantitative measures: timed Up&amp;Go, 360 degree turn test and Icon-FES.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>* age 65 years or over admitted under geriatric medicine at SVH with a variety of medical conditions or community dwelling adults aged 65 years and over who are managed by the SVH Geriatric team
* history of falls within the last 12 months
* higher-level gait disorders: wide-based, short-step, shuffling gait and able to mobilise with or without walking aid independently
* timed Up &amp; Go: equal or less than 30 seconds
* Cognitive screening: 
 - All participants will be screened with RUDAS, a score of 15-26 out of 30 is for inclusion.
 - If RUDAS score is equal to or greater than 27 out of 30 (normal range), a more sensitive tool MoCA will be used and a score of less than 26 out of 30 is for inclusion. 
 - Participant will need to pass spaced retrieval screen.
* Informed consent obtained from patient or primary carer/person responsible. A person responsible is required if RUDAS is equal or less than 20 out of 30.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of combined Errorless Learning (EL) and Spaced Retrieval (SR) techniques in a 3 week transfer training program to prevent falls in adults aged 65 and over with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and higher level gait disorders. Participants are recruited from those admitted to St Vincent's Hospital (SVH) under the Geriatric team or community dwelling adults aged 65 years and over who are managed by the SVH Geriatric team . The assessments and intervention are conducted by a senior occupational therapist and/or  a senior physiotherapist under the supervision of the geriatricians. The intervention is either conducted on the ward or in the participants home.  Follow up assessments at 3 months post intervention are conducted by the occupational therapist at the participants home. This project will form the pilot study for a larger multi-centre clinical trial, which will assess the long-term effect of this novel falls prevention program targeting older adults with cognitive impairment and higher level gait disorders. </summary>
