  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial is being conducted internationally by the International Breast Cancer Study Group. The trial is co-ordinated in Australia and New Zealand by Breast Cancer Trials (formerly the Australia &amp; New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group). The aim of this clinical trial is to try to determine whether long term survival for women who do not have an axillary dissection is different from women who do have an axillary dissection when the sentinel lymph node contains micrometastases. IBCSG 23-01 is an international, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 1960 patients with histologically proven, clinically node-negative breast cancer who have undergone primary breast surgery and sentinel node biopsy with micrometastases identified in the sentinel node. Women will be randomised in a 2-arm design to receive one of the following: a. Axillary dissection b. No axillary dissection </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease-free survival (DFS) - defined as the time from randomisation to local (including recurrence restricted to the breast after breast conserving treatment), regional (including reappearance of tumour in the undissected axilla), or distant recurrence, appearance of a second contralateral breast primary, appearance of a second non-breast primary, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. An in situ recurrence either in the ipsilateral or in the contralateral breast is not considered a recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>DFS will be assessed as follows: assessed as follows:  within one month of randomisation, every 4 months during Year 1, every 6 months during Years 2-5 and yearly thereafter until death or trial closure. Analysis of the increase in the hazards ratio of no axillary dissection versus axillary dissection will be conducted after 558 events have been observed. This is anticipated to occur approximately 11.84 years from the start of the study or in January 2013. Three interim analyses will be conducted , one at 25% of the target number of events, one at 50% of the target number of events and at 75% of the target number of events.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS) - defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival will be analysed as per the primary outcome timepoint and assessed as follows:  within one month of randomisation, every 4 months during Year 1, every 6 months during Years 2-5 and yearly thereafter until death or trial closure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systemic disease-free survival - defined as the time from randomisation to systemic relapse, appearance of second (non-breast)primary tumour, or death, whichever occurs first. (Systemic relapse is defined as any recurrent or metastatic disease in sites other that the local mastectomy scar/chest wall/skin, the ipsilateral breast in case of breast conservation, or the contralateral breast)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Systemic disease-free survival will be analysed as per the primary outcome timepoint and assessed as follows:  within one month of randomisation, every 4 months during Year 1, every 6 months during Years 2-5 and yearly thereafter until death or trial closure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life - measured using patient self-assessments</outcome>
      <timepoint>Quality of life will be analysed as per the primary outcome timepoint and assessed as follows:  at registration, every 4 months from date of randomisation during Year 1, every 6 months during Years 2-5 and at 6years (72 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of reappearance of disease in the undissected axilla</outcome>
      <timepoint>Incidence of reappearance of disease in the undissected axilla will be analysed as per the primary outcome timepoint and assessed as follows:  within one month of randomisation, every 4 months during Year 1, every 6 months during Years 2-5 and yearly thereafter until death or trial closure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sites of first failure  - include: local, regional, conralateral breast and distant failures, second (non-breast) primaries and deaths without recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sites of first failure will be analysed as per the primary outcome timepoint and assessed as follows:  within one month of randomisation, every 4 months during Year 1, every 6 months during Years 2-5 and yearly thereafter until death or trial closure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Long term surgical complications eg Sensory neuropathy, lymphedema and motor neuropathy will be assessed by the physician and graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC VERSION 2).  Assessments will occur within one month of randomisation, every 4 months during Year 1 and every 6 months during Years 2-5</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast cancer usually first spreads to lymph nodes in the axilla (armpit). Sentinel node biopsy is a way of finding and removing the lymph nodes most likely to contain cancer. Women found to have cancer in their sentinel nodes usually undergo an axillary clearance. This involves removal of most lymph nodes in the armpit but can cause side effects such as lymphoedema (arm swelling) and other problems. This international phase III trial will determine if an axillary clearance is warranted for women who have only small clumps of cancer cells, called micrometastases, found in the sentinel lymph nodes.</summary>
