Patients are randomised to receive VAC Therapy (KCI)  for a period of 6 weeks.                                                                                                                                                            The frequency of the VAC Therapy is for a period of 6 weeks with the device to be on for 22 hours out of 24 hours in a day everyday for the length of the study.                                                                               If the wound has not healed after 6 weeks with VAC Therapy, patients are to receive standard wound therapy.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic foot wounds tend to take a long time to heal. In an attempt to heal these wounds, standard wound treatment involves the use of gel and foam dressings. This is the treatment you have been receiving so far. These dressings are designed to keep the wound moist but remove excess fluid, to promote the healing process.  

Vacuum-assisted closure therapy (VAC) is a relatively new treatment for foot wounds.  VAC therapy involves the application of negative pressure (like a vacuum) to the wound through a little tube after the wound has been filled with foam and covered with a clear dressing.  The vacuum sucks out any fluid in the wound and pulls the wound edges together.  There has been some evidence that suggests this therapy assists wound healing. The VAC makes the wound site the best environment for healing to occur by removing the fluid, increasing blood flow and making the wound less suitable for bacteria to grow.

The aim of this study is to see whether VAC therapy helps heal these stubborn wounds better than the standard therapy.</summary>
