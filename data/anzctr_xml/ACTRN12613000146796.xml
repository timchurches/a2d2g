  <interventions>
    <interventions>New medication monitoring system led by pharmacist in the elderly home will be the study intervention. This intervention will cover the whole 6-month study period. The pharmacist will visit the elderly home once a week to check the drug administration process and conduct medication reconciliation in elderly who recently have transition of care, i.e clinic visits and hospital visits. Medication administration record (MAR) will be checked every month. A standardized home safety checklist will be used to perform the assessment once at baseline. The checklist covers several areas including drug storage, preparation, utensils used for drug administration, drug usage records, accuracy of medications, drug administration process, and risk management. Blood pressure levels of the residents will also be reviewed. Corresponding medical officers will be informed in case there is any need for changing the residents medications. Pharmacist will document all the interventions conducted for the above medications related problems and the acceptance of the interventions. The review process of the medication records and blood pressure levels will be standardized. 

Medication reconciliation will be conducted in the elderly residents who recently had a transition of care. The pharmacist will assess if there is any discrepancy in current medication, new medication and the medication listed in the discharge summary. 

Elderly home staff will also be educated on the importance of the proper medication administration once a month by the visiting pharmacist. This training session will last for around 30-45 minutes with a Q&amp;A session included.
