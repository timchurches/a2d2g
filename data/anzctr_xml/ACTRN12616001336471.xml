  <interventions>
    <interventions>We hope to enrol any medical inpatient greater than age 75 who is prescribed five or more regularly scheduled medications at the time of admission and who will be discharged to a residential care facility. This could potentially include patients who were admitted from home but for whom a return to home is no longer feasible. the follow-up period is for one year and id comprised of  a 30 day, 90 day and 12 month follow-ups. The 30 day and 90 day follow-ups include  phone calls to either the participant, the next of kin, GP, or staff at the residential care facility to obtain outcome information. The 12 month follow-up will involve hospital records and may involve contact with the residential care facility or GP.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary aim of this study is to assess feasibility of enrollment and likely recruitment rates for an RCT to be performed next. Analysis will therefore be primarily descriptive.   We will also gather sufficient data to allow an estimate of the effect size on mortality and readmission at 30 and 90 days.

Our research hypothesis is that there will be no difference in mortality and re-admissions at 30 and 90 days between patients for whom medications are ceased and those for whom medications remain unchanged. The usual mortality rate at one year for this population of elderly patients is variable, but is anticipated to lie between 20% and 50%. The usual 30-day readmission rate for this patient group is approximately 10%.  

We intend to enrol a total of 200 patients from the seven public acute care hospitals in Adelaide.  This number will enable us to make an estimate of the sample size needed to measure mortality and read-mission rates for the larger RCT.

Although we anticipate no changes in mortality or readmission rates, we anticipate that quality of life may improve with reduced medication amongst this population.  Therefore, we will also assess the feasibility of measuring quality of life using the Short Form-8 with a phone call to either the participant or the available next of kin at 30 and 90 days.  This questionnaire consists of eight questions and takes only minutes to complete.

 If the enrollment rate is not as high as we anticipate then results will still be broadly generalisable provided that there is no bias in outcomes due to subject self-selection. We do not anticipate this will be the case given that subjects are not being requested to perform any active intervention i.e. they will be provided with standard of care treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Modern medical care can provide many medications for problems, whether simply short-term medications like antibiotics or longer-term medications like those used to treat high blood pressure. But we do not know enough about ceasing medications, especially in elderly patients. We know that often medications are ceased while a patient is hospitalised; sometimes medications are not ceased. We want to collect data about those patients who had medications stopped and those who did not, and compare the two groups later to look for any differences.
Many elderly people complain about being on too many medications. People on lots of medications might wonder what would happen if one or more of their regular medications was ceased. Our purpose is to understand better any benefits for older people to be on fewer regular medications and any unforeseen risks of stopping regular medications in older people. Hospital doctors often cease a regular medication. We will not influence when and how that happens for your loved one, only observe whether or not it does happen, and call you after discharge to find out how he or she is feeling.
What does participation in this research involve? Nothing about their hospital care will be different. The patient will be treated just like any other patient. Sometimes a patient is hospitalised as a result of a side effect of a medication which is then stopped. Sometimes a patient is admitted to hospital for a different reason but a medicine needs to be stopped in hospital. And sometimes no medications need to be stopped. These measures are all part of routine hospital care. We simply want to check on your loved one after his or her hospital stay to see how he or she is feeling. 
What are the possible benefits of taking part? After discharge, the patient will be given extra attention in the form of a follow-up phone call, either to you, the patient, or the patients General Practitioner. If, during this phone call, it becomes evident that the patient needs urgent or semi-urgent attention, the re-search assistant will immediately contact the Chief Investigator, who will then contact either the Residential Care Facility where the patient lives, the next of kin (or person responsible), or the General Practitioner to develop a plan to address the patients needs. 
What are the possible risks and disadvantages of taking part? 
The only burden to you might be a follow-up phone call. If, during this phone call, you seem anxious or distress because of the questions, the interview will be stopped.
