  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK933776
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to match GSK933776

Experimental: Part A - Part A will be a single-blind, single dose, placebo controlled, dose escalation study in up to five consecutive cohorts of Alzheimers Disease subjects. Each subject will receive a single infusion of GSK933776 or placebo. The dose for the first cohort will be 0.001 mg/kg. The proposed nominal doses for subsequent cohorts are 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 3 mg/kg, but these may be altered based on the outcome of the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data of the preceding group(s). The maximum possible dose will be 20 mg/kg, although the planned top dose is 18 mg/kg

Experimental: Part B - Part B will be a single-blind, repeat dose, placebo controlled dose escalation design. It is proposed that there will be initially 3 cohorts of AD subjects. However up to 5 cohorts may be recruited if required in order to characterise GSK933776 fully.Each cohort will consist of eight subjects (six active, two placebo) who will each receive a maximum of three infusions of GSK933776 or placebo. Dosing in Part B may proceed in parallel with Part A following satisfactory review of minimum data sets as below:
First cohort in Part B: at least 3 weeks' data from the Part A dose that is the same dose level as that planned for Part B Second cohort in Part B: at least 3 weeks PK data and 8 weeks safety data following the first dose from all the subjects on active treatment in the preceding Part B cohort plus a satisfactory outcome of the PIB Subsequent cohorts in Part B: at least 3 weeks PK data and 8 weeks safety data follow


Treatment: drugs: GSK933776
Part A planned doses cohort 1 to cohort 3 0.001 mg/kg, 0.01 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg.
Part B planned doses cohort 4 to cohort 7 0.1 mg/kg, 1mg/kg, 3mg/kg and 10 mg/kg

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to match GSK933776
Part A first 2 cohorts 5 patients per cohort 2 placebo and 3 active third cohort part A 2 placebo 6 active. Part B 8 patients per cohort 2 placebo 6 active.
