  <interventions>
    <interventions>Total intravenous anesthesia - maintained by propofol infusion according to Roberts dosing scheme, adjusted by Bispectral index. Sufentanil (approx. 0,3 mcg/kg) will be used as analgetic component and rocuronium (0,6 mg/kg) for muscle relaxation. Mixture of air and oxygen for ventilation. Approx. duration of anesthesia 60 min.</interventions>
    <comparator>Inhalational anesthesia - sevoflurane in concentration 1,0 MAC with age correction, in air and oxygen mixture, adjusted by Bispectral index. Sufentanil (approx. 0,3 mcg/kg) will be used as analgetic component and rocuronium (0,6 mg/kg) for muscle relaxation. Mixture of air and oxygen for ventilation.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients undergoing elective intervertebral herniation resection will be deemed eligible for inclusion. Depending on free capacity of electrophysiology lab (which performs pre- and postoperative examination), during routine preanesthesia visit, patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be informed about the possibility to participate in the study. Informed consent will be obtained. 
Group of included patients will be randomized in 1:1 proportion (intravenous/inhalational anesthesia). Randomization will be performed just before anesthesia by the treating anesthesiologist - sealed envelopes technique. </concealment>
    <sequence>The sealed envelopes technique with the simple urn randomization method will be used to randomly allocate patients into the intravenous and inhalational arm. Equal randomization in proportion 1:1 will be used. </sequence>

    <summary>Aim of the study is to diagnose and compare the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction after two commonly used types of general anesthesia  inhalational and intravenous - in the healthy middle age population. Combination of standardized psychometric tests and electophysiological examination will be used for detection of cognitive disorder at different time intervals after the operation. </summary>
