  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will determine the efficacy of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell injections post arthroscopic microfracture for isolated knee cartilage defects versus arthroscopic microfracture alone. The arthroscopic microfracture will not form part of the study as this is accepted surgical management. The post operative stem cell injections are the sole intervention. 40 participants will be recruited and randomally allocated to a treatment arm/group of 20 participants who receive stem cell injections and a control arm/group of 20 particpants who have no intervention post microfracture. The treatment arm/group will receive injections of 100million mesenchymal stem cells at 1week post microfracture and a 2nd injection of 100Million stem cells at 6months totalling 200Million cells.</interventions>
    <comparator>Non blinded control - microfracture with no post operative intervention.  Control participants will be followed up with serial questionnaires and repeat imaging as per the treatment group.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.	Aged between 18  50 (inclusive). As isolated full thickness chondral defects are often traumatic in nature it is likely that this age restriction represents the majority of patients who undergo microfracture. 
2.	Pre-operative radiological diagnosis of an isolated full thickness knee cartilage defect of the medial or lateral femoral condyle
3.	Planned arthroscopic microfracture/osteoplasty 
4.	Sufficient English skills to complete the questionnaires required for the study, as well as to understand the instructions given by the study doctors. 
5.	No plans at the time of enrolment to undergo surgery in the following three months. This criterion is aimed at avoiding co-interventions that may confound the results of the study. While involvement in the project will not strictly prevent participants from undertaking such interventions if required, we will exclude volunteers who already have such procedures scheduled</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Participants will be referred directly to the study by orthopaedic surgeons.  Surgeons will be made aware of the study through both advertising and presentations.  The participants will be undergoing a planned arthroscopic microfracture external to the study for an isolated medial femoral condyle cartilage defect.  After referral the potential participants will undergo initial screening and if suitable will be formally enrolled in the study after completing an informed consent.  The participants will be randomly allocated by the study administration to the treatment arm or control arm.  

Allocation will be concealed :

Allocation will be performed by the study administrator after formal enrolment by the study doctor.  The study doctor will not be present at time of allocation.  Allocation will be concealed from the study doctor and allocation schedule will only be known by the study administrator using a number randomisation computer program.  The study doctor will only be aware of the treatment group allocation after random allocation has been undertaken and not in their presence (this is not a blinded trial)</concealment>
    <sequence>Use of computer generated Research Randomiser (www.randomizer.org).  Participants 1-20 will be within the treatment arm and 21-40 will be within the control arm.  Research Randomiser will randomly generate the list of 0-40 in random order.  Participants will be sequentially allocated numbers from this randomly generated list.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis will focus on detecting the between-group treatment effect (with 95% confidence intervals) at each of the follow-up points (1-month, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months following randomisation). Analyses will be conducted using SPSS Version 21, with alpha set at 0.05 using a two-tailed hypothesis. Continuous data will be analysed using linear mixed models (with the group x time interaction estimating the treatment effect). These were chosen for their strength in analysing longitudinal biological data and accounting for correlations associated with repeated measurements. The mixed models will adjust for the baseline score of the outcome of interest as recommended by the revised CONSORT statement. Ordinal data will be analysed using the Mann Whitney U test.
At each follow-up point, participants in each group will be dichotomised according to whether they achieved the minimum clinically important difference of the outcome or not, and then the risk ratio, risk difference and number needed to treat will be calculated along with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance will be evaluated using Chi square analysis. For these purposes, the minimum clinically important difference will be defined as 10/100 for the KOOS, 2/10 for the NRS pain scales , at least much improved on the global rating of change scale  and very satisfied on the treatment satisfaction scales. It has been argued that these values for minimum clinically important difference may be too low in some contexts, hence we will repeat this analysis using a threshold of 50% reduction in KOOS scores and NRS pain scores based on empirical validation studies suggesting that this may be a more suitable threshold for important differences.
All data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis, in that all participants will be analysed in the treatment group to which they are initially allocated regardless of their compliance with that treatment. All participants who withdraw from treatment for any reason will continue to be contacted for follow-up assessments and informed that their data are still required. Missing data will be handled via restricted maximum likelihood estimation within the linear mixed models. Given the popularity of simple data imputation methods we will undertake a secondary sensitivity analysis to determine whether the results would differ if missing data were replaced using the last observation carried forward method.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The treatment of isolated knee cartilage defects remains difficult.  Research indicates that these isolated lesions lead to later development of generalised osteoarthritis.  Traditional and accepted arthroscopic microfracture of these lesions leads to formation of fibrocartilage which unfortunately only causes short to medium term improvement.  Use of mesenchymal stem cells injections post micro fracture has shown promise in pre-clinical animal studies and also in initial human trials.  We wish to explore the potential of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell injections post surgery to improve the quality of cartilage repair and prevent later onset development of osteoarthritis.  </summary>
