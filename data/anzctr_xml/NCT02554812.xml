  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 1b/2 dose-optimization study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of avelumab (MSB0010718C) in combination
      with other cancer immunotherapies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors. The primary purpose is to assess the safety and early signs of efficacy of various
      avelumab combinations with other cancer immunotherapies, optimizing dosing regimens as
      appropriate, in a limited series of indications.</summary>
