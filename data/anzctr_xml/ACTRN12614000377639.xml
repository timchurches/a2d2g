    <statisticalmethods>The sample size will be determined assuming that the expected incidence of PHN in patients above 50 years old in the control group was 22.1% to 30 %. (1-5)  An average incidence of 26% will be considered. Our aim will be to lower the incidence to less than 5% at power of study 90% (a = 0.05, B = 0.1). A calculated sample size of 34 patients in each group will be needed. We will include 80 patients to overcome losses during follow-up period. 
 Statistical analyses will be carried out based on the intention to treat using SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Mean (SD) will be used to summarize continuous quantitative data and frequency and proportion will be used for qualitative data.  The  analysis  of  the  data  will be  done  to  test  statistical  significant  differences  between the two groups.  For quantitative data, unpaired student t- test will be used to compare between the two groups.  For qualitative data, chi-square test will be used.  P-value &lt; 0.05 will considered significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized double blind clinical trial will be carried out at Mansoura University Hospital After approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee and obtaining of written, informed consent, 80 adult patients with acute herpes zoster affecting the chest wall will be referred from the dermatology clinic after prescribing appropriate antiviral therapy (acyclovir 800 mg five times daily administered orally for 7 days within the first 72 hours of eruption). 
Inclusion criteria: patients over 50 who had chest wall herpetic eruption of less than one week, with moderate and severe pain and received appropriate antiviral therapy. 
Exclusion  criteria  includes: patient  refusal,  eruption  of  more  than  one  week  duration,  patients who did  not  receive appropriate antiviral therapy, patients with mild pain, heavy skin eruption (no healthy area  for  needle  entry) and  infection  at  site  of  injection. Patients with history of renal, hepatic diseases, coagulopathy, diabetes, steroid therapy, malignancies and patients taking chemo and/or radiotherapy will be  excluded.   
Patients will be randomly assigned using a computer-generated random number assignment to receive paravertebral block using either 25 mg bupivacaine 0.5% plus 8 mg dexamethasone in a total volume of 10 ml  twice one week apart under fluoroscopy ( Group 1) or 25 mg bupivacaine 0.5% plus 8 mg dexamethasone in a total volume of 10 ml  three times one week apart under fluoroscopy ( Group 2).  
All patients will receive pregabalin in a dose of 150 mg/ twice with gradual reduction of the dose as the pain controlled. Acetaminophine was available as rescue analgesia in a dose of 1000 mg on request. 
Patients will be evaluated for pain severity using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), (10 cm unmarked line in  which  0 =  no pain  and  10 cm=worst  pain imaginable) before the block (basal), 1  hour after the  block,  every  3 days  for 2 weeks  after the procedure  and  every week for 6 weeks  and after 3 and 6 months. 
At each assessment visit, the total analgesic consumption will be recorded. The times of complete resolution of pain (from the date of paravertebral block till complete disappearance of herpetic pain) and skin eruption (identified by drop of last crust) will be recorded. The incidence of persistent herpetic pain after 3 and 6 months will be also reported as PHN.
