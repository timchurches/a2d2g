  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to develop and validate brief questionnaire (up to 5 questions) to identify those children and adolescents with cerebral palsy who may have feeding difficulties are be undernourished.  This would allow children to be referred for full assessment by the relevant health care professional/s to determine the presence and severity of feeding and swallowing difficulties and/or undernutrition and lead to the provision of appropriate clinical care.

A total of 100 children between the ages of 2.00 and 17.99 years will be recruited for the study.  To be enrolled, children must have a confirmed diagnosis of cerebral palsy and not rely on a feeding tube for enteral nutrition.  We will aim to recruit an even distribution across gross motor functional severity.

Parents will be asked to answer a series of simple questions regarding their child's feeding and nutritional status. Full feeding assessment and nutrition assessment will then be conducted to determine the presence and severity or absence of feeding difficulties and undernutrition. These will all be conducted on the same day. 

The nutritional assessment will consist of measures of weight and height (or length or knee height) and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses.  A Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment will be performed which involves an interview with the child's primary care giver and the collection of a nutrition related medical history including historical weight and height measurements (if known), full dietary history, presence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, and other related medical information.  A physical examination of key physical signs associated with undernutrition including subcutaneous fat stores and muscle stores will be conducted.

The feeding evaluation will involve the child positioned in their typical mealtime seating, children will be encouraged to consume food and fluids of different textures.

When required children will be referred for a more detailed feeding evaluation using an x-ray procedure.  This may be conducted on a separate day to the other components.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A total of 100 children, 20 from each of the five GMFCS  stratum will be required for this study.  Although formal sample size calculations for studies concerning the measurement properties of tools rely on too many assumptions to be of much use practically, a sample size of 100 is considered to be excellent by the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) group.  This sample size is comparable to those utilised by previous studies where nutritional screening tools have been developed.

To develop the screening tool we will first determine the individual contribution each screening questions makes towards identifying children with feeding difficulties and undernutrition (as defined above) by undertaking a principal components factor analysis. 

To validate the screening tool we will use the identified cutoff scores for feeding and swallowing difficulties and undernutrition, and the DDS and videofluoroscopy and subjective global nutrition assessment to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios for the screening tool. We will use McNemars Test to investigate the percentage of children defined as having feeding difficulties and undernutrition by the screening tool and by the subjective global nutrition assessment. 
The model will be validated using ten-fold-cross-validation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to develop and validate a brief questionnaire (up to 5 questions) to identify those children and young people with cerebral palsy who may have feeding difficulties are may be undernourished.  The primary hypothesis is that "risk" of feeding difficulties and undernutrition for children and young people with cerebral palsy can be determined using a brief, parent completed questionnaire. </summary>
