    <interventions>Neuropsychological assessment with feedback. 

The main components include: a clinical interview, the administration of objective, psychometric tests and observation of behaviour during testing, &amp; interpretaion of the results, followed by collaborative discussion of results and their practical implications with patients and caregivers, and agreeing upon recommedations for management. 

The intervention is delivered by qualified and experienced clinical neuropsychologists. It takes approximately 8-10 hours, and is spread over 2-3 face-to-face sessions (typically 2 sessions for the assessment and 1 for the feedback discussion) over a period of 1 - 2 weeks. It is delivered 6-7 weeks after randomisation.

Tests administered for the neuropsychological assessment vary according to clinical need, and are selected from a core battery, as listed below:
* Screening Examination for Cognitive Impairment in MS
* Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test  IV
* Wechsler Memory Scale  IV
* Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome
* DelisKaplan Executive Function System
* Trail Making Test A &amp; B
* Paced Auditory Serials Additions Test 
* Reid Recognition Memory Test
* Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
* Rey Complex Figure (Copy and Delayed Recall)
* Austin Maze
* Boston Naming Test
* COWAT Letter Fluency
* Semantic Fluency (Animals)
* Alternate Uses Test
* STROOP
* Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
* Cognitive Estimation Test
* Capacity to Consent to Treatment Instrument
* DEX Questionnaire (Self &amp; Other)
* Spielbergers State Trait Anxiety Inventory 
* Beck Depression Inventory
* Geriatric Depression Scale
* Dissociative Experiences Scale

The feedback session comprises six main components:
* A review of the purpose of the assessment, based on the referral question and including concerns and observations expressed by patients, caregivers, or referrers
* An overview of the assessment process and how the neuropsychologist went about testing the patients cognitive and emotional functioning, and interpreting the assessment results  
* A description of the patients assessed strengths and weaknesses 
* An interpretation of the results, including severity of impairment, likely aetiology, role of the patients psychological and emotional state, and so forth
* A discussion of the likely practical implications of the patients cognitive profile  
* Recommended strategies to manage significant cognitive impairment, and for staying well with MS, and the collaborative development of a general plan to implement agreed-upon strategies 
The broad content of the strategic management advice is based on the current neuropsychological rehabilitation literature in general, and the MS neuropsychological literature specifically and is constantly updated.  The specific content of this advice is adapted to take account of: the nature and severity of the patients cognitive impairment;  pre-morbid level of intelligence, personality, relevant beliefs;  nature of their other impairments and disabilities;  personal, vocational and educational history;  age, sex and cultural background;  nature of the environment in which they are functioning (including the people with whom they interact); the nature of their short-term and long-term life goals. The advice is usually strategic in nature, rather than specific (e.g. recommending that an appointment diary should be used, rather than which specific diary type should be used or how to set it up). Often, patients are referred on to other rehabilitation specialists, such as occupational therapists, clinical psychologists, or social workers, for further therapy or assistance with implementing the agreed-upon strategies. Thus, the recommendations that are provided by treating neuropsychologists contribute to an integrated rehabilitative care plan for individual MS patients.</interventions>

    <concealment>Concealed, random allocation of patients is achieved using a block randomisation process with blocks of variable size. Randomisation is conducted off-site by one of the authors, and allocation is concealed using a computer generated set of random numbers. Group allocation is written onto inserts placed in sequentially–numbered, opaque envelopes which are then opened sequentially as patients are recruited to the study.</concealment>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The protocol utilizes a wait-list control method which is structured to effectively blind patients and caregivers to their group allocation. Both groups receive the intervention 6 weeks after randomisation, the only difference between the groups is the timing of the outcome measures; the intervention group receives one set of outcome before the intervention and three afterwards (all 4-weeks apart), and the wait-list control group receives two sets of outcome measures before the intervention and two afterwards (all 4-weeks apart). 

In order to achieve this, the principle investigator organises the timing of the outcome measures. For each participant, the neuropsychological assessment appointment is set at least 6 weeks after recruitment into the study. Once group allocation has been determined by the randomisation process, the first set of outcome measures is back-dated according to group. For the intervention group the first set of outcome measures occurs 1 week before the neuropsychological assessment (at study week 5), and the next 3 sets occur every 4 weeks after this date. For the control group the first set of outcome measures occurs 5 weeks before the neuropsychological assessment (at study week 1), the next set occurs 4 weeks later (at study week 5), and the next 2 sets occur every 4 weeks after this.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cognitive impairment is one of the most common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), being objectively confirmed on neuropsychological assessment in at least 50% of patients. It can be functionally disabling, and has been shown to significantly impact on patients capacity to function in a most domains of life, including personal self-care, mental health and mood, relationships, social and leisure activities, rehabilitation, driving, and employment. Cognitive impairment can also impact upon families and caregivers. In particular, MS patient cognitive impairment has been found to be significantly associated with caregiver distress, quality of life, and caregiver strain. The rehabilitation of cognitive impairment in MS is still in its infancy, and although neuropsychological assessment is often described as the first step in the rehabilitation of cognitive impairment, it can also be a form of therapeutic intervention in its own right. However, research into the direct therapeutic benefit of neuropsychological assessment as a rehabilitative intervention in MS is very limited. So, using an RCT approach, the present study aims to investigate the direct psychological benefit of neuropsychological assessment with feedback in patients with MS and their main caregivers immediately following the feedback session and up to 10 weeks later. It is proposed that the intervention will lead to an increase in patient and caregiver knowledge of the patients cognitive strengths and weaknesses, to an improvement in the patients use of adaptive psychological strategies for coping with the health problems caused by MS, and to more positive caregiving outcomes for the caregiver.</summary>
