    <interventions>Speech Pathology involves a number of speciifc breathing and voice exercises that retrain the vocal cords to open on inspiration and close on expiration.
Education/Reassurance, specific strategies for controlling the cough sensation such as swallowing instead of coughing or sipping regular small quantities of water when the sensation to cough arises. Reassurance, involves assuring the subject that their chronic cough is not caused by a fatal disease and that their condition can be improved and even resolved in cases.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study will investigate how speech pathology treatments may work for chronic cough.

Chronic cough is a common problem that can be caused by conditions such as asthma, rhinitis and reflux. In approximately 20% of people, chronic cough remains unexplained. Recently we have identified that 50% of chronic cough sufferers have Paradoxical Vocal Cord Movement or Vocal Cord Dysfunction coexisting with chronic cough. Paradoxical vocal movement or vocal cord dysfunction is a condition that results in the vocal cords closing rather than opening when you breathe in. This can cause cough or breathing problems. Paradoxical vocal cord movement can be effectively treated with speech pathology. This study will assess how speech pathology benefits chronic cough.


The purpose of this study is to:- 
(i)      To investigate the effects of various aspects of the speech pathology treatment program on cough reflex sensitivity. 
(ii)     To compare changes in cough reflex sensitivity following single components of the speech pathology intervention e.g. voluntary control versus specific strategies.

It is hypothesised that specific speech pathology treatments will decrease cough reflex hypersensitivity.</summary>
