  <interventions>
    <interventions>Titration of baclofen or placebo in 18 methamphetamine dependent subjects to a dose of oral baclofen 60mg/day  (vs placebo) in a closed clinical trials unit over 6 days . The stepped dosage regime shown in Control/comparator (ANZCTR) field is required because baclofen side effects  occur when the dose increase is too rapid.
Day1 (total= 5mg): Breakfast (no dose), Lunch (no dose), Dinner (5mg), 
Day2 (total= 15mg): Breakfast (5mg), Lunch (5mg), Dinner (5mg), 
Day3 (total= 25mg): Breakfast (5mg), Lunch (10mg), Dinner (10mg), 
Day4 (total= 35mg): Breakfast (10mg), Lunch (10mg), Dinner (15mg), 
Day5 (total= 50mg): Breakfast (15mg), Lunch (15mg), Dinner (20mg), 
Day6 (total= 60mg): Breakfast (20mg), Lunch (20mg), Dinner (20mg) 
Each dose of  medication, baclofen or placebo, will be administered by study staff from the subject's individual blister pack of study medication.
The measurement of effect was fMRI evaluation of activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in response to subliminal visual drug cues.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study is placebo controlled. A compounding pharmacy will produce visually identical tablets of both placebo (microcellulose) and baclofen which will be packaged in blister packs for the 7 day period in the clinical trails unit. Each patient will receive tablets from a blister pack (of either baclofen or placebo) which will be assigned in the randomisation schedule. The subjects will otherwise receive the same regime and fMRI scans.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was determined by the maximum number of subjects which the study grant would fund which was 18 subjects. The study is a replica of a study of 20 cocaine dependent subjects but with only a single fMRI so comparisons were inter- subject ie purely baclofen vs placebo.. In this study, the comparisons will be inter- and intra-subject as each subject will have 2 fMRIs, the first prior to administration of the trial medication and the second at the end of titration of the trial medication. 
Functional MRI data analysis will be carried out using SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Methamphetamine addiction is a major and growing problem in Australia, with a considerable individual, family and community burden. The current trend is a rapid increase in the use of crystal methamphetamine, the most addictive form, from 10% of users in 2010 to over 50% in 2014. Current treatment options for methamphetamine addiction are all based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and have very low rates of durable abstinence. There are no proven pharmacotherapy options to assist in attaining and maintaining abstinence. The rapid increase in the use of high purity, highly addictive forms of methamphetamine, coupled with a lack of effective treatment, portends a public health catastrophe in Australia as outlined in the National Ice Action Strategy announced in April 2015.
The key focus of treatment is to stop addicted individuals succumbing to the intense drug cravings on exposure to drug cues: anything that evokes drug memories eg places or people associated with their methamphetamine use. The treatments based on CBT aim to alter the individuals response to drug cues but the igniting of these intense cravings is outside of conscious control. A more effective treatment strategy is to weaken the intensity of drug cravings with anti-craving medication.
Baclofen is a strong candidate for methamphetamine addiction treatment due to its proven effectiveness in suppressing drug cravings for cocaine, another stimulant drug which, like
methamphetamine, acts via the dopamine reward pathways of the brain.
A 2014 study on cocaine addiction used functional MRI (fMRI) to objectively study the brain activation patterns in cocaine addicts in response to cocaine associated images (drug cues). The subjects treated with baclofen showed a dramatic and specific suppression of activation of the brains reward pathways compared to the placebo group. This provides a mechanistic explanation for the clinical effectiveness of baclofen in suppressing cravings for and the use of cocaine in addicted individuals.
The study proposed in this application will reproduce the fMRI/cocaine study in 18 methamphetamine addicted subjects to test the effectiveness of baclofen (vs placebo) in
suppressing reward pathway activation in response to methamphetamine drug cues. If baclofen is effective, it would provide the foundation for clinical trials of baclofen therapy
combined with standard CBT treatment for methamphetamine addiction.
This study seeks to rapidly establish if baclofen has an anti-craving action in the methamphetamine addicted brain. A positive result will accelerate baclofen treatment being
adopted into current treatment programs for methamphetamine addiction with the aim of increasing durable abstinence rates.
