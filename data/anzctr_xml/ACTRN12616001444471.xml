  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a three-arm, single blind randomised controlled exercise intervention trial.  Eligible participants are randomized to 10-month, twice-weekly, either supervised high intensity resistance training, high intensity impact training or a sham active control group.  

Arm 1  supervised heavy progressive resistance training.
Participants allocated to the resistance training intervention group attend twice-weekly 45 minute instructor-led sessions performed on non-consecutive days.  Six compound exercises (deadlift, back squat, bench press, overhead press, bent over row and calf raise) using olympic weights will be completed each session.  For each exercise, 5 sets of 3-5 repetitions, corresponding to an intensity of 85 % of 1 repetition maximum will be performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist.  Measurements of 1 RM will take place every 12 weeks to ensure sufficient progression of resistance training exercises.  Compliance and weight lifted is monitored via training diaries which each participant completes at the end of each session.

Arm 2  supervised high-intensity impact loading exercise.
Participants allocated to the impact training intervention group attend twice-weekly 40 minute instructor-led high intensity impact training sessions performed on non-consecutive days.  Participants will be taught three fundamental upper limb loading exercises in the form of punches (jab, cross and lead hook) as well as complete three fundamental lower limb impact exercises (jump, hop and drop jump) under the supervision of a physiotherapist.  The fundamental exercises will be performed throughout the remainder of the intervention period with progressively increasing height and complexity of jumps and force of landing with participants progressing from shod to barefoot after the familiarisation phase as well as the power and complexity of punching combinations to maintain an RPE of greater than 8 out of 10.  Measures of punch kinematics will take place at 2, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 44 weeks using a GymAware device to ensure that participants continue to increase the loading and speed of their punches throughout the training intervention.  Compliance is monitored via training diaries which each participant completes at the end of each session.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3  
A low load, home-based unsupervised exercise program will serve as a positive control. Participants will be asked to exercise twice per week for approximately 30 minutes.  The sessions consist of shadow boxing and low load and body weight exercises in a low intensity circuit training format.  Participants are instructed on how to perform all exercises at the initial testing session; they are also provided with an exercise handout and have access to a private YouTube channel, as well as contacted weekly via email. Compliance is monitored via training diaries which each participant completes at the end of each session.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The skeletal response to exercise is highly dependent on the nature of the activity.  The most osteogenic loads are those that induce high magnitude bone strains at high loading rates.  However, debate exists as to the predominant source of the adaptive stimulus  muscle forces or gravity-derived impact loads.  The determination of the most effective source of loading would provide grounds for optimal exercise prescription for bone health.  The aim of this work is to compare the bone response to two known osteogenic loading methods, impact loading exercise versus muscle loading exercise in young women with lower than average bone mass. </summary>
