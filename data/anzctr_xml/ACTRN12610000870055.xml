    <interventions>single arm phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy with intravenous docetaxel (Taxotere), cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) [TPF regimen; T: Taxotere, P: Cisplatin F: 5-FU] and concurrent chemoradiation with weekly intravenous cisplatin in patients with squmous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx
Fifty eligible patients with pathologically proven hypopharyngeal carcinoma are enrolled.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients initially receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m2) on day 1 and intravenous 5-FU (750 mg/m2) continuously on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 3 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all Patients  proceed to chemoradiotherapy.
Chemoradiotherapy: 3 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo 7 weeks concurrent chemoradiation with weekly intravenous ciplatin (30 mg/m2). 
Patients with an incomplete response 4 weeks after completion of treatment proceed to surgery, including pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypopharyngeal carcinoma is a highly malignant and fatal neoplasm and with a poor prognosis. The overall 5-year survival rates for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx has not changed significantly, despite advances in surgical techniques,
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Currently pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy  followed by irradiation is considered to be the standard treatment for most patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx; however, this traetment strategy is associated with significant morbidity.  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation is an alternative choice for these patients. The current clinical trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy by TPF regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin in this regard.</summary>
