    <interventions>Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) on gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, gut hormones, glycaemia, plasma insulin, haemodynamics, absorption, appetite, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, plasma lipids and body weight.

Gastric emptying and small intestinal transit will be measured using scintigraphy
Gut hormones, glycaemia and plasma insulin will be measured by taking blood samples
Plasma lipid and glucose absorption measured using a 13C triolein breath test and 3-O-methyl-glucose (3-OMG) respectively. 
Appetite and gastrointestinal symptoms will be measured using questionnaires.

This is a prospective longitudinal study in which all obese subjects will be studied on 4 occasions: 6-8 weeks before surgery (to avoid the pre-operative dietary restriction period), and at 1, 6 and 12 months after surgery; controls will be studied once. Each study will be 6hours in duration.

A group of 20 age- and gender- matched lean volunteers will serve as the control group, to provide normal data for which the results from the patients will be compared. The healthy subjects will only be studied once, with similar concurrent measurements of gastric emptying, gut hormones, blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate and gastrointestinal symptoms as the surgical subjects.</interventions>

      <outcome>The main aim of the current study is to determine and compare the impact of RYGB and LAGB on gastric emptying (GE) and small intestinal (SI) transit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Physiological studies will be conducted on 4 occasions: 6-8 weeks before surgery (to avoid the pre-operative dietary restriction period), and at 1, 6 and 12 months after surgery. The rate of GE and SI transit will be measured using scintigraphy for the entire 6 hour duration of the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine and compare the impact of RYGB and LAGB on plasma concentration of gut hormones (Cholecystokinin  peptide YY, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1 and insulin)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured by taking blood samples every 15mins for the first 2 hours of the study and every 30mins for the following 2 hours of the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine and compare the impact of RYGB and LAGB on small intestinal glucose and lipid absorption</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three grams of 3-O-methyl-glucose (3-OMG) and 200 microlitres of triolein will be added to the test meal to assess small intestinal absorption of glucose and lipid.  A 13C triolein breath test will be performed to assess small intestinal lipid absorption. End-expiratory breath samples will be collected at baseline and every 30 minutes postprandially for 6 hrs.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine and compare the impact of RYGB and LAGB on blood glucose concentration and the correlation to the rate of gastric emptying</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood glucose concentrations will be immediately determined using a portable blood glucose meter every 15mins for the first 2 hours of the study and every 30mins of the study there after.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine and compare the impact of RYGB and LAGB on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) and the correlation to the rate of gastric emptying.</outcome>
      <timepoint>BP (systolic and diastolic) and HR will also be measured with an automated oscillometric BP monitor (DINAMAP ProCare 100) at 3min intervals for the first 2 hours of the study and every 10mins for the following 2 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life (QOL) will also be recorded in both RYGB and LAGB participants</outcome>
      <timepoint>Gastrointestinal symptoms and QOL will be measured on study days using questionnaires</timepoint>
