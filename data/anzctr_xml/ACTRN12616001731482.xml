  <interventions>
    <interventions>15 sessions of source localised EEG biofeedback, using sLORETA, of the posterior Cingulate Cortex, designed to train up theta and alpha band frequencies, and decrease beta band frequencies. At each session, a 21 electrode EEG cap is worn by the participants, which includes 2 reference ear electrodes and a ground electrode. The 19 remaining channels produce an EEG montage referenced to the average on a laptop computer. The current density of the relevant frequency bands is calculated in real time over a four second interval, and the result displayed to the participant as the height of a vertical bar on the screen. The participant is then asked to try and keep the bar in the top half of the screen as much as possible. Each session has 30 minutes of active training with 1 minute relaxation at 5 mintues intervals thoughout. Participants complete a maximum of three and a minimum of 2 sessions a week, until they have completed 15 sessions.

    <statisticalmethods>We will be recruiting 60 participants into the biofeedback study. With 20 participants in each arm, there will be an 80% power of detecting a statistically significant difference of 11 points on the RBANS immediate memory score. This represents a clinically significant change in the participants memory score. If recruitment was reduced and only 15 participants were recruited into each arm, there is an 80% chance of detecting a difference of 13 on the RBANS immediate memory score. This again would represent a clinically significant difference. Our preliminary data analysis from pilot data indicates that there is an increase in the RBANS immediate memory score of 14 points as a result of biofeedback training. 


We will perform repeated t-tests for each group separately to compare the pre training RBANS scores to the post training RBANS scores. Also, compare the pre training RBANS scores to the 6-week follow up scores.
With in each group separately, use  permutation testing within the sLORETA program to find the significant changes in the post training resting EEG compared to the pre training resting EEG in the current density maps, whole brain connectivity and default mode network connectivity.
Similarly, within each group separately compare the 6 week follow up EEG to the pre training EEG. 
We will then assess for significant trends within each group in the in training data and resting state data, specifically assessing the correlation coefficient of change in current density and change in phase lagged synchronisation of the PCC and parahippocampal gyrus.
The significance of changes in RBANS test scores and cognitive indices between the baseline, post training, and 6 week follow up will be assessed using a mixed effect model.
Using permutation testing within the sLORETA program, compare the change in current density maps, whole brain connectivity and default mode network connectivity from pre training to post testing between groups. The following comparisons were planned, broadband feedback group to sham, narrow band feedback to sham, and broadband feedback to narrowband feedback.
We will use a factor analysis to compare the changes in cognitive score on the RBANS to the changes in the current density in the posterior cingulate cortex and changes in the phase lagged synchronisation of the posterior cingulate cortex to the parahippocampal gyrus.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>EEG biofeedback is a form of brain training where we take recordings of brain activity from the scalp, analyse the data for specific patterns from a specific part of the brain called th Posterior Cingulate Cortex, and display it graphically on a computer screen. Participants then use their own willpower to alter their brain activity. It is a non-invasive and safe procedure to undergo. We are aiming to recruit people with a mild memory deficit to see whether we can change these rhythms, in order to improve their memory function on objective testing.</summary>
