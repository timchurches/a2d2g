  <interventions>
    <interventions>Iso-energetic meals of high protein with high glycaemic index carbohydrates or high protein with low glycaemic index carbohydrates. The meal will be consumed for breakfast after an overnight fast (7pm-7am) and followed by a one week wash out period between study meals. The meals will consist of 30% protein, 20% fats and 50% carbohydrates. The glycaemic index of the low glycemic meal will be approximately 30 and the High glycaemic meal will be approximately 75. The two meals have an energy content of 590 kcal or 2470kJ.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of metabolites through the use of mass spectrometry seperation and detection to chemically characterise in breath and blood. There is no metabolites being specifically analysed as this an discovery study. The aim is to see a difference between healthy and Metabolic Syndrome women. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be taken at baseline and every 30 minutes  for 5 hours post meal at each visit.
Breath samples will be collected by expiring gas for 20 minutes at baseline, 2 hours post meal consumption and 4 hours post meal consumption.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hormone status including sex steroids (estrogen, testosterone, cortisol), metabolic hormones (insulin) and bone markers (C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1), vitamin D, Parathyroid hormone) will be measure to accurately profile metabolic health and response to meals. This a composite secondary outcome as each outcome will be brought together to give a full metabolic profile.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be taken at baseline and every 30 minutes for 5 hours post meal at each visit.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by public notices and advertisements placed in community newpapers. Telephone screening will first identify participants within the required ranges and exclude those likely to be experiencing factors (family history of heart disease and cancer). Participants meeting this screening will be forwarded the Participant Information sheet and consent form. The participants will be invited to a face to face meeting with the researchers to ensure the Participants information sheet has been read and understood. At this meeting, participants will undergo a DEXA to verify inclusion criteria (BMI 18-34). Participants meeting the inclusion requirements will be invited to undertake the study and a date provided for the first breakfast meal. Allocation will be concealed by the use of sealed opaque envelopes. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases remain the major cause of preventable ill health and premature death in developed nations. This burden is shared across both genders, although there is far less known in women than men. Following menopause, women experience a rapid increase in metabolic health risk, yet predictive detection is lacking. Diabetes and cardiovascular (heart) diseases have a metabolic basis, in that metabolic processes are altered. Current research suggests that these metabolic alterations are not present under fasting conditions, but may become evident in response to a stimuli (or challenge). In this study we aim to recruit women and following a meal either rich in rapidly digested (high glycaemic) or slowly digested (low glycaemic) carbohydrates take blood samples. These blood samples will be analysed for metabolites (or chemical signatures) that identify metabolic pathway differences. This research can provide new insights into detecting early risks or metabolic abnormalities that place some women at increased risk of ill-health.</summary>
