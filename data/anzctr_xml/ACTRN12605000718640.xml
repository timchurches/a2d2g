  <interventions>
    <interventions>Additional asthma education intervention by local Health Workers with children and their parents. Children selected to receive the extra education will have additional visits from the health worker for their asthma.  The children selected to receive the intervention (additional asthma education) will receive a personalised child friendly booklet and will have three visits from the health worker for their asthma (about 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the clinical consultation).  All children will be followed up for 12 months (from the day of 1st clinical assessment).</interventions>
    <comparator>No additional education (children will receive the usual information about asthma at the consultation).  The Control group (no additional education) will not receive a personalised child friendly booklet and will not be visited by health workers. All children will be followed up for 12 months (from the day of 1st clinical assessment).</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life: we will use the Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire that has been shown to have good measurement properties and is valid both as an evaluative and a discriminative instrument capturing aspects of asthma most important to the patient and adding additional information to conventional clinical outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary outcomes will be measured at the end of the follow-up period (12 months from the 1st clinically re-accessed) when the child is clinically reassessed.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional severity score : we will use questions related to the functional severity score designed by Rosier et al.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>If the child is on regular medications for asthma, basic knowledge of medications and the delivery technique of the child will be assessed. Basic knowledge on medications of all parents and children aged 11 or more years, will be assessed by a score of 1-5 in each of the 3 categories: (a) name of medications, (b) dose of medications, (c) how drugs work. - medication use - Asthma Action Plan (readily available, can parent interpret?).</outcome>

    <concealment>Children will be randomly selected to be included in the intervention arm of this study.  Informed consent will be obtained by a member of the research team from the carer(s) before enrolment. Children enrolled into the study will be randomised to one of the two groups (no additional intervention or additional education). Each child will be allocated to the next treatment regimen on a list, which will be previously generated, in random order, at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Queensland.  A black sticker will obscure the next treatment group and will only be removed after enrolment.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our specific aim is to examine the effect of health worker education intervention on asthma outcomes using a randomised controlled trial. All children involved in the study will receive routine culturally appropriate intervention and thus the community will benefit in general. Additional asthma education by health workers using education material specially developed for the region can directly and indirectly improve the care of children with asthma ultimately with better asthma outcomes. Assuming the study hypothesis is correct, that children who receive additional asthma education by health worker have better asthma outcomes, the possible beneficial outcomes (educational interventions for improved asthma control) of this study can significantly affect rural communities at the regional and potentially national levels. In addition, a culturally appropriate method to reinforce asthma education could be used in the wider Indigenous community to improve asthma outcomes.</summary>
