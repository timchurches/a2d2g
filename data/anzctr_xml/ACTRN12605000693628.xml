  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, assessed using the Cockroft and Gault forumula </outcome>
      <timepoint>Every three months from baseline until completion of the study or need for renal replacement therapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcomes are
- Rate of serum creatinine increase
- Rate of reciprocal of serum creatinine increase
- Rate of creatinine clearance decrease
- Rate of proteinuria increase
- Rate of albuminuria increase</outcome>
      <timepoint>These rate measures will be determined from blood/urine samples every 3 months from baseline until completion of the study or need for renal replacement therapy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to halving of GFR
Time to doubling of serum creatinine</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The need for renal replacement therapy
The nutritional status, quality of life and functional status</outcome>
      <timepoint>Determined from questionnaires completed every 9 months from baseline until completion of the study or need for renal replacement therapy.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety of long-term administration of atorvastatinÂ® to normalise lipid levels.</outcome>
