  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intravenous magnesium sulphate as a single dose of 20mmol in 100mls normal saline as a slow infusion over 30-40 minutes
In addition to standard care/treatment 3x5mg nebulizations of salbutamol and 1x500mcg nebulization of atrovent and 50mg oral prednisolone.
Further salbutamol 5mg nebulizations as required prn for the next 4 hours ( duration of the trial intervention protocol) After this time patient is either discharged or admitted and treatment is determined by the admitting clinician according to need.

Standard care with nebulizations and oral prednisolone given first then if eligible for the trial then given magnesium suplate or placebo and additional ventolin nebulizations as required for the duration of the intervention (4hours)</interventions>
