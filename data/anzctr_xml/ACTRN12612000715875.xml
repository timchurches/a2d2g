    <interventions>The PREVAIL (Trademark) System involves laparoscopic placement of the PREVAIL Implant (a saline filled silicone implant), into the abdominal cavity with a size, shape, and orientation that inhibits typical stomach expansion that occurs with eating. The PREVAIL implant is secure to the anterior abdominal wall. The PREVAIL Implant is designed to occupy the space the stomach would normally expand into when filled with food.    This is done without any modification to the stomach or surrounding anatomy.  The approximate duration of the surgery is 35-60 minutes. The implant is indicated for long term implantation. The maximum duration the PREVAIL Implant may remain in place is 40 years; however, it can be removed by means of a laparoscopic surgical procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>REALIZE (Registered Trademark) Adjustable Gastric Band-C is a silicone implant laparoscopically placed for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity. The REALIZE Band is implanted using laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgery. The gastric band is wrapped around the upper stomach to form an artificial stoma. This
placement creates a small pouch, or antechamber, in the proximal stomach and a larger pouch
in the distal stomach.  After the gastric band is in place, the patient cannot consume large
quantities of food, and weight reduction ensues. 
The average  surgical procedure time is 75 minutes. The REALIZE Band is intended for long term use but may be removed laparoscopically if necessary.</comparator>
