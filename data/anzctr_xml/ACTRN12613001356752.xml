  <interventions>
    <interventions>A three month lead in period will measure the rate of uptake of contraception in the standard care scenario within a drug and alcohol treatment service.  After 3 months, an integrated contraception clinic will be established and women invited to attend.  All participants will be followed up at 12 months.

This integrated contraceptive clinic will employ a medical officer for one session every second week (0.05FTE). All doctors employed will be specifically trained and accredited in family planning and will offer women participants the range of contraceptive options as per standard care including condoms, pills and LARC methods. If a LARC method is chosen then standard care involves follow-up of patients with implants at 2 weeks and IUDs at 6 weeks post-insertion. Treatment will be delivered according to current clinical practice guidelines developed by family planning organisations across Australia.

All women accessing the drug health service will be initially screened for eligibility by their treating multidisciplinary team who regularly undertake physical, mental and social health assessments on their clients. These clients will be invited to take part and will be referred to the research nurse who will obtain informed consent and conduct baseline interviews.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women who misuse alcohol and other drugs have low rates of contraceptive use and higher rates of pregnancies
(including unplanned pregnancies) compared to the general population. Once pregnant, these women and their
babies experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight and adverse
developmental and social outcomes. Our research aims to explore whether women in drug and alcohol treatment
who do not wish to conceive will have better rates of contraceptive use when contraceptive services are integrated into drug treatment clinics, compared to standard care where women are referred to primary health care services for their contraceptive needs. With this model we seek to increase use of all contraceptive methods but particularly methods that do not require daily adherence such as injections, implants and intrauterine devices that are reversible but extremely reliable. These methods are known collectively as the long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods.

A pilot integrated contraceptive medical service will be introduced within a drug and alcohol clinical setting. We
propose to evaluate this pilot, to determine whether integrated care is feasible, and if it is more effective in
increasing the use of contraceptive methods and reducing unplanned pregnancy than the standard of care.</summary>
