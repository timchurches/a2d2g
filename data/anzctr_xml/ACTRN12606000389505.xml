  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two tensioning methods for ACL reconstruction will be used: 1.Manual Tensioning (control group-semitendinosus/gracillis grafts) 2.Tensioning with a Graft Tensioner (intervention group-a tensioning device). Both groups will follow the same postoperative protocols.

Estimated time for procedure 70 mins

Surgical protocol
Tensioning Device Intervention Group:
The graft is fixed to the tensioning device via suture tying
The grafts are tensioned to 60 N for Semitendinosis and 40 Nfor gracillis
The knee is cycled 15 times through full range of motion
The tension is checked and adjusted so that 50 N remain on the semitendinosis graft and 30 N on the gracillis graft
The tibial screw is then fixed in situ with the tension maintained
The femoral fixation will be standardised 

Post Operative Management
Both groups will be reconstructed using the semitendinosus/gracilis graft. The same postoperative protocols will be adhered to which involves an accelerated rehabilitation approach. The aim of this protocol is normal gait no aids by 2 weeks, normal range of movement, and minimal swelling within 6 weeks, and the aim of returning to sport in 6-9 months. Patients will be assessed preoperatively, and at 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months post operatively using the measures outlined above.</interventions>
    <comparator>
Manually Tensioned Control Group:
Tension and fixation will follow the accepted standard practice of graft fixation
The sutures on the end of the hamstring grafts will be held by the surgeon with force applied whilst the knee is cycled 15 times through a full range of motion
The tibial screw will be fixed in situ with the manually applied tension
The femoral fixation is standardised</comparator>
