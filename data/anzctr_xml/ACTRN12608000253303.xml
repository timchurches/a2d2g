    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>On notification of a participant, the Clinical Trials Pharmacist at the Central Registry will allocate the next code available according to the supplied schedule and will advise the particular site’s Clinical Trials Pharmacist which kit (sertraline or placebo) is to be supplied to the participant. The participant ID, allocation code, dates of request, preparation, and dispensing will be recorded in a log maintained by the Central Registry and supplied to the central registry on completion of each randomisation. Each bottle containing capsules which is supplied to the participant will be labeled ‘sertraline / placebo study 25-100mg daily’</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation schedules have been developed by an organisation not involved in this study. Treatment for each participant will be allocated according to a block randomisation schedule, held by the Central Registry Clinical trials Pharmacist, in a 1:1 ratio for each treatment arm. Block randomisation will ensure even allocation to each code.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breathlessness continues to be a major clinical problem for many people with advanced progressive illnesses such as cancer, end-stage cardiac failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, even when they are receiving the best treatment for the underlying disease. Although there are some interventions that may offer benefit (oxygen therapy, sustained release low dose morphine), there is still a need for a wider range .of interventions to meet the needs of people with refractory breathlessness.

Study design: This is a phase II (pilot) double blind randomised controlled multi-site study of sertraline (titrated to a mid-range dose) or placebo. It will run for 28 days and draw participants from across the services participating. 

Objectives: To establish feasibility of the study design and inform adequate power calculations for a definitive study of this intervention in the same sites in mid 2008.</summary>
