  <interventions>
    <interventions>The sample will be divided in two groups by one author that does not participate directly neither in the assessment nor in statistic analyses. The groups will be two: the Ganoderma lucidum (GL) group and the Ceratonia siliqua (CS) group. Patients will know that there are two groups and they can be in any of them, but they will not know the group they belong. Given that, the current trial is a double-blind study, neither the patient nor the researcher will know the group the patient has been assigned.

The GL group will take the micromilled GL. The dose will consist on 6g daily for six weeks. The intakes will consist of 3 grams of GL for two times a day, one intake during or immediately after breakfast and one during or immediately after dinner. The administration will be dissolved in warm water and orally ingested. The GL will be provided by the company MundoReishi and will be analyzed by the Chair of Mycology of the University of Valladolid, Spain.

The CS group will receive a daily dose of CS flour, which consist on 6g of powder coming from Carob tree (CS). This substance looks very similar to the micromilled GL. The administration will be exactly the same than the other group.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Ganoderma lucidum will be compared to Ceratonia siliqua. Both substances look very similar. The administration will be exactly the same for both groups. Ceratonia siliqua could reduce cholesterol and glucose levels and improve the intestinal function. An antidepressant activity mediated by dopamine and noradrenaline has also been found in mice. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through four different questionnaires:
a) 15D: It is a generic instrument for measuring HRQoL among adults. It comprises 15 dimensions: mobility, vision, hearing, breathing, sleeping, eating, speech, elimination, usual activities, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress, vitality, and sexual activity. The score can be represented as a single utility score, which ranges from 0 (death) to 1 (full health). This score can be used to perform cost-effectiveness analysis. 
b) SF-12v2: It is a generic instrument for assessing HRQoL covering physical and mental aspects of health. It is an abbreviated version of the SF-36, which consist in 12 items. It comprises 6 dimensions: physical functioning, role limitations, social functioning, pain, mental health, and vitality. A single utility score, specific of the Spanish population, can be calculated for cost-effectiveness analysis from this questionnaire.
c) EQ-5D-5L: It is a generic utility-based instrument for assessing HRQoL. It comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression; and five levels of severity in each dimension. The current health state of the patients (the health state felt the day of the evaluation) is assessed through a Visual Aanalogue Sscale (VAS) from 0 (worst imaginable health status) to 100 (best imaginable health status).
d)Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3): It is a generic utility-based instrument for assessing HRQoL. It comprises 8 dimensions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional capacity:
It is a composite primary outcome. In order to perform a complete evaluation of the participantsÂ´ functional capacity, the battery from Exercise Looks After You (ELAY) study was selected and other tests from different batteries were added. As result, the following fitness outcomes will be measured:
- Upper body strength: Bi-handgrip strength will be measured by using a grip-strength dynamometer (TKK 5401 Model).
- Upper body flexibility: It will be assessed using the back scratch test. 
- Lower body flexibility: It will be measured using the Chair Sit-and-Reach. 
- Balance and agility: dynamic balance will be measured using the three meter version of the Timed Up-and-Go test (TUG).
- The 30-Second Chair Stand Test.
- Aerobic endurance: It will be measured by using the Six Minutes Walk Test.
- Upper body strength: It will be assessed using the Arm Curl Test. 
- Velocity: The time needed to walk 10m is recorded in the modificated Brisk Walking Test as a measure of velocity.
- Balance: It will be measured using Biodex Balance System. This device measures, in degrees, the tilt about each axis during static and dynamic conditions and calculates a mediolateral stability index, an anteroposterior stability index, and an overall stability index.
- Trunk endurance: It will be assessed by using the method proposed by Ito, Shirado.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain:
Pain perception will be evaluated by a previous trained researcher. It will be measured through the digital palpation of the 18 specified tender points with a pressure of 4kg/cm2 made by an stimulator like Ten FDX (Wagner Instrument). Patients must also fill out a VAS twice a day, where they write the pain that they feel at this moment (when they wake up and when they go to bed).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome.

Impact of fibromyalgia:

Two questionnaires will be utilized to assess the impact of FM. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is a 10-item, self-administered instrument that covers three domains: function, overall impact and symptoms. A consensus version for Spanish population was developed by Esteve-Vives, Rivera Redondo. 

The FIQ was revised in 2009, originating a new questionnaire called Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R). It has the same three domains but differs in some points. The dimension function was reduced from 10 to 9 items and modified. The overall impact domain was completely revised to better reflect the overall impact on functional ability and on the perception of reduced function. Four additional items were added to the dimension symptoms: tenderness, memory, balance and environmental sensitivity. The validation of the Spanish version of FIQ-R was developed by Salgueiro, Garcia-Leiva.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Covariables:
- Sociodemographic variables: gender, age, education level, profession, income level, religiosity, postal code and familiar situation.
- Other diseases.
- Current treatment and therapies, years since diagnosis of FM and years since the first symptoms.
- Current pain at today.

All these variables will be assessed by direct interview.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep quality:
The Spanish version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be utilized to assess the sleep quality and the sleep disorders. Its reliability and validity for Spanish Fibromyalgic patients was developed by Hita-Contreras, Martinez-Lopez.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression:
Depressive symptoms are frequent in Fibromyalgia patients. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) has been used on Fibromyalgia research because it is less focus on somatic symptoms than other depression questionnaires and could therefore be a more accurate assessment of depressive symptoms in Fibromyalgia patients independently of their health complaints.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body composition and anthropometric measures:
After measurement of the height, different variables of body composition will be evaluated by using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (Tanita BC-418) that allows segmental body analysis. This devices measure the weight, body mass index, fat mass, muscle mass, total body water and free fat mass. The waist-to-hip ratio will be assessed too.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Happiness:
It will be assessed by using the General Happiness Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). In Spanish adults, the SWLS was validated by Vazquez, Duque.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood parameters: Blood pressure and blood lipids and glucose.

The systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be assessed by a professional nurse in the health care center. Blood main lipids and glucose will be assessed by direct blood analysis on the healthcare center before the treatment starts and six weeks after the treatment. Reagent strips will be used if the analyses cannot be done by the health care system.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Healthy habits:
The healthy habits questionnaire will be used to assess the healthy habits of the participants. This instrument comprises several dimensions. Due to the aims of the current study, only the dimensions life habits and physical exercise will be considered. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Drug treatment costs:
A list of the drugs that they are taking will be asked to the participants. The treatment costs of each participant will be calculated in order to perform cost-effectiveness analysis. In addition, participants will be asked for another kind of therapies, such as physiotherapy, acupuncture, psychological therapy or massages.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the treatment, six weeks after the intervention started, and three weeks after the end of the intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic pain and other symptoms like fatigue, reduced health-related quality of life, poor physical functioning, or disrupted sleep. 
Ganoderma lucidum has been reported to be safety in humans for reducing pain, fatigue, improves the sleep quality and the health-related quality of life in different populations. Ceratonia siliqua is able to reduce blood cholesterol and glucose, while improving intestinal function and have an antidepressant activity. The present study aims to evaluate the safety and cost-effectiveness of both natural treatments in patients suffering from fibromyalgia.
Methods/design: A double-blind randomized control trial will be developed. A total of 66 patients with fibromyalgia will participate in the study and will be randomly assigned to the Ganoderma lucidum (GL) group or the Ceratonia siliqua (CS) group. The first group will take 6g daily of Ganoderma lucidum during 6 weeks, while the second group will take the same dose of Ceratonia siliqua flour. A three-week follow-up will be carried out after the end of the treatment. 
Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study designed to assess the safety and cost-effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum and Ceratonia siliqua  in patients with FM. If our hypothesis were proved, the results of this study would provide a safe, natural and relatively low-cost alternative to treat the FM symptoms.
