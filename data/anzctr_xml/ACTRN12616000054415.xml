  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: In addition to the control treatment, people allocated to intervention will also receive verbal exercise counselling and support from a physiotherapist over the phone, supplemented by written information about arthritis and the importance of exercise, exercise instructions, links to video clips and/or referral to community exercise services/facilities. Resources will be provided in hard copy via the post.  Access to exercise video clips and exercise instructions will be provided via the internet, using the study website. Five to ten telephone calls (45 min duration for initial call, 20 min duration per subsequent call) will be provided over 6 months. Calls will occur in weeks 2, 4, 8, 13 &amp; 21 of the 26 week intervention period. The physiotherapist will use as few or as many of the five additional phone calls as they deem appropriate per individual participant and will schedule these at a mutually agreed upon time. Together with the participant, the physiotherapist will devise a specific strengthening program, as well as a plan to increase general physical activity levels. The content and intensity of the strengthening exercise program will be determined by the physiotherapist in discussion with the participant. In subsequent calls, the physiotherapist will monitor progress, adjust the program and goals and provide support by increasing participant knowledge and understanding, motivation, confidence and self-efficacy for exercise. Physiotherapist will be trained in, and will use best practice principles for supporting behaviour change, when delivering the intervention. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by a) recording the number of telephone calls the participant participated in; b) asking participants to self-rate their overall adherence to both the strengthening exercises and the general physical activity plan at 6 and 12 month follow up and; c) asking participants to record their use of community exercise facilities/services. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control: the current nurse-led Musculoskeletal Help Line service administered by Arthritis &amp; Osteoporosis Victoria will be provided. Participants will receive verbal information, written materials and/or referral to consumer and/or organisational websites. Participants may receive one or more phone calls, or follow-up via email, according to patient needs. Information is provided from evidence-based sources internally approved by Arthritis &amp; Osteoporosis Victoria. </comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Primary endpoints are changes in pain and function at 6 months. There may be clustering effects due to people treated by the same therapist. We assume the eight therapists will treat the same number of people and an intra-cluster correlation of 0.05. We also assume a between-participant SD of 2.2 for pain and 11.6 for function, and a baseline to 6-month correlation in scores of 0.29 and 0.51 respectively. We wish to detect an effect size of 0.5. These assumptions, together with ANCOVA adjusted for baseline scores and clustering, require 70 people per arm for pain and 54 per arm for function with 80% power. Allowing for 20% attrition, we will recruit 175 people. Comparative analyses between groups will use intention-to-treat. Multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data. For continuous data, differences in mean change will be compared with linear regression random effects modelling adjusted for baseline and physiotherapist clustering. For binary and ordinal outcomes, random effects logistic and proportional odds models will be used, respectively. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of pain and disability in Australia and the knee is commonly affected. OA is the 11th highest contributor to global disability and in 2008-9 was the eighth most-managed problem by Australian GPs. Exercise is a core component of best-practice management, yet access by Australians to appropriately-qualified health care providers for exercise prescription and advice is very limited. Furthermore, uptake of exercise by people with knee OA in Australia is grossly inadequate, and long-term adherence is poor. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate the effectiveness of telephone-delivered exercise advice and behaviour change support by physiotherapists for improving knee pain and function in people with knee OA. The service will be embedded into the Musculoskeletal Help Line  that is provided by Arthritis &amp; Osteoporosis Victoria.
