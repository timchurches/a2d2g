  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthma is a common condition and severe and difficult-to-treat in up to 5-20% of patients. Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a disorder characterised by inappropriate closure of the vocal cords during respiration. Numerous asthmatics have VCD co-existing with asthma. Recent studies have detected VCD in as many as 50% of cases with Difficult-To-Treat-Asthma. Botulinium Toxin has been shown to effectively reverse the detrimental effects of VCD.
This study looks at two hypotheses:
1. That in patients with VCD and DTTA, botulinium toxin treatment reduces VCD compared with saline control;
2. That in patients with VCD and DTTA, botulinium toxin treatment is associated with improvement in symptom-based, but not physiological, measures of asthma control, compared with saline control.</summary>
