  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hydromorphone is an opiate drug quite similar to morphine and is widely used to treat pain after surgery. A recent idea is to use a patient controlled technique which allows the patient to self-administer the drug as they need using a nasal spray. Previous studies show the absorption of hydromorphone through the nasal mucosa is rapid within a few minutes and that pain relief is very effective. The advantage of this route of delivery is that it avoids the use of intravenous drips. In this study we will be comparing the intravenous route of administration with what happens after a similar dose of hydromorphone is given intranasally. This will help to detemine the most appropriate way to prepare the nasal drug and the best dose to give with each spray. Postoperatively patients who are using patient controlled intravenous analgesia will be given a dose of hydromorphone for pain before they are allowed to start using their pump.  All patients will get an intravenous and an intransal dose 12-24 hours apart. The order of which comes first will be randomly allocated. Blood wil be taken from a previously sited cannula at intervals before and after doses to measure levels. At all times good pain relief is guaranteed by use of the fentanyl PCIA.</summary>
