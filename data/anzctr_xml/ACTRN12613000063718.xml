    <interventions>Arm A: Everolimus 10mg Daily, BNC105P 16mg/m2 infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21 day cycle (combination arm). Drugs used on Arm A are given simultaneously: everolimus by oral administration daily, BNC105P by IV administration (on days 1 and 8 of a repeating 21 day cycle).

Arm B:  This is a sequential Arm. Arm B subjects are administered Everolimus at 10mg per day by oral administration until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed (then Everolimus is ceased). Once this occurs, patients have the option to enter BNC105P only portion of Arm B. BNC105P given by IV administration at 16mg/m2 (on days 1 and 8 of a repeating 21 day cycle).</interventions>
    <comparator>Everolimus alone. Patients receive Everolimus alone on treatment arm B at 10mg orally on a daily basis. This continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. At this time, Everolimus is ceased. At this point, patients have the optin to enter the sequential portion of Arm B which is BNC105P alone, given at 16mg/m2 via IV on day 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in 6-month progression free survival (PFS) with the addition of BNC105P to everolimus.
Recist defined tumor assessment.  Measurement from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression is met (or death occurs), taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  The time to progression, in patients with documented disease progression at their first disease evaluation, will be considered the time between initiation of therapy and the date of first documentation of disease progression.  The percentage of patients whom have achieved Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 months will be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 9 weeks for 2 years from registration for protocol therapy, every 6 months for years 3 - 5 for up to a
maximum of 5 years from registration to protocol therapy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine PFS with BNC105P alone in patients progressing on everolimus.

      <outcome>To determine the overall survival, up to a maximum of 5 years from registration for protocol therapy.
The overall survival time for each patient is the number of days from the day of first treatment to the earlier of (1) death (from any cause) and (2) the last date of patient contact. If the survival time does not correspond to the patients death then it is treated as censored.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine response rate with combination therapy compared to everolimus alone.
The objective response rate is the proportion of all patients with confirmed Partial Response or Complete Response according to RECIST, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment).</outcome>

Six block randomization lists were created by a statistician, one for each combination of the stratification factors. Once the stratification factors are entered in the EDC system, the next arm assignment is selected by the software. The process is completely random within the block as the software always selects the next available arm assignment from the appropriate list. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bionomics has discovered and is developing BNC105P as a Vascular Disrupting Agent (VDA). VDAs are a
novel class of agents that target endothelial cells and pericytes of the already established tumor vasculature,
leading to an occlusion (blockage) of tumor blood vessels, thus starving tumors of oxygen and other required
nutrients. The disruption of blood vessels that feed tumors represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating
cancer. In addition, BNC105P has a direct anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells.
BNC105P is the phosphate ester of BNC105, a small molecule Tubulin Polymerization Inhibitor (TPI), and which has displayed a strong efficacy in renal, breast and colon tumor models and other tumor types.
Clinical studies undertaken to date have shown BNC105P, administered as a 10 minute IV infusion on Days 1 and 8 of a repeating 21-day cycle, is tolerated at 16 mg/m2.
Upon exposure to hypoxia (a low oxygen environment induced by disruption of tumor blood flow), renal tumors have been shown to upregulate an intracellular signaling pathway termed the mTOR pathway, as a survival response.
The combined blockade of tumor blood flow (via the use of BNC105P) and the blockade of the mTOR pathway (via the targeted mTOR inhibitor Everolimus) is the underlying rationale behind this trial. This dual blockade may result in improved clinical outcomes for RCC patients who have progressed on other available agents.
The randomized phase II component of this trial will compare everolimus alone (a current standard of care) with everolimus plus BNC105P. Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 months is the primary endpoint. The study has been powered to detect an improvement in 6-month PFS from 36% for everolimus to 60% with the combination group. Additionally, patients progressing on everolimus alone will be offered BNC105P (a
sequential approach), which will provide an opportunity to evaluate the activity of monotherapy with BNC105P alone.</summary>
