  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Midostaurin (PKC412)

Experimental: Midostaurin (PKC412) - Midostaurin was administered at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (bid) in continuous cycles of 28 days until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal due to any cause, whichever occurred first.


Treatment: drugs: Midostaurin (PKC412)
Midostaurin was provided as 25 mg soft gelatin capsules for oral administration.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate (ORR) - The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who classified as confirmed responders (major response (MR) or partial response (PR). A major responder had complete resolution of at least one C-Finding and no progression in other C-Findings. A partial responder showed a measurable improvement in one or more C-Finding(s) without confirmed progression in other C-Findings. A C-Finding was a Clinical Finding, which was considered by the investigator and corroborated by the Study Steering Committee (SSC) Chairperson or designee, attributable to the mast cell disease component and not the associated hematological clonal non-mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD) component or any other cause.</outcome>
