  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study compares the effects of two different levels of incubator humidity (70%, and 80% relative humidity) on temperature control and fluid and electrolyte balance in preterm infants born at 28 weeks gestation and less.
The duration of the study is 14 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>80% incubator humidity
we start nursing the baby in humidity once the baby is transferred into the isolette.
The baby will be nursed in 80% incubator humidity for seven days. From day 8 onwards, we'll start to decrease the incubator humidity by 10% each day. When the humidity is down to 40% and the baby's body temperature is stable, we'll cease the incubator humidity. We'll be collecting data on the baby's body temperature for 14 days, so the total duration of the study is 14 days.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is to compare the temperature variability in preterm infants nursed in 70% or 80% incubator humidity. This will be reflected by the number of documented low body temperature (&lt;36 degree C) on each day for the first seven days after birth </outcome>
      <timepoint>On each day for the first seven days after birth</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) To compare the degree of evaporative water loss in preterm infants nursed in 70% or 80% incubator humidity in terms of daily fluid requirement, variability from normal serum sodium ranges, and skin integrity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily for the first 14 days after birth.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) To compare the incidences of positive bacterial cultures from incubators in 70% and 80% incubator humidity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the start of the study and on day 14.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3) To compare the difference of visibility of the infant nursed in the two different levels of incubator humidity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily for the first seven days after birth.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the protocol is to examine the effects of two levels of commonly used ambient humidity (70% and 80%) in the incubator on
1) body temperature control
2) fluid and electrolyte balance
3)bacterial colonisation and visibility as a   
   result of water condensation
 in preterm infants born at 28 weeks gestation and less. This information will be used as a basis for a unit protocol for nursing preterm infants in humidity. 
We hypothesize that in the first two weeks of life after birth, there is no significant difference in body temperature stability when nursing preterm infants in either 70% or 80% incubator humidity.</summary>
