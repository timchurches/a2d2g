    <studytitle>The effect of mechanical vibration (Acceledent) on root resorption and the rate of tooth movement after application of orthodontic force. A micro-CT study.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Patients with crowded malocclusion requiring extraction of upper first premolar teeth as part of their orthodontic treatment will have Acceledent used on one side to compare the amount of root resorption and rate of tooth movement caused by orthodontic appliances.</scientifictitle>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients requiring upper 1st premolar extractions will have partial braces placed on the upper teeth to produce a buccally directed force on the upper 1st premolar teeth for 4 weeks. Acceledent is a new extraoral device that emits a low vibration force onto an attached mouthpiece. The mouth piece will be cut into half so that when placed in the mouth, only 1 side will feel the vibration force. During these 4 weeks, the patients will use Acceledent on one side only (randomly assigned) for 10 mins per day. After 4 weeks the upper first premolar teeth will be extracted and analysed with Micro CT for root resorption craters.
After extraction of the upper premolar teeth, full braces will be placed on the patient's teeth as part of their normal orthodontic treatment. Acceledent will continue to be used on one side to measure the rate of tooth movement with clinical measurements every 14 days and impression moulds every 28 days. The estimated measurement time for the rate of tooth movement is 3 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>All patients acted as their own controls. Control treatment will be the side which did not use Acceledent</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The sample will be analysed using a microcomputed tomography scan x-ray system, namely the SkyScan 1172 desktop x-ray micro-tomograph (SkyScan, Aartselaar, Belgium) . It enables the researcher to reconstruct the teeth in 3 dimensions as well as to reproduce slices.  Once the resorption craters have been reconstructed, the internal parameters of the craters can be analysed and measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Records will be taken at the start of treatment at T-0. Patients will be seen every week for 4 weeks.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose of this study is to test whether the Acceledent device will decrease the amount of tooth root resorption caused by light buccally directed forces from partial braces for 4 weeks. The Acceledent's purpose is to accelerate tooth movement. The 2nd phase of the study will determine if space closure after tooth extraction is faster than if no Acceledent is used.</summary>
