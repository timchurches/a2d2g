  <interventions>
    <interventions>Imiquimod cream 5% applied 7 times per week (daily at night) for 6 weeks for superficial BCC and 12 weeks for nodular BCC. A thin layer was to be applied to the BCC and 1cm surrounding it, gently rubbed in until the cream vanished, and washed off the following morning.</interventions>
    <comparator>The surgery for the basal cell skin cancers in this study was scalpel excisional surgery with 4 mm margins performed under local anaesthetic . Primary closure was achieved with sutures. The average duration of the surgery was approximately 15 minutes.
Only if surgery fails (eg histology shows that the 4mm margins have missed some of the BCC), or at some stage during the study the BCC appears to have recurred (confirmed first with a biopsy) will surgery be repeated.</comparator>

      <timepoint>Time to recurrence is in time intervals as assessments are only made at intervals (up to 1 year, 1-2years, 2-3years, 3-5 years, &gt;5years); up to 3 years by clinical assessment, 3-5 years from patient notes (hospital, GP and pathology).</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants were invited by the hospital dermatologist to see a study research nurse. The nurse explained the study, and checked eligibility for those interested. Consent was obtained at a separate visit .
The allocation is obtained at the baseline visit, using a central telephone randomisation service run by independent staff at the Trent RDSU. This ensured concealment of allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A pre-prepared randomisation schedule was generated by computer at the Trent Research and Development Support Unit (Trent RDSU).  Randomisation was stratified according to lesion type (nodular or superficial, defined clinically) and by centre, thus minimising the differences in the most important predictor baseline variables. There was no attempt to equalise numbers of nodular and superficial BCCs randomised.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an independent study (a randomised controlled trial) of imiquimod cream versus surgery in low risk basal cell carcinoma (or "rodent ulcer"). Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest cancer in humans.  BCCs are slow growing and rarely spread to other sites of the body, but can be unsightly and can bleed. They are usually treated by minor surgery (current gold standard) or freezing with liquid nitrogen, but dermatologists and plastic surgeons are constantly on the look-out for other simple but effective treatments. Imiquimod 5% cream stimulates the body's immune system and has been used successfully to treat genital warts, and more recently BCCs.  
This is a large definitive study comparing imiquimod to local surgery.  Studies previous to this study were smaller, often looking just at initial success rather than whether the BCC returns in the long term.  This study aims to show how effective imiquimod is in terms of percentage cure of basal cell carcinoma, three years after treatment, when compared with conventional surgery, and whether the cosmetic result of a cream that patients can apply themselves is any better than surgery.</summary>
