  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Leuprorelin Acetate
Treatment: drugs - Zoledronic Acid
Treatment: other - Conventional external beam therapy

Active Comparator: A - LH-RH analogue for 5 months prior to and during first month of radiation treatment (total 6 mths)

Active Comparator: B - LH-RH analogue for 5 months prior to and during first month of radiation treatment (total 6 months) + bisphosphonate therapy.

Experimental: C - LH-RH analogue as for arm A, but continued for further 12 months (total 18 months)

Experimental: D - LH-RH analogue as for arm A, but continued for further 12 months (total 18 months) + bisphosphonate therapy.


Treatment: drugs: Leuprorelin Acetate
LH-RH analogue (LH-RHa) (Leuprorelin acetate 22.5 mg) will be delivered as a depot injection every 3 months. This will be administered as an intramuscular injection (IMI).

Treatment: drugs: Zoledronic Acid
Zoledronic acid 4 mg will be delivered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes once every 3 months for 18 months, in patients randomised to bisphosphonate therapy.

Treatment: other: Conventional external beam therapy
The prescribed dose will be 66 Gy in 33 fractions of 2 Gy to the ICRU 50 point utilising a minimum of three fields with &gt;= 6 MV photons.

    <summary>The principal objectives of the RADAR trial is to address the hypotheses; 1) that 18 months
      androgen deprivation in conjunction with radiotherapy is superior to 6 months androgen
      deprivation prior to and during radiotherapy; 2) that 18 months Bisphosphonate therapy will
      prevent bone loss caused by androgen deprivation therapy and further reduce relapse risk by
      impeding the development of bony metastases.</summary>
