  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a retrospective study performed on all the consecutive cases of posttraumatic endophthalmitis that were treated in the same department over a 5-year period. 
Local treatment consisted in surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) associated with intraocular antibiotics (vancomycin 1 mg, ceftazidime 2.2.mg)and steroids (dexamethasone 0.4 mg). Each of the above mentioned drugs was administered just once, at the end of the surgery.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Program SPSS version 20.0.0. There were calculated frequencies for the following parameters: age, gender, the association or not of an intraocular foreign body, wound anatomy, the associated ocular lesions (direct traumatic cataract, retinal detachment, ocular tissue prolapse), initial visual acuity, culture (positive or negative), the interval between the trauma and the treatment initiation, initial visual acuity. The parameter according to which the outcome was defined was the final visual acuity: less than 0.1 or greater than or equal to 0.1. In every case, we considered as final, the visual acuity tested at the last visit. Statistical analyses were used to compare treatment outcomes among the study groups. Chi-square test was used to calculate the association between the categorical variables. Value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In case of unequal data distribution, the p value was given by Fishers Exact test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intraocular infections following trauma are severe conditions touching mainly young adults and can lead to permanent visual loss. The primary outcome of this study is to outline the importance of prompt intervention in this condition, by surgery and intraocular injections of antibiotics and steroids. The study presents our experience over a 5 year period. The outcomes are evaluated according to the vision, 6 months after treatment. The gravity of the lesions produced by trauma (e.g. retinal detachment) and the delayed intervention (more than 72 houts after trauma) were associated with worse outcomes.</summary>
