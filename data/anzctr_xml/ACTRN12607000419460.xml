  <interventions>
    <interventions>Movement strategies - Participants randomized to the movement strategy training group learned how to use cognitive strategies to enhance walking, turning, standing up from a chair and obstacle negotiation as detailed in the protocol by Morris ME (2000) Physical Therapy 80(6); 578-97.  A maximum of 16 sessions of up to 45 minutes of therapy is provided over a two week inpatient period (ie. 1 x 45 minutes session daily for 2 weeks).</interventions>
    <comparator>Exercises - Conventional musculoskeletal exercises aimed to improve strength, range of movement, posture, general fitness and ADL follows Schenkmans protocol as detailed in Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 1998; 46:1207-1216.  A maximum of 16 sessions of up to 45 minutes of therapy is provided over a two week inpatient period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of the current investigation were to assess the outcomes of an intensive burst of in-patient rehabilitation in ambulant people with mild-moderate PD and to compare the effects of movement strategy training and exercise therapy. It was hypothesised that movement strategy training would reduce disability to a greater extent than exercise therapy.</summary>
