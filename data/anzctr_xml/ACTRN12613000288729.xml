  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the efficacy of substituting the drug, alemtuzumab, for another drug known as ATGAM, as part of combination therapy for steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease in post haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation patients. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male or female aged between 18-69 years who has been diagnosed with grade II or higher steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-GVHD) following haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT). Trial details All participants in this trial will be given the drug alemtuzumab for 5 consecutive days. Alemtuzumab will be administered intravenously (into the vein) over a period of 2 hours each day. All patients will also receive standard premedication (including paracetamol, phenergan and hydrocortisone) 30 minutes prior to alemtuzumab. Participants will be assessed at 6 months in order to evaluate response to treatment and survival.</summary>
