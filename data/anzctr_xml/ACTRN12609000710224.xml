    <interventions>Triple P Positive Parenting Intervention: Following Sanders (1999), parents randomly assigned to this condition will be taught 17 core child management strategies. Ten of the strategies are designed to promote childrens competence and development (i.e., quality time; talking with children; physical affection; praise; attention; engaging activities; setting a good example; Ask, Say Do; incidental teaching; and behaviour charts), and 7 strategies are designed to help parents manage misbehaviour (i.e., setting rules; directed discussion; planned ignoring; clear, direct instructions; logical consequences; quiet time; and time out). Parents will further be taught a six-step planned activities routine to enhance the generalization and maintenance of parenting skills (i.e., plan ahead, decide on rules, select engaging activities, decide on rewards and consequences, and hold a follow-up discussion with child). Each family will receive *Every Parent (Sanders, 1992) and a workbook, *Every Parents Family Workbook (Markie-Dadds, Sanders, &amp; Turner, 2001). Parents will also receive active skills training and support from a trained practitioner (Liz Westrupp) as described by Sanders and Dadds (1993). Active skills training methods will include modelling, role-plays, feedback, and the use of specific homework tasks. On average, parents will attend approximately 10 individual appointments with the practitioner and complete approximately 10 hours of intervention in this condition.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Diabetes Care: Parents randomly assigned to this condition will receive routine clinical care from the diabetes team over the 15-month study period. As well as medical management, this includes support from a dedicated dietician, a diabetes nurse educator and a social worker</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2; Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 1992, parent-report version). The BASC-2 is a multi-method, multi-dimensional system that evaluates the behaviour of children aged 4-18 years. The present study will use only the Parent Rating Scale (PRS) of the BASC-2 (to be completed by the participant?s parent), which provides a comprehensive measure of a child?s adaptive and problem behaviours in community and home settings. The PRS contains descriptors of behaviours that the respondent rates on a four-point scale of frequency, ranging from never to almost always. The PRS assesses clinical problems in the broad domains of Externalising Problems and Internalising Problems and it also measures Adaptive Skills. A T-score of &gt; 60 on either of the scales indicates the presence of substantial problems. The BASC-2 has excellent norms based on a large sample of the general population, representative with regard to gender, race, ethnicity, clinical classification and parent education. Internal consistency reliabilities are in the middle 0.80s to low 0.90s for all composite scores. Evidence of validity is supported via factor structure analyses and comparison to the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist, showing strong, significant correlations with relevant composites (Reynolds &amp; Kamphous, 1992).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measure of Glycemic Control. Blood sampling to assess glycaemic control (HbA1c levels) routinely occurs at each three-monthly diabetic clinic visit. With consent, this information will be accessed from the diabetes unit database. In addition, an average of each child?s Total Daily Insulin Dose will be calculated for the treatment period (units of insulin per kilo of body weight, per day). No additional blood samples are required for study purposes.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.Children with diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes (of a minimum of 6 months duration) who attend the Diabetes Clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne (RCH). 

2.Children with clinically significant emotional problems and/or behaviour problems (i.e., Internalising T Score &gt; 60 or Externalising T score &gt; 60) will be eligible to participate and will be allocated on the basis of their Externalising or Internalising behaviour problem T score. 

3.Children without clinically significant emotional or behaviour problems (i.e., (i.e., Internalising T Score &lt; 60 + Externalising T score &lt; 60).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1.Children whose mothers exhibit significant psychopathology (cut-off score of 12 for depression; Nieuwenhuijsen, de Boer, Verbeek, Blonk, &amp; van Dijk, 2003) will not be invited to participate further in this study as previous research has shown that the Triple P intervention is less effective when mothers have untreated mental health problems. Children and mothers excluded on this basis will be offered assistance getting appropriate clinical services should they want them. 

2.Children who commence or significantly modify psychotropic medication regimes (which may affect behaviour) during the research and follow-up periods. These children will continue to receive the Triple P Intervention or Standard Diabetes Care (SDC) but their data will not be included in analysis.

3.Children with a developmental disorder (such as Autism Spectrum Disorder) and children currently attending at a Special Education School or who qualify for Integration Aide Assistance. These children represent a special population for which individually tailored programs are required. 

4.Other exclusion criteria for the study include the following: 
?non-English speaking families; 
?children with complex medical disease in addition to Type 1 diabetes (e.g., cystic fibrosis, cancer, Traumatic Brain Injury).</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>A system of random numbers was used to generate a slip of paper with the following: assigned study ID number, stratum and study condition. Each slip was then sealed within an envelope. A total of 80 envelopes were divided into two sets of 40, with the stratum printed on the outside: (1) clinical behaviour problems present; (2) no behaviour problems. For every new participant recruited, the appropriate envelope was opened according to pre-intervention BASC-2 results, and the information on the slip contained within the envelope allocated the participant to the intervention or comparision group.</concealment>
    <sequence>The sample will be divided into children with clinically significant behaviour or emotional problems (BASC-2 externalising/ internalising T score &gt; 60) and a second group of children with no/few behaviour problems (BASC-2 externalising/ internalising T score &lt;60). Participants will be randomly allocated (using a system of random numbers) into a treatment or a comparison arm of the study, this randomisation will be stratified by behavioural problems or not. Comparison participants in each group will receive Standard Diabetes Care (SDC) through the Diabetes unit. Treatment participants within each group will receive the Triple P Intervention in addition to SDC.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to test the usefulness of a parenting program in reducing and/or preventing behaviour problems and improving metabolic control in children who have developed diabetes in the past couple of years. If the program is helpful, we hope that this will improve the emotional and physical wellbeing of these children in the future. 
Previous research has shown that children who have behaviour problems before, or soon after they develop diabetes, are at an increased risk for ongoing emotional difficulties, as well as being more likely to have poorly controlled diabetes. We plan to invite the families of children who have diabetes and behaviour problems to take part in this project. Half of these families will be offered a parenting program and the other half will receive the standard care from the Diabetes Clinic.

We are also interested in finding out whether this parenting program may prevent behaviour problems developing in the future.  We also plan to invite families of children who have diabetes and do not have behaviour problems to take part.  Half the families will take part in the parenting program and half will receive the standard care. This will allow us to see whether the parenting program can prevent the development of behaviour problems in children who do not have problems at the moment. We are hoping 80 families will take part in this project.</summary>
