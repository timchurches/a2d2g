  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying observation to see how well a risk based treatment strategy
      works in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. In the study, patients are assigned to receive
      surgery +/- radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy depending on their risk of recurrence. Sometimes,
      after surgery, the tumor may not need additional treatment until it progresses. In this case,
      observation may be sufficient. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller
      and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these treatments
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.</summary>
