  <interventions>
    <interventions>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an endoscopic procedure involving the use of a side-viewing duodenoscope to perform interventions on the biliary tract (bile ducts). These interventions include, but are not limited to: the use of radio-opaque contrast dye to image the bile and pancreatic ducts, the use of sphincterotomes to incise the sphincter of the bile duct (sphincter of Oddi), the use of balloons or basket extraction devices to remove stones, placement of stents for biliary or pancreatic drainage. ERCP is usually performed under fluoroscopic guidance and thus involves radiation exposure.

The procedure usually lasts between 15-60 mins, depending on the experience of the endoscopist.

The study recruitment period is 3 years and duration of follow-up is at least 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is a procedure performed at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder). It involves the use of keyhole surgery instruments to remove stones found in the bile duct.

LCBDE may add an additional 2-3 hours to the operating time of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, depending on experience of the operator. The operator may also decide at any time to either, a) abandon the procedure in favour of the performance of ERCP therafter, b) convert the procedure to be completed by open surgery, which involves making a larger incision in the abdomen.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bile duct clearance

This will be assessed at the time of surgery by the use of either intra-operative cholangiogram or occlusion cholangiogram (if ERCP is performed) to image the bile duct at the end of procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of procedure (LCBDE or ERCP)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Retained stones This will be assessed by follow-up calls 3-monthly to determine if the patient has signs/symptoms of retained stones or has presented to a healthcare practitioner for further intervention for retained stones.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3-monthly, for a minimum of six months, up to a maximum of three years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complication Rate (Morbidity) - Common peri-operative complications result from the use of anaesthesia e.g. heart attack, stroke, DVT. Other procedure specific complications include infections, bleeding, pancreatitis, cholangitis, bile leak.

These will be assessed during inpatient stay by the treating team of doctors/surgeons.

The 3-monthly follow-up calls, up to a maximum of three years, will also aim to determine if complications have arisen after discharge.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During procedure, immediately post-procedure (inpatient stay), three-monthly (by follow-up calls, up to a maximum of three years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Length of stay - hospital records will be used to determine date of admission and calculated up till discharge from the treating surgeon/team's episode of care (usually to home, but may be to other step-down institutions e.g. hospice)</outcome>
      <timepoint>After patient discharge from episode of inpatient stay</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mortality - patient passes away i.e. death certificate is signed</outcome>
      <timepoint>During inpatient stay, patients who fail to answer 3-monthly follow-up calls (up to a maximum of three years) will be marked 'lost to follow-up' and may be retrospectively labelled as 'mortalities' from hospital records</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>We re-analysed the estimated sample size required for this study based on our own institutional data, published in July 2014[1], which found clearance rates of 63% for laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and 86% for post-operative ERCP.

Using these figures as estimates, to detect an expected 25% difference (a= 0.05, power = 80%) in the rate of duct clearance, 49 patients per arm would be required.

Previous figures suggesting 100 patients per arm were based on findings of a meta-analysis [2] on two-stage (endoscopic common duct clearance and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) vs. one-stage (laparoscopic surgery alone or combined with intra-operative endoscopy) procedures for clearing the bile duct, which we used as estimates for our study (laparoscopic common bile duct clearance vs intra-operative ERCP), however, these figures would represent a slightly different intervention comparison and population to that of our study (emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients with choledocholithiasis).

Thus, in the presence of the available institutional data above, we have revised our target sample size to 49 patients per arm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current practice in the management of CBD stones varies widely with most patients receiving either pre­ or post­ operative ERCP. This is a two-­step approach to the management of CBD stones. A one-­step approach to CBD stones exists in the form of open or laparoscopic CBD exploration (either laparoscopic trans­cystic exploration (TCE) or laparoscopic choledochotomy). We aim to assess the practice of performing a single-­step approach to CBD stones by performing either intra-­operative ERCP or LCBDE once a CBD stone is identified.</summary>
