  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label, multicenter, phase IIIb study will assess the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of a combination therapy of intravenous (IV) pertuzumab (Perjeta), subcutaneous (SC)
      trastuzumab (Herceptin), and taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) as
      first-line therapy in participants with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC). All
      participants will be treated with 3-week cycles of pertuzumab IV (840 milligrams [mg] first
      dose; subsequent doses of 420 mg) and trastuzumab SC (600 milligrams per 5 milliliter [mg/5
      mL]). The taxane treatment regimen will be determined by the investigator. Participants will
      continue therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the participant
      withdraws consent, whichever occurs first. Time on study treatment is up to 2 years.</summary>
