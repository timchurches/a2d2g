  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Indacaterol 150 µg
Treatment: drugs - Tiotropium 18 µg
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to indacaterol

Experimental: Indacaterol 150 µg and tiotropium 18 µg - Patients inhaled indacaterol 150 µg and tiotropium 18 µg once daily in the morning between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM for 12 weeks. Indacaterol was delivered blinded via a single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI). Tiotropium was delivered open-label via the manufacturer's proprietary inhalation device (HandiHaler®). Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting ß2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.

Active Comparator: Tiotropium 18 µg - Patients inhaled placebo to indacaterol 150 µg and tiotropium 18 µg once daily in the morning between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM for 12 weeks. Placebo to indacaterol was delivered blinded via a single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI). Tiotropium was delivered open-label via the manufacturer's proprietary inhalation device (HandiHaler®).

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Standardized (With Respect to Length of Time) Area Under the Curve (AUC) From 5 Minutes to 8 Hours Post-dose at the End of Treatment (Week 12) - FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Measurements were made at 5 and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose at the end of the study (Week 12, Day 84). Standardized FEV1 AUC was calculated by the trapezoidal rule. The analysis included baseline FEV1, FEV1 pre-dose and 10-15 minutes post-dose of salbutamol/albuterol during screening, and FEV1 pre-dose and 1 hour post-dose of ipratropium during screening as covariates.</outcome>
