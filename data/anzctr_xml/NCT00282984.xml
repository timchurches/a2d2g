  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Responders With Carbon Monoxide (CO) Confirmed 4-week Continuous Quit Rate (CQR) for Last 4 Weeks of Treatment (Trtmt) - Participants considered Responders (4-week CQR &lt;=10 parts per million &lt;ppm&gt;) through reports of cigarette or other nicotine use since last study visit, confirmed by measurement of end-expiratory exhaled carbon monoxide (CO). If any CO measurement at a particular timepoint was &gt;10 ppm, subject was considered to be Non-Responder at that timepoint.</outcome>
      <timepoint>weeks 9 through 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Responders With Continuous Abstinence (CA) Through Week 52 - Responders: participants who remained abstinent based on 'since the last contact' question in Nicotine Use Inventory 1) "Has participant smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) since last contact?" = No AND 2) "Has participant used any other tobacco products since last contact?" = No. Participant a non-responder if expired CO &gt; 10 ppm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 9 through Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Long-Term Quit Responders - Responders: participants were considered Long Term Quit responders if 1) they were responders for the primary endpoint (the 4-week CQR for Weeks 9-12) and 2) had no more than 6 days of smoking from Week 12 through the given visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 9 through Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Seven-Day Point Prevalence of Abstinence at Week 12 - Responders: abstinence in previous seven days, defined in the non-treatment follow-up as: 1) "Has the participant smoked any cigarettes in the last 7 days?" = No AND 2) "Has the participant used any other tobacco products in the last 7 days?" = No. Participant a non-responder if expired CO &gt; 10 ppm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Seven-Day Point Prevalence of Abstinence at Week 24 - Responders: abstinence in previous seven days, defined in the non-treatment follow-up as: 1) "Has the participant smoked any cigarettes in the last 7 days?" = No AND 2) "Has the participant used any other tobacco products in the last 7 days?" = No. Participant a non-responder if expired CO &gt; 10 ppm.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Seven-Day Point Prevalence of Abstinence at Week 52 - Responders: abstinence in previous seven days, defined in the non-treatment follow-up as: 1) "Has the participant smoked any cigarettes in the last 7 days?" = No AND 2) "Has the participant used any other tobacco products in the last 7 days?" = No. Participant a non-responder if expired CO &gt; 10 ppm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With a 4 Week Point Prevalence of Smoking Cessation - Responders: participants with abstinence during the last 4 weeks of non-treatment based on answering 'no' to both of the two 'last 4 week' questions in the Nicotine Use Inventory (NUI). NUI collected information of cigarette or other nicotine use during the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48 through Week 52 (final 4 weeks of non-treatment period [pd])</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Responders With Continuous Abstinence (CA) Through Week 24 - Responders: participants who remained abstinent based on 'since the last contact' question in Nicotine Use Inventory 1) "Has participant smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) since the last contact?" = No AND 2) "Has participant used any other tobacco products since the last contact?" = No. Non- responder if the expired CO &gt; 10 ppm at any given timepoint.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 9 through Week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cigarettes Smoked Per Day - Cigarettes smoked each day during the first 3 weeks of the treatment phase.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 21</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Long-Term Quit Responders From Week 9 Through Week 24 - Responders: participants were considered Long Term Quit Responders if 1) they were responders for the primary endpoint (the 4-week CQR for Weeks 9-12) and 2) had no more than 6 days of smoking from Week 12 through the given visit.</outcome>
