  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cycling training and competition intervention - 1-2 weekly training sessions will be performed by participant with no supervision. One training session per week will take place in a spin cycle theater and supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist

Dose - 2-3 training sessions per week and 1-2 competitions per month; 
Intensity of training sessions are yet to be determined and will be determined after initial assessment; anticipated intensity will be 55-75% VO2max.
Number of training sessions per week (2-3) and number of competition per month (1) have been set by cycling coach and will be adapted according to participant availability. 
Road cycling competitions are yet to be identified and will depend on group availability and consensus. All competitions range from 40-100kms.

Duration of intervention - 12 weeks

Mode of administration - qualified cycling coach will monitor training load via recorded heart rate data, training diaries, phone calls, emails, text messages</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group 1 - recreational masters cyclists who continue usual cycling activities (i.e. cycling activities that the participant would do under normal circumstance) 

Control group 2 - physically inactive individuals who continue usual daily activities (i.e. activities that the participant would do under normal circumstances)</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful ageing is a multidimensional latent variable which will be defined by physical, psychological, cognitive and social domains and assessed via functional criteria in each of these domains.

Physical and mental function will be assessed by Veterans Rand 12 item health survey (VR-12) 

Cognitive function will be assessed by MOS - CF scale

Social function will be assessed by the short loneliness 3 item scale
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Survey will be implemented at two time points: once at baseline (week 1) and once at final follow up (post intervention - week 12)Pre-intervention and post-intervention</timepoint>
