  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial is aimed at assessing how sugar consumption influences blackcurrant metabolism and antioxidant properties. The trial is a parallel design. This design was selected since the influence of sugar consumption of the time-dependent bioactivity of blackcurrant-derived polyphenolic compounds within the body is currently unknown; a parallel trial design will eliminate any potential problems from a cross-over design. 
Participants will be randomised into 3 trial arms; arm 1 will consume a 200 mL blackcurrant drink containing a whole blackcurrant extract equivalent to 3.2 mg polyphenolic compounds /Kg diluted in water, arm 2 will consume a blackcurrant drink (containing the same amount of blackcurrant extract described for arm 1) containing 40 g sucrose and arm 3 will consume a blackcurrant drink (containing the same blackcurrant extract described for arm 1) and then 1 hr later will consume a 200 ml sugar drink containing 40 g sucrose. The blackcurrant extract and sucrose was commercially sourced from Sujon Berries (New Zealand) and Healtheries (New Zealand) and dinks were prepared under New Zealand food safety requirements. 
The trial will take place in designated clinical facilitates within PFR and will be conducted by experience trial co-ordinators, who are also First Aider and trained phlebotomist. The trial co-ordinator will monitor the welfare of participants and ensure that they adhere to trial arm protocols. 
Participants will be randomised into one of the trial three arms. In all three trial arms a venous blood sample (~ 15 mL) will be taken prior to the consumption blackcurrant +/- sugar drinks, in trial arms 1 and 2, after the consumption of the drinks, blood samples will be collected at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hrs post consumption. In trial 3, blood samples will be taken after both the consumption of the blackcurrant drink and then 1 hr later after the consumption of the sugar drink. In addition, further blood samples will be taken at 2, 3 and 4 hr after the consumption of the initial blackcurrant drink.

In addition, participants will be excluded if they are pregnant or planning to get pregnant in the near future or have any of the following conditions: (i) blood borne diseases (e.g. hepatitis), (ii) clinically diagnosed high/low blood pressure, (iii) recent bacterial or vial illness, (iv) are taking any mediation that affects the properties of blood (e.g. blood clotting). Furthermore, potential volunteers will be excluded if they have donated blood within 4 weeks from the start of the study. </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Prior to the onset of the trial a power analysis will be performed on prior  unpublished data to determine volunteer size. Prior research in this area by PFR has shown that when examining changes in the plasma fruit-derived polyphenolic compounds, a sample size of 15 has a desired statistical power level of 0.8 with a probability level of 0.05. Data will be analysed using a Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.1 for Windows (version 5.1.2600). Using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), comparison between feeding (treatment) groups over time for each measure (independent variable) will also be determined, providing levels of significance for trial effect, treatment effect, and interaction effect between feeding conditions. Post-hoc tests will also be performed to identify significant differences at each time point. Values will be presented as mean +/- standard error at a 95% significance level (p=0.05). Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient's will also be assessed using SPSS 15.0 for windows to investigate if there are any relationship between certain variables by giving an R-value between 0.0 and 1.00 (or -0.0 and -1.00).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Scientific evidence suggests that sugar can enhance the digestion and absorption of berry-derived antioxidant compounds presenting an opportunity for the development of berry foods with enhanced antioxidant properties. In particular, blackcurrant consumption is shown to maintain antioxidant capacity and support recovery from oxidative stress. We have gathered proprietary information on the composition and bioavailability of NZ blackcurrant fruits and derived products, and now turn our focus to how to enhance the bioavailability of blackcurrant-derived polyphenolic compounds to support health. In this pilot study we aim to explore the effect of sugar on the bioavailability of blackcurrant-derived phenolic compounds to formulate nutritional intervention strategies to maximize antioxidant properties. </summary>
