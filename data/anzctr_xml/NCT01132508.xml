Treatment: devices: Norian Drillable Bone Void Filler
Norian Drillable Bone Void Filler is a moldable, biocompatible bone void filler with added reinforcing fibers. Norian Drillable is intended to be placed into bony voids either before or after final fixation. The material can be drilled and tapped, and screws can be placed through it at any time during the setting process. Norian Drillable is a composite, two-component, self-setting calcium phosphate bone void filler
