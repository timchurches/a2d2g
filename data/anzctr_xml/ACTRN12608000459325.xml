  <interventions>
    <interventions>To observe if early psychosocial factors are associated with return to work at one year. The following indicators are observed at Baseline, 6 months and 12 months.
* Depressed Mood 
* Perceptions
* Psychosocial disability

The secondary aim is to determine what the economic impact of not returning to work at 1 year is. The following main indicators will be observed at Baseline, 6 months and 12 months: 
* Return to work status
* Economic hardship
* Income
* Workplace factors
* The quality of return to work
* Relative demands of the job 
* Support received at work</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Economic hardship will be measured as a dichotomous variable based on a series of questions about failure to make household payments and whether there was help provided by any organisation or individual. A respondent reporting one or more failures to make payments or the need for help in making payments will be identified as a case of economic hardship. This will be measured at baseline for the 3 months prior to the stroke and at each follow-up visit. An advantage of this measure is that it is sensitive to the possibility that individuals do prioritise certain payments (e.g. default on power bills to pay rent). The basis for these questions is the US Census Survey of Income and Program Participationsurvivors and their families.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An observational stroke cohort study of younger (18-65 years) patients admitted to a stroke units in NSW surviving to 28 days. 440 participants will be enrolled from approximately 20 stroke units over a 12 month recruitment period commencing August 2008.  Following admission, and prior to 28 days post stroke, all stroke survivors aged between 18 and 65 years will be invited to be interviewed and data will be collected on demographic information, the stroke event (extracted from hospital records) and psychiatric history.  At 28 days, and 6 and 12 months following their stroke data will be collected on psychosocial disability using the World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS) and mood from participants during telephone interviews conducted by trained researchers based at The George Institute. The primary objective is to determine if treatable early (within 28 days of stroke) psychosocial factors are associated with return to work (paid and unpaid) at one year. The secondary objective is to determine the economic impact of not returning to work for stroke survivors.</summary>
