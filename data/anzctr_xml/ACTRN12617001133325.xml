  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this randomised controlled trial, all participants will receive access to an 8 week internet-delivered, self-guided education course, the Pain Course, which teaches participants how to manage chronic pain, anxiety, and low mood. All participants will have experienced chronic pain for longer than 6 months.
The Pain Course comprises 5 online lessons, which provide information about evidence-based, cognitive behavioural strategies for managing pain, anxiety and depression. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 20 minutes to read. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with chronic pain, depression, and anxiety, taking a further 20 minutes per week. 
All participants will receive automatic emails to promote adherence and engagement. Specifically, participants will receive an automatic email: a) from the Clinic Director in the first week of the course to thank them for their participation; b) each time a new lesson becomes available; c) when they complete a lesson; d) if they have not started a given lesson within 7 days (i.e. a reminder email); e) in Week 4, to inform  them that slight increases in symptoms at that point are not uncommon; f) in week 7 to encourage them to complete any remaining lessons by the end of week 8; g) in week 8 to remind them it is the last week and of the post-treatment questionnaires. As the receipt of some of these emails is contingent upon a participants activity (e.g. not completing a course within 7 days), the exact number of emails received will vary between participant. However, each will receive between 10 and 20 automatic emails over the duration of the course.
Participants in this research trial will be randomly allocated to an Active Treatment Group or a Waitlist Control Group. Participants in the Active Treatment Group will receive full access to the Pain Course. The Waitlist Control Group will receive the same treatment after the Active Treatment Group has completed the 8-week Course. Participants will be asked to complete standardised questionnaire measures at 5 main time points: Initial application, pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow up. Participants will also complete brief standardised questionnaire measures of anxiety and depression weekly throughout the Course. To enable the researchers to monitor symptoms and safety throughout the Course, participants will also complete a single-item, question 9 from the PHQ-9, which measures suicidal ideation. This item will be measured at initial application, pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow up, and weekly throughout the course. However, this item will not be used for reporting purposes, and has not been included in the list of Outcomes in Step 4.
The strategy used to monitor adherence to the intervention will be online monitoring of lessons completed (i.e., completion is logged online once the participant clicks through all the slides of the lesson).</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants apply online via the clinic's website (www.ecentreclinic.org.au). Successful applications are followed by a telephone interview to confirm suitability for the trial. Randomisation will occur prior to application and concealment occurs through the use of locked and concealed cells in a spreadsheet, which recruitment staff are required to open serially.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>With alpha set at 0.05, power set at 0.80 and a sample size of 120, the study is powered to enable the detection of moderate-to-large effect size (i.e., Cohens d &gt; 0.40) differences in symptoms of pain, anxiety, depression and disability at each time point. However, more participants are being recruited to enable exploratory analyses to examine the prediction and moderation of clinical response in subgroups of participants (e.g., patients with specific pain conditions, such as complex regional pain syndrome).

Subgroup analyses be utilised to assess change in the clinical outcomes from baseline to post-treatment and 3-month follow up for certain, of interest, subgroups. For example, sub-group analyses will assess treatment effects for participants with baseline levels of anxiety, depression and disability within the clinical ranges separately from the overall sample. Clinical levels of baseline symptoms will be based on the published literature e.g., depression (PHQ-2&gt;2), anxiety (GAD-2 &gt;2) and disability levels (PIQ within the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles). All analyses will be carried out using conservative intention-to-treat principles and using generalised equation (GEE) models to handle missing data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this project is to explore the efficacy of the Pain Course in an entirely self-guided format, for managing symptoms of pain interference, anxiety, and depression in adults (aged 18+) living outside Australia with chronic pain. 
A second purpose is to examine the acceptability of the Pain Course in a self-guided format to adults living outside of Australia with chronic pain.
A third purpose is to explore predictors of treatment response to the Pain Course in a self-guided format to adults living outside of Australia with chronic pain.</summary>
