  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Participants Achieving a Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) 24 Weeks After the Last Dose of Study Drug (SVR24 Actual) - The table below shows the percentage of participants acheiving a SVR 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug defined as having plasma hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels &lt; 25 IU/mL, target not detected at end of treatment (EOT) AND the participant did not relapse AND the participant completed the treatment; OR if the participant had plasma HCV RNA levels of &lt; 25 IU/mL, target not detected at EOT AND the participant did not relapse AND the participant prematurely discontinued at least one study medication, but never for the reason virologic failure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of trial (24 weeks after last dose, administerd at 48 weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentage of Participants Achieving Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Values of Less Than 25 IU/ml, Target Not Detected at Different Time Points - The table below shows the percentage of participants with undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of less than 25 IU/ml, target not detected at different time points during the study. Data was imputed for participants with missing values using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for missing values.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48, and at the end of treatment (Week 48 or at time of early discontinuation)</timepoint>
