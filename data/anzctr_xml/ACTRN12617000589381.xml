  <interventions>
    <interventions>Bilateral surgical transversus abdominis plane block using a total 2mg/kg of ropivicaine in 40mls normal saline. 20mls of the solution to be injected into each side of the lateral abdominal wall by the surgeon once haemostasis has been achieved following delivery of the baby and closure of the uterus. The intervention group will also receive standard oral analgesia post-operatively.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive standard care rather than an invasive saline placebo as this is felt to be more consistent with considerations of patient safety and in keeping with the Helskini Declaration. Both groups will therefore receive standard oral analgesia post-operatively which includes: paracetamol 1g four times a day, ibuprofen 400mg three times a day and slow release oxycodone/naloxone (Targin) 20/10mg twice daily for 48 hours with as required oral oxycodone 10-15mg 3 hourly and intravenous/oral tramadol 50-100mg 6 hourly.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A pilot audit of our Acute Pain Service data revealed the mean (SD) maximum pain score (0-10 mm) in the first 12 hours following caesarean section was 5.39 (2.14). It was considered that a 20% reduction in VAS pain score would be clinically important. Sample size calculation based on a students t test with two groups, power =0.8, alpha 0.05, revealed 42 patients required in each group. 
We will aim to recruit 50 patients in each group in order to allow for patient dropouts, protocol violations, etc.  

Demographic and obstetric data will be displayed as mean and standard deviation, median with interquartile ranges or number and percentage as appropriate.  
Outcomes will be assessed on an intention to treat basis.
Categorical variables will be assessed using Chi squared test (or if appropriate Fischers Exact test). Continuous variables will be assessed using ANOVA or repeated measures ANOVA where appropriate. Ordinal categorical variables will be assessed using the exact Cochrane Armitage test. The null hypothesis will be rejected if p &lt; 0.05 for each of the variables. All analyses will be performed using Stata/MP 13.1 (Stata Software Inc., Chicago IL).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A single centre double blinded randomised control trial to determine if surgical TAP blocks provide any additional post-operative analgesic benefit compared with conventional oral analgesia for caesarean sections under spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal fentanyl.
100 term pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean delivery with spinal anaesthesia (2.2mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 15mcg fentanyl) are to be enrolled. 
Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups of 50: they will either receive a surgical TAP block or no TAP block. In the relevant group the TAP block will be performed by the surgeon after closure of the uterus. Patient blinding will be maintained by use of the standard surgical drapes.
Data collection will be carried out by the acute pain service (APS) who will also be blinded when doing follow-up assessments of pain (visual analogue 0-100mm) scores (VAS) at 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours and cumulative oxycodone use at 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours. 
The primary outcome will be the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score (0-100mm) at six (6) hours post-operatively. 
Secondary outcomes will be: 
1. Rest and dynamic visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores (0-100mm) at 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours post-operatively. 
2. Oxycodone IR use at 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours  
3. Patient satisfaction scores at 24 and 48 hours (10: completely satisfied, 1: completely dissatisfied).  
4. Opioid-related adverse effects including sedation, nausea, vomiting, itch and constipation over 48 hours. Sedation (assessed by the Ramsay Sedation score 1-6). The remaining side effects are graded 0-3 where 0 is none, 1 is mild with no treatment required, 2 is moderate and treatment required and helpful and 3 is severe where treatment is required and not helpful. Constipation is assessed at 48 hours only. 
5. Incidence of symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity (perioral tingling, metallic taste, tinnitus, visual disturbance, slurred speech) at 2 hours.  

Hypotheses
1. Surgical TAP blocks significantly reduce pain post LSCS under spinal anaesthesia as defined by reduced visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores and oxycodone use at 2-48 hours and greater patient satisfaction scores compared to having only conventional analgesia.  
2. Opioid-related adverse effects including post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), pruritus, sedation, constipation) by 48 hours post-operatively are reduced in the surgical TAP block groups compared to those receiving only standard care.
