    <statisticalmethods>To detect a large effect size (i.e. standardised group difference) on continuous outcome measures, a minimum total sample size of 52 (i.e. patients) is required. This sample would achieve 80% statistical power, at a conventional alpha level of .05, on a two-tailed test.General linear mixed modelling with SPSS will be used to analyse data involving continuous outcomes (i.e. global eating disorder psychopathology, percent body mass index). General linear mixed modelling accommodates between-group comparisons, multiple time points, and allows for the modelling of statistical covariates.To assess group differences on categorical outcomes (i.e., amenorrhoea status), chi square tests for independence will be conducted. It is unlikely there will be enough statistical power to test these outcomes, yet we will inspect the data nevertheless.</statisticalmethods>
