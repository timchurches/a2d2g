  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three groups of 15 people each one: intervention, control and placebo control.
0.25mm thickness and 40 or 50mm length needle depending on the anatomical characteristics of each patient will be introduced. Placed the patient in supine position, the needle is inserted horizontally into the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis, burying the part of the abdominal wall that is next to the rectus sheath. Once the first local twitch response appears, the needle will be handled with longitudinal movements of 2 to 3mm, without rotation, at approximately 1Hz for 25-30 seconds. Only one needle will be inserted.
This technique is applied by a physiotherapist only once, taking place two weeks before menstruation.
All groups will perform stretching exercises at home. Cuadratus lumborum and rectus abdominis will be stretched for 30-60 seconds each one three times a day until three months after the intervention..
There are not strategies to monitor adherence to exercises.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two control groups: placebo control and control.
People in control group will only complete the paper with questions about pain and medication and SF-36 questionnaire.
For placebo group, a false needle whose mechanism is identical to the Streitberger needle is used, but without base.
To counter this lack of base weÂ´ll use the fingers that we take on the patient's skin to hold the needle while the other hand manipulate the handle after applying pressure to the skin with the help of the guide tube, but without entering the needle. The placebo needles give a mechanical feeling to the tissue without perforating the skin. The patient will feel pressure in the area, but will not know if it has been punctured or not.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study is to quantify the effectiveness of the dry needling technique of myofascial trigger points in the abdominal wall along with performing a stretching program for the treatment of pain in young women or adolescents with primary dysmenorrhoea.
In this randomized clinical trial (RCT), the treatment with dry needling is compared with the results obtained by administering a placebo puncture in another group of patients and with the normal pain development in another one group. Patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental, placebo and control groups, so that groups will be parallel, similar in characteristics, known prognostic factors, other treatments received, etc., except for the intervention they receive.
The target population will consist of women between 18 and 25 years, residing in Madrid and diagnosed primary dysmenorrhoea by a doctor. To participate in the study, women must undergo primary dysmenorrhea moderate or severe level the score calculated by the visual analog scale (VAS)
We will measure: VAS, medication and SF-36 questionnaire.
Three groups of 15 women each one: treatment, placebo and control.
Dry needling in the treatment group will be apply in the active trigger points of rectus abdominis muscle. In the case of performing the placebo treatment, a false needle whose mechanism is identical to the needle Streitberger be used, but without base. In both groups it will take place two weeks before menstruation. In the control group only they have to fill the data being measured. All women should do stretching exercises at home.
The reassessment will be performed a month and at 3 months after intervention.
Our hypothesis is that the performance of the technique of deep dry needling deep in active myofascial trigger points of the rectus abdominis muscle along with the completion of a program of stretching reduces pain in patients with primary dysmenorrhoea.
H0: pre-puncture pain is equal to post-puncture pain
H1:  pre-puncture pain is greater than post-puncture pain</summary>
