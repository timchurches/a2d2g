Treatment: drugs: latanoprost 75 ug
Eligible patients were randomized to receive 1 of 4 different doses of latanoprost (50, 75, 100 or 125 ug/mL).
Study medication was supplied in clear bottles. Patients were instructed to instill one drop of study medication in one or both eyes (as instructed by their investigator) once daily in the evening between 7 PM and 9 PM during the entire treatment period. The first dose of study medication was instilled in the evening of the baseline visit and the last dose was instilled in the evening before the Week 4 (Day 28) visit.

    <summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the change in intraocular pressure (IOP)
      of three different doses of latanoprost (75, 100 and 125 ug/ml) to that of the marketed 50
      ug/ml dose, in a dose ranging study.</summary>
