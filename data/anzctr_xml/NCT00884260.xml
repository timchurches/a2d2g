  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Has, in the opinion of the investigator, suitable general and uterine conditions for
             inserting the LCS.

          -  Normal cervical smear (normal cervical smear within the last six months prior to visit
             1 presented in writing can be accepted. The cervical smear should be analyzed and
             reported according to the Bethesda System.)

          -  Has clinically normal safety laboratory results (i.e., inside the specified range for
             inclusion).

          -  Has regular menstrual cycles (length of cycle 21-35 days) (i.e., endogenous cyclicity
             without hormonal contraceptive use).</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>40</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Female</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Known or suspected pregnancy or is lactating.

          -  Vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, or abortion within 6 weeks prior to visit 2.

        Note: Postpartum insertions should be postponed until uterus is fully involuted, however
        not earlier than 6 weeks after delivery. If involution is substantially delayed, consider
        waiting until 12 weeks postpartum. In case of a difficult insertion and/or exceptional pain
        or bleeding during or after insertion, physical examination and ultrasound should be
        performed immediately to exclude perforation.

          -  History of ectopic pregnancies. Note: For Korea only: History of ectopic pregnancies
             or high probability of ectopic gestation.

          -  Infected abortion within 3 months prior to visit 1. Note: For Korea only: Endometritis
             after delivery or infected abortion within 3 months prior to visit 1.

          -  Abnormal uterine bleeding of unknown origin.

          -  Any genital infection (until successfully treated).

          -  History of, or current, pelvic inflammatory disease

          -  Congenital or acquired uterine anomaly.

          -  Any distortion of the uterine cavity (by e.g., fibroids) likely to cause problems (in
             the opinion of the investigator) during insertion, retention or removal of the LCS.

          -  History of, diagnosed or suspected genital malignancy, and untreated cervical
             dysplasia.

          -  Current deep venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis; history of deep venous thrombosis.

          -  Clinically significant endometrial polyp(s), which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, will interfere with the assessment of the bleeding profile during the
             study

          -  Clinically significant ovarian cyst(s)

          -  Use of any long-acting injectable sex-hormone preparations within 12 months prior to
             start of study medication, and if entering subset: any sex-hormone administration
             within one month prior to start of the study medication.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, bleeding pattern of low dose LNG
      (12 mg/ 24 hrs), delivered locally by a new intrauterine contraceptive system suitable for
      use by women 18 to 40 years of age. In addition, pharmacokinetic assessments will be
      performed.</summary>
