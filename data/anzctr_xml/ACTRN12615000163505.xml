  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lung tumor motion was investigated in lung cancer patients who underwent a breathing training session with AV biofeedback prior to two 3T MRI sessions. The breathing training session was performed to allow patients to become familiar with an AV biofeedback, which utilizes a guiding wave customized for each patient based on a reference breathing pattern. This training session takes approximately 10 minutes. In the first MRI session (pre-treatment) 2D/3D/4D MR images with (1) free breathing (FB) and (2) AV biofeedback were obtained and the second MRI session was repeated within 3 to 6 weeks (mid-treatment). Each MRI session takes approximately 2 hours to perform. All imaging protocols used are already approved clinical procedures. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tumour motion reproducibility with and without MRI guided audiovisual biofeedback. Results will be evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE) method and compared using statistical analysis methods such as the students t-test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After a minimum of 15 participants have been recruited. The primary outcome will be assessed following the second MRI session (mid treatment) for each participant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical benefit assessed as change in dose delivered to healthy tissues as a result of changes in tumour margins due to more consistant tumor motion achieved with four-dimensional MRI. MRI scans obtained before the start of radiotherapy and during radiotherapy treatment will be used. The treatment planning will be evaluated qualitatively by visual inspection of dose distribution and quantatively by analysing dose-volume metrics derived from dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and functional DVHs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of recruitment. This outcome will also be assessed following the second MRI session (mid treatment) for each participant.</timepoint>

If we assume that the standard deviations of those differences will be approximately double that of healthy volunteers then the minimal detectable difference will be 0.144 for the diaphragm RMSE in displacement (SD = 0.2). The study will involve consecutive 15 lung cancer participants per system development stage (a total of 60 lung cancer patients).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is an imaging study which aims to evaluate whether the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided audiovisual biofeedback system can improve the precision of lung cancer radiotherapy. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with stage I-III lung cancer for which you will be treated with radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. 

Study details
All participants will attend 3 additional sessions to standard care. The first session is a breathing training session with audiovisual feedback. This will involve a visual display of a respiratory waveguide. Participants will be asked to regulate their breathing to keep a red ball within the blue wave guide. The aim is for the ball to stay within the line by adjusting breathing by the participant. The second and third sessions participants will undergo MRI scans with and without audiovisual feedback. These MRI sessions will occur pre-radiotherapy treatment and mid-treatment (3 to 6 weeks later). All imaging protocols used are approved clinical procedures. 

The acquired images will be used to evaluate the reproducibility of respiratory-related tumour motion and whether this leads to improved treatment precision i.e. a reduction in radiotherapy dose delivered to healthy tissues.</summary>
