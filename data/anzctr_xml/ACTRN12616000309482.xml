  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised cross-over dietary intervention trial with two 8-week dietary phases (Mediterranean diet and low fat diet) separated by an 8 week washout period. Total duration of the trial is 24 weeks. 

At baseline, volunteers will meet with the dietitian, for approximately 30 minutes, and receive instructions regarding their dietary prescription for the next 8 weeks. Volunteers will be prescribed their allocated diet, receive a recipe book (The Mediterranean Diet, Catherine Itsiopoulos, Pan Macmillan Australia Pty Ltd) and a sample menu (if MedDairy group) to help guide food choices. Volunteers will be given advice on eating out strategies to assist with compliance to their allocated diet. They will be issued a diet checklist to ensure they are complying with the diet. During the MedDairy phase, volunteers will receive foods characteristic of the MedDiet (olive oil, canned fish, nuts etc.) to assist with compliance.  All volunteers will be asked to maintain their usual exercise pattern.  Volunteers will be asked to return fortnightly to see the dietitian (for 15-30 minutes), have their weight measured return checklists, collect study foods and discuss any problems that may have arisen during the intervention. During the washout periods between diet phases, volunteers will be asked to return to following their habitual diet. 

Mediterranean DAIRY diet (MedDairy)
The MedDiet is characterised by a variety of foods including wholegrain cereals, nuts, legumes, olive oil, red wine, small amounts of red meat, low intakes of dairy (mainly yoghurt and cheese), fish, red wine, fruits and vegetables. For this study the MedDairy diet will be based on the PREDIMED-EVOO diet however volunteers will consume 3-4 serves of low-fat and regular dairy products including cheese, milk and yoghurt. To ensure we meet the Australian recommendations for dairy foods, we are recommending 3-4 serves of dairy foods per day.

Guidelines for following the MedDairy diet are adapted from Estruch R et al 2013 NEJM, include:
Abundant use of extra virgin olive oil for cooking and dressing vegetables and salad 
3-4 daily servings of reduced fat milk (1 cup), yoghurt (200g) and tzatziki dip (200g), regular fat cheese (40g hard/semi-soft cheese, 120 g soft cheese) 
2-3 or more daily servings of fresh fruits including 100% natural juices
3 or more weekly servings of legumes (75g per serve)
3 or more weekly servings of fish and seafood (at least one serving of oily fish) (100g per serve)
3 or more weekly serving of nuts (7.5g hazelnuts, 15g walnuts, 7.5g almonds) or seeds (30g per serve)
Ad-libitum consumption of wholegrain cereal products (bread, pasta, rice, cereal), nuts, fish, eggs and raw and cooked vegetables.
Select white meats (poultry without skin) instead of red meats or processed meats (burgers, sausages, deli meats)
Limit consumption of cured ham, red meat (remove all visible fat) to 1 or less serve/week
Remove chicken skin
Cook regularly (at least twice a week) with tomato, garlic and onion 
Dress vegetables, pasta, rice and other dishes with tomato, garlic and onion
Eliminate or limit the consumption of cream, butter, margarine and discretionary foods

Low-fat diet (LFD)
The LFD will be based on the PREDIMED control diet (Estruch R et al 2013 NEJM) following American Heart Association in combination with local recommendations for the Heart Foundation of Australia. Volunteers will maintain the basis of their habitual diet however will be asked to modify their intake to choose low fat foods.  Specifically : cook with little fat, remove / skim fats from foods, choose and purchase low fat foods

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure will be determined by automatic oscillatory using a Digital Blood Pressure Monitor (UA-767PC). Blood pressure will be measured at each clinic visit by staff. On each occasion 4 readings will be taken, spaced 3 minutes apart. The first reading will be discarded and the mean of the 3 readings will be recorded. Volunteers will also monitor blood pressure twice daily at home for 6 days. Blood pressure will be measured every day for 1 week, immediately after waking, and before going to bed. On each occasion 4 readings will be taken, spaced 3 minutes apart. The first reading is discarded and the mean of the next 3 readings is taken. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinic measured blood pressure will be assessed at baseline and 8, 16 and 24 weeks.

      <outcome>Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R):
The ACE-R is a brief cognitive test battery that has been validated for use to detect early cognitive dysfunction through scoring five difference cognitive domains (memory, attention/orientation, fluency, language and visuospatial). The maximum score is 100 (higher score reflects better cognitive performance) (Mioshi et al. 2006). This will be used at screening to rule out dementia and Alzheimers disease and as an outcome measure as it is sensitive in detecting very mild-cognitive impairment.

      <outcome>The CAIDE Dementia Risk Score was developed to identify individuals at increased risk for developing dementia (20 years later) based on midlife presence of metabolic and vascular risk factors that would potentially benefit from preventative interventions to reduce their risk (Sindi 2015). The validated risk score is based on multifactorial risk estimation using age, education level, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and physical inactivity. Normal risk of dementia is considered a score of 8-9, above normal risk for developing dementia is 10-15 and below normal risk is 0-7. The CAIDE will be assessed in volunteers aged between 45-65 years (validated in this age range). </outcome>

      <outcome>Framingham Risk Score is a gender specific calculator used to estimate an individuals 10 year risk of developing CVD. The score is based on age/age range, gender, total cholesterol, dyslipidemia, blood pressure hypertension treatment and smoking and diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance.  The FRS provides an indication of the possible benefits of prevention which is important for healthcare professionals in tailoring medical and dietetic advice. Individuals with low risk of having CVD in 10 years is 10% or less; intermediate risk is 10-20%, and high risk is 20% or more</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>One-way ANOVA and Chi square will be used to compare baseline demographic, cardiometabolic, cognitive, wellbeing and dietary characteristics between those who completed the study and those who withdrew. Mixed effects models will be used to assess the effects of treatment, and possible carryover or period effects for each of the outcomes separately. Carry over effects will be assessed by comparing baseline values within each group between the two periods using a Group X Period interaction term in multilevel analysis. Treatment-period effects will be explored by comparing the treatment effects using a treatment X period interaction term in multilevel analysis. We will also assess possible seasonal effects by including a term for treatment X season interaction in a secondary analysis with season coded as a binary variable for Autumn or spring versus Winter or Summer.

Diet x Period X Energy intake interaction terms will be used to determine whether there are any changes in diet (total energy, macronutrient intakes) between the two diet phases. All statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS for Windows, version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Stata (version 14, Statacorp, College Station, Texas). Data will be presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) for descriptives and as means+/- standard error (SEM) for reporting estimated effects. P &lt; 0.05 is deemed significance.

A sample size of 30 participants has been calculated on the primary outcome of blood pressure assessed as home blood pressure. 30 volunteers will provide &gt;90% power to detect a 2.5 mmHg difference in mean home systolic blood pressure assuming a within-group SD of 14 mm Hg based on our previous studies, a correlation between hourly measures of 0.6, a correlation between mean home systolic blood pressures at each time point of 0.6, and a minimum of 50 blood pressure measurements per volunteer. This calculation is based on a between group comparison of means using a type I error rate of 0.017. A total of 39 volunteers will be recruited to allow for approximate 10% drop out rate. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a crossover study, we aim to determine whether a Mediterranean diet with adequate dairy foods, consumed over 8 weeks, will improve measures of blood pressure, cardiometablic health, wellbeing and cognitive performance, more than a low fat diet in an high risk population of men and women with for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We believe that volunteers consuming a Mediterranean diet enriched with dairy foods (MedDairy diet), to meet the nutrient reference values for calcium in Australia, will have greater improvements in blood pressure than a low fat diet, based on Heart Foundation recommendations. Low fat diets are recommended for treatment of many chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart health and secondary prevention of stroke etc. together with regular physical activity. We know that the MedDiet, rich in bioactive foods and nutrients, has significant effects on longevity as well as reduced total death and death from CVD. Furthermore, given the independent reported health benefits of dairy foods on CVD risk factors including blood pressure, blood lipids etc. a diet combing both a Mediterranean diet and dairy foods (MedDairy diet) may in fact improve indices of cardiovascular health more than a low fat diet.
