  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Parent collection
Other interventions - Healthcare worker home visit

Active Comparator: Healthcare worker visit - Healthcare worker performs home visit when study child has acute respiratory illness to collect a respiratory swab (nasopharyngeal swab).
At the healthcare worker home visit, the HCW will collect the nasopharyngeal swab, and a parent will collect an anterior nasal swab. The HCW swab is to be returned immediately to the laboratory, and the parent collected swab was placed in a post box for return to the laboratory by surface mail.

Experimental: Parent collection - Home collection of respiratory swab (anterior nose) and mailed return when study subject has an acute respiratory illness.


Other interventions: Parent collection
Parent collection of anterior nose specimen when child has an acute respiratory illness, and mailed return of the specimen to the laboratory.

Other interventions: Healthcare worker home visit
Healthcare worker performs home visit for collection of respiratory specimen (anterior nose) when study child has an acute respiratory illness.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of acute respiratory illnesses that have a specimen available for testing in the laboratory. - For this outcome, the Investigators will compare the proportion of all incident ARIs that have a specimen available for testing in each group (HCW vs parent collection).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of specimens collected that have a virus able to be detected. - For this outcome, the Investigators will compare the proportion of all specimens collected during incident ARIs in each group (HCW vs parent collection) that have any virus detected.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of swabs collected at home visit with virus detected (HCW nasopharyngeal swab vs parent collected anterior nose swab). - This comparison is restricted to children randomised to the health care worker collection group. In this group, at the home visit the HCW will collect a nasopharyngeal swab, place it in universal transport media, and return it immediately to the laboratory. At the same home visit, a parent will collect a dry anterior nasal swab, it will be placed in a post box near the subject's home, and returned to the laboratory by normal surface mail. For this outcome, the Investigators will compare the proportion of all specimens collected during incident ARIs in the HCW group that have any virus detected (HCW nasopharyngeal swab vs parent collected anterior nose swab).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigators are aiming to learn more about respiratory infections in young children in
      the community. To prepare for a larger project, the investigators are conducting this study
      to get information about the best way to collect and transport respiratory specimens from
      young children. The investigators would like to test whether parents are more likely to
      collect a simple respiratory specimen themselves during a child's illness, compared to the
      likelihood of specimen collection when a home visit is made by a health care worker. Further,
      the investigators want to compare the likelihood a virus will be identified in both groups.</summary>
