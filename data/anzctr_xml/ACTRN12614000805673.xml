    <concealment>Trial explained and consent to participate in study obtained in antenatal clinic at 36weeks. 

Upon presenting to the labour ward, the Patient is then reconsented and and randomised to either treatment arm. 

Randomisation was done using a random number generator and the treatment arm is sealed in an opaque envelope and opened only upon randomisation

Patient will not be told which arm they are in. The investigators will not be blinded as the equipment to deliver the drug differs and is easily recognisable to the investigators. However our patients recruited would be exposed for the first time to such devices</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>From the paper by Yeo et al, pain relief score [median (range)]for sevoflurance was 67 (33-100) mm and Entonox 51([13-100)mm.  Using the sample size calculator, OpenEpi; with power of 80% and significant level at 0.05,  Median was approximate to mean, SD was calculated by using the formula of (max  min)/4;

Sample size 46; 23 in each arm</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Labour analgesia in the form of epidural would be ideal for all parturients but this being expensive to provide is limited in supply to only about 1% of the Malaysian population. Dose finding studies have shown that 0.8% sevoflurane administered to a parturient can provide substantial analgesia.  A commercially available 0.8% inhaler has just emerged in the market. We would like to compare this method with the traditional option of using Entonox.

In this study we propose to compare the pain experience of parturients exposed  to either 0.8% sevoflurane or entonox. We expect the 0.8% inhaler to provide better analgesia for the mother. We do not expect any untoward complications to arise from its use. The costing results will be unknown until after the study.
