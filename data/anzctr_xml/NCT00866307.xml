             study

          -  Patients must have newly diagnosed high-risk B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
             (ALL)

          -  Intrathecal chemotherapy with cytarabine is allowed prior to registration for patient
             convenience; this is usually done at the time of the diagnostic bone marrow or venous
             line placement to avoid a second lumbar puncture; the CNS status must be determined
             based on a sample obtained prior to administration of any systemic or intrathecal
             chemotherapy, except for steroid pretreatment; systemic chemotherapy must begin within
             72 hours of this intrathecal therapy

          -  Patients receiving prior steroid therapy are eligible for study; the dose and duration
             of previous steroid therapy should be carefully documented

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent

          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute
             (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Pregnant female patients are ineligible; pregnancy tests with a negative result must
             be obtained in all post-menarchal females; males and females of reproductive potential
             may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method;
             lactating females must agree that they will not breastfeed a child while on this study

          -  Patients with Down syndrome (DS) are ineligible since excessive toxicities and death
             have been noted for those enrolled on AALL0232 receiving the prednisone/Capizzi
             methotrexate (PC) arm of treatment, which is the backbone regimen for the current
             study</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of pegaspargase when given together with
      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed high-risk acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia. Pegaspargase may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy)
      together with pegaspargase may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
