  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve the individual prescription of aerobic and resistance-based exercise at moderate-intensity, accumulating at least 150 minutes per week (dose). Women will likely walk and undertake resistance exercises using free-weights or therabands, either supervised by an AEP or in their own time. An accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) will prescribe and monitor exercise type, duration and frequency on a weekly basis and modify prescription according to presentation of symptoms and by adhering to the exercise principle of gradual progression. The exercise program will continue for the duration of chemotherapy or for a maximum of 18 weeks for participants who discontinue chemotherapy early.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care will include provision of the resilience pack from Ovarian Cancer Australia. It provides information about dealing with a diagnosis, treatment options and expectations, advice about living well with ovarian cancer and information about available support options. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine the enduring effects on survivorship of an exercise intervention administered in addition to usual care, compared to usual care alone, during first-line chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a woman aged 18 years or above and have been newly diagnosed with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer of any histological type and are suitable for first-line chemotherapy. Study details Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive a structured exercise program, in addition to usual care, whilst participants in the other group will receive usual care alone. The structured exercise program will likely include walking and resistance exercise. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their physical well-being and quality of life. Participants will be followed for up to 5 years, in order to determine survival rates. </summary>
