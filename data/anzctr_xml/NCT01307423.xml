      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index [HAQ-DI]) at Week 16 - The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 52 - The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</outcome>

Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning.
