    <interventions>HEPAP (Exercise &amp; Education Programme): 
Participants randomized to the HEPAP condition (exercise and education) will visit the Massey University recreation centre, twice a week, for 8 weeks to take part in a group focused exercise session. Each exercise session will last 90 mins, incorporating 30 mins of aerobic exercise (treadmill, cycle ergometer) and 60 mins of resistance exercise, core-stability, balance, control, postural exerices, flexibility etc. Each session will also be followed by a 30 min group focused education section. Participants progression will be monitored over the course of the programme. Heart rate, blood pressure and perceived exertion will be monitored at rest, during the session and following the session. The education component will cover issues such as signs and symptoms of TIA, physical activity opportunities in the local area, diet modification, pacing, goal setting and smoking cessation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control condition will complete identical assessment procedures as the HEPAP intervention. However, those randomized to the control condition at the completion of the baseline assessment will receive normal care (i.e. no additional supportive strategies will be implemented) during the 8 week exercise and education intervention.</comparator>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The Stroke Department at Wellington Hospital receives referrals for all those with possible TIA in the Region.  Referrals are received via telephone, fax or e-mail from General Practitioners, the Emergency Department and Paramedics.  All referrals are reviewed within 2 working days by a specialist physician and appropriate diagnostic tests undertaken, as per the NZ TIA guidelines. Between 6 and 10 referrals are seen each week.  Those in whom a diagnosis of TIA/Non-disabling stroke is reached will be invited to participate. 

Following the baseline assessments participants will be randomized to the HEPAP (exercise and education) or control group. Randomization will occur via 'allocation concealment'. Allocation concealment will occur via sealed opaque envelopes which will be sequentially numbered.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computerised sequence generation

The randomization sequence will be generated using the following internet source (http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm). The randomization sequence (i.e. A = HEPAP; B = Control) will be placed in a sequentially numbered envelope (from 1-60) based on the derived sequence generated by the website.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For patients diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack (TIA; mini stroke), management strategies are predominantly aligned with lifestyle (i.e. smoking cessation advice, diet, alcohol consumption) and pharmacological interventions. 
Coronary Heart Disease and Cerebrovascular Disease (CVD) share many predisposing, modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, abnormal blood lipids, cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, obesity and diabetes. Research has shown benefits of exercise programmes and lifestyle education in the cardiac disease population (Jolifee et al., 2010). There is however the need to establish and identify the feasibility and efficacy of exercise based interventions as an early treatment strategy for patients with CVD to see if it is an effective approach towards preventing recurrent vascular events (Lennon &amp; Blake, 2009; Yang et al. 2010)
The purpose of the present pilot study is therefore to examine whether an exercise and education intervention with patients post TIA (and non-disabling stroke) reduces risk factors aligned with CVD, increases physical fitness and the awareness of educational and health issues associated with TIA. This study will examine both the short-term and long-term effects of an exercise and education intervention.</summary>
