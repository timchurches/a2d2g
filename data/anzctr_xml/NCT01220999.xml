Cohort #5: 2-5 pts - 6 mg/kg - 2 mg/kg - 2 mg/kg - 2 mg/kg - 2 mg/kg
Day 1 and Day 36 doses will be trace labelled with Indium-111 (111In-CS-1008)
Additional treatment cycles in suitable patients with stable disease or better at the day 44-50 reassessment may continue be given as weekly infusions of CS-1008 at 2 mg/kg per week. Disease reassessment is planned after every second 4-week cycle.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a clinical trial of CS-1008 which is a humanized monoclonal antibody.

      This trial explores where CS-1008 distributes in the body, and the activity of CS-1008 in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to give patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer a series of different CS-1008 antibody doses in order to:

        -  Study how the dose of CS-1008 effects where the CS-1008 distributes in the body
           (biodistribution), how long it circulates in blood (pharmacokinetics) and how much
           attaches to tumour (tumour uptake). These issues are studied after the initial infusion
           of 111In-CS-1008 (CS-1008 tagged with a small amount of radioactive Indium - also called
           Indium-111 or 111In), and also during and after a cycle of weekly infusions of CS-1008
           antibody.

        -  Study changes in the function (metabolism) of tumour cells following CS-1008
           administration.

        -  Assess whether repeat doses of CS-1008 cause shrinkage of the tumour.

        -  Study whether experimental treatment with CS-1008 changes chemicals in the blood that
           may indicate tumour cell death (serum apoptosis biomarkers) and/or tumour response to
           treatment (serum tumour biomarkers (CEA - carcinoembryonic antigen)).</summary>
