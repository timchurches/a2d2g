    <interventions>In this observational study we aimed to recognize a pleural space effect, distinguishing it from an active air leak, by means of a digital chest drain system providing a continuous air flow and pleural pressures check. Since March  2010 to October 2011, we employed 144 digital drains for 125 patients undergone 138 thoracic surgical procedures. We observed: 18 active air leaks (12.5%), among which 4 prolonged (2.8%), all characterized by high differential pleural pressure, especially due to an increased mean expiratory pressure (&gt;1 cmH2O) (p &lt;0.0001), and significantly related to upper lobe resections (p: 0.00017), a chest tube removal time later than the fifth post-operative day (p &lt;0.0001), an increasing pneumothorax after a one day provocative clamping (p &lt;0.0001); three late air leaks (2.1%), all long lasting (p &lt;0.0001), predicted by pressure curves divergency before the air flow appearance. Moreover, we reported 25 pleural space effects (17.4%), equally characterized by a high differential pleural pressure, but mainly due to a lower mean inspiratory pressure (&lt;20 cmH2O) (p &lt;0.0001), and especially related to surgical pleurodesis procedures (p: 0.0003) and wide lung resections (p: 0.0002); none of these patients had an increasing pneumothorax after provocative clamping. A digital chest drain system ensuring a continuous air flow and pleural pressures measurement could clearly identify a pleural space effect, avoiding the frequent misinterpretation with an active air leak and allowing to safely remove a chest tube at the right time.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To recognize a pleural space effect, distinguishing it from an active air leak, by means of a digital chest drain system: a pleural space effect is characterized by high pleural differential pressures and low trans-pleural air flows, while an active air leak is  always characterized by high trans-pleural air flows. A digital chest drain system can detect both air flows and differential pleural pressures by means two MEMS (micro electronic mechanicakl systems) sensors, one for measuring flow and another for measuring pressures</outcome>
