  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intraocular pressure (IOP) is dependent on the balance between the production of aqueous fluid within the eye and the rate at which aqueous leaves the eye through the trabecular meshwork (TM) in the angle of the eyes anterior chamber. The medication Ibopamine (Trazyl: Pharmainvest SpA, Milano, Italy) which is a dopamine receptor agonist, will temporarily increase aqueous production and dilate the pupil. A healthy eye with healthy TM cells will overcome this increase, pump aqueous out of the eye at an increased rate and the patient will demonstrate no IOP rise when Ibopamine drops are applied topically to the eye, however there is evidence that those with glaucoma will exhibit a rise in IOP. It may be that patients whose glaucoma is progressively worsening, will demonstrate a larger increase in IOP when Ibopamine drops are applied topically to their eye compared with stable patients. 
To undertake an Ibopamine challenge, the patient has their IOP measured and recorded using goldmann applanation tonometry seated at the slit lamp; they then had two drops of Ibopamine 2% solution instilled into both of their eyes; lastly their IOP is re-measured 45 minutes after receiving the Ibopamine eye drops and the IOP results pre and post the challenge are compared. </interventions>
    <comparator>This will be a longitudinal cohort study of those who are glaucoma suspects. The entire group will receive the ibopamine challenge. Then they will be followed. At the end of the follow-up period, the results of the ibopamine challenge will be compared with the outcome of the glaucoma suspects to determine the ability of the ibopamine challenge to predict glaucoma development.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Its a clinical trial of a drug called Ibopamine, to be used in a challenge test in much the same way as a water drinking test. Ibopamine is an alpha, beta and dopamine receptor agonist, which causes a brief increase in aqueous production for about 4 hours after a single drop. Among normal patients, this causes no change in intraocular pressure, but in glaucoma patients, IOP will increase. My suspicion is that the degree of IOP rise might be related to the patients likelihood of further progression in the future. I have recently completed a pilot case-control study which has successfully shown that an ibopamine challenge can differentiate between glaucoma suspects, stable glaucoma patients and patients whose glaucoma is rapidly worsening. Now, I would like to commence a longitudinal study investigating the predictive value of a positive ibopamine challenge among glaucoma suspects and early glaucoma patients.</summary>
