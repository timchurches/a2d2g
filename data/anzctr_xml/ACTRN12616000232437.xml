Patient outcome will be determined by objective examinaion criteria including range of motion and strength assessment. Radiographic analysis performed utilising standardised AP and axillary lateral projections to assess for evidence of complications and early loosening. Statistical analysis will be performed by University of Auckland statistician looking for specific associations.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>TSA is now well established as a means to relieve pain and improve function for a variety of shoulder arthritic conditions. Reverse TSA use has increased, with most joint registries showing that at least 50% of arthroplasty procedures performed involve use of the reverse TSA. Concerns remain however regarding complication and failure rates with reverse TSA, with little medium and no long term outcomes reported in the literature. Many different reverse TSA designs are now in use, including 155 degree neck shaft angle Grammont designs, to designs that utilise either 145 degree or even 135 degree neck shaft angles. Short stem designs are now available, in addition to designs that lateralise the centre of rotation or lateralise the humeral shaft. At present we do not know what the optimal reverse configuration is, and only medium and long term follow-up studies that look specifically at implant design can help answer this question. Longer term outcomes following reverse TSA remains poorly defined, and very little literature is available on newer implant designs. 
The primary purpose of this study is to critically look at both clinical (patient) and radiographic (Xray) outcomes of the DePuy Delta Xtend reverse TSA. This will to add to the body of literature regarding reverse TSA and specifically to our understanding of this implant and the indications for its use.</summary>
