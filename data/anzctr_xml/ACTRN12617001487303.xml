    <statisticalmethods>A power calculation has been performed on 50 participants. When mean change in visual acuity in the population is estimated to be 55 letters, with a 20% standard deviation and a 5% significance, the power to detect a change of 5 letters is 88%. When the mean central macular thickness is estimated to be 400 microns, with a 20% standard deviation and a 5% significance level, the power to detect a change of 50 microns is 99%.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>This is an open label study in patients who have been previously treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF drug for macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion despite regular injections. The study will describe the effectiveness, safety of intravitreal aflibercept and changes in health related quality of life (HRQoL) among these patients.</summary>
