    <interventions>transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
TDCS involves the application of a mild constant electrical current of 2 mA to predefined brain regions of interest through placement of electrodes on the scalp surface. The current induces intracerebral current flow. This current flow then either increases or decreases the neuronal excitability in the specific area being stimulated based on which type of stimulation is being used: cathodal (decreases excitability), or anodal (increases excitability).
The total duration of a single session is 20 minutes. Each treatment phase will include 20 consecutive weekdays (or 4 weeks). Participants may continue for up to 12 weeks, depending on the allocation within the trial, and therapeutic responsiveness.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study will involve 2 phases. In the first phase of this study all 40 participants will be randomly assigned to 4 weeks of either active asymmetrical tDCS or sham treatment using a double-blind design,  such that half of the participants will receive active and half of the participants will receive sham treatment. During the second phase of the study all participants in the active arm will be assigned to another 4 weeks of either asymmetrical tDCS or bilateral tDCS on the basis of treatment response: those responding to asymmetrical will continue with asymmetrical tDCS, while those not responding to asymmetrical tDCS will begin bilateral tDCS  see below, using an open label un-blinded design. Following 4 weeks of sham treatment, participants in this arm will enter an arm of 4 weeks of active tDCS, randomized to either asymmetrical or bilateral tDCS. 

The active and sham treatments will have a duration of 20 minutes and will be conducted on consecutive weekdays. In the case of the asymmetrical tDCS set-up, the location of the cathodal electrode will be the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) of the left hemisphere, and the anodal electrode will be placed over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Stimulation will be conducted at 2mAmp intensity. In the case of bilateral tDCS, 4 sites wil be stimulated at 1 mAmp intensity: cathodal electrodes will be positioned over the bilateral TPJ and anodal electrodes will be positioned over the bilateral DLPFC.

Assessments of symptom severity, cognitive function, general daily functioning, as well as Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels in the blood, and brain activity measured by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be conducted at baseline and following each 4 week treatment period of the study. 

The first phase will use a double-blind design in which the tDCS administrator will be aware of the active or sham condition, but both the patient and the researchers administering the clinical and cognitive assessments will not be aware of the treatment condition.
Sham tDCS will consist of the same set-up and electrode positions as the actual tDCS treatment. However, the stimulator will be turned on for just 30 seconds, during which time current intensity will be ramped up, an back down. This will provide a similar sensation to the actual tDCS, decreasing the likelihood that participants will notice the difference between real and sham tDCS.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to assess to what extent cathodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) of the temporal cortex, in conjunction with anodal tDCS of the prefrontal cortex, may reduce auditory hallucinations, and induce improvements in cognition, and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia who are concurrently maintained on antipsychotic treatment. The central hypothesis is that cognitive deficits and negative symptoms, having been linked to prefrontal cortex dysfunction, will be reduced by anodal stimulation of the prefrontal cortex via facilitation of neural function, and that cathodal stimulation of the temporal cortex will reduce auditory hallucinations through disruption of pathological over-activity.</summary>
