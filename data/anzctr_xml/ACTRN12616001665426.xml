  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Navigate Website: an Internet-based treatment DA for men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer. The goal of the Navigate DA is to reduce confusion, distress and decisional regret, and increase understanding of treatment options and side-effects. Patients and partners allocated to the intervention will be given access to the Navigate DA website. 
The website has been developed using co-design methodology, meaning that consumers (users and potential users) were involved with every step of the design phase. Content was based on the latest empirical evidence and iteratively reviewed by clinicians and consumers to ensure accuracy, relevance and completeness.
The website contains seven main sections:

1.	Prostate Cancer Information
2.	Prostate Cancer Treatment Information and, Treatment Side Effects and management
3.	DA &amp; Values Clarification Exercise
4.	Wellness Section
5.	Gay Section
6.	Partner Section
7.	Video Section (contains 45 short films of consumer experiences and clinician information)

Participants will have access to the online DA for 12 months (duration of their participation in the study) and will be able to access the website to use the DA as much or as little as they choose during this time.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the Control group will receive links to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia (PCFA) website. This website is one of the leading health information resources for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Australia. It has informational content relating to all components included within Navigate, however in less detail, and without videos, graphs or formal low health literacy copy editing. It is currently the best website for those diagnosed with prostate cancer to seek information regarding their diagnosis and treatment. It is therefore an appropriate alternative to be provided to those randomised into the usual care group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is uptake of Active Surveillance as the first-line management option for localised prostate cancer assessed as a dichotomous outcome (AS or curative treatment option) at follow-up 1. This will be determined based on treating clinician report and confirmed via medical record audit, as well as MBS and PBS data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up 1 will occurr at 1 month (4 weeks) after their consent date</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preparedness for decision-making. 
Mens preparedness for decision-making will be assessed at baseline and follow-up 1 with the preparedness for decision-making scale. The PrepDM total scale was designed specifically to assess decision-aids used in a health context and has shown acceptable internal consistency (Chronbachs a=0.92 to 0.96), and Item Response Theory analyses demonstrated that all ten scale items function very well</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up 1  at 1 month (4 weeks) after their consent date</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decisional conflict. 
Mens decisional conflict will be assessed at follow-up 1 with the 16-item Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The DCS total scale is suitable for use with cancer patients and has shown acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachs a=0.78-0.92), test-retest reliability (r=0.81) and responsiveness (longitudinal validity)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up 1  at 1 month (4 weeks) after their consent date</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decisional satisfaction. 
Mens decisional satisfaction will be assessed at follow-ups 2 and 3 with the 6-item Satisfaction with Decision (SWD) measure. The SWD has shown acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's a=0.86), discriminant validity and responsiveness</outcome>
      <timepoint>follow-ups 2 and 3 at 3 and 6 months after initial consent respectively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decisional regret. 
Mens decisional regret will be assessed with the 5-item Decisional Regret Scale (DRS). The DRS has shown acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's a =0.81-0.92) and convergent validity with related measures (r =0.31-0.60) and responsiveness</outcome>
      <timepoint>follow-ups 2 and 3 at 3 and 6 months after initial consent respectively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of patients and partners illness communication. 
The quality of mens illness communication with their partners will be assessed at baseline and follow-up 1 with the 4-item Couples Illness Communication Scale (CICS). The CICS was adapted for use in prostate cancer populations. The original scale has shown acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachs a= 0.80) and convergent validity with other measures of dyadic adjustment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline at time of cosent and  Follow up 1 (4 weeks) after their consent date</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prostate cancer-specific quality of life. 
Prostate cancer-specific quality of life will be assessed at baseline with the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite short-form (EPIC-26). The EPIC-26 comprises four subscales: urinary, bowel, sexual and
hormonal summaries. The hormonal subscale is not relevant to this group as hormones are not usually prescribed to those diagnosed with LRPC, and therefore will not be included. All four subscales have shown acceptable internal consistency (all Cronbachs a &gt;0.70), test-retest reliability (all r&gt;0.69) and responsiveness when used independently, therefore using only three of the four scales will not impact on the reliability and validity of the measure.</outcome>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Demographic, clinical, patient-reported outcome measures and partners data will be then imported into R version 3.3.0 (or higher) for analysis and graphing. The R package ggplot2 will be used to prepare any graphs. Prior to formal analysis, descriptive statistics and graphical displays will be used to identify missing and out-of-range values, assess distributional assumptions and identify outliers.

Recruitment bias will be assessed by comparing demographic and clinical characteristics of consenters and non-consenters using t-tests (or Mann-Whitney) and chi-squared (or Fishers exact) tests as appropriate.Differential attrition will be assessed by comparing baseline characteristics of drop-outs and continuing participants using t-tests (or Mann-Whitney) and chi-squared (or Fishers exact) tests as appropriate.

Outcome analysis. Study participants will be analysed as part of the study arm to which they were randomised in all outcome analysis. Pearsons chi squared test will be used to analyse study arm differences in the primary outcome, uptake of AS as first-line management option for LPC. Analysis of covariance will be used to analyse study arm differences in the following secondary outcomes: preparedness for decision-making (follow-up 1 adjusted for baseline) and illness communication (follow-up 1 adjusted for baseline). Independent-samples t-tests will be used to analyse study arm differences in the following secondary outcomes: decisional conflict (follow-up 1), satisfaction (follow-up 2 and 3) and regret (follow-up 2 and 3). Finally, prostate cancer-specific quality of life will be analysed with a repeated measures model; more specifically, a reference cell model with the mean of the control group at baseline used as the reference An unstructured covariance type will be used to guard against misspecification and the model will be estimated by maximum likelihood.

Exploratory analysis. Study participants will be analysed as part of the study arm to which they were randomised in all exploratory analyses. Analysis of covariance will be used to analyse study arm differences in the following exploratory outcomes: mens anxiety (follow-up 1 adjusted for baseline) and partners illness communication with men (follow-up 1 adjusted for baseline). Independent-samples t-tests will be used to analyse study arm differences in the following secondary outcomes: partners decisional conflict (follow-up 1), satisfaction (follow-up 2 and 3) and regret (follow-up 2 and 3).

As appropriate, effect size estimates for between-group differences will be calculated using recommended procedures. After inspection of the data, the suitability of stated methods will be assessed and revised as necessary.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to assess the impact of the Navigate online decision aid (DA) on the uptake of active surveillance as a management option for low risk prostate cancer patients. This can be achieved by assessing the impact of the online DA on decision making, confusion and distress, and decisional regret and by increasing understanding of treatment options and side-effects for men recently diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer (LRPC).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enrol in this trial if you are aged 18 or over, and have been diagnosed with LRPC in the previous two weeks. 

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive access to the Navigate DA, or to receive links to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia (PCFA) website, an existing information website for men with prostate cancer. Participants' partners will also have access to the allocated information resource. Participants and their partners will then be followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months to assess update of active surveillance as the first line management option, preparedness for decision making, decisional conflict, regret, satisfaction, relationship outcomes and quality of life using questionnaires.

It is hoped that this trial will provide information on the impact of the Navigate DA on the uptake of active surveillance, reducing confusion and distress associated with decision making regarding LRPC diagnosis.
