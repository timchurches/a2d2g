  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this pilot study we will evaluate the efficacy of acetazolamide in the treatment of lithium-induced NDI. 
Acetazolamide will be commenced at 250mg orally once a day for 7 days, then increased to 250mg orally twice a day for the 2nd week, then as tolerated to 500mg orally twice a week for weeks 3 &amp; 4. If the higher dose is not tolerated, the dose will be lowered back to the tolerated oral dose.Total duration of treatment is 4 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A change in urinary concentrating ability.
This will measured by a standard water deprivation and urinary concentration test. Following an overnight fast, a baseline urine sample will be collected at 0830. Then 40ug desmopressin (dDAVP) will be administered intranasally. Urine samples will be collected at 2,4 and 6 hours to measure urine osmolality.
This will be done at baseline and at the end of 4 week.</outcome>

Interim analysis

After analyzing three patients in this pilot study results will be analyzed. The main parameter which will be analyzed is maximal urine osmolality. The maximal urine osmolality after acetazolamide treatment will be compared with the maximal urine osmolality before the acetazolamide treatment. 

After finishing the study, maximal urine osmolality after acetazolamide treatment will be compared with the maximal urine osmolality before the acetazolamide treatment by using a paired t-test; p-values &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lithium is an effective drug for controlling various mood disorders. However it is frequently associated with the development of nephrogenic diabetes inspidus - where the individual is unable to concentrate their urine and so have an increased thirst and pass large quantities of urine. This can be modified by the use of amiloride which blocks the action of lithium in the kidney and corrects the NDI. Acetazolamide also alters kidney handling of lithium and may be more effective in correcting the NDI. We wish to test this in a group of individuals on lithium therapy.</summary>
