  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who consent to and enroll in the study will be randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups: (1) A standard care rehabilitation group, and (2) A simulator training + standard care rehabilitation group. 
All participants will be involved in standard outpatient rehabilitation consisting of a range of allied health therapies including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, psychology and neuropsychology services. In addition to standard rehabilitation, participants allocated into the simulator-training group will complete a program of eight 45-minute sessions (twice weekly) at Epworth Hawthorn. An occupational therapist driver assessor (OTDA) will deliver a standardised protocol, while tailoring to individual needs based on impairment (e.g. spinner knob for arm weakness due to stroke). Each session will comprise of 30 minutes driving on the simulator with 5 minutes break in between and 10 minutes of video playback of performance in order to increase awareness of errors. 
In order to examine the occurrence of simulator sickness in participants, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire will be administered in sessions 1,5 and 8 (Kennedy, Lane, Berbaum, &amp; Lilienthal, 1993). This will allow us to monitor any patient discomfort as well as identify barriers to compliance. In order to monitor adherence, a log of attendance at sessions will be taken.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be compose of individuals receiving treatment as standard. These participants will be involved in standard outpatient rehabilitation consisting of a range of allied health therapies including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, psychology and neuropsychology services. They will not receive the simulator rehabilitation.</comparator>

    <concealment>Following recruitment and baseline assessment, participants will be randomized into either simulator training or no simulator training groups stratified by injury cause (TBI vs stroke). Allocation sequences will be transcribed onto cards, and placed into opaque envelopes and pass them into the Study Coordinator. Randomization lists will be separately prepared for TBI (approx. 65% of participants) and Stroke (approx. 35% of participants) patients to ensure equal numbers across strata. Staff conducting follow-up assessments will be masked to group membership and independent of treatment delivery.

    <statisticalmethods>Fishers exact test will be used to compare whether the pass/fail rate is different for standard rehabilitation only and simulator rehabilitation groups.
For those who fail the initial on-road assessment, regression methods suitable for counts, such as Poisson or negative binomial regression will be used to determine whether receiving simulator intervention predicts the number of required on-road rehabilitation sessions to complete driver rehabilitation.
Separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) will be conducted to compare groups on driving confidence and driver self-awareness, adjusting for whether TBI or stroke., Stratification at randomization (TBI, Stroke) and clinically meaningful demographic and injury data will be employed as possible confounders in the ANCOVA model, conducted using (robust if indicated by the presence of skewness in the outcome variables) within a multiple regression framework. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted by calculating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using net costs to successful completion of driving rehabilitation for each participant, as well as health effect data in the form of subjective quality of life ratings and number of weeks to return to driving.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study seeks to investigate the effectiveness of simulated driver rehabilitation methods in reducing time taken and success in return to driving following an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  No commonly agreed best-practice guidelines are currently available to guide the assessment and rehabilitation of driving ability post-ABI in Australia and worldwide. Many current driving assessment and retraining procedures used post-ABI are generic and the reliability, validity and clinical effectiveness of these procedures have yet to be established. In order to develop reliable and valid driving assessment and re-training procedures, a clear evidence-base identifying which specific driving interventions are effective post-ABI is needed. To date, studies investigating rehabilitation methods for driving post-ABI suggest that a functional, top-down approach (involving the full activity of driving a car) generalizes better than less comprehensive to improved driving performance on on-road tests. Due to modern advances in technology, production of and access to sophisticated driving simulators has increased. Given limited and inconsistent evidence surrounding the utility and effectiveness of driving simulators for rehabilitation after ABI, further exploration is warranted.
In this study, participants will be recruited from the Epworth HealthCare Occupational Therapy Driving Assessment and Rehabilitation service. Their decision to participate, or not to participate, will not impact on their treatment. All participants will be involved in standard outpatient rehabilitation (as part of their regular clinical care) however participants allocated to the simulator-training group will dedicate 6 extra hours of their time (8 x 45 minute sessions) to complete the simulator program, in contrast to the standard rehabilitation group, who will not complete the program. 
While we do not anticipate or advocate for simulators to completely replace on-road driving rehabilitation, we propose that simulator-based training may improve pass rates for on-road assessment and reduce the total number of costly on-road rehabilitation sessions required by people returning to driving. Furthermore, simulators may act as a starting block for drivers who either lack confidence or are judged too risky to engage in on-road driving rehabilitation, and facilitate increased engagement in driving rehabilitation as a result.
