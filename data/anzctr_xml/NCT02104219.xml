  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiographic Global Impression of Change - RGI-C - The RGI-C scale is a 7-point ordinal scale that is used to evaluate musculoskeletal characteristics of HPP (eg, metaphyseal fraying, demineralization of distal metaphyses). The scores range from -3 (severe worsening) to +3 (complete or near-complete healing).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between Baseline (earliest available, complete, and readable x-ray set) and all available, readable post-Baseline x-ray sets during the period of patients' aged 5 to 15 years, inclusive.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Height Z-score From Baseline to Last Assessment - Height measurements were assigned to Z-scores which were calculated using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2000 growth charts and methodology. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. Higher Z-scores indicate a better outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any available growth data during the period of patients' aged 5 to 15 years, inclusive. Baseline is the earliest available assessment while post baselines are time points after Baseline during the defined age period.</timepoint>
