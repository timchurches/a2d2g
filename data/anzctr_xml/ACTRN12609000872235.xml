  <interventions>
    <interventions>compare the two different group using the holter metodology for cardiac autonomic control analysis (24hour eletrocardiogram monitorization). The volunteers come to the lab and the equipament (holter) is installed on the subject, staying with the holter for 24hours. The next day the subject come back to the lab to desinstall the equipament. The data is recorded during the 24 hour by a memory card for further analysis. This procedure is done just one time. It is a cross sectional study.
The two groups studied are: Group 1: non active men (at least 6 months without practioning any physical activity); Group 2: men who had participated of a 16week strength training offerd by our lab.</interventions>
