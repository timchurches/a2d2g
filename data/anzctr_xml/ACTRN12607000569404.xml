    <interventions>The study medication used is 4g Omega 3 fatty acid (4 1g capsules per day (46% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 38% docosapentaenoic acid (DHA)) and 100mg aspirin (1 100mg tablet per day). Participants can randomised to 6 arms; 
1. Omega 3 fatty acid and aspirin, 
2. Omega 3 fatty acid and aspirin placebo, 
3. Omega 3 fatty acid placebo and aspirin, 
4. Omega 3 fatty acid placebo and aspirin placebo, 
5. Omega 3 fatty acid (participants already taking aspirin) 
6. Omega 3 fatty acid placebo (participants already taking aspirin)
Participants start the study medication 24 hours prior to AVF surgery and contiune to 12 Week visit</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AVF Access Failure which is a composite of Thrombosis (absence of a thrill or bruit clinically and/or the requirement of Rescue Intervention), AVF Abandonment (permanent abandonment of study AVF) and Cannulation Failure (failure to successfully cannulate the study AVF in 8 or more of the 12 HD sessions during the Cannulation Assessment Period).
Cannulation Assessment Period (CAP) is based on when the patient commences maintenance haemodialysis (HD); If the participant starts HD prior to Week 12, the CAP starts from the first HD session after Week 12, if the partticipant start HD after Week 12, the CAP start at the first HD session.</outcome>

    <concealment>Each of the two interventions will be studied using a matching placebo, in order to make this a double-blind trial. At the completion of treatment, patients and investigators will be asked which treatment they believe the patient has been receiving, in order to have a measure of the degree of effectiveness of blinding. In addition, the primary outcome of AVF Access Failure will be made by an independent observer, unaware of the patientâ€™s treatment assignment. Participants are centrally randomised using the online system Flexetrials</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be achieved using a permuted block method, balancing over the two stratification factors of 1) study site and 2) upper versus lower arm AVF</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The event rate for the primary outcome (AVF Access Failure)
is estimated to be 30% at twelve months in the control group. To achieve a 30% relative risk reduction is achievable with omega-3 fatty acids, then with 80% power and a significance level of 5%, 954 study subjects will be required. This allows for 5% drop-in from placebo to active treatment, 5% drop-out from study treatment (to no treatment  assumed equivalent to placebo), and 5% loss to follow-up. This is equivalent to an observed relative risk reduction of 24%.  Without adjustment for compliance, the study size needed would have been 734 subjects.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>FAVOURED is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial design. The objectives of this trial are to determine whether the use of the omega-3 fatty acids and to a lesser extent, aspirin, will effectively improve postsurgical outcomes for patients with de novo arterio-venous fistulae (AVF). The study population are patients with stage IV or V chronic kidney disease who require or will require haemodialysis and who are scheduled to undergo creation of an AVF. The primary outcome is AVF Access Failure, which is a composite of Thrombosis, AVF Abandonment, and Cannulation Failure during the Cannulation Assessment Period. Secondary outcomes include AVF access failure according to strata of aspirin use, safety and adverse events of omega-3 fatty acids and aspirin alone or in combination, catheter use, and rescue interventions.</summary>
