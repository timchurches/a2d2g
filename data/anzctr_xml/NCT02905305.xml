  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In an effort to further preserve residual acoustic hearing after cochlear implantation, it
      may be beneficial to incorporate anti-inflammatory agents into the electrode array for
      passive elution over a time course after implantation. This study aims to assess the ease and
      effectiveness of such an electrode design, and to assess the preliminary safety of use of
      such a device in the post-operative period. This study is a first-time-in-human study of the
      investigational device.

      In the first instance, the aim of the current investigation is to obtain first experience in
      use of a Combined Device in the adult clinical population, and to assess tools and techniques
      that may be considered in future clinical studies of similar devices.</summary>
