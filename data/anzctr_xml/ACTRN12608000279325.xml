  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the research project is to compare a family-centred model of care in paediatric speech pathology with usual paediatric speech pathology practice performed at Ballarat Health Services. The project will also explore parent/carer satisfaction/dissatisfaction with family-centred care.
Hypotheses
1.  The family-centred model of care will produce similar speech and language outcomes compared to usual speech pathology practice.
2.  Goals (as measured by the Goal Attainment Scale) will be achieved more successfully following a family-centred model of care compared to usual speech pathology practice.
3.  Parents will be more satisfied with the family-centred model of care compared to those whose children participate in the usual practice model.</summary>
