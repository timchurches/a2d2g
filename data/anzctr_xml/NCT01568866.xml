  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival - Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause. Participants were evaluated for disease response and progression according to the International Myeloma Working Group-Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC) as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).
Median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants with no baseline disease assessments, starting a new anticancer therapy before documentation of disease progression or death, death or disease progression immediately after more than 1 consecutively missed disease assessment visit, or alive without documentation of disease progression before the data cut-off date were censored.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until the data cut-off date of 10 November 2014; median follow-up time for PFS was 11.1.and 11.9 months in the bortezomib and carfilzomib arms respectively</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death (whatever the cause). Participants who were alive or lost to follow-up as of the data analysis cut-off date were censored at the patient's date of last contact (last known to be alive).
Median overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until the data cut-off date of 10 November 2014; median follow-up time for OS was 11.9 and 12.5 months for each treatment group respectively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response - Disease response was evaluated according to the IMWG-URC by the IRC. Overall response was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of partial response (PR), very good PR (VGPR), complete response (CR) or stringent CR (sCR).
sCR: As for CR, normal serum free light chain (SFLC) ratio and no clonal cells in bone marrow (BM).
CR: No immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and &lt; 5% plasma cells in BM biopsy; VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not electrophoresis or = 90% reduction in serum M-protein with urine M-protein &lt;100 mg/24 hours. A = 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas if present at baseline.
PR: = 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in urine M-protein by = 90% or to &lt; 200 mg/24 hours. A = 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas if present at baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Disease response was assessed every 28 days until end of treatment or the data cut-off date of 10 November 2014; median duration of treatment was 27 weeks in the bortezomib group and 40 weeks in the carfilzomib treatment group.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Duration of response (DOR) was calculated for participants who achieved an sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR. Duration of response is defined as the time from first evidence of PR or better to confirmation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Median duration of response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants with no baseline disease assessments, starting a new anticancer therapy before documentation of disease progression or death, death or disease progression immediately after more than 1 consecutively missed disease assessment visit, or alive without documentation of disease progression before the data cut-off date were censored.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until the data cut-off date of 10 November 2014; median follow-up time for DOR was 9.4 and 10.4 months for each treatment group respectively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With = Grade 2 Peripheral Neuropathy - Neuropathy events were defined as Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy as specified by peripheral neuropathy Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query, narrow (scope) (SMQN) terms.
Peripheral neuropathy was assessed by neurologic exam and graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03:
Grade 1: Asymptomatic; Grade 2: Moderate symptoms, limiting instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) Grade 3: Severe symptoms; limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: Death.</outcome>
