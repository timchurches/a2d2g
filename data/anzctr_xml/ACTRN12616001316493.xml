  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a double blinded, randomised, placebo controlled, cross-over trial
This trial will involve 30 healthy participants who will be randomised to two treatment groups, each group consisting of 15 participants. In the first group, the 15 participants will take the nutrient  supplement (Lester's Oil) or placebo for 4 weeks. Each nutrient capsule is made up mainly of six ingredients: vitamin D:25-OH (500IU), long chain PUFA-Omega-3 from fish oil [more than 500mg] as well as  CoQ10 (50mg), zeaxanthin (0.82mg),  lutein (3mg) and astaxanthin (500mcg). Each nutrient capsule  also contains natural mixed tocopherols, vitamin E with ascorbyl palmitate (1mg) and is enclosed in a soft gel composed of gelatin, glycerine soft gel, beeswax and natural annatto. This will follow with a 4 week period of no supplementation and then another four week period of taking a similarly encapsulated medium-chain tryglyceride oil placebo. The placebo  was a Medium Chain triglyceride oil  [MCT- 8+10 Triglyceride] (MCT). Its major components were FAD - C6:0 Caproic 0.0 2.0%; FAD - C8:0 Caprylic 50.0 -80.0 %; FAD - C10:0 Capric 20.0 -50.0 %; FAD - C12:0 Lauric 0.03.0 %.
Two capsules of the nutrient supplement or placebo were taken daily, (orally), with the participants lunch or dinner meal

The second group will take the encapsulated medium-chained oil placebo for the first four weeks, followed by a four week period of no supplementation. The nutrient supplement will then be taken for the remaining four weeks,

All participants are blinded to the treatment regime they are on.

The levels of CoQ10 were determined in serum for each trial participant at each collection point as a measure of dietary uptake and compliance in the study. Participants were also asked to return their containers of left over capsules (more  capsules than needed by the study were given) and these were counted as another indicator of compliance.

The number of participants selected for this trial was based on the Jorgensens et al. Vitamin D3 treatment in Crohns diseasea randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study  (Jorgensen SP, Agnholt J, Glerup H, Lyhne S, Villadsen GE, Hvas CL, et al. Clinical trial: vitamin D3 treatment in Crohns diseasea randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2010;32(3):377-83) .This data indicates that the difference in the response of matched pairs is normally distributed with standard deviation 4.  If the true difference in the mean response of matched pairs is 27 we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power) 1.000.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  Based on these prior data, the proposed numbers are appropriate to detect a true difference in the key outcome measure (vitamin D level).

    <summary>Introduction: 
Diet is a key component in the disease susceptibility of individuals. Vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Co-enzyme Q10 and carotenoids are associated with immune regulatory functions. Vitamin D supplementation, omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants have been shown to be beneficial in reducing inflammation especially in people with inflammatory disorders e.g. inflammatory bowel disease.

Study Design: 
Double blinded, randomised, with cross-over. The study population (n=30) was recruited from Auckland, New Zealand. The intervention , the nutrient supplement, Lester's Oil - Registered trade mark) or the control (the medium chain triglyceride-[MCT- 8+10 Triglycerides] was for four weeks, followed by a washout of four weeks followed by the control or intervention for four weeks. 

Methods 
Blood, urine and faecal samples were collected before and after each 4 week intervention from the participants and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin), vitamin D:25-OH, plasma lipid metabolic profiling (FAMES), lipid profiles, Co-enzyme Q10, carotenoids,  lipid peroxidation, and full blood count measures were taken. A food variety score (FVS), Quality of Life (QoL) and stool questionnaires were also conducted. The QoL score was measured using a numeric scale from 1  10. The FVS was a list of foods and participants indicated which ones were eaten over each seven day time period. The stool chart measured daily frequency, ease, volume and consistency of each stool on a number scale. The outcomes of interest were measured at baseline, and the end of each phase or at the end of the trial.
