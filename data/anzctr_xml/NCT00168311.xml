  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is pilot data to suggest the therapeutic value of rTMS applied to the left prefrontal
      cortex in the treatment of negative symptoms. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate abnormal
      activity in this region in patients experiencing negative symptoms. Finally rTMS applied at
      high frequency shows the capacity to up-regulate cortical activity in a way that would
      provide an explanation for a therapeutic response.

      The study involves participants receiving 15 sessions of high frequency rTMS treatment
      applied bilaterally to the prefrontal cortex over a 3 week period or sham rTMS. Following
      this double blind phase, participants randomised to placebo treatment will be offered 15
      sessions of active treatment.

      In addition, ppTMS (paired pulse TMS) will be conducted prior to the onset of treatment and
      after completion of the course, as a means of measuring cortical inhibition and facilitation.
      NIRS (Near Infra red spectroscopy) will also be conducted prior to, during and after the
      first and last treatment sessions to allow monitoring of oxygenated and deoxygenated
      haemoglobin.</summary>
