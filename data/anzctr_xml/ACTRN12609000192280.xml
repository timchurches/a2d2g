  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Islets inside microcaspules, made from alginate that is extracted from seaweed,  are infused into the peritoneal cavity to overcome the need for exogenous insulin administration.  Up to 4 infusions are carried out per patient, with each infusion the maximum number of islets obtained from a human pancreas donated after death.  Average is 178,200 islet equivalents per infusion.</interventions>
    <comparator>The patients are their own controls.  All are C-peptide negative, so any production of C-peptide must be a result of the transplant.  Glycaemic control and insulin requirments post transplant are compared with individual patient values pre-transplantation.</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Devices</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To normalize blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes patients and no previous evidence of beta cell function, without the need for exogenous insulin.

Method used for assessment:
1. Blood glucose monitoring by patients
2. Daily exogenous insulin requirements.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily for up to 12 months after islet infusion</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The dynamics of insulin production from the grafted cells.  This is assessed in two ways:
1. 24 hour urinary C-peptide and creatinine (C-peptide index = 100 x [C-peptide (pmol/mL)] / [creatinine (mol/mL)].  All patients are initially C-peptide negative.
2. serum C-peptide after 5g intravenous arginine up to 12 months, or longer if there is insulin production from the graft</outcome>
      <timepoint>Urinary C-peptide: at 1,3 &amp; 5 days, 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4  weeks, 2,3, 4 5, 6 8,10,12, and 3 monthly thereafter if the graft is functioning.  Each time point relates to time from each islet infusion.
Arginine stimulation test:  at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 &amp; 24mo, yearly thereafter, if the graft is functioning.
Final endpoint is October 2008, a total of 33 months after the first infusion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety
(a) the safety of injecting encapsulated human islets into people with type 1 diabetes (pain and infection are the assessment criteria)
(b) if cytotoxic antibodies are produced 
(c) if there is recurrence of autoimmune activation</outcome>
      <timepoint>(a) Safety of injecting encapsulated islets:  on day of infusion and daily over the next week. 
(b) cytotoxic antibodies: monthly
(c) islet cell antibodies: at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 &amp; 24mo, yearly thereafter, if the graft is functioning.
Final endpoint is October 2008, a total of 33 months after the first infusion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>normal body weight, that is, body mass index &lt; 30, but ideally &lt;25.
(b) age 18-50 years
(c) no insulin production from their pancreas 
(d) (i) difficulty in controlling blood glucose levels despite compliance with insulin injections, physical activity and food intake. This difficulty is impacting on the quality of life. 
     (ii) unable to recognise the symptoms of low blood glucose levels for whom no other strategy has been successful.
     (iii) special situations, e.g., rapid falls in blood glucose levels resulting in epilepsy and where anti-epileptic medication is unsuitable.  

Each case will be considered on its merit, but the benefit must exceed the risk.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1.  Does not fit the above criteria.
2.  Residual function of recipients pancreatic beta cells, as assessed by C-peptide production.
3. Body mass index &gt; 30.
4. Pregnancy.
