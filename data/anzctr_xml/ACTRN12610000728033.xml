  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will include three sessions per week for 30 minutes per session.  Participants will be part of a group of two or three, working with one personal trainer in each session.  All sessions will be supervised by the personal trainer to ensure correct technique and to monitor the appropriate amount of exercise and rest intervals. The resistance programme will be periodised to allow progressive increases in the resistance training programme based on the individuals ability and adaptation to the resistance training intervention.  The 30 minutes sessions will begin with 5 minutes warm up on a stationary bicycle or walking on a treadmill.  This will be followed by 20 minutes of high intensity resistance training using body weight exercises, strength machines and free weight exercises.  The 30 minute sessions will conclude with 5 minutes warm down on a stationary cycle. When an individual shows they can easily complete a strength exercise with appropriate technique, they will progress on to a more challenging weight or exercise.  The specific resistance exercises chosen for each individual will be introduced dependant on the individuals personal ability and experience.  The workout will also be varied at each session by the personal trainer dependant on the individuals energy levels, muscle soreness and performance at the specific session.     The sessions will be offered at a variety of times across the full seven day week to ensure that there are times which are suitable for the participants.  
The personal trainer facilitated sessions will cease following 12 weeks, though membership at the gym will continue for a further 12 weeks, to allow the non-coached attendance rates to be monitored.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This proposal seeks to conduct a feasibility study to assess the impact of the use of a personal trainer supported gym based resistance exercise programme for Pacific adults on adherence, insulin sensitivity, body composition, costs and satisfaction.  This innovative study will explore a previously unused role in chronic disease management as well as develop our understanding of resistance exercise and insulin sensitivity.</summary>
