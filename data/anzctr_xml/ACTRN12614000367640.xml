  <interventions>
    <interventions>The impact of the ten weeks treatment with use:

Arm 1. Manual therapy and Neuromobilisation - First Group
[Functional massage of the descending part of the trapezius (duration 3 min.). The 20 therapeutic sessions were performed twice a week.]
[Mobilization techniques described by Shacklock were used. Three series with 10 repetitions were used. The duration of one mobilisation was 15 s with a rest period of 10 s. Gliding and tension mobilisations of the median nerve were performed in the median neurodynamic test position (median neurodynamic test 1  NM 1) with support. One-direction proximal and distal slider mobilisations and one-direction proximal and distal tension mobilisations were performed. The standard approach was to perform three series of 60 repetitions of glide and tension mobilisations. The duration of the inter-series intervals was 15s. The 20 therapeutic sessions were performed twice a week].

Arm 2. Laser and Ultrasound - Second group
[Laser therapy was performed using a contact method at three points on the palmar surface of the wrist in the transverse ligament area. Each procedure started with a red laser (using a R650/50 probe) emitting 658 nm light at 50 mW; the duration of biostimulation was 1 min 40s. The dose was 5J. Next, an infrared laser (with a IR810/400 probe) emitting 808 nm light at 400 mW was used; the duration of the biostimulation was 1 min. The dose was 24J. Thus, each point was stimulated for two minutes 40 s. The entire procedure was eight minutes long. 20 laser sessions were performed twice a week].
[Ultrasound therapy was used to treat the palmar surface of the hand in the transverse ligament area. The following parameters were used: frequency 1 MHz, intensity 1.0 W/ cm squared and impulse mode with a pulse width factor of 75%. Each procedure was 15 minutes long. 20 laser sessions were performed twice a week]

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nerve conduction:
Examinations of nervous conduction was performed in the electromyography laboratory by experienced personnel. The examination was performed by an antidromic method using a Neuro-Mep instrument, with superficial electrodes. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and after therapy completion (10 weeks), and 1 month later post completion of therapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feeling two-point discrimination:
The examination of two-point discrimination sensation was performed with the use of its static variety by assessing innervation density in slowly adapting touch receptors. A standardised Dellon discriminator was used for the study. </outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of pain:
A Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), which is a subjective method of pain evaluation by the patient, was used.

    <concealment>Patients were randomised by drawing lots with the group number. Individuals who drew the number “1” were assigned to the first group and those that drew number “2” were assigned to the second group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using procedures like coin-tossing and dice-rolling 
Each consecutive patient that was not excluded and that met the inclusion criteria was randomly assigned either to the neural mobilisation (NM - first group) or physical therapy (PT - second group) group. Patients were randomised by drawing lots with the group number. The persons that drew number ‘1’ were assigned to the NM group and those that drew number ‘2’ were assigned to the PT group. </sequence>
