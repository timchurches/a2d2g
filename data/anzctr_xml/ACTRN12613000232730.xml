  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a 12-week randomised controlled trial testing one intervention. Participants in the intervention group will receive a booklet containing factsheets about iron and a goal system promote dietary habits that may maximise iron absorption. The goal system encourages participants to 1) eat two iron-fortified products each day, 2) eat 50 mg of vitamin C with meals, 3) using a point system where foods are assigned points depending on iron content, consume at least 12 points per day, and 4) drink coffee/tea away from meals. Participants will be encouraged to follow the goals through weekly emails and text messages.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive an Australian Guide to Healthy Eating booklet and a goal system will encourage participants to: 1) limit intake of saturated fat, 2) choose wholegrain foods, 3) reduce sodium intake, and 4) aim to eat 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables daily over the 12 week period. Participants will be encouraged to follow the goals through weekly emails and text messages.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous studies have shown mixed results on the ability of dietary interventions to improve iron status in women with iron deficiency. Given the popularity of email and mobile phones, communicating through email and text messages may be a promising means to encourage iron-friendly eating habits throughout the day. The aim of this study is to investigate whether email and text messages can improve knowledge, iron intake, and iron stores in women with low iron stores.</summary>
