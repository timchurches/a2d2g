  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adefovir dipivoxil 10mg tablets were approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B by the TGA in 2003 and are now marketed as Hepsera(r) by Gilead Sciences. Patients who are not resistant to another anti-hepatitis B virus drug called lamivudine are not able to access Hepsera at a PBS reimbursed price.

Patients who participated in the adefovir dipivoxil clinical trials GS-98-437, GS-98-438, and GS-00-480 and are still taking adefovir dipivoxil have never received lamivudine and thus cannot receive Hepsera at reduced price. This study will allow the patients to continue accessing adefovir free of charge and provide unprecedented data on the long-term safety and efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil without changing the procedures and tests routinely done during normal visits to the clinic.</summary>
