  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment group will receive deeper planes of volatile general anaesthesia for the duration of surgery with a bispectral index (BIS) targeted at 30-40. (ie the dose of volatile general anaesthesia will be titrated to the BIS)</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive volatile general anaesthesia for the duration of surgery with a bispectral index (BIS) of 50-60. (ie the dose of volatile general anaesthesia will be titrated to the BIS)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our primary aim is to determine whether depth of volatile general anaesthesia, as measured by BIS, influences early post-operative pain scores and analgesic requirements in patients undergoing elective surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Visual analogue pain score, patient controlled analgesia morphine consumption and incidence of nausea and vomiting will be assessed daily from days 0 to 2 post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary aim of our study is to assess whether depth of volatile general anaesthesia, as measured by BIS, influences persistent post-operative pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A functional assessment of persistent pain, analgesic requirements and limitations of activities of daily living will occur through a single telephone call at 3 months post-operatively and again at 6 months post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <concealment>Pre-operatively a verbal explanation and a written information sheet will be given to patients including a description of the pain assessment tools and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device to be used post-operatively. Pre-operative written informed consent will be obtained for all study participants. Consenting participants will then undergo block randomisation via sealed opaque envelope to be opened by the participantâ€™s anaesthetist prior to surgery. Participants will be randomised to either treatment or control protocol pre-operatively.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent studies have shown that the amount of general anaesthesia administered during an operation may influence pain and pain relief needed after surgery. We plan to use a brain monitor called bispectral index (BIS) to investigate a possible relationship between general anaesthesia and pain after surgery. We also plan to further investigate whether differing intensity of post-operative pain is influenced by either different genetic sensitivity to pain, or the body excreting fentanyl more quickly.</summary>
