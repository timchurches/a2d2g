  <interventions>
    <interventions>The characteristics of all shoes include: an enclosed walking shoe, adequate cushioning, good motion control, midsole stability and sufficient width at the forefoot. 
Shoe A: A walking shoe with cushioning and motion control. Cost at retail: $40.
Shoe B: A casual walking shoe with minimal cushioning but additional tread for motion control. Cost at retail: $40.
Shoe C: A walking shoe that promotes cushioning and stability. Cost at retail: $40. 
Shoe D: A shoe that provides cushioning, motion control, midsole stability and additional width at the forefoot. Cost at retail: $150.

Feasibility Part 1: Randomised crossover study for intervention evaluation
Each participant will complete the baseline measurements and be randomised to one of the 24 possible crossover sequences of the four footwear types. Participants will be asked to complete a walking circuit that includes walking on carpet, on a hard level surface and ascending and descending stairs for each type of the footwear and their own footwear. Measurements will be carried out after each circuit. To reduce fatigue, each participant will be allowed to rest for 5 min between footwear changes. All footwear will be covered with surgical booties held in place with tape, so the footwear brand being worn will be unknown to the participant.  Following completion of the measurements, the identity of the four footwear types will be revealed to the participants. Each participant will be asked by the researcher to identify the most important features on a check-list and choose the most comfortable shoe. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be evaluated. We anticipate 60mins to complete all measurements. 

Feasibility Part 2: Prospective observational study for sustainability evaluation

Immediately after the data collection is completed in part 1, participants will commence part 2. During part 2, participants will wear the most comfortable footwear they chose in part 1 over a period of 8 weeks. Each participant will be given a study diary to complete over the 8 weeks and will note the amount of time the footwear was worn each day, any flares, pain or discomfort. At the eight-week follow-up both primary and secondary outcomes will be recorded.</interventions>
    <comparator>In Part 1 the control intervention is the patients own footwear. The comparator intervention is the four types of new footwear based upon cost and footwear characterstics.

In Part 2 the patients will wear the footwear of choice based upon the findings of part 1 over 8 weeks.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>The study design involves two parts. Part 1 is a randomised crossover design and Part 2 a prospective observational study over 8-weeks. In both parts the participants and outcome measures are the same. However, in Part 1, all data will be collected in a single session at the time of measurement, whereas in Part 2 data will be collected after eight weeks. Eight weeks was chosen so that meaningful clinical data can be collected. A health care professional researcher will collate the data.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gout is major problem in Aotearoa New Zealand. Previous research has shown that patients reported comfort, fit, support and cost as important factors in choosing their own footwear. The proposed research design is aiming to undertake a feasibility study looking at key issues such as identifying an inexpensive walking shoe, recruitment, footwear acceptability and calculating the numbers required for a future clinical trial. At the first visit the objectives are to evaluate four different types of walking shoe and measure pain, comfort, footwear characteristics, acceptability and foot function. Each participant will be randomised to one type of shoe and measured again after 8 weeks. After 8 weeks the same measures taken on the first visit will be obtained. In the long term we will see further funding from HRC to undertake a clinical trial based upon the results from the feasibility study</summary>
