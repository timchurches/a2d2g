  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is commonly used in cardiac surgery to maintain blood flow to the brain. However, loss of pulse pressure during CPB means that brain blood flow may be low and brain oxygen levels may fall. This may be bad and affect brain performance after surgery. Oxygen levels in the brain can be monitored with Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and brain performance can be assessed with psychological tests. One way to improve brain blood flow and oxygen levels may be to target a slightly higher carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the blood during and after CPB. This is because even a slight increase in CO2 can open up the blood vessels to the brain, increase blood flow to it and increase oxygen levels for brain cells. However, targeting such slightly higher CO2 levels in this setting has not been formally studied.

The aim of this study is to compare the changes in cerebral oxygen levels (SctO2) and psychological test-assessed brain performance when a mildly increased CO2 level is targeted compared with a normal CO2 level during and after CPB. We plan to study forty adult patients having CPB (twenty targeting normal CO2 levels and twenty targeting mildly increased CO2 levels), and to measure their SctO2 and psychological test performance prior to surgery and before hospital discharge.
 
The information derived from our investigation will be used by doctors to improve oxygen levels in the brain of patients during and after CPB in the future.</summary>
