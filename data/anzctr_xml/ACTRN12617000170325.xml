  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assessments of the elasticity / stiffness of the joints, skin and arteries.
1. Participants will answer a simple 5-point questionnaire asking questions about the mobility of their joints.
2. An assessor will painlessly assess the range of motion of the joints of the finger joints, wrists, elbows, knees and spine.
3. The flexibility of the right 5th finger will be formally tested in a device that stretches the finger backwards using specific forces (torques).
4. The skin elasticity will be evaluated first by drawing two dots 10 mm apart on th dorm of the right hand and measuring how far they can be stretched apart by the examiner. 
5. The skin elasticity of the solar aspect of the right forearm will be measured as the volume of skin/tissue that can be drawn into the barrel of a 50mL syringe (plunger removed) in response to specific negative pressures.
6. The thickness of the skin will be measured at both sites using a pair of Harpenden skin fold callipers.
7. Arterial stiffest will be firstly measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (the delay between the the carotid and femoral pulses measured using a pressure transducer applied to the carotid and an inflatable cuff around the thigh. Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity will be repeated on a second occasion 1 day - 4 weeks of the first assessment. Then endothelial fiction, the ability to dilate, will be measured as the strength of the pulses in the finger tips after a 5 minute period of complete occlusion of blood flow to the left arm using an inflatable cuff.

Assessment of the severity of arthritis (in the rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis groups)
1. Severity of arthritis will be evaluated as the number of tender and swollen joints, blood tests for inflammation (ESR, CRP) (to determine how well arthritis is controlled) and 
2. The strength of treatment required to achieve this control (what drugs the participant is receiving).

These assessments will be conducted over two visits. The majority of the assessments can be completed on the first visit. Upon the second visit carotid-femora pulse wave velocity will be measured a second time and any assessments not already conducted on the first occasion will be completed on the second occasion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A specially designed device constructed from Meccano will be used to measure angular displacement of 5th finger metacarpophalangeal joint in response to torque applied to extend the finger. The right hand is strapped into the device positioned such that the 5th finger MCP can be extended by rotation of a lever arm attached to a pulley through which forces can be applied to generate a range of torques to extend the finger.  </outcome>

Study participants will include patients receiving high dose corticosteroids for any indication that does not affect the skin. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The currently accepted paradigm holds that systemic autoimmunity and inflammation have a directly causal relationship with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and with the associated cardiovascular (CV) disease. However, the evidence supporting this paradigm is inconclusive and possibly contradicted but clinical studies. 

The T-BIRD study inverts the existing paradigm to explore the hypothesis that while autoimmunity sets the stage for the development of arthritis, it is the connective tissue biomechanical properties (stiffness) that:
1.	Determine the risk of developing RA and PsA
2.	Influence the severity of the RA and PsA and;
3.	Determine the severity of the CV disease seen in association with RA and PsA .

If this hypothesis is confirmed then a considerable part of the inheritance of RA and PsA (much of which remains unaccounted for) might be explained. There would also be important clinical implications as it would change the way clinicians undertake risk assessment and therapeutic decisions in managing inflammatory arthritis and its associated cardiovascular disease. 

This preliminary study will begin exploring this hypothesis by evaluating the relationship between articular biomechanical characteristics in the joints, skin and arteries and exploring the relationships between tissue biomechanical properties upon rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis and vascular and cutaneous disease.
