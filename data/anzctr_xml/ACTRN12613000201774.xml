  <interventions>
    <interventions>Recording of Evoked Compound Action Potentials during Deep Brain Stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus. With every stimulation pulse, nerves near the deep brain electrode respond by sending an action potential signal down the nerve. Sensitive recording equipment is used to detect and record these action potential signals as they travel past the recording electrode. The stimulation is delivered at 130 pulses/second and recording occurs on on each pulse. For this trial the stimulation and recording will take about 20 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ability to record evoked neural responses (Evoked Compound Action Potentials). Sensitive stimulation and recording equipment will be used to record and display neural signals from the deep brain electrodes. With averaging (from 2 to 100 averages), any neural activity that is triggered by the stimulus (evoked responses) will become apparent in the average signal display. The primary outcome is to demonstrate that these evoked responses can be recorded in the operating room. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Intra-operative</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effect of changing stimulation electrode. The stimulation system will be reprogrammed to stimulate on 1 of 4 electrodes (4 electrodes/lead). Neural signals will be recorded on the remaining electrodes and changes in amplitude, latency and time course of the evoked responses will be measured. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Intra-operative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effect of changing pulse width. Similar to changing electrodes, the stimulation will be reprogrammed to use 3-5 pulse widths. Neural signals will be recorded and changes in amplitude, latency and time course of the evoked responses will be measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intra-operative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measurement of refractory period. The stimulation system will be programmed to deliver two identical pulses with varying delays between the two - from 100 microseconds to 5 milliseconds. The amplitude of the evoked response to the second pulse will be measured. At short delays, the 2nd response will not occur (absolute refractory period) and as the delay gets longer the 2nd response will begin to grow (relative refractory period) back to control amplitudes. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Intra-operative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measurement of evoked compound action potentials and local field potentials during movement. During stimulation, evoked responses  will be measured as the Neurologist passively moves the patients limbs and when the patient actively moves their limbs. Changes in amplitude, latency and time course of the evoked potentials will be measured. Additionally, non-evoked background neural activity (local field potentials) will be measured during the above manoeuvres and changes in amplitude and frequency content of the neural signal measured.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Intra-operative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The central aim of the study is to determine if Evoked Compound Action Potentials (ECAPs) can be recorded during Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). During the DBS lead implant procedure, specialised stimulating and recording equipment will be connected to the lead. Routine stimulation will be applied to the implanted lead electrodes and neural responses (ECAPs) will be recorded from the adjacent electrodes. Measurement of the ECAP responses may provide information to improve the implant procedure and stimulation programming, and provide information on the mechanisms of DBS.  </summary>
