    <summary>This is a randomized double blind placebo controlled study of azacitidine with or without
      birinapant in subjects with higher risk Myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary MDS or
      myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) who are naïve, to azacitidine therapy. Pre-clinical and
      mechanistic studies support that azacitidine may modulate pathways that enable
      birinapant-mediated anti-tumor activity.</summary>
