  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fortnightly medication counselling and education by a qualified pharmacist who has been trained to work with renal dialysis patients. 

Each session will consist of approximately 45 minutes and will focus on a particular topic (medicines for calcium regulation, blood pressure control et cetera). Each session is administered on a one-on-one basis. 

Each patient will receive 12 counselling sessions. Patients will receive self-assessment tools and memory aids to use during the sessions and take home afterwards. Patients will also receive Waikato Dialysis Unit standard of care. </interventions>
    <comparator>Waikato Dialysis Unit standard of care. This will include a monthly results/chart review and 3 monthly clinic assessment including with dietician input</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum phospate levels in millimoles per litre (mmol/L). This is measured via serum assay (phosphate level) monthly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months and twelve months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of patients who achieve end dialysis target body weight. 

Target body weight is determined by the renal doctors. It is the lowest weight a patient can reach in the presence of a normal blood pressure and no signs of fluid build up.
Nurses normally record the weight of the patient before and after dialysis and compare it to the target weight. Referrals will be made to the doctor for a review of target weight and dialysis regimen if a patient regularly fails to meet target body weight after dialysis.  
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months and twelve months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ultrafiltration volume (litres). 

Each patient has a target weight determined by the doctors. Nurses take a pre-dialysis weight and then compare it to the target weight to determine how much fluid the patient gained in-between dialysis. The difference between the pre-dialysis weight and the target weight determines the Ultrafiltration volume (the amount of fluid that will be remove during the dialysis).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months and twelve months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Haemoglobulin level in millimoles per litre (mmol/L).

This is measured by a full blood count test monthly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months and twelve months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Calcium level in millimoles per litre (mmol/L). 

This is measured via serum assay (calcium level) monthly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months and twelve months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parathyroid hormone levels in picomoles/litre (pmol/L). 

This is measured via serum assay (parathyroid hormone level, 2nd generation assay) three monthly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months and twelve months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm hg).

This is measured via automatic sphygmomanometer to check the patients blood pressure. BP checked before dialysis, every hour during dialysis, and post dialysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months and twelve months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Days of hospitalisation (in days). 

This is measured through medical records, with assistance of audit office/clinical coding.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months and twelve months</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis is by intention-to-treat (patients are analysed in the cohort they are initially assigned to, even if they subsequently choose to leave the study). 

Each cohort is compared with itself (at baseline (average results over a 3 month lead in period) and at the end of the evaluation period).

Each cohort is also compared against the other (at baseline and at the end of the evaluation period).

Analysis will include:

1.	Summary statistics (mean and standard deviation, or median and percentiles, depending on whether the data are normally distributed or not).
2.	Hypothesis significance test (0.05 and 0.01 level).
3.	Parameter estimates (95% and 99% confidence intervals, if the distribution of the data allows this). 

The sample size was calculated pragmatically, based on the maxium number of patients we had pharmacist time funded to provide counselling for. This determined the size of the intervention group, and the same size was used for the control group. No power calculations were performed. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the achievement of treatment goals in patients who receive pharmacist medication counselling and education in addition to standard of care compared with patients who receive standard of care. 

This is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this new service, inform best practice at the Waikato Dialysis Unit (and elsewhere in New Zealand), and guide future funding decisions at Waikato DHB.</summary>
