  <interventions>
    <interventions>Consultations with and treatment from a naturopathic student in a supervised clinical environment as part of an existing academic clinic. Participants will consult with a naturopathic student engaged in supervised clinical practicum as part of their naturopathic training. Student naturopaths will follow regular clinical process: full case history, individualised treatment plan development; input and advice from a qualified naturopathic doctor to finalise treatment plan; and discussion of treatment plan with participant, including treatment recommendations and prescriptions as appropriate. Each student naturopath will conduct their consultation in accordance with the legislation, policies, systems and processes appropriate to their country, region and institution. As such, this study will document treatment as it occurs in natural practice, at the discretion of the practitioner. The observation period will last for 12 weeks for each participant.</interventions>

  <eligibility>

    <statisticalmethods>In this uncontrolled study, before and after differences between baseline and endpoint values will be calculated. The eight week endpoint will be the primary endpoint of the study. P values will be set at 0.05. As a pilot study, sample size will be set to as many participants as can be enrolled within a one year period. 

Outcome data will be presented in descriptive and summary form. Secondary analyses will be conducted by country of care, IBS diagnosis status, naturopathic medicine as adjunctive versus sole care, adherence (as determined by patient reported compliance), and severity of baseline condition (as determined by the baseline IBS-SSS score). 

Our primary analysis will describe outcomes as a complete case analysis i.e. only including those participants for whom we have no missing outcome data. We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis for our primary outcome using the last observation carried forward for missing values.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to conduct an international prospective observational before and after study on naturopathic approaches to IBS. This will allow us to better describe naturopathic approaches to this disorder, establish the feasibility of building an international consortium of academic naturopathic clinics as well as the feasibility of recruiting participants. Our ultimate goal is to follow this observational study with a randomized active controlled trial using the same consortium and benefiting from lessons learned during this study. 

Our primary aims are descriptive. We aim to describe naturopathic approaches to IBS as well as establish pilot data on before and after changes in validated IBS instruments. Secondary aims include the feasibility of recruitment and operations across more than 9 sites in 4 countries; the establishment of an international research network of naturopathic teaching clinics; qualitative data gathering around the experience of patients seeking naturopathic care for IBS; and comparing the consensus results of our delphi panel of naturopathic IBS experts to the care received at the teaching clinics.
