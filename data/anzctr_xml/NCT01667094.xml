  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder which results in increased thickness of
      secretions, especially in the lungs. By adulthood, the majority of patients with CF will have
      a bacteria living in their lungs, called Pseudomonas aeruginosa which can cause lung
      infections. This usually results in worsening respiratory symptoms and often an acute
      deterioration in their lung function. They are usually treated with antibiotics that target
      the Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These antibiotics are typically given as short intravenous
      infusions several times a day. This study aims to compare the standard method of giving these
      antibiotics with a different strategy of giving these antibiotics to see if this can improve
      the outcomes of treatment of these infections and reduce the amount of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      in the lungs of these patients. This strategy consists of giving the same antibiotics
      continuously, to ensure there is always enough antibiotic in the bloodstream and the lung to
      be able to kill the bacteria.</summary>
