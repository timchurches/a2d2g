    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if Abatacept given for six months will prevent
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who are at risk for the development of RA in comparison
      to placebo. High risk patients are defined as those having a positive laboratory test for
      anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP2).</summary>
