  <interventions>
    <interventions>Active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) plus sensorimotor retraining will be given twice per week for 10 weeks by a qualified physiotherapist trained in the use of tDCS.

Active tDCS: will be delivered to the primary motor cortex while participants are comfortably and quietly seated. Direct current will be delivered for 20 minutes via two 35cm2 surface sponge electrodes. The active electrode (anode) will be positioned over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the side of worst pain and the reference electrode (cathode) over the contralateral supraorbital region. Current intensity will be ramped up (0 mA to 1 mA) and down (1 mA to 0 mA) over 10 s at the beginning and end of the 20-min stimulation period.
 
Sensorimotor retraining: Immediately following the tDCS intervention, participants will commence 60 minutes of supervised graded sensorimotor retraining. Components of the protocol include localisation and graphesthesia training, laterality recognition, imagined movements and small to full range movements with feedback. Participants will progress through each stage by the physiotherapist based on specific, previously published criteria such as &gt; 80 % accuracy on tactile discrimination or successful dissociation of lumbar from thoracic spine movements (Wand et al 2011). Participants will be provided with a home exercise diary containing visual and written instructions for each exercise (including dosage) and will be asked to practice the training at home for 30 minutes, 3 x per week. The diary will also be used to record adherence to the home program.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) plus sensorimotor retraining will be given twice per week for 10 weeks by a qualified physiotherapist trained in tDCS.

Sham tDCS: For sham stimulation, electrodes will be placed in an identical position to that used for active stimulation. To provide the initial itching sensation, stimulation will be turned on for 15 seconds and then off. Participants will be informed that they may or may not perceive any sensation during the treatment. 

Sensorimotor retraining: identical to that described for the active stimulation group.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility  - composite primary outcome

The number of participants that (i) meet the inclusion criteria, (ii) agree to be randomised, (iii) complete the intervention and, (iv) attend the post-intervention assessment will be calculated in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Feasibility will be measured as (i) the number of treatment sessions attended by each participant, (ii) number of drop-outs in each group, (iii) proportion of participants recruited from the total number screened and, (iv) willingness of each participant to undergo therapy on an 11-point numerical rating scale with not at all willing at 0 and very willing at 10 (measured at baseline) and, (v) the number of home exercise sessions completed. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety

Safety will be assessed as any adverse effect, defined as a response to an intervention which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease, or for the modification of physiological function and that likely has a causal relationship with the intervention (Carlesso, Macdermid, &amp; Santaguida, 2010), reported upon verbal questioning by the treating physiotherapist at each session. A mild tingling or itching sensation under the electrodes, fatigue, headache, nausea, and insomnia have been reported as potential adverse reactions following tDCS (Poreisz, Boros, Antal, &amp; Paulus, 2007). Potential adverse reactions as a result of sensorimotor retraining may include increased pain or muscle soreness in the back. The treating physiotherapist will record a description of any adverse effects along with the severity and duration of symptoms and how the adverse effect was managed. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately following each intervention session, at the conclusion of the 10 week intervention period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain severity

The Brief Pain Inventory will be used to measure pain severity. To assess pain, participants will be asked to complete four numerical rating scales anchored with 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst pain imaginable) for pain at its: i) most intense over the last week, ii) least intense over the last week, iii) average intensity over the last week, and iv) right now. Scores from each scale will be averaged to calculate a final pain severity score out of 10 (Song et al., 2016). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Immediately following conclusion of the 10 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical function

The Brief Pain Inventory will be used to measure physical function. Participants will complete seven numerical rating scales to describe how their back pain interfered with daily life (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relationships with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) in the past week. Each scale will be anchored with 0 (does not interfere with daily life) and 10 (completely interferes). Scores from the seven scales will be averaged to give a final pain interference score out of 10 (Ger, Ho, Sun, Wang, &amp; Cleeland, 1999). 

Self-reported disability and function will also be measured using the 24-point RMDQ which has been shown to be valid and reliable in people with low back pain (Chapman et al., 2011). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Immediately following conclusion of the 10 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Global perceived effect of treatment scale, where each participants perceived response to therapy is assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from completely recovered to vastly worsened will be completed (Hassett et al., 2009). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately following conclusion of the 10 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pressure pain thresholds 

Measured using a hand-held pressure algometer with a probe size of 1cm2.   The probe will be applied perpendicular to the skin (rate 40 kPa/s) until the participant first reports that the sensation of pressure has changed to pain. PPTs will be measured three times at i) the site of worst pain and ii) the contralateral thumbnail. The average of the three measurements at each site will be used in the analysis. PPT measures have been shown to be reliable in chronic LBP (Vuilleumier et al., 2015; Walton et al., 2011).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Immediately following conclusion of the 10 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Heat pain thresholds (HPT) 

Measured using the conditioned pain modulation system. A 30 x 30 mm Peltier-based thermode will be placed on the skin. The temperature will start at 32 degrees celsius and increase at a rate of 0.5 degrees/second. Participants will push a button when the sensation of heat first turns to a sensation of pain. HPTs will be measured at i) the site of worst pain and ii) the bilateral ventral aspect of the forearm (10 cm distal from the elbow crest). Three measurements will be recorded at each site and the average analysed. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Immediately following conclusion of the 10 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Conditioned pain modulation

We will use pressure pain (PPTs) as the test stimulation and heat pain (1 degree celsius above HPT) as the conditioned stimulation. Three PPTs will be measured before the application of heat pain. Heat pain will then be applied via a 30 x 30 mm thermode. Three PPT measurements will be repeated 30 seconds after applying the conditioned stimulation. Participants will be asked to rate their pain during conditioned stimulation on a numeric rating scale (0-100) at 0 s, 30 s and at the end of the trial. Pain scores will be maintained between 50 and 80/100 during testing. Participants will complete two trials in random order: i) test stimulation applied at the most painful lumbar region (indicated by the participant) and conditioned stimulation at the contralateral forearm; ii) test stimulation at the contralateral forearm and conditioned stimulation at the ipsilateral forearm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Immediately following conclusion of the 10 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Temporal summation

Temporal summation will be assessed using a 26g nylon monofilament to apply repeated mechanical stimulation according to the Standardized Evaluation of Pain (StEP) protocol (Scholz et al., 2009). The participant will be asked whether a single filament stimulus provokes pain. If the answer is yes, the participant will then be asked to rate the pain on a numeric rating scale (0-100). If the answer is no, a zero will be recorded on a numeric rating scale.  The filament will then be applied to the skin at a rate of 1 Hz for 30 seconds. The participant will be asked to rate the pain on the numeric rating scale again at the end of the 30 stimuli. Temporal summation will be tested on the most painful area and the dorsal aspect of the non-dominant wrist joint. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for people to seek health care. Of those that report LBP, 44-78% experience a re-occurrence within 12 months, and approximately 25% of individuals develop chronic pain. Despite high prevalence, current treatments for chronic LBP demonstrate at best, small effect sizes. One avenue to improve outcomes in chronic LBP is through the application of combined treatments with synergistic clinical and mechanistic effects. 

Sensorimotor retraining is a novel treatment that incorporates motor control exercise and lumbar tactile retraining and has been shown to be effective in early randomized controlled trials and case studies of chronic LBP. The mechanism underpinning improvements in pain and function with sensorimotor retraining is thought to involve normalization of motor and sensory cortical plasticity and improved pain system function. The addition of a second treatment that targets similar mechanisms may boost the effectiveness of sensorimotor retraining in people with chronic LBP.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, is thought to promote cortical plasticity and improve pain system function through direct effects on the cortex and thalamus, as well as downstream effects on the anterior cingulate cortex and upper brainstem. Studies of healthy individuals and people with some forms of chronic pain suggest that anodal tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex can reduce pain. In addition, the cortical effects of tDCS are hypothesised to increase the brains receptiveness to other treatments, a phenomenon known as priming. Thus, tDCS may optimise the responsiveness of the brain to sensorimotor retraining and improve outcomes beyond that which can be achieved with sensorimotor retraining alone. Despite this, no study has examined the effect of a combined tDCS and sensorimotor retraining therapy in chronic pain.
 
This pilot RCT protocol will outline study methods, and resources required in order to determine the feasibility, acceptability and safety of tDCS combined with sensorimotor retraining for people with chronic LBP.  The specific aims are to i) determine the feasibility, safety, perceived patient response to, and acceptability of, a combined tDCS and sensorimotor training intervention in chronic LBP and ii) provide data to support a sample size calculation for a fully powered trial should trends of effectiveness be present.
