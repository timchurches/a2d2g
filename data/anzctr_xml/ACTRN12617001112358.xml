  <interventions>
    <interventions>Our study makes use of a targeted and locally customized smartphone mobile application (nBuddy Diabetes), implemented to promote lifestyle modifications for diabetes prevention and control. The program's effectiveness and efficacy in early diabetics and pre-diabetics will be studied in this randomised controlled trial. 

The first study visit can be conducted individually or as a group workshop by a dietitian at National University Hospital, depending on the recruitment numbers. The experiment group will be taught on using the smartphone mobile application which targets on diet and exercise interventions. They will be guided to achieve their individualised goals using in-built evidence based behaviour modification tool. These are implemented as daily tips,  prompters and decision-support system to motivate participants towards their weight goal and blood glucose control. Participants can also review their progress via the weight, calorie intake, physical activity and blood glucose  charts in the application.  During this 1 hour session, the dietitian will also educate participants on the basics of diabetes management or prevention. 

During the 12 weeks' intervention period, participants will be required to input their daily food intake, exercise, weekly weight and blood glucose readings via the application. To facilitate self-monitoring at home, they will each be issued with weighing scale and glucometer at their first study visit. Through the application, they will receive remote monitoring and targeted advice from the dietitian. The application will provide participants with real-time decision-support response if the food selected is not the best choice for him or her. 

Educational videos on diabetes and pre-diabetes management will be sent to participants weekly via the application. The videos will cover various topics such as "What can you do to control diabetes", "Counting carbohydrates made easy", "Building your support channel for successful diabetes control", and "Exercise to manage diabetes". Two optional group workshops within the study period will be conducted to enhance the intervention - (i) Behavioural Strategies, inclusive of a Supermarket Tour, (ii) Sustenance of Results. These workshops range from 1 to 2 hours and will be conducted by a dietitian.
The application, intervention and the remote coaching within the study period are provided for the participants at no cost. 

The dietitian will monitor progress of participants via a dashboard, tracking participants' daily food intake and exercise, weekly weight, and blood glucose readings for the diabetics arm. The research team will touch base and provide coaching to the patients via the chat feature of the application. From the dashboard of the mobile application, the research team will be able to evaluate the participants in the intervention group on the following:
- login access rate and usage pattern of the application
- food choices and nutrients intake
- activities / exercise level
- user's responses to health recommendations 
- user preferences
- actions taken by users
- strategies that are effective
- records of progress and outcomes for weight, BMI, blood glucose, calorie intake, other nutrients intake, exercise
- identifying patterns and correlations
- favourite discussion topics
- effect of buddy support system within the application and amount of support sourced from family or friends
- frequency of slipping from the plan 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised in the control arm will receive standard care. For those who have been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes during health screening, the current standard care is either advice given be a General Practitioner (GP) or a referral to the dietitian by the GP or management of care at the Polyclinics. The time taken for the clinic visit depends on the various healthcare professionals within the primary healthcare network. They will be issued a pamphlet on "Diet Management for Diabetes" or "Diet Management For Pre-Diabetes" (an in-house pamphlet, produced by Dietetics department at National University Hospital), during their first study visit by the research team,</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be performed using SPSS for Windows version 21.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics for normally distributed numerical variables will be presented as mean (standard deviation) otherwise median (interquartile range) will be presented. Categorical data will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Parametric tests (and the appropriate non-parametric) will be used to compare numerical variables between the control and intervention groups upon normality &amp; homogeneity assumptions checking. For categorical variables, the chi-square or Fisher Exact tests will be used. Between-group differences in the primary outcomes, changes in HbA1c, Fasting Blood Glucose, Body Weight, Blood Lipids, Creatinine levels, Blood Pressure, nutrients intake (calorie, carbohydrate, sugar and other nutrient intake) will be investigated using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline measurements and relevant covariates. Statistical significance is set at p &lt; 0.05.  

In the qualitative study, data analysis will be done through a process of thematic analysis of the survey forms. For the cost effectiveness analysis, we will first compare the average costs of each treatment arm. Secondly, we will compare the average costs and outcomes across treatment arms relative to the control over both the immediate and long-term horizon. We will compute the within-study incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of incremental cost per 1% drop in HbA1c and per kilogram weight loss. We will also estimate the incremental cost per percentage point reduction in lifetime diabetes risk and cost per QALY, using standard modeling techniques. Bootstrap techniques will be used to generate an empirical sampling distribution for the ICER and 95% bias-adjusted confidence intervals, as well as cost effectiveness acceptability curves, which show the probability that treatment is cost-effective at different threshold cost-effectiveness ratios (bearing in mind Singapore-specific thresholds consistent with WHO CHOICE benchmarks are at the time of writing approximately $60-75000 per QALY). With respect to the projected long-term benefits, sensitivity analysis will be performed to explore the robustness of our results to baseline assumptions.

In the quantitative study, regression models will be used to test for significant treatment effects after controlling for confounders.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases in general and diabetes mellitus in particular, is a major health concern in Singapore and many countries around the world. According to National Health Survey in 2010, the prevalence of diabetes has increased, with 25.7% of Singapore's adult population aged 18-69 years having diabetes or pre-diabetes. The rapidly aging population will further add on to the burden on healthcare resources. The burden of diabetes extends beyond physiological abnormalities like high blood glucose, to the impact on quality of life associated with uncontrolled or untreated diabetes. Diabetes complications are irreversible and range from coronary heart disease, renal failure, blindness, limb amputations and many other end organ complications.

The current treatment of diabetes is often reactive, and is managed at a later disease stage. With late detection and management, health complications may have already set in. Management of diabetes needs to move upstream, to prevent the progression of disease and also to manage it well enough to prevent further complications. Lifestyle intervention is first-line strategy in the prevention and management of pre-diabetes and diabetes. In a landmark study known as Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP), it was shown that lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of diabetes by 58% and metformin by 31%, as compared with placebo. In another study of 4503 U.S. adults with body mass index of 25 or higher and type 2 diabetes, an intensive lifestyle intervention was associated with a higher rate of remission of diabetes. As a result, there is a surge of programmes targeting on diet and physical activities in the States and all over the world. An economic review of 28 studies in the U.S shows that combined diet and physical activity promotion programmes for people at increased risk for type 2 diabetes are cost effective.

Lifestyle intervention programmes commonly incorporate diet, exercise, behaviour modifications, dietitian or exercise therapist consultations (or both), and an individualised diet or exercise plan (or both). The success of the treatment is associated with the intensity of lifestyle measures, leading to greater weight loss in those who are overweight or obese and reduction in newly onset diabetes. However, current methods of delivering these interventions are not scalable to the at-risk population as it is costly, time consuming and has high default rate post screening. At present, mobile technology-enabled modality of treatment to facilitate lifestyle interventions has not been studied locally for diabetes and other chronic diseases. 

The study hypothesis is that a locally developed and targeted mobile application, combined with remote coaching, will be able to effect positive changes in health related behaviours and lifestyle choices, prevent and manage diabetes, and ultimately improving health outcomes and save healthcare costs.</summary>
