  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) - The combination active treatment group will be compared to each of the single component groups, including the placebo group, the mean change from Baseline to Week 72 will be quantified.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Week 72</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) - Safety will be evaluated based on the number, type, and frequency of treatment emergent adverse events. They will be individually presented for all subjects in data listings, and summarized in tables by treatment group and by treatment assignment. The AE's will be summarized and reported collectively based on information obtained through physical examination, ECG, and laboratory findings captured after dosing is initiated.</outcome>

    <summary>This is a global Phase III, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study for subjects
      with evidence of early AD. The protocol is designed to determine whether ALZT-OP1 combination
      treatment (ALZT-OP1a + ALZT-OP1b) will slow down, arrests, or reverse cognitive and
      functional decline, in subjects with evidence of early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD).</summary>
