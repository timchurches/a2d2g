    <interventions>Biological: Gut Microbiome Transfer. 
One male and one female donors will be selected (fit lean young adults aged 18-28 on a well-balanced diet) and will provide fresh stools each as the source of gut microbiome treatment. These donors will provide 3 fresh stools each. Stools will be washed, sieved, and differentially centrifuged to isolate the bacteria. 650 microlitres of gut bacterial suspension will then undergo double encapsulation into 0 and 00 DRcapsTM capsules to eliminate odours and taste issues, and to target delivery of the bacteria to the small and large bowel. Capsules will be stored at -80 degrees C and warmed to 4 degrees C prior to administration.

There will be 80 participants [40 males and 40 females], post-pubertal adolescents (14-18 years); BMI &gt;35 kg/m2] randomized into two groups: control (placebo  saline) or treatment (gut microbiome transfer).  Recipients will undergo bowel cleaning with Picoprep-3 in their own home in the night before treatment initiation. Two 15.5 g sachets of Picoprep-3 will each be dissolved in 250 ml of chilled water and taken over 30 min. 

Subsequently, participants will undergo a single treatment course, consisting of 30 capsules of placebo or treatment (15 per day over two consecutive mornings). 
To ensure maximum compliance, these capsules (which are odourless, tasteless, and acid-resistant to secure release of contents only in the bowel) will be taken in the presence of an investigator. Parameters that may affect the treatment response (mainly diet and physical activity) will be regularly monitored throughout the trial duration.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Treatment evaluation will be performed on the principle of intention to treat, using data collected from all randomised participants. Generalised linear regression models will be used to assess treatment effects between groups, adjusting for the baseline outcome value and sex. Model-adjusted estimates and their difference between two groups will be calculated and tested. Planned subgroup analysis by sex will be conducted on primary and key secondary outcomes, to evaluate the consistency of possible treatment effects in males and females. Per protocol analyses will be carried out on those participants without major protocol violations. Statistical tests will be two-tailed and significance maintained at 5% level.

Our power calculation was performed using data from 50 severely obese adolescents in Australia aged 14-18 years, with a pooled mean BMI SDS of 2.5 and SD of 0.27 at baseline. A study on 32 gut microbiome transfer (treatment group) and 32 control (placebo  saline) adolescents will be powered to detect at least a 0.22 SDS difference in BMI (approximately 5 kg) between groups at 26 weeks post gut microbiome transfer, with power of 0.90 and a of 0.05. To account for a 20% loss to follow-up, we will recruit 40 treatment (20 males and 20 females) and 40 control (20 males and 20 females) participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis
Gut microbiome transfer will lead to weight reduction and improvement in metabolism in severely obese adolescents. 

Aims
To determine whether gut microbiome transfer in severely obese adolescents will: 
(i)	Reduce body mass index (BMI) adjusted for age and sex 
(ii)	Improve body composition
(iii)	Improve insulin sensitivity

Background

Gut microbiome transfer (GMT) in mice demonstrates the critical role of gut bacteria (i.e. the gut microbiome) in weight regulation at many levels: increased calorie absorption from non-digestible carbohydrates; impairment of the gut mucosal barrier; and production of bacterial products that pass into the host circulation (which are pro-inflammatory, promote adipogenesis, or regulate appetite). In humans, an association has been found between obesity and gut microbiome dysbiosis, with reduced bacterial diversity and over-abundance of obesogenic bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum. Despite this, GMT has not been evaluated for the treatment of human obesity. However, GMT is the first-line treatment for recurrent chronic Clostridium difficile colitis, curing ~90% of cases with remarkably few adverse events. In addition, a small pilot study showed that GMT improved insulin action in adults with type 2 diabetes. We propose to perform a novel gold-standard clinical trial using encapsulated material to demonstrate the effectiveness of GMT for the treatment of severe obesity in adolescents.  
 
Subjects

We will select one male and one female gut microbiome donor who are fit lean adults aged 18-28 years on a well-balanced diet. These donors will provide 3 fresh stools each. 
	
We will recruit 80 severely obese (BMI &gt;35 kg/m2) adolescents (14-18 years), which will be randomly allocated into two groups: 40 (20 male, 20 females) control subjects (placebo  capsules containing saline solution) or 40 (20 male, 20 females) treatment subjects (capsule containing GMT). Recipients will undergo bowel cleaning with Picoprep-3 the night before the GMT to optimise donor bacterial colonisation. Subsequently, recipients will receive 15 capsules per day of placebo or treatment in two consecutive mornings.
Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline, 6, 12, and 26 weeks.
