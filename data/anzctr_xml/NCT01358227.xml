      <outcome>Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PR104 when administered weekly - MTD is based on cycle 1 data and defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 subjects with no more than one of the following DLTs:
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
Grade 4 heme toxicity (excluding thrombocytopenia) that lasts for = 5 days (Neutrophils &lt; 500/mm3, ANC = 0.5 K/mm3, lymphocytes &lt; 1K/mm3, HGB &lt; 6.5 gm/dL)
Non-heme toxicity = Grade 3 despite appropriate treatment
Neutropenic fever
Grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity of = 1 week
Any toxicity of Grade 2 or higher that has not resolved within 2 weeks of end of cycle 1 (except grade 2 alopecia)</outcome>
