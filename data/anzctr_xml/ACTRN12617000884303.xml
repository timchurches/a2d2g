  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) Decompressive spinal surgery via laminectomy (which involves the removal of the lamina and spinous process of the vertebrae at the affected level with a high speed drill and/or bone punch, to relieve the pressure on the spinal nerve) or laminotomy (a small opening of the lamina above and below the spinal nerve is created with the high speed drill, leaving the remaining structure of the lamina intact) versus placebo surgery (same incision and muscle dissection as the active intervention but without bone removal).
b) The use of the surgical procedures of laminotomy or laminectomy will be as per the surgeons standard procedures and will reflect real world practise.
c) Spinal surgery will be performed in the operating theatres of the participating institutions and the operating time will vary from 2 to 4 hours
d) Registered medical practitioners with no regulatory impediment to perform spinal decompression surgery in Australia will be invited to participate as study doctors</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo surgery arm will receive identical treatment to the active arm except that no bone removal will be performed during the surgery.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgical decompression for symptomatic spinal stenosis is justified primarily upon clinical experience, expert consensus and pathophysiological considerations, not high quality clinical trials  results of past research have been significantly confounded by placebo effects of surgery. There is an urgent need to rigorously test decompressive surgery for spinal stenosis as the intervention is expensive and potentially harmful and is increasingly used reflecting our ageing community. The efficacy of surgical decompression, the most popular procedure for spinal stenosis, has not yet been proven, as it has never gone through high level of scientific scrutiny to establish its efficacy or safety beyond placebo effects. The SUcceSS trial aims to randomly allocate 160 participants with chronic, symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis to either decompressive surgery or placebo surgery to measure the efficacy of decompressive surgery on patients' outcomes with central spinal canal stenosis.</summary>
