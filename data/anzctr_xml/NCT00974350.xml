  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a research study testing SABER-Bupivacaine (an experimental pain-relieving
      medication). SABER-Bupivacaine is designed to continuously deliver bupivacaine, a common
      local anesthetic, for a few days in order to treat local post-surgical pain. This study is
      testing SABER-Bupivacaine in people having surgery to repair a hernia.

      The purpose of the study is to measure and compare the safety (side effects), tolerability
      (ability to tolerate), and efficacy (how well it works) of two different volumes of
      SABER-Bupivacaine with SABER-Placebo.</summary>
