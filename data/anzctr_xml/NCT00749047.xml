  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pioglitazone is an insulin sensitising drug used in the treatment of patients with type 2
      diabetes. In addition to its blood sugar lowering effect, pioglitazone also has a number of
      other beneficial effects, one of which is to reduce the loss of protein in the urine. The
      mechanism of this protein "sparing effect" of pioglitazone is not fully understood. The
      proposed study will investigate whether pioglitazone has beneficial effects on the filtration
      characteristics of filters in the kidney that are responsible for retaining protein in the
      body. The effect of pioglitazone on the size of the pores in the filters and also the
      electrostatic charge barriers that surround these pores will be investigated. The clinical
      study will involve 12 patients with type 2 diabetes with minimal urine protein loss, taking
      low dose pioglitazone for 3 months. Blood and urine samples will be collected at the
      beginning, mid point and end of the study and used to measure the concentration of specific
      proteins of different size and electrostatic charge. This data will be used to identify and
      characterise changes in the filtration properties of the kidney filters during the study.</summary>
