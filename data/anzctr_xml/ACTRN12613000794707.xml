  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a pregnancy/birth cohort study of children with a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes. Pregnant mothers and their infants will be followed prospectively from early pregnancy through childhood to investigate relationships between the development of islet autoimmunity (and subsequently type 1 diabetes) and prenatal and postnatal environmental factors. Investigation will involve 3-monthly assessments of the mother during pregnancy, then 3-monthly assessments of the child until 24 months of age and 6-monthly thereafter. 

The initial duration of the study is until the child reaches three years of age. However, we would like to follow these children longer-term into adolescence to determine the relationship between genotype and early environment and the development of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Development of antibodies against one or more of the following islet autoantigens detected in serum: glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD) tyrosine phosphatase-like insulinoma antigen (IA2), insulin, and beta cell-specific zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). 

Insulin autoantibodies will be measured by fluid phase radiobinding assay. ZnT8 autoantibodies will be measured by precipitation of 35S-methionine labelled recombinant human ZnT8 protein. GAD and IA2 autoantibodies will be measured by ELISA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Islet autoantibodies will be measured 3-monthly from birth until 24 months of age and 6-monthly thereafter up to 3 years of age in the first instance.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Development of type 1 diabetes as measured by blood glucose testing and HbA1c analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed on a 3-6 monthly basis after the detection of islet autoantibodies up to 3 years of age in the first instance.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>1400 participants will be followed in five States (SA, WA, NSW, Qld and Vic) over three years, followed for a median of two years with a 9% rate of persistent islet autoimmunity. Maximum total dropout/lost to follow-up rate is estimated at 15% with the majority of dropouts occurring in the first six months of follow-up. 

Using nQuery Advisor, with 600 participants above the median and 600 below (1200 total after 15% drop out from 1400), for a given exposure variable the power is 90% to detect a difference between a survival (i.e. no islet autoimmunity) of 93% in one group and a survival of 88% in the other  with 108 events (islet autoimmunity) or 9% of the total sample of 1200 required. For examining interactions between uncorrelated exposure variables with approximately 375 participants per combination of above/below the median, the power is 77% to detect a difference in survival (no islet autoimmunity) between 93% and 87% (70 events in 600 participants required).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The incidence of type 1 diabetes has increased worldwide, particularly in younger children and those with lower genetic susceptibility. These observations are consistent with environmental effects that promote pancreatic islet autoimmunity and destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. The Environmental Determinants of Islet Autoimmunity (ENDIA) Study is investigating candidate environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions that may contribute to the development of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes.</summary>
