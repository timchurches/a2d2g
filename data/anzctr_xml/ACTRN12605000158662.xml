  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention (a sedation guideline previously found to be beneficial) was tested in a quasi-experimental preintervention study (n=322).  The study was conducted in two phases, a ten-month preintervention data collection phase (November 2002 to October 2003) was followed by a twelve-month postintervention phase (November 2003 to December 2004).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary aim of the study was to determine whether an algorithm based sedation guideline reduced duration of mechanical ventilation for ICU patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether the use of a sedation guideline improved the experience of recovery after ICU for mechanically ventilated patients, reflected by lower ETIC-7 scores.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether the use of a sedation guideline reduced the length of ICU stay</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of unscheduled self-extubations</outcome>
      <timepoint />

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of reintubation and the number of tracheostomies.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of the study intervention on the costs of intravenous analgesic and sedative medications was also examined.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In addition the rate of adoption of the new practices of sedation scoring and use of a sedation guideline by bedside clinicians was explored.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Research participants were selected on the basis of whether they were mechanically ventilated while they were in intensive care.  Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were adults older than 17 years. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients were excluded if they:  i) had a primary diagnosis of head injury or other neurological insult and where the aim of sedation was to reduce or minimise intracranial pressure and/or cerebral artery spasm.ii) were not expected to live for more than 24 hours after admission, e.g. patients who had a diagnosis of brain stem death or who were likely to require brain stem death tests.iii) had an explicit ventilation weaning goal on admission e.g. post operative coronary artery bypass graft patients recovering from general anaesthetic.iv) were likely to be ventilated for more than 21 days, e.g. patients with neurological conditions such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome and myasthenia gravis, and patients who had sustained a recent complete spinal cord lesion above cervical spine vertebra number five.v) had previously been enrolled in the study and were readmitted to the intensive care unit more than 72 hours after they were discharged.  However for the purpose of this project patients who were readmitted within 72 hours were regarded as being in the same ICU admission.vi) had sustained a burn injury covering more than 15% of their body surface area.</exclusivecriteria>
