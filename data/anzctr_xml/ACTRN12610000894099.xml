  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Area Under the Curve (AUC) concentration of darifenacin/time (AUC0-t and AUC0-inf). 
Darifenacin plasma concentration will be measured with Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectromtry method and concentration vs. time curves will be plotted.
AUC0-t will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule.
AUC0-inf will be calculated extrapolating the last concentration point to infinity using the log-linear elimination rate constant method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 0:30, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peak concentration (Cmax)
Darifenacin plasma concentration will be measured with Liquid Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry Method and concentration vs. time curves will be plotted.
Cmax will be taken directly from the darifenacin plasma concentration vs. time curve.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 0:30, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Cmax (tmax).
Is the time elapsed from ingestion of darifenacin tablets to plasma peak concentration.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absorption Rate Constant(Ka)
The absorption rate constant is the fractional rate of drug disappearance from the intestinal tract, measured in the log-linear phase of drug absorption.</outcome>
