  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Overall Population - Median time (in weeks) from randomisation until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable RECIST assessment</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomisation until objective progression</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Female Population - Median time (in weeks) from randomisation until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable RECIST assessment</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomisation until objective progression</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until death. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive (ie their status must be known at the censored date and should not be lost to follow up or unknown).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time to death in months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) - The ORR is the number of patients that are responders ie those patients with a confirmed best objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by RECIST criteria.
The categories for best objective response are CR, PR, stable disease (SD)&gt;= 6 weeks, progressive disease (PD) or NE.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Each patient was assessed for objective response from the sequence of RECIST scan data up to data cut off. RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomisation until objective progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Control Rate (DCR) - Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients who achieved disease control at 6 weeks following randomisation. Disease control at 6 weeks is defined as a best objective response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) &gt;= 6 weeks</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomisation until objective progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DoR) - Response is defined as a confirmed best objective response of CR or PR. Duration of response is defined as time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (provided death is within 3 months of last RECIST assessment)</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomisation until objective progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Deterioration of Disease-related Symptoms (TDS) by Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) Total Score - TDS is the interval from the date of randomization to the first assessment of worsened without an improvement in the next 21 days. A deterioration in symptoms is defined as a single visit assessment of 'worsened' with no visit assessment of 'improved' within the next 21 days. The LCSS scale measures changes in symptoms associated with lung cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>LCSS questionnaires are to be administered every 3 weeks after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Deterioration of Disease-related Symptoms (TDS) by Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) Score - Time to deterioration is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the first assessment of worsened without an improvement in the next 21 days. A deterioration in symptoms is defined as a single visit assessment of 'worsened' with no visit assessment of 'improved' within the next 21 days. The ASBI is derived from 6 of LCSS's 9 items</outcome>
      <timepoint>ASBI is a score taken from the LCSS questionnaires which are to be administered every 3 weeks after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Longitudinal Analysis of Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) Total Score - The longitudinal data analysis will include all non-missing visit scores and the model will include only the first 12 weeks of data. LCSS total score is an average of all nine visual analogue patient scales from "none" (0 mm) to "as much as it could be" (100 mm)</outcome>
      <timepoint>LCSS questionnaires are to be administered every 3 weeks after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Longitudinal Analysis of Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) Score - The longitudinal data analysis will include all non-missing visit scores and the model will include only the first 12 weeks of data. ASBI is an average of the six symptom visual analogue patient scales from "none" (0 mm) to "as much as it could be" (100 mm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>ASBI is a score taken from the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) questionnaires administered every 3 weeks after randomisation</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be treated with drugs that kill tumour cells, stop
      them from dividing, or stop the growth of the blood supply that cancers need to grow and
      spread. Clinical research has shown that drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor (VEGFR) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling can increase
      overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical
      studies have shown that vandetanib (ZD6474) is an inhibitor of both VEGFR and EGFR
      signalling. Giving vandetanib may therefore inhibit the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      their blood supply and by stopping them from dividing. This lung cancer study is to
      investigate if adding vandetanib to Alimta (pemetrexed) is more effective than Alimta
      (pemetrexed) alone.</summary>
