    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ventilatory loop gain will be measured by ventilatory response testing, using the pseudorandom binary stimulation (PRBS) method, an engineering technique that uses inhalation of CO2 enriched gas (4% CO2) and room air in a pseudorandom sequence of breaths to probe the response of the respiratory system to carefully controlled CO2 disturbances.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to develop alternative treatments in patients refusing CPAP therapy. We hypothesize that 2 months of low-flow oxygen compared with room air, each delivered via nasal cannulae will improve sleep-disordered breathing, hypoxia during sleep, symptoms and maladaptive cardiovascular response in patients with OSA refusing CPAP treatment. Secondly, we hypothesize that patients with higher loop gain will derive a greater benefit (reduction in apnoea-hypopnoea index) from oxygen therapy.</summary>
