    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drugs
      dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in patients with Type 2 Diabetes who are aged 10 to below 18
      years old and are currently taking metformin, insulin, or both drugs.

      Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are both approved for use in patients with Type 2 Diabetes aged
      18 years or older. This study will assess how well dapagliflozin and saxagliptin work by
      finding out how these treatments affect blood glucose (sugar) levels compared to placebo (a
      pill that contains no active drug), in children and adolescents. Dapagliflozin and
      saxagliptin are considered investigational products in this study since while they have been
      approved for use in adults (patients 18 years or older), they haven't been approved for
      children and adolescents due to lack of clinical studies in this specific population.

      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes have higher levels of blood glucose (sugar) than patients who
      do not have this disease. The high level of sugar in the blood can lead to serious short-term
      and long-term medical problems. The main goal of treating diabetic patients is to lower blood
      glucose to a normal level. Lowering and controlling blood glucose help prevent or delay
      complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney, eye and nerve diseases, and the
      possibility of amputation.

      Dapagliflozin is a drug that helps to reduce blood glucose (sugar) levels by helping the
      kidneys to remove excess glucose from the blood and excrete it in the urine. It prevents the
      kidneys from returning glucose from the urine back into the bloodstream.

      Saxagliptin increases insulin production when blood glucose levels are high. Insulin is a
      hormone made by the pancreas that allows the body to use sugar (glucose) from the food that
      is eaten for energy or to store glucose for future use. Saxagliptin helps to improve blood
      sugar levels in response to a meal and between meals if blood glucose levels are not lowered
      effectively. Saxagliptin does not work when the blood glucose is low. Saxagliptin also helps
      to decrease the amount of sugar made by the body. Together, these processes reduce blood
      glucose levels and help to control Type 2 Diabetes.

      Dapagliflozin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) has been shown to be
      effective in lowering blood glucose in adults with Type 2 Diabetes and is available for use
      in adults (patients 18 years or older) in approximately 40 countries worldwide including the
      USA and Europe. Dapagliflozin has not yet been studied in children (pediatric patients).

      Saxagliptin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) has been shown to be
      effective in lowering blood glucose in adults with Type 2 Diabetes and is available for use
      in adults (patients 18 years or older) in approximately 90 countries worldwide. Saxagliptin
      also has not yet been studied in children (pediatric patients).

      The subject will either receive one of the active study drugs or a placebo (a pill that looks
      identical but contains inactive drug). This study will be double blind; this means that
      neither the subject, nor the study doctor will know which treatment the subject will receive.

      Which treatment the subject receives is decided by a computer, purely by chance; this is
      called a "random assignment".

      For this study, there will first be a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, followed by a 2 week
      lead in phase. Thereafter there will be a 26 week short-term treatment phase (week 1-week
      26), and a 26 week long-term treatment phase (week 27-week 52). Following this there will be
      a follow-up telephone call on week 56 and a post study visit at week 104.

      At day 1 visit after the lead in phase the subject will be randomly assigned to receive one
      of 3 treatments: dapagliflozin 5 mg, saxagliptin 2.5 mg or placebo in a blinded manner. This
      treatment will continue up to week 14. Then after week 14, and until the end of the study,
      the subject will be assigned to receive one of the following 5 treatments: dapagliflozin 5
      mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg or placebo in a blinded manner.
      The drugs assigned after week 14 will be the same drugs as at Day 1, but some of the groups
      will receive them at a higher dose.

      After completion of the 26-week short-term phase, the subject will enter a 26 week long-term
      phase. The same treatment that the subject had been assigned to at week 14 visit will be
      continued. This long-term phase is primarily designed to provide additional information on
      how well dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are tolerated.

      Following the treatment phases, there will be a follow-up telephone call at week 56.

      The subject will be asked to visit the clinic at week 104 again for a final evaluation of the
      physical development (based on the stage of puberty).</summary>
