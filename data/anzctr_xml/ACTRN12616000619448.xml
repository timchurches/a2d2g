    <interventions>Administration of CRD-102 vs placebo, with a two week placebo run in period.

Day one - all participants will commence oral administration of one placebo capsule, identical in  appearance to CRD-102, twice daily for 14 day duration, at which point 1:1 randomisation will occur, 50% of participants will continue to take the placebo capsule twice daily while the other 50% will take one 14mg oral capsule of CRD-102 twice daily (12 hourly) days 15 - 42. The study will run for 43 days (+/-3 days). All empty medication containers will be collected and returned to pharmacy for accountability and to monitor adherence, as well as a participant diary, which will be given to participants to record any missed dosed etc.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart failure is a condition where the hearts pumping cycle does not function as it should. There are two types of heart failure, with about half of patients with the condition falling into each group. One where the pump/contraction function of the heart is reduced.  That is called systolic heart failure. In the other type, the heart does not fully relax, so it does not fill properly with blood. This is called diastolic heart failure or heart failure with normal pump function. The official medical term is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and is abbreviated as HFPEF. At the moment, there are no established medical therapies for HFPEF.  
Our research has shown that people with HFPEF develop breathlessness very quickly during physical activity because the heart muscle cannot relax normally. In this study we want to test the effect of a medicine, CRD-102,  on the pressure in the heart during exercise in HFPEF patients.  
The use of CRD-102 tablets in this study is considered experimental. CRD-102 tablets have not been approved for marketing by the Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia. Because of its actions on the heart we hope that it may be helpful in patients with diastolic heart failure. </summary>
