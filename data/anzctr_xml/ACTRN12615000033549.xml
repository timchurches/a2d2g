  <interventions>
    <interventions>Application of 1mL CTNX-2022 (40% Anhydrous Lidocaine Gel) or placebo topically applied to 300cm squared outlined area once daily (in the morning) for 8 days at the study site. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety of topically applied 40% lidocaine gel by measuring by using descriptive statistics:
- Incidence, intensity, relationship, and seriousness of treatment-emergent AEs
- Treatment-emergent changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and ECGs
- Treatment-emergent changes at the application site (edema and erythema)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 1-12 and Day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of topically applied 40% lidocaine gel by measuring:
- C(max)
- T(max)
- Elimination rate constant
- Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable plasma concentration
- Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 to infinity
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 1-12 and Day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effect of 40% lidocaine gel on 0-10 numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) pain scores related to acute herpes zoster. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 1-12 and Day 28</timepoint>

3.	Subject has an average daily pain intensity score of &gt; or = 4 using the NPRS as determined by pain assessment during the physical examination at screening.
4.	Subject must have a diagnosis of herpes zoster (shingles).
5.	Subject has rash limited to trunk and limbs, with a total surface area of up to 300 cm2.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1.	Subject has an active herpes zoster lesion on the face, head, neck, genital or rectal areas.
2.	Subject has rash limited to trunk and limbs, with a total surface area greater than 300 cm2.
3.	Subject has a known history of allergic reaction, hypersensitivity, or clinically significant intolerance to lidocaine, ingredients of the study drug, or local anesthetics of the amide type.
4.	Subject has target skin area (allodynic area and surrounding skin) that is not intact, is inflamed, or in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, consistent with rash due to acute herpes zoster.
5.	Subject has any other form of pain that was not discernible from herpes zoster (shingles) allodynia.
6.	Subject is taking Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., tocainide, mexiletine), or medications that could interact with the study drug or interfere with its evaluation.

    <concealment />
    <sequence>Upon returning to the clinic on the morning of Day 3, subjects will be randomized per the code provided prior to dosing. Stratified randomization will be used to achieve a reasonable balance of subjects with &lt; or = 10 days and &gt; 10 days since onset among the 4 treatment schedules. A randomization list will be computer-generated for each of the 2 strata using random permuted blocks. </sequence>
