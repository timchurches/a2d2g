  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the experimental group will complete a 10-week progressive resistance training program. They will be taught 7 exercises: three exercises for the upper limbs, three exercises for the lower limbs and one exercise for the trunk. All exercises will be completed on weight machines in a local gymnasium and each exercise session will take approximately 60 minutes. The training program is based on the recommendations of the American College of Sports medicine and will comprise 3 sets of 12 repetitions of each exercise at a training intensity of 12RM. The weight lifted in each exercise will be increased when 3 sets of 12 repetitions of an exercise can be completed. Two-minute rest periods will be given between each exercise set. The program will be conducted twice weekly for 10 consecutive weeks. Participants will complete the program one-on-one with a physiotherapist. Adherence will be monitored using an exercise log-book.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the (waitlist) control group will continue with their typical daily activities, which may include leisure and sporting activities, but will not include a progressive resistance strength training. The control group will be offered the intervention after all assessments have been completed i.e. approximately 12 weeks after the intervention group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>  At baseline and 1 week after the intervention has ceased</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be monitored during the intervention period using exercise log-book and classified as minor/ major; expected/ unexpected; related to the intervention/ unrelated to the intervention. An example of a possible adverse event is delayed onset of muscle soreness which would be anticipated in people who are unaccustomed to exercise, but which would be expected to resolve quickly and not interfere with training.</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility</outcome>
      <timepoint>Will be measured during the intervention phase of the trial by documentation in the exercise log-books of attendance at the exercise sessions and adherence to the exercise protocol.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot randomised controlled trial will be the first to investigate if supervised progressive resistance training (strength training) is safe and feasible for adolescents and young adults with Prader Willi syndrome aged 13-39 years. It will also investigate the effect of the training on body composition (including muscle mass), muscle strength, muscle performance, and physical activity.
Twenty-two adolescents and young adults with Prader Willi syndrome will be recruited through the Prader Willi Syndrome Association of Victoria and through the Prader Willi Syndrome register. Participants will be randomly allocated to either a 10-week twice a week community gymnasium based progressive resistance training program supervised by a physiotherapist (n=11) or a waitlisted control group (n=11). The training program will comprise 7 exercises on pin-loaded weight machines: 3exercises for the arms, 3 exercises for the legs and 1 exercise for the trunk which will take 45-60 minutes to complete each session. Participants will be assessed before they start the intervention and again after they complete the intervention.</summary>
