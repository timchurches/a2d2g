  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is unclear whether patients who do not undergo an axillary dissection and receive further systemic treatment, have a similar prognosis to those with axillary clearance who receive the same therapy. The focus of this international trial is to determine the importance of an axillary node dissection for breast cancer patients 60 years or older who receive Tamoxifen as an ongoing treatment. Particular attention will also be given to the quality of life of the patients over the first six years of the study.</summary>
