  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of idelalisib with
      obinutuzumab versus the combination of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab on progression-free
      survival (PFS) in participants with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      An increased rate of deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs) among participants with
      front-line CLL and early-line indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) treated with idelalisib in
      combination with standard therapies was observed by the independent data monitoring committee
      (DMC) during regular review of 3 Gilead Phase 3 studies. Gilead reviewed the unblinded data
      and terminated those studies in agreement with the DMC recommendation and in consultation
      with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All front-line studies of idelalisib,
      including this study, were also terminated.</summary>
