  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 20-30% of women with advanced breast cancer have a genetic
alteration in the HER2 gene (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2), causing an over-expression of the HER2 protein in the tumour, which is associated with a more
aggressive disease and a worse prognosis. Patients with this type of breast cancer
benefit from treatment with Herceptin when the patient has not previously received
chemotherapy for their advanced disease. This randomised clinical trial evaluates the
use of Herceptin in combination with currently available chemotherapy treatments in providing a better outcome for these patients by delaying progression of the cancer and death with as little toxicity as possible. The trial will compare two treatments: (1)
a combination of the drugs Taxotereâ, platinum salt and Herceptinâ and (2) a standard treatment of Taxotereâ and Herceptinâ in combination without platinum salt.</summary>
