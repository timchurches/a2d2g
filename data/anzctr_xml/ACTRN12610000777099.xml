  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prehabilitation sessions will be 60 minutes in duration conducted by a physiotherapist. The program will be conducted twice weekly, for up to 4 weeks prior to the patients surgery date, with a maximum 6 clients per group.  The exercise component will take a circuit training approach where various stations are set out that participants move around during the session.  These exercises will include
1.	Warm up for all at rails in standing (5 minutes)
2.	Plinth  Hip knee flexion/quads over fulcrum/Hip Abduction/Bridging
3.	Chair  Knee flexion and extension
4.	Rails  gait re-education
5.	Rails  Hip abduction/ Hip Flexion/ Hip Extension/ Squats/ Heel Raises/ Ham string curls/ calf stretch
6.	Pedals/stairs/exercise bike
7.	Lunges
8.	Hands on therapy on plinth with Physiotherapist (Usual care rehabilitation phase) / Education station (prehabilitation phase)
Despite the circuit format, all of these exercises will have individually tailored dosages / difficulty levels set to ensure that therapeutic benefit and participant safety are maximized.
Education will also be provided to participants through provision of hip and knee care booklets with a view to clarifying the operation, pain management, gait aids, (giving a general post-surgical concept) as well as educating the patient regarding ongoing exercise at home.
Participants allocated to the intervention group will also be given a passport which they will be required to bring to all appointments eg. Community rehabilitation centre, their hospital inpatient stay, to have their attendance recorded and signed off by staff.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group participants will receive usual care as is currently practiced at Southern Health.  This entails no pre-surgical exercise program.  Usual care includes the provision of a hip and knee care booklet that is handed to all patients who attend pre-admission clinic.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients who attend preadmission clinic approximately four weeks prior to surgery will be approached for consent to participate in the program be one of the investigative team.  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be checked.  A written and verbal explanation of the project will be provided. Consenting participants will then have baseline assessments administered before being randomized into the intervention (prehabilitation) or control (usual care) group.  Allocation concealment will be completed using sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will follow a computer-generated random allocation sequence with stratification by type of surgery (knee or hip).  No further stratification variables will be used in this pilot study.  The random allocation sequence will be contained within opaque envelopes with numerical sequencing corresponding to the order in which participants were recruited into the trial.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently, patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery do not participate in formal exercise classes prior to their operation.  It is possible that the introduction of these classes may affect patients length of inpatient hospital stay, discharge destination, the speed of post-operative improvement (particularly movement of the affected joint) and the use of healthcare resources.  Participation in exercise classes may also improve health-related quality of life following surgery.
This pilot project will examine the effect of an exercise group for patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery provided prior to their surgery (referred to herein as prehabilitation).  Patients attending pre-admission clinic prior to their operation will be invited to participate in the study and included participants will be randomized to either usual care or usual care with the addition of prehabilitation.  
All participants will undergo baseline testing of health-related quality of life, joint range of movement and functional activity testing in pre-admission clinic and participants will then be re-tested eight weeks following their operation.  The differences between groups (usual care and usual care + prehabilitation) will be analysed using appropriate statistical tests.</summary>
