  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project is associated with a similar correspondence-based treatment for alcohol misuse co-morbid with depression. It is a randomised controlled trial, in which participants are assigned to standard care by their GP or, standard care plus correspondence-based treatment. After three months, those in the standard care only group are provided the same treatment as the experimental group. The correspondence-based treatment is founded on empirically supported cognitive behaviour therapy for alcohol misuse and comprises four weekly and four fortnightly letters covering topics such as motivation enhancement, goal setting, dealing with urges, planning for high risk situations and relapse prevention.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome being measured is the relationship between craving and self-efficacy.  Craving is measured using The Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire (Clark et. al., 1996) and self-efficacy using the Controlled Drinking Self-Efficacy Scale (Sitharthan &amp; Kavanagh, 1990) and Cognition Efficacy Questionnaire (Kavanagh &amp; Wilson, 1989). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured prior to treatment, during treatment, immediately post-treatment and three, six, nine and 12 months after treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the effectiveness of the correspondence-based treatment compared to standard care by a GP.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is evaluated by measuring alcohol intake and craving levels prior to treatment, during treatment, immediately post-treatment and three, six, nine and 12 months after treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
