  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Sternalock 360 sternal plating system
Treatment: devices - Sternal Wires

Active Comparator: Sternalock 360 sternal plating system - use of the SternaLock 360 system to close the sternum: 3 plates with 3 bands and measured screw length to engage but not penetrate the posterior sternal cortex, used to close the sternum

Active Comparator: Sternal wires - Stainless steel sternal wires applied in a "figure of 8" configuration to close the sternum


Treatment: devices: Sternalock 360 sternal plating system
The SternaLock 360 system is a band and plating system designed to improve sternal stability. 3 bands surround the sternum to oppose the bones (like wires), but an additional 3 plate system prevents anterior posterior displacement and provides a rigid fixation.

Treatment: devices: Sternal Wires
Stainless steel wires are applied in a "figure of 8" configuration to close the sternum

    <summary>Design:

      Investigator Initiated Prospective Randomised Trial

      Study Centre's:

      Melbourne Private Hospital Royal Melbourne Hospital

      Study Hypothesis:

      Use of the SternaLock 360 will reduce the incidence of sternal motion &gt; 2mm by absolute
      difference of 40% at 6 weeks of surgery compared to stainless steel wiring.

      Use of the SternaLock 360 will improve bone healing and quality of recovery after surgery
      compared to stainless steel wiring

      Study Objective:

      To determine if the SternaLock 360 system reduces sternal instability, increases bone
      healing, and improves quality of recovery compared to stainless steel wiring of the sternum,
      after cardiac surgery involving median sternotomy

      Inclusion Criteria:

      Age = 18 year old Elective cardiac surgery Primary cardiac surgical procedure No evidence of
      infection at time of surgery Sufficient English language to complete the Postoperative
      Quality of Recovery Survey

      Exclusion Criteria:

      Previous sternotomy (redo) Clinical sternal deformity Home locality preventing follow-up
      (e.g. remote regional, interstate or overseas patient)
