  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Osia System

Experimental: Bone-conduction hearing device - The bone-conduction hearing device Osia system allows a direct bone-conduction through an osseointegrated implant. A magnet allows the external Sound Processor to be placed in the correct position over the implanted system including an inner magnet.


Treatment: devices: Osia System
An external Sound Processor captures and digitize the sound which is transferred to the internal implant where it is converted to an electrical signal. The electrical signal is further transferred as a vibration through an osseointegrated implant to the mastoid bone and eventually to the cochlea.
