  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive a single implant of SIR-Spheres microspheres followed by standard treatment with 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 4 to 6 weeks after implantation patients will receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) weekly for seven weeks followed by a 1 week break. It will then be administered weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a 1 week break until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Metatstatic pancreatic cancer is the 5th most lethal cancer killer. For those with hepatic lesions the outlook is 3-5 months with best available care. This study aims to use SIRT (Selective Internal Radiation Therapy) to effectively target and treat the hepatic lesions, thus significantly improving the outlook for patients with this condition.</summary>
