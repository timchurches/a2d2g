  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing cardiopulmonarybypass  will receive a pump prime of 2 litres of bicarbonate based prime . The bicarbonate based prime has the following composition.(Sodium (Na) 140 mmol/L, Chloride (Cl) 116 mmol/L and bicarbonate 24 mmol/L).   The pump flow rates and the membrane oxygenator protocls will be as per standard practice.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive the normal pump prime which is Plasmalyte A at the volume of 2 litres and the composition of plasmalyte is Na 140 mmol/L, Cl 98 mmol/L, Magnesium (Mg) 3 mmol/L, Potassium (K) 5 mmol/L, Acetate 27 mmol/L, gluconate 23 mmol/L. The pump flow rates and the membrane oxygenator protocls will be as per standard practice.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart operations is frequently accompanied by a degree of inflammation and irregular heart beat.This study aims to determine if the use of a solution containing bicarbonate during heart operations will reduce the amount of inflammation and improve heart rhythm.

During heart bypass surgery, patients' circulation is supported by a heart lung machine. During this process, the patient's blood is mixed with  around 2 L of fluid. In Brisbane, we have developed a fluid for use during heart surgery. Initial results suggest that it maintains the acid levels in the blood better than the conventionally used fluid. This project is seeking to determine whether the new fluid also improves the overall well being of the patient.

If shown to improve the overall well being of the patient, it has the potential to reduce hospital stay and hospital costs.</summary>
