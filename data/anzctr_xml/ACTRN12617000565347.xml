Rural-targeted

The 12-page targeted brochure detailed 13 specific services (i.e., Cancer Council 13 11 20; supportive accommodation; transport; Country Cancer Support website; phone, letter, email, website and in-person information; counselling; online and in-person peer support; telephone or internet, and in-person, support groups; financial assistance; financial planning referral, and; legal referral) for rural people affected by cancer and included a telephone helpline fridge magnet. The appropriate contact details, availability, and a brief description were provided for each service. The targeting modifications were made using strategies for cultural appropriateness for population subgroups, with additional input provided by a panel of experienced social workers that worked with the target population.  Following the panels recommendation, language used was informal, and referred to country rather than rural needs. The brochure was delivered in a sealed, opaque envelope along with pre- and immediate-post questionnaires by supportive accommodation or research staff, or via post; participants were asked to read the brochure carefully after completing Time 1 measures (baseline, prior to intervention material exposure).

Arm 2
Rural- and male-targeted

As above, a 12-page targeted brochure detailed 13 specific services (i.e., Cancer Council 13 11 20; supportive accommodation; transport; Country Cancer Support website; phone, letter, email, website and in-person information; counselling; online and in-person peer support; telephone or internet, and in-person, support groups; financial assistance; financial planning referral, and; legal referral) for rural men affected by cancer and included a telephone helpline fridge magnet. The appropriate contact details, availability, and a brief description were provided for each service. The targeting modifications were made using strategies for cultural appropriateness for population subgroups, with additional input provided by a panel of experienced social workers that worked with the target population. Consistent with previous description in the literature, coping was further emphasised as an active, solution-focused process in the targeted rural male brochure. The brochure was delivered in a sealed, opaque envelope along with pre- and immediate-post questionnaires by supportive accommodation or research staff, or via post; participants were asked to read the brochure carefully after completing Time 1 measures (baseline, prior to intervention material exposure).</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3

The 12-page existing "Cancer? We can help" (CWCH) control brochure, developed by Cancer Council SA, detailed 13 specific services as in the intervention arms (i.e., Cancer Council 13 11 20; supportive accommodation; transport; Country Cancer Support website; phone, letter, email, website and in-person information; counselling; online and in-person peer support; telephone or internet, and in-person, support groups; financial assistance; financial planning referral, and; legal referral) for people affected by cancer generally (i.e., it was not further targeted) and included a telephone helpline fridge magnet. The appropriate contact details, availability, and a brief description were provided for each service. All brochures were comparable in length, format and readability. The brochure was delivered in a sealed, opaque envelope along with pre- and immediate-post questionnaires by supportive accommodation or research staff, or via post; participants were asked to read the brochure carefully after completing Time 1 measures (baseline, prior to control material exposure), even if they thought they had seen it before.

Power analysis was conducted prior to the study in order to estimate the required sample size. The initial sample size calculation suggested at least 159 participants (n = 53 per group) would be required for the study, assuming statistical power of .8 and an alpha level of .05, to be able to detect effects of a medium size (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low rates of psychosocial service use (e.g., helplines or support programs) are well documented, especially for rural men affected by cancer. Developing targeted information specifically for this group has previously been suggested as a way to provide information on psychosocial services, and address the barriers to using services. However, theory-based informational resources for rural men affected by cancer have not previously been objectively developed or tested. This trial aimed to develop targeted rural- and targeted rural male-psychosocial service information brochures. Specifically, the trial examined the effectiveness of such information in increasing how personally relevant the information is seen as, and attitudes to seeking help and intention to use services after reading one version of the brochure.

Targeted versions of an existing Cancer Council SA brochure were developed based on psychological theory. Participants viewed one copy of the brochure in a randomised fashion (either the existing version, or the targeted rural- or rural male-version). Participants completed questionnaires before, immediately after, and approximately 24 hours after viewing a brochure. N = 114 rural men affected by cancer were recruited via supportive accommodation facilities, Ninety participants returned all questionnaires and were included in the final analyses. Results showed that attitudinal or behavioural measures between the three brochure groups were not significantly different. Participants reported that they primarily sourced service information from other people (friends, family, medical professionals, others). Notably, existing service use was high in the sample or participants, reflecting the recruitment methods, and therefore increasing awareness of services may have been particularly challenging. There was no evidence that targeting rurality or gender improved attitudes to service use in this trial. Further qualitative research to build understanding about the acceptability of various targeting techniques in this population would be useful, as would replicating this study in a sample not recruited via a Cancer Council SA service.</summary>
