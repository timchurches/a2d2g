  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of study is to establish safety and efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars. We included a total of 120 patients of more than 12 years of age with no history of chronic renal or liver disease. They were divided into group A, who received intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) alone and group B who received combination of 5-FU and TAC. Total of 8 injections were given at weekly interval. Patients were assessed at the beginning, at 4th and 8th week of treatment and then 4 weeks after the treatment for mean reduction in scar height, efficacy (more than 50% reduction in initial scar height) and complications of both treatments.</summary>
