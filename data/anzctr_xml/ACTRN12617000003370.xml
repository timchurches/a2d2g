  <interventions>
    <interventions>People aged 40 or older and who have had a recent diagnosis of a bowel condition at colonoscopy will be contacted about this study. This will include people with a main diagnosis of a small adenoma, a significant adenoma, bowel cancer of stage I, II, III or IV, or those with non-neoplastic findings such as diverticular disease or haemorrhoids. Within two weeks after colonoscopy people will be sent a letter inviting them to take part in a questionnaire at this time point and again 12 months later. The questionnaire contains four sections. Section A mainly includes questions about health conditions and any treatment that the person may have received in the past 12 months. Section B contains questions about health-related quality of life and wellbeing. Section C contains questions on attitudes towards managing health. Section D includes questions about the person's background. If the questionnaire is not returned within two weeks then research staff will make telephone contact with the invitees to follow-up and confirm their willingness or otherwise to participate in the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be people aged 40 or older who have had a recent colonoscopy and who have had no bowel pathology found (ie. a finding of a normal bowel). The control group will receive the same questionnaire within two weeks after colonoscopy and again after 12 months. They will also be contacted by research staff if the questionnaire has not been returned within two weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be the quality of life in people who have been diagnosed with a bowel condition. This will be assessed by questionnaire using existing surveys- a generic preference-based health related quality of life instrument (the EQ-5D-5L), a cancer-specific quality of life instrument (the EORTC QLQ-C30) and a widely used subjective wellbeing measure (the Satisfaction with Life Scale).</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed via questionnaire within two weeks and 12 months after colonoscopy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome will be the health activation scores in people who have been diagnosed with a bowel condition. This will be assessed by questionnaire using an existing survey, the commonly used Consumer Health Activation Index (CHAI) survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed via questionnaire within two weeks and at 12 months after colonoscopy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Another outcome for this study will be to determine the relationship of quality of life with health activation in people who have been diagnosed with a bowel condition. This will be assessed by determining quality of life using existing surveys including a generic preference-based health related quality of life instrument (the EQ-5D-5L), a cancer-specific quality of life instrument (the EORTC QLQ-C30), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale survey, and compared to the findings from the Consumer Health Activation Index (CHAI) survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed via questionnaire within two weeks and at 12 months after colonoscopy. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine how the diagnosis of a bowel condition at colonoscopy impacts quality of life, and whether this changes between diagnosis and one year later?

Who is it for? Participants for this study will be people who have had a colonoscopy within the last two weeks, all aged 40 or older, who have a diagnosis of one of the following at colonoscopy: (1) bowel cancer (stages I, II, III or IV), (2) advanced adenoma, (3)  small non-advanced adenoma, (4) non-neoplastic findings (such as diverticular disease or haemorrhoids) or (5) no pathology detected (normal colon)

Study details: All study invitees will be sent via mail a study invitation letter and a questionnaire within two weeks after their colonoscopy appointment. The questionnaire contains questions about health conditions, health-related quality of life and wellbeing, attitudes toward managing health and other basic demographic questions (including age, education level, country of birth). A two week period will be allowed following the mail out of letters for return of completed questionnaires. If the questionnaire has not been returned during this time, then research staff will make telephone contact with the study invitees to follow-up and confirm their willingness or otherwise to participate in the study. Those who complete the questionnaire will be invited to complete the same questionnaire 12 months later.

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide health related quality of life data for different bowel conditions in the Australian population. This can then be used in health economic modelling to assess the cost effectiveness of bowel cancer screening.</summary>
