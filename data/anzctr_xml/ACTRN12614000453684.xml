  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention to be evaluated is Kia Piki te Hauora (KPtH: Uplifting our Wellbeing).  KPtH is 1x1 hour/week for 8 weeks, school-based, indicated occupational therapy group programme for children aged 11-13 years, designed to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, promote self-esteem, and increase occupational participation.

The intervention being studied is a manualised, indicated occupational therapy group intervention.  Through engaging participants in developmentally appropriate activities the intervention is designed to promote mental health and wellbeing by enabling students to understand the relationship between what they do and how they feel/think; how activities they engage in influence their identity, self-concept, health and wellbeing; to practice and develop strategies for overcoming difficult emotions; and to apply this knowledge in building and designing healthy routines, behaviours and habits in their day-to-day life that support self-esteem and participation.  Group activities are didactic (e.g. occupational analysis, fight-or-flight, relaxation techniques), involve peer exchange (e.g. occupational charades, brainstorming), direct experience (e.g. relaxation, games) and personal exploration (e.g. occupational analysis, pepeha , activity scheduling).</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Senior staff from eligible schools will be offered a meeting with the lead researcher to explain the study process, review the Participant Information Sheet: School Version and obtain consent.  This process will be repeated until 14 schools are recruited across the stratum.  Schools will be stratified by decile grouping (low, medium, and high) and allocated unique identifiers.   For the 14 schools recruited to this study stratification can be understood as four schools from deciles 1-3, six schools from deciles 4-7, and four schools from deciles 8-10.  

An indicated sample of 10-12 students at each of the enrolled schools will be recruited by senior staff from the school (e.g. Special Education Needs Co-Ordinator (SENCO), Principal).  An indicated sample is those children presenting with some signs of anxiety or depression, low self-esteem or poor participation in typical occupations.  Once participants have consented/assented to participate they will be assessed for eligibility.  Participants will be screened using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) (Birmaher, 1999).  

After eligibility screening is complete schools will be randomly allocated to one of the two study arms: (intervention or control) according to a computer-generated random number list held by a statistician unaware of the cluster-identifiers.  The lead researcher will then advise the school which arm of the study they have been allocated to, in order to facilitate logistical aspects of arranging times and venues for the group to be held.  Individual participants will not be informed of how they have been allocated until they have completed the baseline outcome measures.  Further concealment is impractical due to the nature of the complex intervention. </concealment>
    <sequence>Clusters will be randomly allocated to one of the two study arms (intervention or waitlist control) according to a computer-generated random number list held by a statistician unaware of the cluster-identifiers. 

Schools will be stratified by decile grouping (low, medium, and high) and allocated unique identifiers.  For the 14 schools recruited to this study stratification can be understood as four schools from deciles 1-3, six schools from deciles 4-7, and four schools from deciles 8-10.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Parallel component of the trial will include all participants as initially randomised to one of the two arms of the trial: intervention or Waitlist Control.

Crossover component will be included as secondary analysis will include the data from participants in the Waitlist Control group who later cross over into the Intervention group.

Outcome measures will be taken by a research assistant blinded to the treatment allocation of each cluster.  However, given the outcome measures are self-, parent- or teacher-rated the individuals completing the measures will not be blinded to treatment allocation, except at baseline. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size
The sample size requirement for this study is 63 per study arm, a total of 126 children from 14 schools.  This calculation is based on a sample size requirement for an individually randomised trial of 64, adjusted by a DE for clustering and analysis by ANCOVA of 0.98, and resulting in an ESS of 64.  A target sample of 154 participants will be recruited to allow for possible 10% attrition. 

ITT approach
As a pragmatic trial this study will utilise an ITT approach to analysis.  The result is that data from all participants are used regardless of adherence to treatment allocation as this more accurately reflects real-life conditions.

Data analysis plan
A Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance (RM-ANCOVA) approach to the data will allow comparisons of between-subject (intervention versus waitlist control) and within-subject (repeated measures on outcomes) factors and their interactions.  Covariates can be incorporated into analysis through a regression model with an appropriate adjustment for clustering, such as a RM-ANCOVA.  This approach will increase the power or sensitivity of the F-test and increase the likelihood of being able to detect differences between the groups, while also controlling for the increased number of comparisons and reducing the likelihood of Type I error (Pallant, 2010). 

Two predetermined covariates will be specified for this study:
*Baseline scores on outcome measures 
*Time from baseline to assessment (treated as categorical data) for repeated measures analyses

Additional covariates will be considered following a blind review by an independent statistician to determine if other factors are significant (e.g. decile rank, gender etc).  The decision to include additional covariates will be the result of a blind review and secondary to their allocation, as they are derived from baseline data unaffected by the Independent Variable.

Planned comparisons, also known as a priori, will be performed to test the hypotheses of this study.  Given the need to make multiple comparisons for the secondary hypotheses, the False Discovery Rate Control (FDRC) will be applied to protect against Type I errors.  

Blind review
An independent statistician will review treatment data without knowledge of treatment allocation, prior to the final data analyses and after the data sets have been created. This is to finalise the statistical plan.  The review will have scope to change three components of the statistical plan: any additional covariates that may be included in the final analyses to enhance efficiency; transformations required or the selection of other models; and management of missing data.

Missing data 
This study will utilise multiple imputation for missing values and a logistical regression analysis of missing data characteristics from baseline outcomes to assess for any systematic patterns in missing data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The intervention to be evaluated is Kia Piki te Hauora (KPtH: Uplifting our Wellbeing).  KPtH is an 8 week school-based group programme for children aged 11-13 years, designed to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, promote self-esteem, and increase occupational participation.

Question: "Is the intervention (KPtH) effective at reducing risk factors (symptoms of anxiety and depression) and increasing protective factors (self-esteem and participation), thus promoting future mental well-being, in children aged 11-13 years?"

Objectives
1) To compare change in outcome measures between intervention and waitlist-control.
2) To compare change in outcome measures between post-intervention and 8 weeks follow-up.
3) To evaluate the relationship between knowledge change about occupations, health and wellbeing on all outcome measures.

Design: This pragmatic trial will cluster participants by schools.  Schools will be randomly allocated to receive the intervention or waitlist control.  Outcome assessors will be unaware of intervention allocation.  Measures will be taken at baseline and post-intervention for intervention or waitlist control groups. Those allocated to the waitlist will later receive the intervention. Outcome measures will be repeated at an 8 week follow up. Primary measure: the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children  short form. Secondary measures: the School Anxiety Scale, Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children, Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale  Parent report/short version, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Single Item Self-Esteem Scale, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure  modified, Wellbeing and life satisfaction questions and a survey evaluating participant knowledge.

Significance: Generating research on preventative interventions is important for the future of children in Aotearoa/New Zealand.
