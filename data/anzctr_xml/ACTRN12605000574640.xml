  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single blinded, randomized controlled trial of 198 participants. Three groups: 1) Manual Therapy and therapeutic exercise consisting of eight 30 minute treatment sessions over 6 weeks of Mulligan's mobilisations with movement, taping and customised therapeutic exercise programme. Participants also instructed on a home programme of exercise and self-mobilisation. 2) One Corticosteroid injection. All groups were given written and verbal advice on self-management.</interventions>
