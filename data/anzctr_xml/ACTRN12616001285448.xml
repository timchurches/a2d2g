  <interventions>
    <interventions>Where clinically appropriate, administer regular IV paracetamol 1 gm 6 hourly as fever prophylaxis.  If the patient is deeply sedated with no response to voice, target a body temperature of no greater than 36.5-37 degrees Celsius using simple cooling measures (removal of clothing and sheets, using a sponge or wet towel, using a fan) plus a physical cooling device if necessary. Physical cooling devices are any device at the study site that the treating clinician considers appropriate such as cooling blankets, cooling pads and cooling helmets. 
Shivering should be aggressively treated where possible using the following hierarchy of treatments:
1. Administration of an opioid bolus
2. Increasing of sedation
3. Administration of a bolus of neuromuscular paralysis
Decisions regarding choice of drugs, doses, frequency, and duration of administration will be at the discretion of the treating clinician.
Protocol-driven temperature control measures including IV paracetamol should be ceased at day 28 or ICU discharge (whichever is sooner).  Physical cooling can be ceased to allow the patient to be desedated at any time at the discretion of the treating clinician but should be recommenced if further deep sedation is needed and body temperature is not within the target range of 36.5-37 degrees Celsius.  If treatments to control shivering are clinically inappropriate or shivering cannot be controlled then physical cooling should be ceased.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients allocated to the control group should receive standard care.  There are no protocol-defined temperature targets.  Administration of IV paracetamol in the standard care arm is discouraged unless there is a specific indication for its use.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background:
Intensive care doctors make decisions about prevention and treatment of fever every day but their decisions are currently made on the basis of very weak evidence. Although ICU patients often have limited physiological reserves so that their tolerance of the demands on the body created by fever may be limited, clinicians are generally tolerant of relatively high body temperatures in the absence of acute brain pathologies.
Study question:
Among adults in ICU without acute brain pathologies who are expected to life support (a breathing machine) beyond the day after randomisation, does systematic control of body temperature using regular IV paracetamol combined with physical cooling to treat fever alter mean body temperature compared to standard temperature management?
Why this study is being conducted:
Understanding whether or not an active approach to prevention and treatment of fever results in a lower mean body temperature than a standard care approach is a necessary prerequisite to evaluating the active approach in a phase 3 clinical trial. Obtaining high level evidence to inform clinical practice in relation to temperature management in patients without acute brain pathologies requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is a high priority because fever is common problem and the best approach to managing fever is uncertain.</summary>
