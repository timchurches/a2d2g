Patients were encouraged to drink freely of clear fluids while taking the preparation in line with the manufacturers instructions, while obstaining from solid food for 24 hours prior to colonoscopy</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The adequacy and efficacy of various small-volume bowel preparations for colonoscopy has become increasingly popular due to improved  tolerance by patients and equivalent efficacy compared with the larger volume preparations. Comparative studies however between small volume preparations are lacking. This randomised controlled trial aims to compare the efficacy and acceptability of phospo-soda buffered saline (Fleet ®) with sodium picosulphate/ magnesium citrate (Picoprep ®)  in the preparation of patients for colonoscopy.</summary>
