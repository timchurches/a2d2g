  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During peritoneal dialysis fluid is repeatedly recycled in the abdomen, to get rid of excess fluid and waste products. Peritonitis or infection of the lining inside the abdomen is a serious complication in dialysis patients that can sometimes result in death, hospitalisation or withdrawal of peritoneal dialysis. We add antibiotics to the dialysis fluid which then dwell inside the abdomen. 
The dialysis process interferes with the ability of the body to localise infection and depletes useful factors formed to fight it. Icodextrin速 is a product that can provide superior dialysis to the traditional dextrose based product that is used in our units, especially so with fluid removal during peritonitis episodes. It is our aim to utilise the superior dialytic properties of Icodextrin速 in the first 60 hours following a peritonitis episode with a dialysis free period of up to 12 hours to allow the body sufficient time to contain the infection and also to allow sufficient build up of the factors of immunity to overcome the infection. We want to show that this procedure is equivalent in safety to the traditional treatment we use and is associated with less inflammation in the peritoneum and blood of patients.</summary>
