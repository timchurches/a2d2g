  <interventions>
    <interventions>On the postoperative anaesthetic review round within 12-72 hours of the surgery, all Women allocated to open questioning will be asked how they are feeling followed within 5 minutes by the closed question of whether they are comfortable. If they have not already that they have pain, they will then immediately be asked whether they have pain or not and how severe is their pain. This will be measured using a ten point Verbal Numerical Rating Score (VNRS) with zero being no pain while 10 is the worst pain imaginable. Those women allocated to closed questioning will be asked whether they are in pain and to score the pain first prior to then being asked (within 5 minutes) how they are feeling.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>subjects will be interviewed as per our routine follow-up (usually) the next day after caesarean section but within 12-72 hours of surgery. Immediately prior to this interview subjects will be randomly allocated to pain score questioning before or after open questioning. Allocation concealment is achieved by opening consecutively numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Open questions will be asking patients how they are feeling. Closed questions will be VNRS pain scores and whether they are in pain</concealment>
