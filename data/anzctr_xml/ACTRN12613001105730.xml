  <interventions>
    <interventions>Floatation-REST (Restricted environmental Stimulation Technique) utilizes sensory deprivation as a way to induce deep relaxation.
Participants receive treatment twice a week during seven weeks. Each treatment session is 45 min long. One of the weeks is without any treatment and can be chosen by the participants.  
Participants use floating tanks which is located at Karlstad University, in the human performance laboratory. 4 floating tanks are provided. 
Sensory deprivation is reached by lying in a supine position within the floating tank. The tank is filled with a salt-water solution which hold a temperature of 34,7 Celsius degrees. The tank is dark and soundproof, efficiently blocking out external stimuli. 
Before the treatment extensive information is given about the treatment and techniques to make the most of the treatment session. If any question arises the participants can ask personal in the lab for further instructions. </interventions>
