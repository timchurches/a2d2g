  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial has 3 arms. Following baseline testing, participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups, 2 intervention and 1 control group.
The 2 exercise (intervention) groups will involve participants completing 3 weekly 40 minute training sessions over a 4 week period. The exercise intensity will be controlled and training sessions will be supervised by trained exercise science students and overseen by an exercise physiologist.
Details of the groups are as follows:
Intervention group 1- 
gym based exercise including aerobic training (walking, jogging, cycling and indoor rowing) and resistance training (lifting weights)
Intervention group 2- 
small sided games training  (e.g. modified team sports activities such as Touch rugby, Tag and various football codes). 
Control group-
no exercise (will be offered 4 weeks gym membership at the end of the trial)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A disproportionate number of Pacific people in New Zealand have impaired glucose tolerance and type II diabetes, potentially leading to cardiovascular disease and other complications. While a variety of lifestyle interventions are recommended to reduce these risks, to date there is insufficient research that has compared the benefits of differing types of physical activity. Individuals who engage in regular exercise demonstrate lower incidence of diabetes, improved metabolic control, reduced cardiovascular risk and fewer health problems overall. Thus exercise presents a therapeutic, non-pharmacological option for the prevention of diabetes and reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) amongst other health benefits. However, the benefits of differing types of physical activity in a Pacific community are largely unknown. While there is some research showing the benefits of aerobic and/or strength type exercise within the general population, there is no research that has compared these modalities of exercise to team-sport activities that are often performed in Pacific communities during organised sport and play.
Therefore, for the first time, we will compare effects of gym based activities versus small sided games to a non-exercising control group.
Encouraging results could have implications for future larger scale trials and government funded health initiatives.</summary>
