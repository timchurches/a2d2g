  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is mainly based on psychoeducation and structured behaviour modification for the long term treatment of insomnia. The methods used in our program include environment and lifestyle modifications, teaching of relaxation techniques and structured sleep schedule modifications aiming to improve sleep initiation and continuity.

Our program has two formats:

- 2 group sessions with a trained therapist followed by 2 individual sessions

or

- 4 group sessions with a trained therapist 

In either cases, sessions last for one and half hours every fortnight.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to compare the outcomes of two different formats of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) programmes implemented by our team in real life clinic populations. 

Key components of these education-based programmes include:
- teaching about sleep mechanisms and factors contributing to the development and maintenance of insomnia
- challenging current beliefs about sleep
- structured behavior modification
- strategies to cope with anxiety and mood disturbances 

 CBT-i can be used in different formats, with individual sessions, group sessions or both. This study will compare two formats of CBT-i presented in a standardised slide presentation: 
  - The CBT-i4 Programme which involves 4 group sessions 
  - The CBT-i2-2 Programme which involves 2 group sessions with 2 subsequent individual follow-up sessions focussing on the participants implementation of the behavioural strategies learnt during the group session and allowing individual guidance and support.

These two programmes will be conducted at the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research with individuals who have at least a one month history of insomnia symptoms (DSM-IV criteria). Voluntary participants will be recruited by sleep psychologists and sleep physicians at the Woolcock Insomnia Clinic after completing an assessment for sleep disorders. To quantify improvements in subjective sleep quality assessments, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and sleep diaries between the assessment visit and the first CBT-i session, at the end of the programme (4th group session or 2nd individual session) and 6 months after the last session.  

The current study will also include data from a CBT-i4 Programme previously run at Royal Prince Alfred Hospitals Sleep Unit through a project that has been approved by the SSWAHS Ethics Review Committee (RPAH ZONE).

Results from the current study are likely to provide empiric evidence on ways to optimize cognitive-behaviour therapy for insomnia in real world clinical settings.</summary>
