  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised infants are placed on the resuscitation bed and initial care is per local protocol. Adequate lung expansion is achieved with CPAP or ventilation. A pulse oximeter sensor is placed on the right wrist and connected to the Masimo pulse oximeter. Initial FiO2 is set to 0.21. Once oximetry readings are established, FiO2 is adjusted every 30 seconds to achieve target SpO2 values of 80% at 5 minutes and 90% at 10 minutes and after. This is a one off intervention that will last about 20-30 minutes (average duration of respiratory care in the delivery room). Infants may be given pure oxygen (FiO2 1.0) if 1. The infant's heart rate falls below 100 bpm despite adequate ventilation, 2. SpO2 is less than 65% at or after 5 minutes, and/or 3. external cardiac massage or resuscitation medications are required at any time. Management after the infant leaves the delivery room will be as per institutional guidelines.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Assuming 77% survival without major disability at 2 years corrected for gestation in the control group, 600 infants per arm (1200 total sample size) yields 80% power for a 7.1% improvement from 77% to 84.1% in survival without major disability at 2 years, with two-tailed 5% significance level, allowing for 10% non-adherence.
Statistical analysis for the primary endpoints of this study will be conducted by the intention to treat principle. Analyses will be based on the GEE extension to the generalized linear model with each measures treated as a binary outcome using a logit link to evaluate the effect of treatment controlling for gestational age stratum. Comparison between treatment arms will be assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) models and comparable non-parametric tests for continuous variables and generalized linear models and contingency table procedures (Chi square tests) for categorical variables, controlling for gestational age strata. Linear and generalized regression models will adjust for potential confounders (i.e., demographic and clinical data, site) and evaluate the independent association between oxygen level used for resuscitation at delivery and neuro-developmental outcome.  For each outcome measure, model-based approaches will examine whether treatment effects differ across the two gestational age strata, and if so will evaluate treatment effect within strata, although the power to detect such differences is limited. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oxygen is necessary for life, but both too much or too little, can damage eyes, lungs and brain. The preterm infant is unique, while their ability to cope with too much oxygen (oxidative stress) is limited, they also need some oxygen after birth because their lungs are not fully developed.

The Torpido2 Study aims to show that preterm infants born at less than 28 completed weeks gestation who have had delivery room resuscitation initiated with 21% (air) followed by lower oxygen targeting until admission to NICU will have improved outcomes when compared with similar infants who have had delivery room resuscitation initiated with 60% oxygen followed by higher oxygen targeting until admission to NICU.</summary>
