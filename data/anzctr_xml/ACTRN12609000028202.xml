  <interventions>
    <interventions>use of continuous glucose monitoring to better define the nature of prednisolone induced hyperglycaemia. Each patient will be monitored for up to 3 days and high dose prednisolone is defined as a single daily oral dose of 20mg or more. Interstitual fluid glucose is measured by the continuous glucose monitor, and this is a well known and accurate proxy for blood glucose. We aim to enrol 50 patients and this is expected to take up to 1 year.</interventions>
    <comparator>Extrapolation of the Hba1c to estimate the mean interstitual glucose level over the prior 3 months. This is done using the equation developed by Nathan et al(Diab Care 31:1473-8, 2008) that converts a Hba1c value into a mean blood glucose reflecting the prior 3 months. In this manner the patient acts as their own control</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When people with airways disease have flare-ups in their disease they are often admitted to hospital and receive high doses of an anti-inflammatory drug (prednisolone) as treatment. This drug can increase the patient's blood sugar levels, even in those who are not diabetics. This temporary increase in sugar evels may slow the patient from recovery. We are measuring the effect of prednisolone on blood sugar levels in the hope that we can identify a way to manage the sugar levels and keep them in the normal range when a patient receives high doses of prednisolone. If we managed to achieve this, then we may be able to speed up the recovery of the patient.</summary>
