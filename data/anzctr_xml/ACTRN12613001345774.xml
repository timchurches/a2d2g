    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Suitable patients will be identified on the wards and at consultant outpatient clinics of the Cardiothoracic Department and recruited over a period of 18 to 24 months. Ward patients who are suitable will be approached on the ward where they will be given the PICF and given enough time read the information and discuss with family members before consent is sought. Patients who are identified at consultant outpatient clinics will be given the PICF at the end of the consult, where they will have an opportunity to read and discuss the information with family members. They will then be followed up at preadmissions clinic for discussion of the trial and seeking of consent.
A preassigned randomisation schedule has been generated offsite and all medication bottles are labelled with a randomisation number.  When the time comes for a patient to be randomised, they are given the next appropriate bottle of pre-randomised trial drug.  Treating team, investigators, and participants are blinded.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio of placebo and colchicine using a preassigned randomization schedule. The randomization will stratified for the type of surgery (CABG, AVR, CABG+AVR). A 24 hour code breaking facility, for unblinding the treatment allocation of an individual participant in case of an emergency is available.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The trial will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis with the primary outcome of whether the participant develops POAF or not (a dichotomous variable). Cox regression analysis will be used to estimate the relative risk reduction of POAF with colchicine.  POAF-free survival after surgery will be evaluated in treatment and control groups using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test.  Differences between treatment and placebo groups will be investigated using the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, and ?2 analysis for categorical variables.  Treatment and placebo groups will be compared for baseline characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes:
Primary Outcome:
a)	Incidence of POAF
Secondary Outcomes
a)	Duration of AF
b)	Recurrence of AF
c)	Postoperative LOS
d)	Representation for AF
e)	Readmission for AF 
f)	Incidence of amiodarone use
g)	Symptoms of toxicity
h)	Adverse events
Sub-groups of our trial population will be analysed individually to investigate whether their outcomes differ from the whole trial population.  These sub-groups will include but is not limited to:
a)	CABG patient group
b)	AVR patient group
c)	Septuagenarian patients
d)	Octogenarians patients
e)	Patients who are extubated within 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours may be analysed separately and compared.
