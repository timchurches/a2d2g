The 6 variables are physician global assessment of disease activity (worsening of 20 units minimum on a 0-100 visual analog scale [VAS]), parent/patient global assessment of overall well-being (worsening of 20 VAS units minimum), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with active arthritis (swelling, or pain and limitation of motion), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and functional ability assessed using the disability index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ, 30 questions, 8 domains, 0[best]-3[worst]). Patients who withdrew or who took escape medication are classified as flared.

There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. If aids and devices listed in the questionnaire or assistance from a person are required to perform a task, a domain score of 0 or 1 is increased to 2; if the domain score is 2 or 3, the domain score is not adjusted. To calculate the overall score, the patient must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A higher score indicates less ability.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score at Weeks 2, 40, 52, and 104 - The patient or parent/guardian, as appropriate, provides a rating of the patient's pain (also called a discomfort index) on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal scale. The extreme left end of the line represents 'no pain' and the extreme right end represents 'very extreme pain'. A higher score indicates more pain. A negative change score indicates improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percent of Patients With Inactive Disease From Week 16 to Week 104 - A patient is judged to have inactive disease if all of the following criteria are met: Number of joints with active arthritis = 0; absence of active uveitis, defined by the adverse event preferred terms 'uveitis' and 'intermediate uveitis'; normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (&lt; 20 mm/hour regardless of age and sex); and physician's global assessment of overall well-being visual analog scale score = 10.

      <outcome>Percent of Patients in Clinical Remission From Week 40 to 104 - A patient was in clinical remission if they had inactive disease at all visits in the 6 months prior to and including the visit assessment day. A patient was judged to have inactive disease if all of the following criteria were met: Number of joints with active arthritis = 0; absence of active uveitis, defined by the adverse event preferred terms 'uveitis' and 'intermediate uveitis'; normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (&lt; 20 mm/hour regardless of age and sex); and physician's global assessment of overall well-being visual analog scale score = 10.

The 6 variables are physician global assessment of disease activity (20 units minimum on a 0-100 visual analog scale [VAS]), parent/patient global assessment of overall well-being (20 VAS units minimum), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with active arthritis (swelling, or pain and limitation of motion), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and functional ability assessed using the disability index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ, 30 questions, 8 domains, 0[best]-3[worst]).

      <outcome>Oral Corticosteroid Dose at Baseline, Week 52, and Week 104 - Due to the different types of corticosteroid medications available, the prednisone equivalent was used in the calculation of the oral corticosteroid dose. Values are based on the average daily dose on the study day and if not available the last observation carried forward is used.</outcome>

      <outcome>Height Standard Deviation Score at Baseline, Week 52, and Week 104 - The height Standard Deviation Score was calculated using the following formula: (Observed height - median of the reference population)/standard deviation of the reference population. The reference population was defined as that of the same sex and age to the nearest completed year and month using the World Health Organization norms. A negative score indicates less height than the reference population.</outcome>

    <summary>This 3-part study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with active
      polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who have an inadequate response to, or
      were intolerant of methotrexate. In Part I of the study, all patients received intravenous
      (iv) infusions of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg for patients = 30kg, 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for patients
      &lt; 30kg) every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. In Part II of the study, patients with an adequate
      response in Part I were randomized to receive either tocilizumab at the same dose as in Part
      I or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 24 weeks. In Part III of the study, patients received
      tocilizumab at the same dose as in Part I every 4 weeks for up to another 64 weeks. Standard
      of care therapy with or without non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID),
      corticosteroids, or methotrexate was continued throughout the study.</summary>
