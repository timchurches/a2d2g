  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Urocortin 2 is a recently discovered peptide present in human plasma which may play an important role in cardiovascular control. In animals it has been shown to relax arteries, increase blood flow to the heart and the amount of blood the heart pumps confirming it's role in cardiovascular physiology.  We plan to measure plasma concentrations of Urocortin 2 in normal subjects and patients with stable left ventricular dysfunction.  We also plan to assess the effect of low dose infusions of Urocortin 2 in normal volunteers and subjects with stable left ventricular dysfunction.  Arterial pressure and cardiac output will be measured non-invasively, blood samples to assess its hormonal interactions and urine samples to assess the effect of Urocortin 2 on urine volume and sodium excretion will be collected.</summary>
