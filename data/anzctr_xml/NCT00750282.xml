    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Specificity and Sensitivity of Florbetaben PET Scans Obtained in Part A Using Two Separate Algorithms and the Onsite Clinical Diagnosis as the Standard of Truth - Part A: For the calculation of sensitivity/specificity, a patient with probable AD was expected to have a positive florbetaben PET scan which was considered a match for sensitivity. A HV was expected to have a negative florbetaben PET scan which was considered a match for specificity. Standard of truth was the onsite clinical diagnosis.
Two Beta-Amyloid Plaque Load (BAPL) algorithms for assessing the normality/abnormality of beta-amyloid plaque load in the brain scans were used.
Using algorithm A (Majority Read), a brain scan of a subject with a BAPL score of "1" (without beta-amyloid plaque load) or "2" (with minor beta-amyloid plaque load) was considered normal and a BAPL score of "3" (with significant beta-amyloid plaque load) was considered abnormal.
Using algorithm B (Average), a brain scan of a subject with a BAPL score of "1" was considered normal and a brain scan with a BAPL score of "2" or "3" was considered abnormal. Algorithm B was used in Part B and in the final</outcome>

      <outcome>Specificity and Sensitivity of Florbetaben PET Scans Obtained in Part B Using Two Separate Algorithms and the Onsite Clinical Diagnosis as the Standard of Truth. - Part B: For the calculation of sensitivity/specificity, a patient with probable AD was expected to have a positive florbetaben PET scan, ie,abnormal scan (BAPL scores "2" or "3") which was considered a match for sensitivity. A HV was expected to have a negative florbetaben PET scan, ie,normal scan (BAPL score "1") which was considered a match for specificity.
The clinical diagnosis was established by an independent consensus panel (CP) of experts in dementia.
Two independent sets of PET data reads were performed. The first set was performed by a panel of three readers who received live, instructor-led training on the visual assessment procedure. The second set was performed by a panel of five separate readers who were trained on the visual assessment procedure with electronic media.</outcome>

      <outcome>Kappa Coefficient as a Measure of Agreement Between Readers Concerning the Visual Assessment of Abnormality of the Brain Scan (Based on BAPL Score) - The agreement between 3 blinded readers concerning the visual assessment of abnormality of the brain scan (based on BAPL score) was measured by the kappa coefficient. Kappa values close to 1.0 indicate a high agreement while values close to 0 indicate random agreement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Standard Uptake Value Ratios for Florbetaben Signal - The Standard Uptake Value Ratios for florbetaben signal in the frontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate cortex, occipital cortex, and cerebellum (white matter) were determined as a quantitative measure of tracer uptake. The SUV is defined as the ratio of (1) the tissue radioactivity concentration c (in MBq/kg) at time point t, and (2) the injected activity (in MBq, extrapolated to the same time t) divided by the body weight (in kg). These SUV numbers from regions of interest were then used to derive SUV ratios (SUVR) using the SUV from the cerebellar cortex as reference.)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety of a single dose of BAY 94-9172 (ZK
      6013443) as an investigational medicinal product (IMP) in detecting cerebral protein-plaque
      (amyloid beta) with positron emission tomography (PET). IMP binds to amyloidal beta protein
      accumulating in brain tissue already from early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). IMP is
      therefore a potential tracer to be used for detecting amyloid plaques. For each subject it is
      required to visit the study centre during the screening phase, on the PET imaging day and for
      1 follow-up visit on the next day. A telephone call for safety follow-up will be performed 7
      days after IMP administration. During the screening phase the subject's medical, neurological
      and surgical history, specific laboratory tests related to AD, MRI of the brain and certain
      neuro-psychiatric tests will be performed. Clinical safety measures (physical examinations,
      vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory tests) will be performed on the PET
      imaging day before IMP injection and monitored during and after two PET imaging sessions.
      Clinical safety measures will be performed again on the follow-up visit next day. The results
      of PET imaging with IMP will be compared between probable AD patients and healthy volunteers
      (HV). The clinical diagnosis is based on international validated and accepted criteria and
      established after comprehensive clinical and neuro-psychiatric examinations</summary>
