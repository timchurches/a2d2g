    <interventions>This study will recruit 120 participants with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).  The trial is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised cross over trial to evaluate a novel and cost effective food supplement, butyrylated high amylose maize starch (HAMSB), compared to a control starch, low amylose maize starch (LAMS), on polyposis in FAP patients.  The starches (20g dose size) will be ingested orally, twice per day, by way of combination with food for 6 months duration.  The daily dose of HAMSB and LAMS is 40g/day.

Following a baseline colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy and biopsy collection, participants will consume either HAMSB or placebo (LAMS) for 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) then undergo another colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy examination and biopsy collection before crossing over to the alternate starch for 6 months.  The second intervention period will be concluded with a colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy with biopsies.  Participants will then consume their normal diet for a further 6 months with no intervention and at the end of this period a final colonscopy/sigmoidoscopy and biopsy will be performed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aim 1: Assess the efficacy of Starplus B at reducing polyp incidence 
(i)  In a defined area after appropriate clearance at sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy, or
(ii)  causing regression of small polyps left in situ in another defined area, and
(iii)  in general throughout the large bowel
This will be done using colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy procedures and video analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 26, Week 52, Week 78</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aim 2: Determine the effect of Starplus B on molecular characteristics of typical polyps and on macroscopically normal adjacent rectal mucosa:
a.  Measure rates of apoptosis in polyps and adjacent mucosa
b.  Measure proliferation in polyps and adjacent mucosa
c.  Measure surrogate markers of DNA damage in polyps and adjacent mucosa</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 26, Week 52, Week 78</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aim 2.1: Determine the proportion of esterified butyrate released in the gastrointestinal tract of FAP patients consuming Starplus B.  This will be done by analysing faecal samples, using standard distillation procedures and gas chromatography, collected from 60 participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 4, Week 26, Week 30, Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aim 2.2: Collect information on the normal diet of FAP patients, their baseline nutrient intake and the impact of supplementation on their diet.  This will be done using a 24 hour diet recall.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 12, Week 38</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aim 2.3: Determine the effects of consumption of Starplus B on gastrointestinal function and quality of life of FAP
patients.  This will be done using a validated assessment tool for evaluating the quality of life and distress for gastrointestinal symptons (Eypasch et al., 1995 Gastrointestinal quality of life index: development, validation and application of a new instrument; British Journal of Surgery, 82, 216-222).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel and cost effective food supplement, butyrylated high amylose maize starch (HAMSB), as a dietary chemo-preventative agent for reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.

This study is a randomised double blind cross-over placebo controlled trial comparing the effects of HAMSB with a placebo starch.  This study will require a total of 120 participants with medically diagnosed familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with either an intact colon, or after colectomy with a residual IRA or ileal pouch and who have a history of polyp detection at seurveillance colonoscopies/sigmoidoscopies.  Participants will consume either HAMSB or placebo starch for 6 months and will undergo regular surveillance for assessment of established surrogate CRC markers (polyp number polyp history and biological markers).

The primary hypothesis is that HAMSB will increase butyrate levels in the large bowel digesta of FAP patients and that the increase in butyrate will reduce or delay adenoma development by inducing apoptosis in damaged colonocytes and/or reducing proliferation of adenoma cells.</summary>
