    <interventions>23-gauge vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade combined with phacoemulsification were allocated to the group 1.

Trans-scleral cannulas were placed through the pars plana in the superonasal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal quadrants, per standard vitrectomy protocol. In the combined group, phacoemulsification and IOL implantation was performed before PPV through a 2.75 mm superior clear corneal incision. Hydrophilic acrylic IOL inserted to the capsular bag in all cases. All eyes underwent core vitrectomy followed by removal of the posterior hyaloid membrane and vitreous traction. Retinal photocoagulation was performed in selected eyes. The fluid in the vitreous cavity was exchanged with silicone oil after vitrectomy. The approximate duration of procedure is 90 minutes.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>All statistics in this study were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Preoperative numerical data of the first groups were compared with the Mann Whitney U test which of the difference between the distributions of data collected in two experimental conditions applied to unmatched groups of subjects but comparing the distributions of the ranks of the scores.

In order to do the inferential analyses of three times studied between themselves it was used the Friedman test. This test was complemented by the Wilcoxon signed rank test to cases in which there were significant statistical difference pointed by the Friedman test. Bonferonni corrected, was used to perform pairwise comparisons (in the text, p-values are corrected). Visual acuity was measured with the Snellen chart, then converted to the logMAR chart and mean best-corrected visual acuities were calculated. Finally, LogMAR scores were converted back to snellen. The level of significance was set at &lt;0.05.

To determine the sample size we need to specify, a form of a priori power analysis is used. G Power 3 is used for calculating statistical power. The graph was generated from G Power on power analysis.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Purpose: To compare the clinical outcomes of 23-gauge vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade combined with phacoemulsification and without phacoemulsification. 
Patients and Methods: This study included thirty eight eyes of 38 patients that underwent 23-gauge vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade combined with and without phacoemulsification in SB Ankara Ulucanlar Eye Education and Research Hospital between January 2009 and December 2011. A complete ophthalmological examination including visual acuity, intraocular pressure with applanation tonometry, biomicroscobic examination findings, dilated pupil examination of the posterior segment, and ocular ultrasonography were evaluated at baseline and during follow-up period. Nineteen eyes of 19 cases that underwent 23-gauge vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade combined with phacoemulsification were allocated to the group 1, and 19 eyes of 19 cases that underwent 23-gauge vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade alone were allocated to the group 2.
Results: There were 5 female (26.3%) and 14 male (73.7%) and the average age of patients was 48.8 years in group 1. There were 9 female (47.4%) and 10 male (52.6%) and the average age of patients was 49.4 years in group 2. Mean follow up period was 2.2 years (8-44 months). Visual acuities between two groups were statistically compared and significant changes were not found (P&gt; 0.05). Recurrent retinal detachments were observed in 1 case (5%) in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups as a point of recurrent retinal detachments (P&gt; 0.05). This study found higher rate of post-vitrectomy cataract progression (47.4%).
Conclusion: Combined vitrectomy and phacoemulsification is safe and effective in vitreoretinal surgery and was associated with better visual acuity in postoperative period. There was no significant difference in the final visual acuity and in re-detachment rate.
