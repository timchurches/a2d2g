  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In an 8 week randomised controlled trial, patients with type 2 DM (n=30) will be randomised into one of two treatment groups to receive either exercise and 30 mg/d elemental zinc (Zn + exercise group) or exercise and placebo (Exercise group). Supplementation will occur over the 8 week intervention, with exercise training conducted in the last week of the study period. All participants will undergo supervised daily exercise training for 60 min/day at 60% of maximal fitness capacity for 7 consecutive days. During the study, participants will be asked to provide three fasting blood samples in total (baseline, week 6 and week 8). Blood samples will be analysed for glucose, insulin, lipids and zinc. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated for the assessment of cellular zinc status which includes the expression of zinc transporter, metallothionein, and mediators of insulin sensitivity will be measured. Insulin sensitivity will be measured by hyperinsulinemic, euglycaemic clamps on three occasions (baseline, week 6 and week 8) during the intervention period. A skeletal muscle biopsy may be obtained during the clamp, with participant's additional consent.</summary>
