Behaviour - Quadriceps strengthening program

Experimental: 1 - Motor control retraining program


Behaviour: Motor control retraining program
Specific retraining of VMO activation in a low-load situation,and progressed to integrate more functional positions. Use of dual channel biofeedback was incorporated

Behaviour: Quadriceps strengthening program
4 exercises focused on quadriceps strengthening commencing at a resistance of 60% 1 repetition maximum. Each exercise was performed for 3 sets of 10 repetitions

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain at the front of the knee is a common condition treated by physical therapists. Treatment
      may consist of generalised strengthening exercises directed at the quadriceps muscle or
      specific retraining aimed at restoring motor control at the knee. This study compared these
      two exercise programs in a group of people who were painfree at the time to evaluate their
      effect on motor control. It was hypothesised that only the motor retraining program would
      influence motor control at the knee.</summary>
