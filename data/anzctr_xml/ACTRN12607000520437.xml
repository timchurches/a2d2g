    <interventions>Two-stage dose escalation study involving intravenous administration of BNC105P on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.

Stage 2 enrolls 3 or more patients per cohort, beginning at the dose level where significant toxicities are observed in Stage 1 and dose increments are either 33%, 50% or 100% depending upon the incidence of adverse events (2 or more, 1, or no patients with adverse events, respectively).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Phase 1
This is trial of the drug BNC105P for treating people with advanced solid tumours.

Who is it for?
Participation in this study is open to patients who have advanced solid cancers of any type (excluding brain tumours), are 18 years and over and meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Trial details
Participants will receive BNC105P intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle, for a minimum of 2 cycles. Blood tests and imaging will be carried out throughout the treatment cycles to monitor safety, tumour response and suppression of cancer growth.  
The trial aims to test the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of BNC105P. This is an experimental anti-cancer drug which disrupts the blood supply within tumours and is cytotoxic to cancer cells.</summary>
