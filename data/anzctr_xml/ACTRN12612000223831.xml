  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia(CBT-I): 4 one-on-one face-to-face sessions of CBT-I are conducted with a psychologist across 8 weeks of treatment (one 50 minute session every two weeks). Session one consists of sleep education and sleep hygiene recommendations as well as an introduction to relaxation techniques. Session two focuses on the importance of sleep scheduling and discusses the rationale and instructions for both stimulus control and sleep restriction. It also introduces progressive muscle relaxation. Session three looks to adjust the sleep schedule, overcome adherence issues and focuses on cognitive restructuring around unhelpful beliefs and attitudes about sleep. It also has an imagery relaxation exercise. The fourth and last session Assesses gains made across the treatment, looks at maintenance strategies and relapse prevention, and concludes with a mindfulness relaxation exercise.
A 3 month-follow up is then conducted to monitor changes over time.</interventions>
    <comparator>The information only control group attends the same number of sessions (4 sessions across 8 weeks) and receives the same documentation of information (sleep education, sleep hygiene recommendations, sleep scheduling rationale and instructions, relaxation techniques and cognitive techniques) as the CBT-I group. However, they are unable to go over the information with the researcher or ask any treatment related questions during their participation in the study. Following their 3-month follow-up, they will be offered up to 4 sessions of CBT-I free of charge, although data will not be collected for the study during this time.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II): This will be used as a primary outcome measure. It is a 21-item self-report measure that assesses the severity of various commonly reported symptoms of depression over a two week period. It has a 4 point scale for each item ranging from 0-3. Total scores range from 0-63.  It has high internal consistency, high content validity, high validity in differentiating between depressed and non-depressed subjects, and sensitivity to change.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The BDI-II will be taken on a total of six occasions: At the screening session, at sessions 1, 2, and 3, at post-treatment (end of session 4), and 3 months post-therapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): This will be used as the primary outcome measure for determining changes in insomnia severity across the study. This self-rated measure consists of 7 items that are scored from 0 to 4, with 0 = no problem, very satisfied, not at all noticeable, not at all worried, and not at all interfering to 4 = very severe problem, very dissatisfied, very much noticeable, very much worried, and very much interfering. The sum of these items produces an overall score (range = 0-28), with 0-14 indicating no clinically significant (or sub-threshold) insomnia, 15-21 indicating a moderate severity of clinical insomnia, and 22-28 indicating severe insomnia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The ISI will be taken on a total of six occasions: During baseline data collection, at sessions 1, 2, and 3, at post-treatment (end of session 4), and 3 months post-therapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS): The FSS is a 9-item general fatigue scale that assesses the behavioural consequences, rather than the symptoms of fatigue, and the impact of fatigue on daily functioning. The FSS has acceptable internal consistency, stability over time, and sensitivity to clinical changes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The FSS will be taken on three occasions: During baseline data collection, at post-treatment (end of session 4), and 3-months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS): This daytime sleepiness measure is widely used as an index of sleep propensity in adults. Participants rate how likely they would be to doze off in eight situations, in their usual way of life, on a scale from 0  = would never doze, to 3 = high chance of dozing. Total scores range from 0-24.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The ESS will be taken on three occasions: During baseline data collection, at post-treatment (end of session 4), and 3-months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): This instrument is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a one-month period. Seven component scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duaration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction) and a global score are generated from 19 questions. The global PSQI score greater than 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 86.5% (kappa = 0.75, p &lt; .001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The PSQI will be taken on three occasions: During baseline data collection, at post-treatment (end of session 4), and 3-months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Actigraphic sleep parameters. Actiwatch (Respironics, USA) is a wrist activity monitor (16g) with an integrated light sensor (range 0.1 TO 150,000 lux). Several sleep parameters can be derived from actigraphic data, including sleep duration, sleep efficiency (total sleep time divided by time in bed) and number of awakenings.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sleep parameters will be collected during the baseline period every night for two weeks and for every night across the 8 weeks of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Pittsburgh sleep diary (PSD): This instrument records several subjective sleep measures across a 2-week period,  including bedtime (BT), sleep onset latency (SOL; time taken to get to sleep), number of awakenings (NOA), wake after sleep onset (WASO - time awake during the sleep period), and rising time (RT). The collection of these variables also allow for further subjective sleep measures to be calculated, including time in bed (TIB = difference between BT and RT), total sleep time (TST = TIB - SOL - WASO) and sleep efficiency (SE = TST / TIB).  These variables allow for progress to be monitored and for feedback to be given to participants. The SE findings also help determine TIB prescriptions for sessions 2, 3 and 4 (based on the bed restriction instructions).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The PSD will be completed by participants upon waking each day during the two-week baseline data collection, across the 8 weeks of treatment, and two weeks prior to the 3-month post-treatment session.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Diagnostic Interview of Sleeping Disorders (DISD): The DISD is a structured clinical interview that asks several questions about the severity of an individual's sleeping problem, their typical current sleep pattern, their history of insomnia, whether or not they exhibit symptoms of other sleep disorders, their ideal circadian rhythm, usage of medicinal or other sleeping aids, their sleep hygiene practices, their nocturnal cognitions, and the relationship between their sleep and mood to delineate if their insomnia is primary, secondary or co-morbid.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The DISD is only given once: During the initial screening session, and is used to help determine eligibility for the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Multivariate Apnoea Risk Index (MAP index): This 13-item screening tool assesses for the likely prevalence of sleep apnoea or other primary sleep disorders. Responses are rated on the frequency of symptoms experienced or noticed by others per week over the past month, with 0 = never; 1 = rarely, less than once a week; 2 = 1-2 times per week; 3 = 3-4 times per week; 4 = 5-7 times per week; and DK = Don't know. The sum of these items are then divided by the number of responses to obtain the overall symptom score (range 0-4), with a higher score representing a greater risk of apnoea. Any participants that are considered to be high-risk of a primary sleep disorder will be informed of their results at the conclusion of their participation in the study and will be encouraged to discuss these findings with their general practitioner or a sleep specialist.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The MAP index is only given once: During the initial screening session.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21): The DASS-21 consists of three separate 7-item scales that aim to delineate the core features of depression, anxiety and stress, with the overall 21-item scale being a general measure of negative affectivity. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3 based on how much each statement (item) applied to the participant over the past week. Scores for each scale are summed up and multiplied by 2 to obtain the final rating (range = 0-42), with higher scores indicating a greater level of severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The DASS-21 will be taken on three occasions: During baseline data collection, at post-treatment (end of session 4), and 3-months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep Scale (DBAS-16): This instrument is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that is used to examine the strength of several unhelpful beliefs and attitudes that are thought to contribute to the maintenance of insomnia. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 (= strongly disagree) to 10 (=strongly agree) based on how much the participant agrees with each statement. The item scores are then summed to obtain an overall DBAS-16 score, with higher scores indicating more dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The DBAS-16 will be taken on three occasions: During baseline data collection, at post-treatment (end of session 4), and 3-months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI): This instrument is used to assess sleep hygiene practices. Each of the 13-items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 based on how frequently the participant engages in specific poor sleep hygiene behaviour, with 0 = never and 4 = always. The item scores are summed to obtain an overall SHI score, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep hygiene practices.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The SHI will be taken on three occasions: During baseline data collection, at post-treatment (end of session 4), and 3-months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Insomnia and Depression share many common features such as low energy, fatigue, poor concentration and sleep difficulties. Insomnia is not just a symptom of depression however, and this is why insomnia symptoms remain nearly 50% of the time through antidepressant treatment. The objective of the current research is therefore to treat the sleep disturbances in individuals with depression and insomnia (whose symptoms have not remitted through at least 6-weeks of antidepressant treatment) with 4 sessions of CBT-I. The aims are to improve the participant's quality of sleep and reduce both their insomnia and depression severity.  

Our primary hypotheses are that participants receiving CBT-I will have significantly improved sleep quality and significantly reduced insomnia and depression severity compared to an information only control (IOC) group after the 8 weeks of treatment and at the 3-month follow-up session.</summary>
