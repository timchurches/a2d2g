      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Normalized Number of GERD Events Observed From Video and Cardiorespiratory Monitoring - The number of events are normalized prior to summary to correspond to a complete 8-hour monitoring period.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Normalized Number of GERD Events During Video and Cardiorespiratory Monitoring Associated With Acid Reflux - Event considered associated with reflux if start time of GERD sign/symptom is within 2 minutes of start time of acid reflux.
