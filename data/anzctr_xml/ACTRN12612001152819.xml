    <interventions>PART 1

Three fixed dose combination formulation prototypes will be compared to co-administration of the marketed formulations. The difference between the 3 prototypes for part 1 are different rates of dissolution.

Treatment A:  Administration of a single oral dose of MK-0663B 90 mg etoricoxib /6 mg tizanidine MR (Prototype 1)

Treatment B: Administration of a single oral dose of MK-0663B 90 mg etoricoxib /6 mg tizanidine MR (Prototype 2)

Treatment C: Administration of a single oral dose of MK-0663B 90 mg etoricoxib /6 mg tizanidine MR (Prototype 3)

Treatment D: Co-administration of a single oral dose of etoricoxib 90 mg &amp; tizanidine MR 6 mg
All participants will receive single oral doses of each treatment in a 4 way crossover fashion with a minimum of 7 day washout period in between.

PART 2
The prototype most closely approximating  co-administration of etoricoxib 90 mg &amp; tizanidine MR 6 mg will be selected for Part 2.


Treatment E: Administration of a single oral dose of MK-0663B (Prototype selected from Part 1)

Treatment F: Co-administration of a single oral dose of etoricoxib 90 mg &amp; tizanidine MR 6 mg

All participants will receive single oral doses of each treatment in a 2 way crossover fashion with a minimum of 7 day washout period in between.
MK0663B (combination treatment) is being developed for the treatment of acute pain in musculoskeletal conditions with swelling and muscle spasm. However, this study is in healthy volunteers only.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare the pharmacokinetic profile of three single-dose formulations of MK-0663B (90 mg etoricoxib /6 mg tizanidine MR), a tablet administered as a single bi-layer tablet with the co-administration of etoricoxib 90 mg and tizanidine MR 6 mg by means of AUC0-last, Cmax, tmax, and t1/2 under fasting and non-fasting conditions.

Measured by: pharmacokinetics of etoricoxib and tizanidine</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for determining etoricoxib and tizanidine in plasma will be collected over a period of 72 hours post-dose
(All Arms in both Parts 1 &amp; 2): predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 72hr post dose (2 samples collected at each time point)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To monitor the safety of subjects participating in the study and tolerability of the MK-0663B probe formulation in comparison with the co-administration of etoricoxib 90 mg and tizanidine MR 6 mg considering adverse events, physical exams, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and laboratory safety tests (serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis).

Measured by adverse events, physical exams, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and laboratory safety tests (serum chemistry, haematology and urinalysis)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events: from screening (enrollment into study) through to study completion (14 days post dose)  
 
Physical Exams: screening (enrollment into study), pre dose (visit 1), and 14 days post dose
Vital Signs Measurement:  screening (enrollment into study), pre dose (visit 1),  4hr, 8hr, 14 days post dose
ECG:  screening (enrollment into study), pre dose (visit 1), , 14 days post dose
Lab safety tests:  screening (enrollment into study), pre dose (visit 1), , 14 days post dose</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An open-label, 2-part, randomized, single-dose, crossover study to initially characterize the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of MK-0663B 90 mg/6 mg
formulated as prototype tablets under fasted and fed conditions when compared to coadministration of the individual components. The change in pharmacokinetics for etoricoxib and tizanidine when administered under fasting (Part 1) and fed conditions (Part 2) will be characterized.

MK0663B (combination treatment) is being developed for the treatment of acute pain in musculoskeletal conditions with swelling and muscle spasm. However, this study is in healthy volunteers only.</summary>
