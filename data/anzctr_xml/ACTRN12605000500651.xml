  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: To determine if changes in motor performance following a course of exercise in patients with mechanical neck pain (MNP) were dependent on the primary behavioral demand of the exercise performed. 
Design: Randomised clinical trial
Setting: University laboratory.
Participants: Sixty volunteers with chronic MNP were randomly allocated into either an endurance training group (ETr) (n=20), a coordination training group (CTr) (n=20), or an active mobility training group (MTr) (n = 20).
Intervention: Exercise targeted to improve cervical motor performance
Main Outcome Measures: Changes in cervical motor performance (strength, endurance, coordination, active mobility) following the training program were evaluated immediately following the 10 week training program, and at a 26 week follow-up. 
Results: Between group comparisons revealed significantly greater gains in endurance (P = 0.01) by the ETr group, and significantly greater gains in coordination (P = 0.02) by the CTr group. All three groups experienced improvement in pain (P &lt; 0.05) and disability (P &lt; 0.01). 
Conclusions: Changes in motor performance in individuals with MNP in response to an exercise program were dependent on the specific mode of exercise performed, with minimal improvement in other domains of motor performance
