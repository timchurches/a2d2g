  <interventions>
    <interventions>Contrast retrieval after diagnostic or interventional coronary procedure (e.g. angiogram), 30 day follow-up post procedure, evaluation the safety of the Osprey Medical Contrast System used to retrieve contrast (dye) from the coronary sinus before the dye can damage the kidneys. The device is used for a few seconds after a patient is injected with contrast</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe the safety of the Osprey Medical Contrast Removal System by summarising all system and procedure-related adverse events and estimating the serious - and procedure related serious adverse even-free rate through 30-days post treatment. System and procedure related events include death, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, pericardial hemorrhage/tamponade requiring treatment, coronary sinus perforation, dissection, or occlusion, blood loss requiring transfusion, other events related to partial coronary sinus occlusion and suction. System and procedure-related events are those events that are rated as probably related or related utilizing the protocol-specified adverse event rating system and adjudication process</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days post diagnostic or interventional coronary contrast procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine ease of use, utilizing the Likert rating (1-5), of the Osprey Medical Contrast-Induced Nephropathy System.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 (procedure day)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To estimate the rate of Adverse Events (AE) for the study group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days post diagnostic or interventional coronary contrast procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Contrast media removal sub-study will be conducted at a central laboratory utilizing Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). This analysis method utilizes inductively coupled plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths characteristic of a particular element. In this case, the element of interest is iodine, which will be used to calculate the percent removal of contrast media during the activation episodes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days post diagnostic or interventional coronary contrast procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To summarize the change in serum creatinine and eGFR pre-procedure and 72 hours post procedure and to provide an estimate of the number of subjects that develop CIN.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day of procedure and day 3 post procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To summarize the rate of successful coronary sinus cannulations with the study device. A cannulation is considered successful if the study device is deployed into the coronary sinus.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day of procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
