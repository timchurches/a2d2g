  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Queensland Health Medical Imaging survey data has highlighted only 39% of all radiologist (medical) diagnostic reports are available within 24 hours.  The absence of a radiologist report or radiographer comments within clinically relevant timeframes represent ongoing potential risks to patients through missed diagnosis. There is increasing evidence that a radiographer (allied health) commenting system that highlights and describes acute abnormalities, improves service delivery, aids in improving a quality diagnosis, and above all else improves patient care in trauma settings (such as Emergency Departments). Radiographer commenting is not intended to replace the role of radiologist reports, but assist multidisciplinary clinical teams and radiologist when viewing and interpreting x-rays.   Importantly, radiographer performance in this regard can be improved as a result of targeted education in image interpretation. A radiographer commenting system is not currently used in Queensland Health, despite evidence of its benefit and adoption elsewhere (such as the UK, NHS). Targeted education for image interpretation is a priority for radiographers within Queensland Health.  To date there has been no study comparing education delivery methods of an image interpretation program for radiographers. The purpose of this project is to assess the comparative merits of two education delivery methods as a tool for improving the ability of radiographers to detect and comment on, abnormalities visualised on trauma radiographs. This critical evidence will inform the rollout of targeted training for radiographers within Queensland Health and is likely to influence clinical education in national and international healthcare settings.</summary>
