Trial outcome Index (TOI) was calculated by the sum of the physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), and breast cancer scale (BCS) subscales of FACT-B. Total score of subscores or TOI is calculated from each score of question. Higher score means better and lower score means worthier.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>European Questionnaire-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire - EQ-5D questionnaire is a measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The optional part of the questionnaire was not applied. EQ-5D defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 5 items are combined to generate health profiles. These profiles were to be converted to a continuous single index score using a one to one matching. The lowest possible score is -0.59 and the highest is 1.00. Higher scores on the EQ-5D represent a better quality of life (QoL) and lower scores on the EQ-5D represent a worst QoL.</outcome>
