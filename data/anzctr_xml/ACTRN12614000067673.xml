  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients suspected of having nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) will do ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A diagnosis was obtained from an endoscopic biopsy that was collected from the suspected tumor or a normal nasopharynx. US examinations and MR imaging were performed prior to the nasopharyngeal endoscopy so that the biopsy would not affect the images of the nasopharynx. There was approximately 30 minutes assessed on a single occasion only.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Suspicion of NPC was based on the presence of metastatic cervical lymph nodes and/or a nasopharyngeal abnormality accompanied by nonspecific symptoms (e.g., epistaxis, nasal obstruction, hearing loss). </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether ultrasonography represents a potential screening method for suspected cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to evaluate the imaging information provided by ultrasonography that can be applied to the clinical staging and treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</summary>
