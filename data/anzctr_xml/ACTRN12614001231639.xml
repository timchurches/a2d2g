  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) during paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation  (75 patients): During the procedure, 4 catheters were introduced via the right femoral vein under lidocaine local anesthesia. A decapolar catheter (InquiryTM St. Jude Medical Inc., St.Paul, MN, USA) was positioned inside the coronary sinus (CS) and a tetrapolar catheter (SupremeTM CRD-2, St. Jude Medical Inc., St.Paul, MN, USA) on the His bundle.  Left atrium access was obtained by a single interatrial septal puncture with a BRK needle (St. Jude Medical Inc., St.Paul, MN, USA). Subsequently a circumferential decapolar catheter for pulmonary vein mapping (AFocusIITM 10 pole with a 20 mm diameter; St. Jude Medical Inc., St.Paul, MN, USA) , and the ablation catheter as were positioned into the left atrium.
The ablation was performed with open irrigated ablation catheter Therapy Cool Path DuoTM (St. Jude Medical Inc., St.Paul, MN, USA).  3-D electroanatomic mapping was performed using EnSite NavXTM-software version 8.0 (St. Jude Medical Inc., St.Paul, MN, USA). The time of the procedure never exceeded four hours.
The first objective was to systematically isolate all segmental ostial pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein isolation was confirmed by entrance block. 
Repeated electrophysiological procedures were carried out for recurrent atrial arrhythmias (after the blanking period or 3 months). The first objective was to assess pulmonary vein reconduction, followed by electrical re-isolation. </interventions>

The first objective was to systematically isolate all segmental ostial pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein isolation was confirmed by entrance block. If atrial fibrillation (AF) persisted after pulmonary vein isolation, the procedure was continued using electrogram-guided ablation for complex fractionated atrial electrograms.  Complex fractionated atrial electrograms were defined as atrial electrograms with a cycle length (CL) =120 milliseconds or atrial electrograms with fractionation composed of =2 defections and/or with continuous baseline activity. After the creation of left atrial lesions, radiofrequency application was continued inside the coronary sinus and in the right atrium if the right appendage cycle length was shorter than the left, especially at the cavotricuspid isthmus, superior vena cava, crista terminalis and right atrial septum. The tachycardia cycle length was monitored in both the right and the left atrial appendage to assist in determining the optimal site of ablation. If AF converted into atrial tachycardia (AT), activation mapping and catheter ablation of these tachycardias were performed until restoration of SR.  ATs were ablated if a patient had =1 stable AT. Atrial tachycardia was defined as organized atrial rhythm with a stable CL, a consistent endocardial activation sequence in both atria and a monomorphic P wave. The endpoint for complex fractionated electrogram (CFE) ablation was (i) the elimination of all CFE sites in the left atrium (LA), CS, and right atrium (RA),  and termination of AF with (ii) non-inducibility of AF post-ablation. If AF did not terminate after eliminating all the CFE sites, sinus rhythm was restored by electrical cardioversion. After the restoration of sinus rhythm, the induction of atrial fibrillation was again attempted; if the arrhythmia was not inducible, the procedure was stopped and if AF was still inducible, the ablation continued until the its noninducibility. Atrial fibrillation was considered inducible if it lasted more than 1 min.The time of the procedure never exceeded four hours. 
Repeated electrophysiological procedures were carried out for recurrent atrial arrhythmias (after the blanking period or 3 months). The first objective was to assess pulmonary vein reconduction, followed by electrical re-isolation. The aim of electrogram-guided ablation was the restoration of sinus rhythm , or all complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) abolished or reduced in amplitude (&gt;80%).

    <statisticalmethods>The differences in AF/AT recurrence rate according to type of ablation and other recorded variables were initially examined using chi-squared test for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. Cox proportional hazards analysis was then used to compute the adjusted relative hazards of AT and/or AF recurrence by each variable, after both the first and the second ablation procedures. The dependent variable was recurrence of either AF or AT in both models. We recorded the following variables, all of which were a priori considered for inclusion in multivariate analysis: age, gender, BMI, current cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular heart disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomiopathy, AF duration, number of AF episodes per month, left atrial size and volume, left ventricle ejection fraction, antiarrhythmics, amiodarone, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers use, procedural, radiofrequency and fluoroscopy time, Complex Fractionated Atrial Electrograms (CFAEs) and ablation complications. Covariates were selected for inclusion in final models using a stepwise forward process with the following inclusion criteria: p-value less than 0.15 at univariate analysis and equal to20% change in the hazard ratio of significant predictors. Age and procedure complications were forced to entry. A minimum events-to-variable ratio of 10 was maintained in multivariate modeling to avoid overfitting, and Schoenfelds test was carried out to check the validity of proportional hazards assumption. There were no missing values. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.
The sample size estimation was based on the following conservative assumptions: Alpha equal to 0.05; mean SD maintance of sinus rhythmin both the pulmonary vein isolation and the stepwise ablation groups. Using the above parameters, minimum 100 patients were needed to achieve 90% power with 10% expected withdrawals/dropouts.
Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p-value less than 0.05; all analyses were carried out using STATA statistical software, version 13.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA, 2013).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), arrhythmogenic activity usually originates in the muscle sleeves of the pulmonary veins (PVs) and  may trigger and perpetuate the arrythmias. Randomized trials have shown that catheter ablation is superior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in maintaining sinus rhythm (SR). Circumferential isolation of the PVs has become the cornerstone strategy for PAF catheter ablation with a  success rate ranging from 38 - 70% after a single procedure to  65 - 90% after repeated procedures.
Once initiated from a trigger, PAF will not be maintained if the appropriate substrates are not present.  The atria of patients with PAF can present very different patterns during electroanatomic mapping due to atrial myocardial fibrosis which is significantly increased in patients with PAF as compared with those in sinus rhythm. There are multiple potential etiological causes for this relationship. Aging and co-existing cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension) are thought to play an important role in the development of myocardial fibrosis and, consequently, in maintaining PAF. In patients with PAF and structural atrial disease, PVs ablation may fail and cause progressive atrial remodeling which explain the recurrences and the development of new arrhythmias. Thus alternative  approaches aimed at modifying atrial substrates in order to prevent maintaining PAF has been proposed. There is no consensus about the best catheter ablation strategy. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine whether ablation of both CFAEs and PVs is associated with a higher probability of maintaining sinus rhythm as compared to PV isolation alone in patients with PAF refractory to anti-arrhythmic therapy. One hundred fifty patients  with paroxysmal AF refractory to at least one anti-arrhythmic drug, were consecutively enrolled for a first-time catheter ablation at Electrophysiology laboratory of Clinica Pierangeli Pescara and Electrophysiology Unit, Cardiovascular Department, Spirito Santo Hospital, Pescara between January 2007 and July 2012.</summary>
