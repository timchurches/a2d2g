  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the number of days to recovery with recovery defined in two ways. Firstly recovery is defined as a pain score of 0 or 1 on a 0-10 pain scale (numerical pain rating scale) that is maintained for seven consecutive days. Secondly recovery is defined as the first day that the patient has a pain score or 0 or 1 on a 0 to 10 pain scale.</outcome>
