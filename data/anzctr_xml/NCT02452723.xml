             cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or psychiatric disease

          -  Any current or relevant previous history of serious, severe or unstable physical or
             psychiatric illness or medical disorder that may make the participant unlikely to

    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety of an investigational cell transplantation therapy,
      ISC-hpNSC, in patients with Parkinson's disease. All patients will receive the therapy, which
      consists of human neural stem cells. Three dose levels will be examined in the study.</summary>
