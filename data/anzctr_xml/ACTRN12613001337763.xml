  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study in split into two components: Survey A and B. Respondents who agree to participate will be randomly assigned to either Survey A or B, and undergo one survey only. The study will be administered online. In Survey A, respondents will be randomly assigned to read one of 12 (2x3x2) variations of a leaflet describing a hypothetical trial. These variations incorporate positive, negative or neutral wording. The leaflet is based on BOOST II (www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1302298). In Survey B, respondents will be randomly presented either (i) a video describing features of clinical trials (ii) a written transcript of the video or (iii) no information. The approximate duration of the video is 5 minutes. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For Survey A, the primary outcome being observed is the parent's level of understanding. This will be measured using a previously validated questionnaire (Porteri et al, 2009) adapted for use in parents of newborn infants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During completion of the anonymous online survey</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For Survey B, respondents level of understanding will be measured on a three part Likert Scale on the key aspects and common pitfalls of randomized clinical trials.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>During completion of the anonymous online survey</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Both Survey A and B measure general anxiety and changes in levels of anxiety after receiving the intervention. For Survey A this is one of 12 variations of the BOOST II leaflet; and for Survey B this is either the video or the transcript of the ECRAN Video Introduction to Clinical Trials or the control, summing to 3 variations.

Anxiety will be measured using the previously validated State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (Spielberger et al, 1977; OBrien et al, 2013). </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome for both Survey A and B, parents willingness to participate, will be measured on a five part Likert Scale ranging from very unlikely to very likely to participate.</outcome>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be invited to consider contributing to the study via the Facebook pages of Miracle Babies Foundation and other similar parent support organisations in other countries.

After accessing the anonymous online questionnaire and agreeing to participate participants will be randomly allocated to Survey A or to Survey B, without prior knowledge of which survey will be allocated. This will be done via central randomisation by computer. 

In Survey A participants will be randomly allocated to 
read 1 of 12 versions of a hypothetical information leaflet describing a hypothetical a randomised controlled trial in preterm babies, without prior knowledge of which intervention will be allocated. This will be done via central randomisation by computer.

In Survey B participants will be randomly allocated to (a) watch a 5 minute video describing features of randomised clinical trials (b) read a transcript of the 5 minute video (c) receive no information about clinical trials, without prior knowledge of which intervention will be allocated. This will be done via central randomisation by computer. </concealment>

    <assignment>Factorial</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Survey A is a randomised 2x3x2 factorial comparison of (i) negative versus positive language, or (ii) neutral versus negative versus positive language or (iii) negative versus postiive language in 3 sections of the leaflet.
Survey B is a 3 arm randomised controlled trial. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In these anonymous surveys no prior data exist to provide robust estimates of background rates of understanding, anxiety or willingness to participate in clinical trials in the population of those accessing the Facebook pages of Miracle Babies Foundation, or others who may access the links to the study.

However, assuming the score to measure understanding of clinical trials (Primary Outcome) behaves as a continuous variable from 0-22 with a standard deviation of 3, about 50 respondents per group are needed to yield over 80% to show a difference of 3 score units between groups with two sided statistical significance of p=0.05.  Therefore at least 150 respondents will be sought for each Survey. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This anonymous online questionnaire consists of two surveys completed by participants after agreeing to participate and for use of their responses to be reported in a journal.

Survey A is a randomised study of different versions of an information leaflet describing a hypothetical clinical trial in preterm infants. The hypothesis is that different types of wording in 3 sections of the leaflet using negative, neutral or positive language will influence respondents' understanding, anxiety and willingness to participate.

Survey B is a randomised 3 arm study of the effect of providing online participants with

(i) a video versus (ii) a written transcript of the video  
versus (iii) no  information  will influence respondents' understanding, anxiety and willingness to participate.</summary>
