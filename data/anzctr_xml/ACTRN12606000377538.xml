  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Investigator initiated separate sub-study to the VYTUL study to measure novel serum biomarkers associated with increased heart disease risk to ascertain whether these biomarkers are predictive of response in this population and whether further work on targeting these biomarkers is warranted.
A second part to the substudy will focus on exploring non-physiological external factors that may contribute to ineffective risk factor modification and ultimately increased CHD risk in this population.</summary>
