  <interventions>
    <interventions>6 months treatment with oral dexamphetamine, starting at 5mg twice daily and increased if tolerated to 30mg twice daily in weekly increments of 5mg per dose. Compliance will be monitored by keeping track of the amount of medication prescribed and the expected number of tablets used per day. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight loss
Difference between weight at baseline and weight at 6 months. Weight measured using electronic scales</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 6 months of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)
The AHI is defined as the number of apnoeas or hypopnoeas occurring during 1 hour of sleep.  (ie the units are events/hour sleep)
An apnoea is defined as an event if there is a 90% reduction in airflow at baseline lasting for at least 10 sec.  A Hypopnoea is 30% reduction in airflow at baseline lasting for at least 10 sec with a 3% desaturation of oxygen.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 6 months of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in insulin requirement
Participants will be asked their daily insulin requirement at baseline and at 6 months and the change calculated</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 6 months of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in weight after ceasing treatment
Difference between weight at 6 months on ceasing treatment and weight at 12 months. Weight measured using electronic scales</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in regular medications
Participants will be asked their daily regular medications at baseline and at 6 months and the changes documented</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
