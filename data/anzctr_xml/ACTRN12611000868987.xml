  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomised to the intervention arm of the study will be asked to drink 800ml of the CHO (Nutrica PreOp [registered trademark] solution) between 1900 and 2400 hours on the night before surgery and to have no solid food from midnight. The beverage is a clear fluid with 50 kcal per 100 ml, 290 mOsm/kg, and a pH of 5.0). In accordance with the RBWH protocol, other clear fluids may be taken during the night. At 0500 hours on the morning of surgery, patients will be asked to drink a further 400mls of the solution and to record any side-effects caused by the drink. No further fluids are permitted before surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomised to the control arm of the study will follow the RBWH protocol, that is, they must not take solid food from midnight but may drink clear fluids up to 0500 hours.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The literature suggests that a carbohydrate rich
beverage before surgery positively affects postoperative recovery and improves subjective patient wellbeing.
The positive effect of carbohydrate rich oral fluid intake on perioperative urine output and fluid and electrolyte balance has also been shown. Although the metabolic and electrolyte advantages of using a carbohydrate rich
preoperative beverage have been demonstrated, there is less information about whether these advantages translate into improved postoperative clinical outcomes, such as whether preloading with a carbohydrate drink reduces hospital length of stay. The current study has been designed to establish the efficacy of preoperative
carbohydrate drink in shortening time to discharge in a prospective randomised clinical trial for gastroenterology patients undergoing elective bowel surgery.</summary>
