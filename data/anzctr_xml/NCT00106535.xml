Experimental: Tocilizumab 4 mg/kg + Methotrexate - Tocilizumab 4 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks plus MTX 10-25 mg (oral or parenteral) weekly for 52 weeks. From Week 16 participants with &lt; 20% improvement in swollen and tender joints counts were eligible for escape therapy with tocilizumab. After Week 52 participants were able to switch to open label treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 12 months in year 2 (except patients who had a &gt;70% improvement in both swollen and tender joint counts who remained on blinded treatment). Participants who completed year 2 of the study were eligible to enter an optional open-label long-term extension period (Year 3 to 5) and received Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp-Genant Score at Week 52 - Radiographs were taken of each hand and foot at Baseline and Week 52 and evaluated at a central reading service by two independent radiologists using the Genant modified method according to Sharp. Erosion Score: A total of 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=Normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. Joint Narrowing Score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). The maximum total erosion score in the hands is 100 (normalized from 98) and in the feet 42, the maximum scores for joint space narrowing in the hands is 100 (normalized from 104) and in the feet 48. The maximum modified Sharp score achievable is 290. A lower number change from Baseline indicated a better score.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in Physical Function as Measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index at Week 52 - HAQ-DI consisted of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities rated on a 4-point scale where 0=without any difficulty to 3=unable to do. The sum of scores was divided by the number of domains with a score for a total possible score of 0 (best) to 3 (worst). Functional disability was determined as a cumulative measure of HAQ-DI over 1 year by using the AUC of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score through week 52. Decreases in AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI indicate a greater average improvement in physical function over time and represent a decrease in sustained impairment. For patients with missing week 52 HAQ-DI score, the AUC of the change from baseline was standardized to 52 weeks using the latest timepoint available for calculation of the AUC. The mean was adjusted for region. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>

The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This 3 arm study will compare the safety and efficacy, with respect to a reduction in signs
      and symptoms and prevention of joint damage, of tocilizumab versus placebo, both in
      combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid
      arthritis. Patients will be randomized to receive tocilizumab 4 mg/kg IV, tocilizumab 8 mg/kg
      IV or placebo IV, every 4 weeks. All patients will also receive methotrexate, 10-25 mg/week.
      The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years and the target sample size is 500+
      individuals. After completion of the 2 year study participants could participate in the
      optional 3 year open label extension phase (year 3 to 5).</summary>
