  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) is a painless form of non-invasive brain stimulation. It is proposed to work by polarising brain tissue beneath the stimulating electrodes. Usually applied over the motor cortex, TDCS can either increase (anodal) or suppress (cathodal) excitability depending on electrode configuration. In this study, TDCS will be applied over the cerebellum. The current will be applied at 2mA for 20 minutes in three separate sessions, one week apart. The order of the sessions will be randomised. Two sessions will be cathodal, andodal and  sham session. The randomisation order and the intervention will be applied by an independent investigator. Investigators who are collecting and analysing data will remaind blinded until the end of the study period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham stimulation will be applied by turning the machine on for 30 seconds and then switching it off. This allows the participant to experience the sensory stimulation associated with the current ramping up, to maintain blinding as to the condition. No current is used for the remainder of the 20 minute intervention.
In addition to undergoing sham stimulation, each patient will be age and gender matched to a healthy control participant. They will act as controls and will undergo the same procedures as the patients.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Neurophysiological measures using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS is used to test excitability of intracortical brain circuits, that are known to be affected in primary focal dystonia. A change in these measures more toward 'normal' (as measured by comparison to a healthy group) will indicate improvement.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Handwriting and circle drawing tasks will be used to assess kinematics before and after the intervention. An improvement in these tasks is expected. The measures of interest include stroke frequency, mean pen pressure and the Coefficient of Variation of positive velocity peaks (CV). These are calculated using computer software. The Handwriting task will also be analysed using the Writers Cramp Rating Scale (WCRS) by an independent assesor.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to assess whether noninvasive stimulation of the cerebellum (base of the brain) can improve the symptoms of primary focal dystonia. Dystonia is a movement disorder that may be expressed, in part, due to dysfunction of motor networks in the brain including the cerebellum. There are few treatments currently available. If stimulating this region improves dystonia then it has potential to be used as a therapeutic intervention in the future.</summary>
