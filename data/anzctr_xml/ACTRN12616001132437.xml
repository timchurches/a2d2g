  <interventions>
    <interventions>Alterations in capnography waveforms and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels observed during procedures performed in a cardiac catheterisation laboratory with nurse-administered sedation (midazolam or midazolam plus fentanyl) will be used to measure the incidence and duration of episodes of sedation-induced respiratory depression (e.g. hypoventilation and apnoea). Capnography waveforms and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels will be measured from the start to the end of the procedures. These measurements are available to the clinicians (nurses and cardiologists) monitoring patients during procedures and as such may influence treatment decisions.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Latent class analysis (LCA) will be used to identify subgroups (classes) of patients with similar physiological responses to sedation (i.e., hypoventilation, apnoea and hypoxaemia). Alterations in capnography waveforms and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels will be used to measure the incidence and duration of episodes of hypoventilation or apnoea.  After identifying the latent class solution that best fits the data, associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and the subgroups will be evaluated using analysis of variance and chi-square analysis. The likelihood that a clinical intervention for respiratory depression was applied between the identified subgroups will be calculated using logistic regression. Ventilation status (measured as the mean transcutaneous CO2 level during OAA/S 4 or less) will be compared between those who received interventions in time with evidence of capnography waveform abnormalities that indicate alveolar hypoventilation and those who did not using ANOVA. Analysis of variance will be used to compare ventilation status (measured as the mean tcCO2 whilst OAA/S score 4 or less) between the identified subgroups. Separate hierarchical multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for identified confounders, will then be used to evaluate for differences between latent classes in: 1) post-procedural complications; and 2) disability-free survival at 30 days. Disability will be classified as an increase from baseline of &gt;8% in the WHODAS score, which has been identified as the minimum clinically important difference. A separate analysis of the overall change in WHODAS score over time (baseline and 30 days), between latent classes and (time by group) interaction effects will be examined using Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) with adjustment for identified confounders.

Sample size considerations
A sample that is too small may lead to choosing a solution from LCA where the number of classes does not adequately describe the data. A sample size of 180 is recommended for LCA models with 5 indicators, assuming power of 0.8 and a medium effect size (0.3). Therefore, we plan to recruit a sample of at least 200 participants over the duration of this study. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Respiratory depression is more likely to be detected during sedation when capnography is used. However, sedation-induced respiratory depression is commonly transient and does not always cause patient harm. Randomised controlled trials have produced conflicting results regarding whether capnography improves patient safety when used during sedation and there is considerable variation in the utilisation of capnography monitoring in clinical practice. This project seeks to optimise the implementation of this technology into clinical practice. 
AIMS
1.	To identify subgroups of patients based on their physiological responses to sedation.
2.	To characterise the identified subgroups by determining whether they are associated with particular demographic and clinical characteristics.
3.	To examine variation in clinical interventions applied to support respiratory function between subgroups. 
4.	To determine if there are associations between the subgroups and intra-procedural ventilation status as well as post-procedural outcomes.</summary>
