  <interventions>
    <interventions>A standardised protocol for the self-management intervention has been developed incorporating elements important to behaviour change (Abraham and Michie, 2008), and will be implemented in 5 sessions by trained physiotherapists. 

All sessions will be allocated 60 minutes and will be implemented in collaboration with the participant in the participants home. The first two intervention sessions will be delivered at 1-week intervals, the third after a 2-week interval, and the fourth and fifth after 4-week intervals. 

Session 1 includes education about the importance of physical activity, completion of an physical activity preferences questionnaire and generation of a list of goals, barriers and potential solutions.

Session 2 includes revision of goals, barriers and solutions, development of a weekly physical activity schedule, selection of self-monitoring strategies, and implementation of the initial physical activity session. 

Session 3 includes feedback about initial measurement outcomes, revision of goals and self-monitoring strategies, revision of the physical activity schedule, encouragement and praise.

Session 4 includes revision of goals and self-monitoring strategies, relapse prompting, encouragement and praise. 

Session 5 includes feedback about 3 month measurement outcomes, revision of physical activity, relapse prompting, encouragement and praise. 

The intervention is self-management, not physical activity prescription, so participants will decide on the type, intensity, duration and mode of physical activity individually.  These elements will  not be prescribed.  Participants will be informed that 150 minutes of physical activity a week is recommended by Australia's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines', (Department of Health, 2014).  Participants will also be guided to select a strategy for monitoring their physical activity, which again will be decided by the participant. Adherence to the self-management program will be determined by attendance at self-management sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual practice, including advice to increase physical activity and will be provided with the consumer advice booklet Make yourself strokesafe 'Trademark"; Understand and prevent stroke (National Stroke Foundation, 2009).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether self-management, and self-management support from a physiotherapist, can assist people after mild stroke to increase physical activity levels. Self-management, in this case, is when patients make the decisions about their own health and physical activity, with the assistance and support of a physiotherapist. Physical activity is important after stroke because it reduces the risks associated with recurrent stroke, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugars. Research has also shown a direct link between increased physical activity and decreased risk of stroke. Many people after mild stroke do not participate in a healthy amount of physical activity, even though they are physically capable of doing so. A physiotherapist will provide 5 sessions of support to people after mild stroke over a 3 month period, which will include education, generation of goals, barriers and solutions for being physically active, development of a weekly physical activity schedule, selection of strategies to monitor physical activity, feedback, encouragement and praise. It is expected that this will result in stroke survivors completing a healthy amount of physical activity each week, as well as improving their confidence in their ability to be physically active, and improving their health status, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugars. This group will be compared with a control group, who receive an information booklet only.</summary>
