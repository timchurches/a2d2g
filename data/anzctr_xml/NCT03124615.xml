  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Enzalutamide

Experimental: Enzalutamide - Patients will have commenced standard dose enzalutamide (160mg) daily and dose will be reduced if Grade 3 fatigue or cognition change has occurred and if toxicity is attributed to enzalutamide


Treatment: drugs: Enzalutamide
Enzalutamide is a FDA and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA, Regulatory Authority of therapeutic goods in Australia) approved treatment for castration resistant prostate cancer

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of patients who have an improvement in cognition/ fatigue symptoms - The primary endpoint is an improvement in the fatigue and cognition symptoms. Improvement will be de ned as the patient answering 'Better' in the cognition/ fatigue question at the lowest dose of enzalutamide.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to determine whether dose reduction of enzalutamide in
      patients with grade 3 fatigue and/or cognition change will lead to an improvement in symptoms
      while maintaining active drug levels.

      Patients within 3 months of starting enzalutamide will be assessed by their oncologist as
      being potentially eligible for dose reduction due to the onset of moderate to severe fatigue
      and/or cognition change, which is assessed as being due to enzalutamide</summary>
