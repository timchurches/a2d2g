  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intravenous GLP-1 at an initial dose of 1.2pmol.kg.min (10mL/h) and placebo insulin (0.9% saline) commenced as per the Royal Adelaide Hospital unit protocol. The drug will be administered for a minimum of 18 hours and a maximum of 30 hours. The infusion will span Day 0 and Day 1 of the study (minimum of 18 hours, maximum 30 hours). Due to differences in the rate of gastric emptying throughout the day, the length of infusion on Day 0 will change depending on time of randomization so that scintigraphy on Day 1 will be standardized to 9am. The GLP-1 rate is altered if the blood sugar remains above 10mmol/L in a stepped fashion (to 2.4 and 3.6 pmol/kg/min). Saline will be run as if insulin is being administered (1U/mL e.g if 2 units required, rate will be 2 ml/hr).</interventions>
    <comparator>Intravenous placebo GLP-1 (0.9% saline; run at the appropriate rate depending on the blood sugar e.g 10ml/hr) and insulin (actrapid; Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd; 1 Unit per mL) as per the Royal Adelaide Hospital unit protocol. Study drugs  are administered for a minimum of 18 hours and a maximum of 30 hours. The infusion will span Day 0 and Day 1 of the study (minimum of 18 hours, maximum 30 hours).

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Fifty sedated and mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with stress hyperglycaemia will be recruited from the Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Stress hyperglycaemia will be defined as a single random blood glucose &gt;10 mmol/L in a patient without a history of formally diagnosed type-1 or type-2 diabetes mellitus who has a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;6.5%. Patients will be between the ages of 18 and 80 years, anticipated to remain ventilated for at least 24 hours and deemed suitable by the treating intensive care physician to receive intragastric enteral nutrition.</inclusivecriteria>

We anticipate up to 20% of subjects to dropout (weaned from mechanical ventilation, commenced on comfort care etc.) and 40 completed subjects are required for adequate power of this parallel study.

The findings from the study will be analysed using parametric and/or non-parametric approaches as appropriate based on distribution of data. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.</statisticalmethods>
