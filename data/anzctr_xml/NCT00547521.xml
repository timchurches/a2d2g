Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. The score sums worst scores in each domain and divides by the number of domains answered. Baseline was Day 1 of Short Term Study. Day 113 was the last day of the Short Term Study.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With AEs of Special Interest During the LTE Study - All Treated Participants in LTE Study - An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (even if not caused by the study drug). For this study, AEs of particular importance were associated with the use of immunomodulatory agents: infections, autoimmune disorders, malignancies, and injection reaction AEs (systemic AEs occurring within 24 hours of SC injection and local injection site reactions) were recorded.</outcome>
