  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is being conducted in an effort to understand how improvements in sleep may affect factors related to pain and mood. 
There are three components to this research project, a group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy program, a Sleep Hygiene program, where participants are provided with reading material on how they can improve their sleep, and a wait list. The wait list is an important part of the study because it will provide information about how sleep patterns change over time. This study has two main hypotheses. The first is that the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy program will lead to greater improvements in sleep quality and quantity than the sleep hygiene program and the second is that improved sleep quantity and/or quality will increase individuals ability to cope with or manage pain.</summary>
