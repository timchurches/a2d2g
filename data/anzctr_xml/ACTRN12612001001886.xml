  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a study designed to measure the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Paliperidone Palmitate in an elderly cohort that meet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia.  Paliperidone palmitate is a long acting injectable antipsychotic that is administered monthly and participants will complete research procedures for a 28 week period after screening has been completed.  In this study all participants that meet inclusion criteria and satisfy the screening procedure will be included.  Dosage information and site of administration will be collected, but no dosage range restrictions will apply.  The decision to commence treatment with Paliperidone Palmitate does not form a study procedure.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The change in score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to week 28 (6 months) in an elderly cohort with schizophrenia.

The PANSS is a widely used 30 item, 7 point rating scale used in the assessment of schizophrenia symptoms combining modified items from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Psychopathology Rating Scale.  The scale provides a definition of a symptom, and once its presence is determined, the severity.  Seven items relate to positive symptoms and seven to negative symptoms with the remainder relating to general psychopathology.</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Calgary Depression Scale (CDS)

The CDS is a nine item depression screen for people with schizophrenia with a four point scale to indicate severity of the symptoms.  It is designed to be administered to persons with schizophrenia and has been shown to be independent of the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and extrapyramidal symptoms.  It has been shown to be sensitive to change in this population</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE)

The MMSE is a rapid 30 point questionnaire used to screen for dementia and cognitive impairment.  Administration can be completed within 10 minutes.  It assesses cognition over a number of domains including memory and orientation.  Its use is ubiquitous in cognitive assessment in the aged.</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale

The AIMS is a 12 item tool that measures disordered movement associated with antipsychotics.  This includes tardive dystonia and Akathisia and other motor disturbances that are related to the disease.  Scoring consists of rating the severity of the movements over a 5 point scale and is commonly administered in a population with schizophrenia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)

The BARS is a measure of motor restlessness (akathisia) and is assessed over four items and is predominantly involved in the assessment of drug related akathisia as seen as a side effect of antipsychotics.  It has an objective measure where the movement disorder is observed, and a subjective measure where the patient's awareness and distress in response to the movement is assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Simpson-Angus Scale for the Assessment of Extrapyramidal Side Effects 

The SAS is a 10 item instrument that can be completed within 10 minutes to measure drug induced Parkinsonism.  The items are measured on a 5 point scale with seven items measuring rigidity and the remaining items measuring tremor and pooling of saliva in the mouth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>WHO Quality of Life BREF (WHO-QOL-BREF)

The WHO-QOL-BREF is a 26 item questionnaire of quality of life that was developed to measure QOL in the context of an individual's culture and value systems as well as their personal values and concerns.  The scale assesses across physical and mental health social situations and the environment.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paliperidone palmitate (Invega Sustenna) is a recently approved long acting injectable antipsychotic medication to treat schizophrenia that is only required to be administered monthly, unlike others which require daily or fortnightly administration.  It is useful in people where previous drugs have been ineffective, or where taking oral medications has been a problem as doses are more closely monitored and clinical staff will know quickly when doses are missed.  

For Invega Sustenna to be approved for use in adults by the government, a number of studies were conducted in adults aged 18-65 that showed it was effective, and that its benefits outweighed any side effects.  It is assumed that this information will be applicable to an elderly population with schizophrenia, but this has not been directly studied.  In this study we will explore how effective the medication is as well as its safety and how well tolerated Invega Sustenna is in an elderly population with schizophrenia where a clinical decision has been made to commence treatment using the drug.  

The study will add a number of measures to standard care to measure whether the symptoms of schizophrenia are changed and also whether there are any significant side effects.  After ensuring that all participants meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we will conduct frequent assessments of patients over a 6 month period.  This information will be used to treat any side effects as soon as they occur and to build up a profile of the side effects that could be expected to be seen in the elderly and add to the knowledge about the side effects of this medication in an elderly population.  

The results will be published in a medical journal and provided to the drug company so that they can update their product information so that any side effects can be better dealt with.</summary>
