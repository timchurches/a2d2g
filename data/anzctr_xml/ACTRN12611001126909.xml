  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a two-day workshop, held at the study hospital over a weekend, which occurs once per month for a period of 10 months.  Study particpants and their birth partners will attend 1 weekend course during the period of 24-34 weeks of gestation. The workshop will introduce 6 different complementary medicine techniques for labour and birth: Education - the hormones of labour, and the fear-tension-pain cycle; breathing techniques; guided visualisation; acupressure; movement/yoga techniques; facilitation of partner support and its current evidence. The workshop will introduce 3 concepts each day of the weekend, which will run for for 6 hours each day. The intervention will be conducted by the researcher, Kate Levett, who is a qualified teacher (BEd), Researcher (MPH), Childbirth Educator (She Births), Acupuncturist (Adv.Dip.App.Sci.Acup, and Grad.Cert.Jap.Acup.).
The intervention group will also be advised and encouraged to attend the hospital based antenatal education classes (standard care), which is run by Midwifery Educators at each of the study hospitals.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care, which is the hospital based antenatal education classes.  These classes are run by Midwifery Educators employed by the hospital to run these classes.  The hospital schedules these classes regularly with options for weekend courses, or weeknight courses depending on the preference of the participants.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>20% reduction in rate of epidural use.  This outcome will be collected from the Maternity Unit's discharge summary sheet, which is included in the individual medical records of the participants. The use of epidural anaesthesia will be indicated by its selection in a computer generator form which is completed by midwives at the time of discharge of the patient from hospital following the birth of their baby.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At birth of child, less than 20 weeks following randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Medical interventions in labour. These will ascertained from the Maternity Unit's Discharge Summary Sheet, which is included in the individual medical records of the participants. The notation of medical intervention will be indicated by its selection in a computer generator form which is completed by midwives at the time of discharge of the patient from hospital following the birth of their baby.
This will include: induction of labour; failed induction of labour; augmentation of labour; instrumental delivery; episiotomy; caesarean section (CS); emergency or planned CS;  length of labour; gestational age at delivery; length of stay in hospital.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At birth of child, less than 20 weeks following randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Birth satisfaction as measured by the Labour Agentry Scale (Hodnett, 1987)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre Intervention, post-intervention and post-labour/birth.  All will occur less than 20 weeks following randomisation.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have chosen two established antenatal education programmes (SheBirths and 'Acubirth'), which together introduce 6 different CM techniques for the management of labour and birth.  We plan to introduce the programme via 10 two-day workshop to 96 women and their birth partners over a period of 12 months. We will adapt the programme for implementation at 2 large teaching hospitals in NSW.  Participants and their birth partners will be recruited from Antenatal clinics from 24 weeks of gestation and randomly allocated to attend the CM birth education program plus standard care or to standard care alone.  The CM birth education programme is an intervention which introduces techniques of: Physiology of birth, the Fear-Pain-Tension cycle; Movement and positions for birth; Acupressure techniques; Guided visualisation; Breathing techniques.
Outcomes: The primary outcome to be evaluated is the rate of epidural use.  Secondary outcomes to be evaluated include: pharmacological pain relief, instrumental delivery; caesarean section; length of labour; Apgar scores; admission to NICU/SCN; gestational age at delivery; satisfaction/control scores and post-natal depression scores.</summary>
