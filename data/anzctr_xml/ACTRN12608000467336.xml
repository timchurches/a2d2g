  <interventions>
    <interventions>Men who drink&gt;30g alcohol/day and &lt;110g alcohol/day will participate in a randomised 3 period crossover design. The study will compare drinking 375ml of red wine, or the same volume of de-alcoholised red wine or water over a 30 min period with food. The 3 beverages will be administered in random order in a crossover design on 3 separate days. The 3 treatment days will be 2 weeks apart. During the 2 week intervals between treatment days volunteers will maintain their normal dietary and alcohol intake.  Prior to each treatment day volunteers will abstain from drinking alcohol for 48 hrs, and will fast for 12hrs to before being studied. On each of the 3 treatment days, volunteers will have blood pressure (BP) monitored for 24hr. On each treatment day, cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid will be measured in urine and in plasma and cell membranes before and after 2hrs, 4hr and 24hr of drinking the beverage .</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol consumption is known to affect blood pressure regulation but the mechanism  by which it does this is not known  This project examines the role of certain fatty acid metabolites called cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid (CYP450AA-M) acutely after drinking red wine de-alcohlised red wine or water.  These fatty acid metabolites act on blood vessels  causing them to constrict or dilate. In doing this they affect blood pressure regulation. The results of this study will determine how important CYP450AA-M are in regulating blood pressure acutely after consuming alcohol. We will study  CYP450AA-M in cells as in plasma and urine in relation to blood pressure levels over 24hours.This project will help scientists decide how important these metabolites are for blood presssure regulation. If these metabolites are found to be important then it should be possible to alter their levels either by diet or drug treatment.</summary>
