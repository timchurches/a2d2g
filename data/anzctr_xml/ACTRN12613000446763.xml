  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1 - Customised foot orthotics + new neutral athletic footwear - medical devices used to relieve the stresses on pathologiccal tissues. These devices will be placed in new neutral athletic footwear and worn in both feet. Duration of the intervention period is 12 weeks. To be worn every day for as much as possible. Compliance and amount worn will be monitored as average time worn per day in an online pain diary to be completed weekly.
Arm 2 - New neutral athletic footwear - athletic running shoe with no added medial support or midsole dual density. Duration of the intervention period is 12 weeks. Shoes to be worn every day as much as possible.
Compliance and amount worn will be monitored as average time worn per day in an online pain diary to be completed weekly.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A mixed model will be used to describe the differences between conditions. The required sample was determined based on previous literature. The minimal important difference of foot orthotics in decreasing first-pain associated with plantar fasciopathy has been reported as 19 mm on a 100 mm VAS (effect size (d) = 0.8) (Landorf, Radford &amp; Hudson 2010). These data were used to conduct a sample size calculation, indicating a total sample required of 51 participants (17 in each group) with 80% power and alpha set at 0.05. This is a straight mixed model with time and group treated as factors. Subjects are designated as random effects. As intention to treat (ITT) analysis will be used, there is no need to account for participant dropout.</statisticalmethods>
