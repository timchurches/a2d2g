  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Morning -Pre-dose Trough FEV1 Over 52 Weeks - Change From Baseline in Morning Pre-Dose Trough FEV1 Over 52 Weeks as a Model-Based Average (ITT Population). FEV1 was assessed at multiple time points post-baseline, and a model-based average of all visits starting from Week 2 through week 52 inclusive was calculated. The change values reported in the table represent the change between the baseline and the average FEV1 post-baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Weeks 2 to 52</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-Administered Computerized (SAC) TDI Focal Score Over 52 Weeks - SAC TDI focal score over 52 Weeks as a Model-Based Average (ITT Population) The TDI is an instrument which measures the changes in the participant's dyspnea from Baseline. The scores in the TDI evaluate ratings for 3 different categories (functional impairment, magnitude of task in exertional capacity, and magnitude of effort). TDI scores ranged from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement); total score = -9 to 9.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Weeks 4 to 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peak Change From Baseline in FEV1 Within 2 Hrs Post-dosing - Peak change from Baseline FEV1 Over 52 Weeks is a Model-Based Average (ITT Population). Peak FEV1 was assessed at multiple visits post-baseline, and a model-based average of all visits starting from Week 2 through week 52 inclusive was calculated. The change values reported in the table represent the change between the baseline and the average Peak FEV1 post-baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Weeks 2 to 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in SGRQ Total Score - The SGRQ is a disease-specific questionnaire, self-completed by participants, used to evaluate the effect of GFF MDI, FF MDI and GP MDI on health-related quality of life as compared to placebo in subjects with COPD. The scores range from 0 (best possible health status) to 100 (worst possible health status). The SGRQ contains 76 items grouped into three domains (symptoms, activity and impacts). Change from Baseline in total score of -4 units or lower is considered as clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life. SGRQ Total Score was assessed at multiple visits post-baseline, and a model-based average of all visits starting from Week 12 through week 52 inclusive was calculated. The change values reported in the table represent the change between the baseline and the average SGRQ Total Score post-baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Weeks 12 to 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Rescue Ventolin Use - Subjects recorded in their diary the number of puffs of rescue Ventolin HFA taken on each study day. The subject's average daily number of puffs of rescue Ventolin HFA was calculated over the entire 52-week treatment period. Missing values were ignored in both the numerator and denominator. Diary data recorded during the last 7 days of the 10-14 day screening period were used to calculate the baseline average. Change in rescue Ventolin HFA use was calculated by subtracting the baseline average from the 52-week average.</outcome>

    <summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, chronic dosing,
      active-controlled, 28-week safety extension study of the two pivotal 24-week safety and
      efficacy studies (Studies PT003006 and PT003007). This study is designed to assess the
      long-term safety and tolerability of Glycopyrrolate (GP) and Formoterol Fumarate (FF)
      combination (GFF) metered dose inhaler (MDI), GP MDI, and FF MDI in subjects with moderate to
      very severe COPD over a total observation period of 52 weeks. Open-label Spiriva is included
      as an active control. To be eligible for this study, a subject must complete participation in
      Study PT003006 (NCT01854645) or Study PT003007 (NCT01854658).</summary>
