    <concealment>The care managers selected residents who appeared to fit the research selection criteria and then sent informed consent information to their next of kin. If there was no response, a second posting of information was sent as a reminder three weeks later.  

A person not involved with data collection conducted the randomization process using a random number table (restricted randomization) in the care residential facility to allocate participants into three groups.</concealment>
