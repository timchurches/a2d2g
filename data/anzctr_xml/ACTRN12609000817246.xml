  <interventions>
    <interventions>The go for your Life diabetes prevention program, The Healthy Living Course,  comprises a series of learning sessions conducted in groups of six to ten people with pre-diabetes. The aims of the program are to promote healthy lifestyle change and reduce risk of progression to Type 2 diabetes. Participants undertake one pre-course individual session, in which personal medical history, eating and exercise patterns are discussed and the course explained. Then follow six sessions spread across six months. The sessions are psycho-educational, providing information on diet, exercise, motivation, goal setting and stress, plus support for participants to adopt healthier lifestyle choices.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in dietary intake assessed via changes from pretest to post intervention/wait in scores on a questionnaire: The Food Choices Questionnaire (FCQ); items developed from Dietary Guidelines for Australian Adults (National Health and Medical Council (NHMRC), 2003).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and completion of the Healthy Living Course (intervetnion) or waiting period (control group). t=6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase in physical activity  assessed via changes from pretest to post intervention/wait in scores on a questionnaire: adapted form of the International Activity Scale (Craig et al., 2003).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and on completion of the Healthy Living Course (intervetnion) or waiting period (control group). t=6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase in diabetes knowledge  assessed via changes from pretest to post intervention/wait in scores on a questionnaire:the Diabetes Knowledge Scale (13 items developed for current trial)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and on completion of the Healthy Living Course (intervetnion) or waiting period (control group). t=6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in weight  assessed via changes from pretest to post intervention/wait in weight in kgm as measured by participants' general practitioners (GPs)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and on completion of the Healthy Living Course (intervetnion) or waiting period (control group). t=6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in metabolic indicators (glucose metabolism, blood pressure triglyceride &amp; cholesterol levels)  assessed via changes from pretest to post intervention/wait in blood assays and blood pressure measures as reported by general practitioners (on basis of blood tests).Pre-diabetes was diagnosed via the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT); criteria included an absence of diabetes and (a) impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 6.1 and 7.0 mmol/l,  or (b)  impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2 hour plasma glucose (2hrPG) between 7.8 and 11.0mmol/l, or (c) both IFG and IGT (World Health Organisation, 1985).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and within 3 months of competing the Healthy Living Course (intervention) or waiting period (control)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in cognitive variables (motivation and self-efficacy) assessed via changes from pretest to post intervention/wait in scores on questionnaires.
The motivation to change measure was based on Prochaska, DiClemente and Norcross? (1992) trans-theoretical model of behaviour. A one item forced-choice question with five response options assessed whether participants were at the 1) pre-contemplation 2), contemplation 3), preparation 4), action or 5) maintenance stage in relation to maintaining appropriate weight, eating healthy food and engaging in physical exercise.
Self efficacy was assessed using items from the Stanford University Patient Education Research Centre Self efficacy for Diabetes Scale (http://patienteducation.stanford.edu/research/sediabetes.pdf) and the Diabetes Empowerment Scale (Anderson, Funnell, Fitzgerald &amp; Marrero, 2000), adapted for use with a pre-diabetic population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and on completion of the Healthy Living Course (intervention) or waiting period (control). t= 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in mood (depression, anxiety and positive affect) were assessed via changes from pretest to post intervention/wait questionnaires.
The 10-item Positive Affect (PA) sub-scale of the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale - PANAS (Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988) assessed positive mood. 
Depression and anxiety were assessed using the shortened version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and on completion of the Healthy Living Course (intervention) or waiting period (control). t= 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <concealment>Once participants volunteered for the study they were randomly allocated to either the Intervention (N= 208) or the Control group (wait group N= 99) in a ratio of approximately 2:1.  Primary health workers from the three recruitment catchment areas were provided with a tear off pad with sheets that were labelled ‘now’ (for intervention) or ‘later’ (for wait-control) in a 2:1 ratio.  As each new participant was recruited they were allocated to their group according to the instruction on the next sheet of the tear off pad. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>'Now' and 'Later' were generated in a random sequence in a ratio of 2:1 via throws of a dice - 1, 2, 3 and 4 faces generated 'yes'; 5 and 6 faces generated 'no'.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a randomised controlled trial (with a wait- list control group) of the six month, group-based go for your Life diabetes prevention program, the Healthy Living Course.  Outcome variables included the degree to which participation in the program led to changes in modifiable risk factors including behaviour (physical exercise, dietary intake), diabetes knowledge, body weight, glucose metabolism (measured using an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism, cognitive variables (self efficacy, motivation),  and mood (depression, anxiety, and positive affect). Volunteers (N=307) with pre-diabetes were assigned to an intervention or wait control group in the ratio of approximately 2:1. Biochemical, anthropometric, behavioural, cognitive and mood variables were tested at baseline and then again either at the end of the intervention or the wait period.</summary>
