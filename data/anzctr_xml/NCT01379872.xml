  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) has been commissioned by the Department of
      Health and Ageing to undertake a project to assess new Radiation Oncology Technology and
      Treatments. This project is being undertaken in response to a recognised need for the
      Medicare Benefits Schedule to support appropriate new radiation oncology technologies and
      treatments as they become available, to ensure optimal patient care.

      The first phase of the project required TROG to develop a Generic Research Framework (the
      Framework) capable of collecting and generating information to substantiate the safety,
      clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of new technologies and treatments.

      The second (and current) phase of the project requires that the Framework be piloted to
      assess the safety, clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of Intensity Modulated Radiation
      Therapy (IMRT) and Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) in four tumour site specific
      regions:

      A. Post Prostatectomy(IMRT) B. Anal Cancer (IMRT) C. Nasopharynx (IMRT) D. Intermediate Risk
      Prostate Cancer (IGRT)

      The aims of the site specific components of the ANROTAT protocol are as follows:

      Protocol A. Develop an approach for applying the Framework to evaluate the safety, clinical
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IMRT compared to 3DCRT in patients with prostate cancer
      (PP).

      Protocol B. Develop an approach for applying the Framework to evaluate the safety, clinical
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IMRT compared to 3DCRT in AC.

      Protocol C. Develop an approach for applying the Framework to evaluate the safety, clinical
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IMRT compared to 3DCRT in NPC.

      Protocol D. Develop an approach for applying the Framework to evaluate the safety, clinical
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IGRT compared to non-IGRT in patients with intermediate
      risk prostate cancer.</summary>
