  <interventions>
    <interventions>Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) administered by an air pump and mask every night during sleep over a 3 month period. Nocturnal CPAP will be commenced immediately sleep apnoea is diagnosed. Patients will also be given lifestyle advice including on weight loss and sleeping position prior to CPAP being started at a one-on-one physician appointment with further follow-up (at least fortnightly) with sleep clinic nursing staff.</interventions>
    <comparator>Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) given 3 months after sleep apnoea is diagnosed and lifestyle interventions have been recommended (as per Description of intervention above). The only difference between the intervention and control will be the timing of commencement of CPAP (immediate vs 3 months)</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep apnoea (a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep) is associated with high blood pressure, high blood glucose and overweight in the general population, and a consequent increase in cardiovascular disease and death as a result. There are, however, few data relating to these associations in the special case of diabetes. It is also likely the treating sleep apnoea with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) will be especially beneficial to diabetic patients. In a sample of diabetic patients with confirmed sleep apnoea, we will see whether CPAP therapy improves blood glucose levels, blood pressure and other risk factors for vascular disease, as well as looking at its effects on quality of life and sexual function. The results should provide evidence of the value of screening for, and treatment of, sleep apnoea in people with diabetes.</summary>
