  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy program is an intervention program designed specifically to reduce depression, anxiety, stress and distress associated with chronic illnesses (Segal, Williams, &amp; Teesdale, 2002). During the program participants discover how thinking patterns promote depression and anxiety where a main aim of the program is to teach participants to stay in touch with the present moment and to avoid ruminating about past or worrying about future events. 
	The MBCT program for the current study will be adapted from the work of Segal, Williams and Teesdale (2002) and tailored for group delivery for people with Parkinson's Disease (Segal, Williams, &amp; Teesdale, 2002). The manualised intervention program comprises 8 weekly sessions where each session runs for 120 minutes. The program will target skills such as experiential learning, concentration, bringing awareness of thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations, being in the moment, decentering, acceptance and being in a state of non-doing. Weekly handouts will be provided and a set of meditation CDs that contain material covered in the weekly session for personal practice at home.

    <comparator>Waitlist Control
Waiting list control group
	Upon completion of the intervention, the participants in the waitlist group will be offered the same intervention program. Throughout the study however, they will not receive any therapeutic assistance from the therapists assisting in the study.  In order to ensure they remain part of the study, and to check that waiting for treatment is not detrimental, these participants will receive a monthly phone call or email. If participants are demonstrating the need for immediate intervention for example reporting the risk of suicide, then they will be withdrawn from the study and referred to appropriate treatment providers.

    <designfeatures>The research design for this study is a randomised experimental design (waitlist control) with three repeated measures (pre-intervention, post-intervention and 3 month follow-up). The research design consists of one within-subject factor: Time (Pretest, posttest, 3-month follow-up) and one between-subjects factor: Group (Intervention, waitlist control). It belongs to a category of designs traditionally referred to as pretest-posttest control group designs with random allocation to groups. The participants will be randomly assigned to either experimental group (MBCT) or to the waitlist control group (CG). Once the data has been collected for the intervention group, the control group will be offered the MBCT treatment program. Outcome variables are depression, anxiety, mindfulness and quality of life. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A priori power analysis showed that a total of 40 participants (20 control, 20 intervention) would give 80% power to detect a large-sized difference (effect size = 0.8) with a = .05. 

Data will be screened for outliers, missing data and checked for normality, linearity, homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices multicollinearity. Univariate outliers will be examined via box plots. If univariate outliers are identified their influence can be reduced by rescoring the participant data one standard deviation above the next most extreme score. If there is any missing data this will be dealt with accordingly where Expectation-Maximisation is recommended (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001). Assumptions of Multilevel Modeling (MLM) are that the dependent variables are normally distributed, that the growth curve parameters are normally distributed where all participants show the same relationship overtime and observed changes are related to time and the growth curve and errors are independent and normally distributed (Rasbash, Steele, Browne, &amp; Prosser, 2004).
	It is predicted that a significant Time (pretest, posttest, and follow-up) by Group (Intervention and Waiting List) interaction exists across the clinical outcomes (symptoms of anxiety and depression, QOL and mindfulness). To explore whether the each outcome differs as a function of group across time, a multi-level mixed effects linear regression (MLM) will be conducted. By using MLM, the three time point measurements (pretest, posttest, and follow-up) can be identified as nested within individuals, where individuals are treated as a level 2 variable. The lower level analysis will then look at the effect of time on the dependent variable (symptoms of anxiety, depression, QOL, and mindfulness). In the present study, there are two fixed factors (Group, Time) and one random factor (Participants) with Time nested within participants. 
	Amongst particular therapy groups participants might interact in a certain way which could influence their scores on outcome variables, hence violating the assumption of independence. If this assumption has been violated within groups then this can be controlled for through a sandwich estimator for the standard errors (Rabe-Hesketh &amp; Skrondal, 2005).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness for anxiety and depression in a sample of people with Parkinson's disease. The aim is to establish whether mindfulness is successful in reducing the impact of the depressive and anxiety symptoms while improving quality of life. It is expected that, compared to a wait-list control group, mindfulness participants will demonstrate significant improvements in depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and quality of life at post-intervention and at 3 month follow-up.</summary>
