             inclusion.

          8. Prior week average Low Back Pain NRS of =6.0 and =9.0 on a 11 point NRS scale (0-10)

          2. Back Pain characteristics:

               1. Any surgical correction procedure for scoliosis at any time, or a current
                  clinical diagnosis of scoliosis.

               2. Lumbar spine stenosis, as defined by an anterior-posterior diameter of the spinal

               5. Back pain due to inflammation or damage to the spinal cord or adjacent structures
                  (e.g. arachnoiditis or syringomyelia)

          3. Any current indication for back surgery according to local institutional guidelines,
             or has indication for back surgery but cannot undergo surgery for other reasons.
