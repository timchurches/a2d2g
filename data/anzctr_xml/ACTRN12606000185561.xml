  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomised to receive  very early rehabilitation within 24 hours of the onset of stroke and for up to 14 days.  The rehabilitation consists of protocol specified rehabilitation sessions of short duration, related to the patients normal activities of daily living.  The rehabilitation is implemented by physiotherapists and nurses.  Blinded assesssment of outcome is performed at 3 and 12 months.</interventions>

    <concealment>Allocation is concealed via a central web based randomisation system.  Randomisation occurs once the patient provides consent. The AVERT physiotherapist and Nurse are aware of the allocation. The patient, other staff and specifically the assessor remain blinded to the allocation. All online information is secured by use of password site entry, and data encryption procedures.</concealment>
    <sequence>Permutated blocks of various lengths will be used to ensure allocation concealment.  A secure remote web based computer generated randomisation will be used, statified according to stroke severity.  (NIHSS 1-7 Mild), (NIHSS 8 - 16 Moderate), (NIHSS greater than 16 Severe).</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The study is powered to detect an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of death or a poor outcome of 7.1% or greater, based on the following rationale: (i) consensus among investigators and international advisors that an ARR of this magnitude would represent a clinically meaningful effect size (although there are no formal cost-effectiveness data to support this view); and (ii)  3 month figures from an Australian hospital (40.9%) and a hospital that has practiced early mobilisation over many years (31.8%) showing less death and institutionalisation, therefore greater independent survival. Clinicians at this centre have estimated that mobilisation accounts for 78% of this 9.1% benefit. This gives a final absolute difference of 7.1%.  A sample of 2104 patients (1052 per arm) will provide 80% power to detect a significant intervention effect (2 sided, p = 0.05) with adjustments for 5% dropping- in and a 10% dropping-out.
The primary efficacy hypothesis is tested using the binary logistic regression model with a treatment group as an independent variable and the 3 months mRS outcome (dichotomized into mRS 0-2 as favourable outcome and mRS 3-6 as poor outcome) as the dependent variable, including baseline NIHSS and age as treatment covariates for adjustment purposes. The treatment effect will be presented as odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% CI. This analysis will allow comparison with published outcomes of other acute stroke trials. 
Statisitical analysis plan for this trial will be published prior to the analysis of data.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial (AVERT)
Randomised controlled trial of very early mobilisation (intervention) versus standard care (control) with blinded assessment of outcome and intention to treat anlaysis.  A comprehensive cost eccectiveness sub study is included.  It is hypothesised that early mobilisation of patients in addition to standard care alone, will reduce death and disability at 3 months, reduce the number and severity of stroke complications experienced by patients, resullt in a better quality of life and is cost effective.</summary>
