    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria:

          -  Recent immobilization = 3 days

          -  Level 1 mobility patients who are = 40 years of age with acute medical illness or
             acute exacerbation of chronic medical illness

          -  Level 2 mobility patients who

               -  are &gt;75 yrs of age

               -  are = 40 years of age and have a history of VTE (deep venous thrombosis or
                  pulmonary embolism)

               -  are = 40 years of age and have a baseline diagnosis of cancer (active cancer or
                  history of cancer)

        Anticipated decreased level of mobility of 5 ± 2 days with a level of activity 1 and 2 at
        the time of study entry and likely to continue at a lower than pre-morbid activity level
        after the initial 5 ± 2 day period. PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED IN ORDER TO BE
        INCLUDED IN THE STUDY.(Definition of decreased level of mobility: _Level 1:bed rest or
        sedentary patients _Level 2:level 1 with bathroom privileges)

          -  Presence of at least one of the following medical conditions:

               -  Heart Failure, NYHA class III and IV

          -  Patients with a persistent renal failure. The patient's creatinine level must be less

    <summary>Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of extended VTE prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40mg sc qd
           for 28 ± 4 days, compared to placebo, both following 10 ± 4 days of initial treatment
           with enoxaparin 40mg sc qd

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the reduction in mortality rate at the end of the double-blind treatment
           period, at 3 (90 ± 10 days) and at 6 (180 ± 10 days) months from the time of entry to
           the study, in patients on extended prophylaxis

        -  To assess the incidence of VTE at 3 months (90 ± 10 days) from the time of randomization
           to the study

        -  To evaluate the safety of extended enoxaparin VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical
           patients with prolonged immobilization. Safety evaluation includes:

             -  Major and minor hemorrhage

             -  Heparin induced thrombocytopenia

             -  Serious adverse events

        -  To assess differences in levels of health-care utilization and cost between patients
           receiving extended VTE prophylaxis versus those receiving placebo.</summary>
