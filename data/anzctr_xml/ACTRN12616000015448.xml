  <interventions>
    <interventions>An ultrasound of the neck will be performed by the trial Radiologists. This will involve a small probe being placed on the skin of the front of the neck. It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete the examination.All measurements will be performed by the examining Radiologist and repeated by a second to assess reproducibility of this method.

This examination will be performed as an additional study to the standard diagnostic laryngobronchoscopy in the 'study subjects'. It will be an additional examination undergoing imaging for other reasons in our 'normal subjects'.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients presenting to the clinic with noisy breathing will undergo standard Otorhinolaryngology (ORL) surgical assessment using diagnostic laryngobronchoscopy under sedation / general anaesthetic. This involes the ORL surgeon placing an endoscope within the airway to directly visualise the structures and assess for pathology. Only the 'study subjects' will undergo this assessment. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether ultrasound can detect subglottic and tracheal abnormalities. The findings from both the standard ORL assessment and the ultrasound will be reviewed by the surgeon and the radiologists to assess whether there is corellation between the two examinations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>When 100 'normal subjects' and 20 'study subjects' have undergone ultrasound assessment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reproducibility of standard measurements.
Images will be saved from the ultrasound assessment of 'normal subjects' and the standard measurements will be performed by at least two radiologists blinded to the results of previous attempts to assess whether this test is reproducible. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Within one week of the 'normal subjects' ultrasound examination.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the utility of ultrasound scanning in assessing paediatric patients presenting with symptoms of airway pathology at the level of the subglottis or trachea. Age matched patients who have no airway symptoms but are presenting for ultrasound imaging for other reasons will be the control subjects for this study. We hypothesise that ultrasound will be a good alternative tool for assessment obviating the need for more invasive examinations currently available.
This pilot study will prospectively acquire data over a 12 month period. We anticipate that 100 normal subjects and 20 study subjects will be recruited over this period.
