    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate if pharmacologically safe dose intravenous
      glutamine dipeptide supplementation to multiple trauma patients receiving enteral nutrition
      is associated with improved clinical outcomes in terms of decreased organ dysfunction,
      infectious complications, and other secondary outcomes</summary>
