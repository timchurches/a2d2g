  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend a physiotherapy program in small groups of 3 participants, once weekly for a 1.5 hour session for an 8 week intervention period. Participants will also perform a structured home practice session. The intervention will focus on individualized balance training, including practice of anticipatory and reactive dynamic balance strategies, dynamic gait training and strengthening exercises. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will also attend in small groups of 3 participants, once weekly for a 1. 5 hour session for an 8 week intervention period, with equivalent therapist contact to the intervention group. Activities will incorporate activities such as  guided relaxation, meditation, seated yoga and discussion groups structured to each groups preferred topics of interest. No activities relating to walking or standing balance will be included. </comparator>

  <outcomes>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Balance- as measured by the BESTest balance measure</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, after 8 week intervention and at 4 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and feasibility. Safety will be assessed during the intervention phase in three ways; (i) structured weekly
screening by the intervention therapists for any new muscle soreness lasting longer than 48 hours related to therapy; (ii) recording of adverse events that may occur during therapy; and (iii) fall rate during the intervention phase, as measured with  falls calendars.
Retention and adherence will be assessed by the: (i) the proportion of participants who attend post-intervention assessments, and (ii) participant attendance at the intervention/control sessions. Reasons for not attending sessions will be recorded.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Some adults with cerebral palsy have more difficulty with walking as they get older. Impaired balance and reduced balance confidence have been suggested to be  contributing factors to this decline.  This project will conduct a small randomised trial to examine the effect of a physiotherapy program of balance training on the walking self-confidence and balance of adults with cerebral palsy, compared to a different program of a variety of meditation, relaxation and lifestyle activities.</summary>
