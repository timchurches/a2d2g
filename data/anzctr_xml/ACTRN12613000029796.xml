  <interventions>
    <interventions>Seated in wheelchair, an intervention group undertook three 40-minute sessions each week of Simplified Tai Chi Exercise Program (STEP) for a period of 26 weeks. The Tai Chi exercise program was conducted by a qualified instructor from Taiwan's Tai Chi Chuan Association. The group of 30 participants randomized into the intervention group was further split into two smaller group of 15 participants due to space constraints and to ensure a quality learning experience.</interventions>

    <sequence>Participants were randomly assigned into one of two parallel groups in a 1:1 ratio. A consultant statistician provided a computer-generated randomization list using the Excel Randomization Function, using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The list generated consisted of the participant numbers (1–60) and a number indicating which group that participant had been randomly allocated to: “0” indicated the control group; “1” indicated the intervention group.
