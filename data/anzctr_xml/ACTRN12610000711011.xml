    <interventions>Radiation Therapy
A radical dose of radiotherapy (RT) to be delivered to the entire bladder volume: 64Gy in 32 fractions over 6 weeks and 2 days.
Conventional plan is used to deliver treatment for fractions 1-7 using a standard planning approach and a Clinical Target Volume (CTV) to Planning Target Volume (PTV) margin of 1.5cm.
Adaptive plan is used to deliver treatment for fractions 8-32 using the same standard techniques as for fractions 1-7 but using one of the three specific CTV's, namely: small, average and large. In all these cases the CTV to PTV margin is 0.7cm. Image guidence using a treatment unit based verification Computed Tomography (CT) unit (cone beam CT or CT on rails) based on soft tissue delinieation is used to position the traetment fields and select the plan to best cover the CTV.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compliance with online adaptive radiation therapy process. A patient is considered to be compliant if that patient completes treatment without experiencing a major protocol deviation.
A major protocol deviation will be considered to have occurred for any patient for whom the following 3 conditions applies: 
1. All 3 adaptive treatment plans (small, average, and large) were found to be inadequate for more than 10% of treatment fractions, necessitating use of the conventional plan for those treatment fractions. Since the adaptive treatment plans must be available for fractions 10-32 inclusive, this means that using the conventional plan for three or more of these fractions would constitute a Major
Protocol Deviation.
2. Three adaptive plans cannot be created and quality assured in time for the patients 10th fraction.
3. Post treatment imaging shows that the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) has expanded beyond the Planning Target Volume (PTV) chosen in any one of the treatment fractions where post treatment imaging is conducted (namely fractions 10,15,20,25,30).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be monitored on a daily basis, from the start date of radiotherapy to the last day of radiotherapy treatment (approximately 6 weeks and 2 days)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to local bladder failure. Documented by biopsy within the bladder or by cystoscopic assessment (Cystoscopy performed at baseline, every 3 months following radiotherapy for 12 months, then every six months following radiotherapy until trial ends)</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of enrolment until a local failure or regional nodal recurrence. (Cystoscopy performed at baseline, every 3 months following radiotherapy for 12 months, then every six months following radiotherapy until trial ends)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pattern of failure. Assessed clinically and with imaging where appropriate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of enrolment until a local failure or regional nodal recurrence. Patients will be assessed at Baseline, weekly during radiotherapy (where applicable), 1 month following radiotherapy, 3 months following radiotherapy, then every three months until 12 months following radiotherapy reached; at 12 months following radiotherapy then every three months until 2 year follow up is completed</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute Toxicity using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTC AE) version 4.0</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed weekly during radiotherapy, then at 1 month and 3 months following radiotherapy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life (QoL) measured using appropriate QoL questionnaires. Assessment of Quality of life - 8 Dimensional (AQoL-8D), European Organisation for research and treatment of cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30), European Organisation for research and treatment of cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Bladder Module (EORTC QLQ BLM30) and EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D).</outcome>
      <timepoint>within 2 weeks prior to commencement of treatment, during the last week of traetment, 1 and 18 Months after the completion of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Late Normal Tissue effects using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTC AE) version 4.0</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured between 3 months and 3 years after the completion of radiation treatment. Patients will be assesed at 3 months following radiation, then every 3 months until 2 years post radiation treatment, then 6 monthly for 12 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival. Assessed clinically and with imaging where appropriate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start date of treatment until death due to any cause. Patients will be assessed at Baseline, weekly during radiotherapy (where applicable), 1 month following radiotherapy, 3 months following radiotherapy, then every three months until 12 months following radiotherapy reached; at 12 months following radiotherapy then every three months until 2 year follow up is completed</timepoint>
