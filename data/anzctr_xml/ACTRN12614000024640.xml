  <interventions>
    <interventions>prospective randomized trial that included 100 couples with unexplained infertility agreed to continue with intrauterine inssemination (IUI )
All participants were extensively counseled about the risks and benefits of each type of treatment and an informed consent was obtained. 50  Patients  received a daily dose of letrozole (Femara; Novartis) tablets orally  beginning on day 3 of menstrual cycle with 2.5 mg (1 tab) which is then increased in a step up fashion to 5 mg (2 tabs), 7.5 mg (3 tabs) and finally 10 mg (4 tabs) on days 4, 5 and 6 of the menstrual cycle (Total duration of treatment will be four days starting from third day of mensis).
all participants of this group will be followed up by transvaginal ultrasonography starting from day 7 menstrual cycle every 3 days until one dominant follicle reaches a size of 17 mm hence HCG will be given intramuscular in a dose of 10000 iu  followed by IUI 36 hours later .
</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in control group will  receive human menopausal gonadotropins preparation (HMG ) as (fostimon / merional; IBSA) 

HMG injection will be given daily in a dose of 75 iu (1 ampoule) from day 3 of the  menstrual cycle that will be tailored according to the response assessed  by vaginal ultrasoound every three days until one dominant follicle reach a size of 17 mm ,hence HCG will be given intramuscular in a dose of 10000 iu  followed by IUI 36 hours later .

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>  ongoing pregnancy rate through detection of pulsating interuterine gestational sac by vaginal ultrasound at 6-8 weeks of gestation </outcome>
      <timepoint>defined as detection of viable  gestational sac at 6 to 8 weeks gestation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>number of mature follicles that are defined as a follicle measurement more than 17 mm by vaginal ultrasound   </outcome>
      <timepoint>at the day of human chorionic gonadotropins injection (HCG)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>endometrial thickness by enovaginal utrasound at the day of HCG administration.
 With the uterus imaged in the longitudinal plan, endometrial thickness will be  measured at the thickest point between the two basal layers on the anterior and posterior uterine walls. Endometrial thickness, measured to the nearest millimeters, included both endometrial layers together</outcome>
      <timepoint>at the day of HCG </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome assessed by endovaginal ultrasound visualization of large cystic ovary and measurement of serum estradiol level </outcome>
      <timepoint>early after HCG administration till pregnancy if occurred through monitoring of patient complain of abdominal fullness , vomiting  and ultrasound assessment of ovarian size in addition to serum estradiol serum assessment .</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>total financial cost of the cycle treatment </outcome>
      <timepoint>after finishing treatment and doing intrauterine insemination procedure</timepoint>
