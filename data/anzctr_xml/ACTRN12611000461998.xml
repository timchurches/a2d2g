  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eculizumab 30mL vials with a solution concentraion of 10mg/mL. 
Given by intravenous infusion over 1-4 hours with the dose depending on body weight. Dosing is weekly infusion for 4 weeks and then IV infusion every 2 weeks. There will be 26 weeks of treatment to meet the study defined endpoints. Patients will be allowed to continue to receive the drug for 2 more year or until the product is registred in Australia unless the study is prematurely discontinued.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a serious, life-threatening rare and chronic disease believed to be caused by genetic mutations. Current treatment for the disease is inadequate.
Due to the uncontrolled complement activation seen in aHUS patients and the previously shown activity of eculizumab to selectively inhibit terminal complement activation, it has been decided to look in to the use of eculizumab in the treatment of severely affected aHUS patients.</summary>
