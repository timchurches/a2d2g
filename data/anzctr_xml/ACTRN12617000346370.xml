  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study compromises the collection of salival and buccal swabs. An initial set of baseline swabs will be collected with the first 72 hours postpartum, and are taken every 4 hours for the selected 24-hour period (i.e day 2 of life at 04h00/08h00/12h00/16h00/20h00/00h00). Thereafter, buccal and saliva swabs will be taken in the same manner (i.e. every 4 hours for 24 hours) on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 postnatal age. We will also take the same set saliva and buccal swabs (every 4 hours for 24 hours) at week 36 postmenstrual age, week 44 postmenstrual age.
Infant weight, length and head circumference will be measured on the above sampling days and an actimeter will be fitted to the infant to measure physical activity for the duration of each sampling day (i.e. 24 hours). 
</interventions>
    <comparator>All measurements will be taken in preterm and term infants. The study samples will be take in 4 different gestational age group: Extremely preterm infants (24-26 weeks postmenstrual age), Very preterm infants (28-30 weeks postmenstrual age), Moderately preterm infants (32-34 weeks postmenstrual age), and Term Infants (39-41 weeks postmenstrual age). Term infants (39-41 weeks postmenstrual age) represent the control/comparator population and will define the  "normal" circadian rhythm development pattern against which the preterm infant developmental patterns will be assessed. There is no intervention in this observational study.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to establishment of circadian rhythm in cortisol and melatonin secretion. 
Saliva samples are taken every 4 hours for a 24 hour period. From these 6 consecutive samples we are able to determine how the rhythm of cortisol and melatonin fluctuates across the 24 hour day and hence determine whether a typical circadian rhythm is depicted in these patterns. Cortisol and melatonin concentrations are determined from the samples by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). 
The circadian rhythm of the hormones are determined by means of a cosinor analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time to establish a circadian rhythm will be established as the time taken until cosinor analysis shows a significant rhythm is present, for cortisol and melatonin.

(Saliva sampling days, defined as 6 samples across a 24 hour period are initially determined within the first 72 hours of life. Identical sample days are then repeated at weekly intervals for the first month of life (i.e. 7, 14, 21 and 28 days old). 
In preterm infants we will take another set of samples at 36 weeks and we take the final set of samples when the infants are 1 month corrected postnatal age (a common sample timepoint with term infants).)
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This is a composite secondary outcome of time to development of circadian rhythm of heart rate/pulse/respiration rate.

These physiological measurements are all determined and assessed from downloads of NICU monitors at the cot bedside.  Analysis of amplitude, mesor and phase of circadian rhythms of heart rate/pulse/respiration rate in preterm and term infants are performed using a cosinor analysis. If a circadian rhythm has developed at any given timepoint, the cosinor analysis shows a significant outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time to establish a circadian rhythm in cardiorespiratory circadian rhythms will be established as the time taken until cosinor analysis of measurements obtained at any nominated measurement point shows a significant rhythm is present in cardiorespiratory circadian rhythms.

(Monitor downloads will be obtained at the end of each of the determined sampling days, i.e withing the first 72 hours of life, then at weekly intervals for the first month of life (i.e. 7, 14, 21 and 28 days old), at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (for preterm infants born less than 36 weeks only) and finally at 1 month corrected postnatal age (a common sample timepoint with term infants).)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to development of circadian rhythm in physical activity 

Outcome is assessed using an actimeter worn on the left lower limb. Actimeters will be fitted for the duration of the sampling days (24 hours). Cross-sectional analysis of amplitude, mesor and phase of circadian rhythms physical activity in preterm and term infants are performed using a cosinor analysis. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The time to establish a circadian rhythm in physical activity will be established as the time taken until cosinor analysis of measurements obtained at any nominated measurement point shows a significant rhythm is present in physical activity.

Actimeters will be fitted for the first sampling day that occurs withing the first 72 hours of life, then for 24 hours at weekly intervals for the first month of life (i.e. 7, 14, 21 and 28 days old), at 36 weeks post-menstrual ages (for preterm infants born less than 36 weeks only) and finally at 1 month correct postnatal age (a common sample time point with term infants).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental attitudes to circadian intervention will also be assess by means of a customised parent survey designed for this study. 
Parental survey data will be collated and put into a simple coding system which will be used to rank the data. Answers that already contain a numerical scale, will likely be ranked on a similar scale. Answers to open ended questions and review responses will be categorised into a sufficiently small set of broad categories which will then be ranked accordingly. These data can be analysed with the use of a Chi-squared test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These surveys will be administered to the parents at the end of the study once the final samples have been taken from their infants. Surveys will be sent out via email and submitted into a secure database called REDCap.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to establish a regular and rhythmic expression of core circadian clock genes. 

Buccal samples allow us to determine clock gene expression of the clock genes Bmal1, Per 2 and Reverb-alpha. The expression of these specific clock genes at particular times of day determines circadian variation that occurs in many other other tissues, physiological processes and hormonal fluctuations. It is therefore important that we obtain this information in conjunction with the hormonal data to determine whether the expression of these clock genes matches up with the rhythms depicted in the hormones described in Primary outcome 1. Clock gene expression is determined by examination of mRNA levels of each clock gene by means of PCR.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time to establish a circadian rhythm will be established as the time taken until cosinor analysis shows a significant rhythm is present in the core clock gene expression

Buccal samples occur at the same time as saliva samples, defined as 6 samples across a 24 hour period are initially determine within the first 72 hours of life. Identical sample days are then repeated at weekly intervals for the first month of life (i.e. 7, 14, 21 and 28 days old). 

In preterm infants we will take another set of samples at 36 weeks and we take the final set of samples when the infants are 1 month correct postnatal age (a common sample timepoint with term infants).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>A group size of 10 participants per gestational age group will facilitate detection of a minimum mean difference of 4 weeks in the time taken to establish a circadian rhythm in cortisol and melatonin secretion based on an expected standard deviation of residuals of 2.06 (McMillen et al, Pediatr Res 1991; 29: 381-384) with a power 0.824 and alpha = 0.01.

Circadian rhythms in each of the physiological measures of interest (e.g., activity, temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, salivary hormones, clock gene expression) will be analysed using cosinor analysis (computing macro on Microsoft Office Excel 2013) to establish the outcome variables of amplitude, mesor, phase and period for each gestational age group at each timepoint. Data will be analysed subsequently in SPSS v23 (IBM Business Analytics Software, NSW, Australia).

Cross sectional analyses will apply a general linear model with adjustment for covariates (ANCOVA) at the common maturational time points of 36 w and 44w postmenstrual age. Cross sectional analyses will use the gestational age group as the between subjects factor and potential covariates such as sex, duration of mechanical ventilation, postnatal sepsis episodes, and postnatal steroid treatment to ascertain differences between gestational age groups at each maturational time point, to define absolute differences between groups, and independent predictors. 

To analyse differences in the time to the onset of a circadian rhythms, the rate of development of circadian rhythm will be analysed at the individual patient level for each outcome variable and compared between groups using ANCOVA using potential explanatory factors as described above.  

Determinants of time to onset will be analysed using multiple linear regression analysis.  Where multicollinearity exists between potential explanatory variables, factor reduction will be achieved using principal components analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A circadian rhythm is any endogenous biological process exhibiting an entrainable daily oscillation. Circadian rhythms are essential for normal physiological and behavioural functioning and alignment with the 24 h light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms are coordinated by a set of rhythmically expressed clock genes. A master clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronises peripheral cellular clocks and hormonal rhythmicity (e.g., plasma melatonin and cortisol concentrations). Light is the dominant environmental cue setting the rhythm of the SCN master clock. 
The developing fetus is not exposed to light. The development of the fetal circadian system is driven by maternal variation in circadian hormones transmitted to the fetus via the placenta. The fetus cannot synthesise its own hormones until near term. Premature delivery deprives the fetus of these materno-placental circadian cues. Hospitalisation of preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) further disrupts circadian input and rhythm development due to constant lighting and noise, and invasive procedures/therapies. 
This prospective study is observational and investigates the circadian rhythm development across infants of different gestational ages; gestation specific patterns will be identified from physiological, hormonal and molecular outcome variables. This study will inform a second prospective study; a randomised-controlled trial of two interventions to normalise circadian rhythm development in preterm infants: modification of environmental light/dark information; and environmental modification with additional time-specific supplementation of endogenous circadian hormones (melatonin and cortisol). The clinical trial will identify if a circadian intervention improves short-term clinical outcomes.  </summary>
