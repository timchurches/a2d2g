  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Patients diagnosed with malignancy who have persistent pain which is believed by the

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Patient has no pain (0/10 on NRS).

          2. Patients with severe pain are excluded, however once their pain control is optimised
             they are eligible.

          3. Patient has received radiation therapy in the six weeks prior to commencing the study
             or is likely to require radiotherapy during the study period.

          4. Patient has commenced, or had dose modifications, to either non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids in the week prior to commencing
             the study, or during the two-week study period.

          5. Patient has commenced chemotherapy or hormone therapy in the 4 weeks prior to the
             study or is expected to commence chemotherapy or hormonotherapy during the study
             period. Patients who are stable on long-term chemotherapy or hormones are eligible for
             this study. Patients who receive high dose steroids as antiemetics with their
             chemotherapy are eligible providing they are not receiving the steroids during the
             study period.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many patients with cancer pain have pain not fully controlled on opioids (eg. morphine). The
      addition of acetaminophen (Tylenol) to opioids in a small study in cancer patients
      demonstrated better pain control without an increase in side effects. This study will
      determine if regular acetaminophen improves pain control when added to strong opioids in
      patients with cancer pain.</summary>
