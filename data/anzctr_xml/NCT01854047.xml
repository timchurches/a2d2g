      <outcome>Time to First Severe Exacerbation: Kaplan-Meier Estimates at Week 12 and 24: HEos-ITT Population - The time to first severe exacerbation was defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first severe exacerbation event. For participants who had no severe exacerbation on or before last dose date + 14 days, it was censored at the date of last dose date + 14 days. The median time to first severe exacerbation was not estimated because the number of severe exacerbations was too low in the Dupilumab arms. Therefore, alternative Kaplan-Meier statistics, the probability of severe exacerbation at Week 12 and 24, are presented as the descriptive measure statistics.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire 5-item Version (ACQ-5) Score at Week 12: HEos-ITT Population - The ACQ-5 has 5 questions, reflecting the top-scoring five asthma symptoms: woken at night by symptoms, wake in the mornings with symptoms, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath and wheeze. Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week and to respond to each of the five symptom questions on a 7-point scale ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment). ACQ-5 total score was mean of the scores of all 5 questions and, therefore, ranged from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Higher score indicated lower asthma control.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Global Score at Week 12: HEos-ITT Population - The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that are most important to participants with asthma. The AQLQ comprises of 32 items in 4 domains: symptoms (12 items), activity limitation (11 items), emotional function (5 items), environmental stimuli (4 items). Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert scale (1=maximal impairment, 7=no impairment). The 32 items of the questionnaire are averaged to produce one overall quality of life score ranging from 1 (severely impaired) to 7 (not impaired at all). Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</outcome>
