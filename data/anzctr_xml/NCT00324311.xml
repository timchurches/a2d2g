  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Burns represent one of the most severe and dreaded traumas. Burned and traumatized tissue is
      known as eschar. The dead eschar, if not removed, often becomes heavily contaminated and is
      the source of local and/or systemic infection or sepsis. The local inflammation and infection
      destroy healthy surrounding tissues and extends the original damage. In order to prevent
      these complications, and in order to minimize the risk of infection, it is imperative to
      evaluate the burn and remove all of the offending eschar at the earliest possible
      opportunity. This removal of dead tissue is termed "debridement".

      The most direct debridement method for eschar removal is surgery. Traditional, conservative
      non-surgical debridement is a lengthy process which often involves many complications.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and enzymatic debriding efficacy of
      Debrase Gel Dressing (DGD) in hospitalized patients with deep partial thickness and/or full
      thickness thermal burns and to compare DGD to standard of care (SOC).</summary>
