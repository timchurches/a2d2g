  <interventions>
    <interventions>We have developed an online decision aid (My Prostate Cancer Screening Annalisa) for men aged 40 to 69 years. The aid summarises the evidence for the benefits, potential harms and other factors associated with screening and elicits individual participants preferences for each factor associated with the decision to screen (the benefits, potential harms and other factors).
Responses to these questions are used to generate a personalised decision aid for the user. 
There are two arms of the trial: 
Control arm: Users are asked to indicate how important 5 attributes of prostate cancer screening (benefits and potential harms) are to them; these were pre-installed by researchers based on literature (RCT data) and a pilot study (i.e. the attributes are fixed). This arm is referred to as My Prostate Cancer Screening Annalisa: Fixed Attributes.
Intervention arm: Users are asked to choose the attributes they would like to include in their decision aid, from a total of 10 attributes. That is, users pick their own attributes. This arm is called My Prostate Cancer Screening Annalisa: You Choose. The control decision aid takes about 15 minutes to complete. The intervention decision aid takes about 18 minutes to complete.</interventions>

      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 1: The proportion of the intervention and control group who indicate they are more likely to visit their GP to discuss PSA testing after interacting with either the 'Pick Your Own' (PYO) or Fixed Attribute (control group) decision aids. (The PYO version is where participants choose, from a list of 10 attributes, the ones they think are important to them). This will be assessed in the online questionnaire by asking participants to indicate how likely they are to see their GP about PSA testing before and after they use the appropriate decision aid.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate an online interactive decision aid for prostate cancer screening. Who is it for? You can join this study if you are a male aged 40-69 years who lives in Australia. You must have access to the internet and a reasonable command of the English language. Trial details Participants in this trial will complete an online decision aid for prostate cancer screening. This easy to use interactive decision aid asks men to rate the importance of factors that are relevant to making a high quality decision, and to weigh up the potential benefits (e.g. avoiding the potential loss of lifetime by early detection of prostate cancer) and harms (e.g. false positive test results and unnecessary treatments) of PSA testing for prostate cancer. Participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of two groups. One group will complete the 'Fixed Attributes' version of the decision aid and the other group will complete the 'You Choose' version. The usefulness of the decision aid will be assessed via a series of questions asking the respondents to rate aspects of the quality of the decision about prostate cancer screening.</summary>
