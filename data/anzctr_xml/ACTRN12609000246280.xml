  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) oral tablets (1000IU/25micrograms), 2 tablets/day for a total of 6 months.  It was not felt to be ethical to randomise patients who were frankly vitamin D deficient.  However, useful data can be obtained using the patients as their own controls. Specifically, results will be compared using paired T tests (baseline and end of study) to determine whether correction of overt deficiency is associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity and inflammatory burden.  The magnitude of response (presuming a positive effect) will be compared in general terms to the size of effect in the 2 arms of the randomised study.</interventions>

    <concealment>Once a potential study participant has been identified and informed consent signed, they will undergo a baseline assessment, after which if they meet the eligibility criteria and have serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &gt;37nmol/L they will be randomised into one of two groups (1:1).  To ensure allocation concealment, 'off-site' computer randomisation will be used.  
At the time of enrollment patients will be issued a unique identification number consisting of a three-digit study number.  The investigator will sequentially assign these numbers.  Once assigned, the patientsâ€™ three-digit study number will not be re-used and will remain with the patient for the duration of the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be by permuted block and stratified for baseline Body Mass Index (BMI, &lt;25 or &gt;25) and diabetic status. Randomisation will be performed using a validated Microsoft Access based system available at Centre for Clinical Research Excellence Metabolic and Vascular Health, University of Queensland, that automates the random assignment of treatment group to randomisation numbers, based on the stratification data, permuted block size, and the generation of a randomisation code for the order in which to select each block.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  Addressing traditional cardiac risk factors in this population does not ameliorate the disease burden to the
same extent as the background population. As such, novel risks are being explored.
Vitamin D is now recognised as having pleiotropic roles beyond bone and mineral homeostasis. The vitamin D receptor is found in almost all human tissues, and whilst it was once thought that only the kidneys metabolised vitamin D to its active form (calcitriol), other tissues (such as peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, PBMCs) are recognised as possessing the metabolising enzyme, raising the question of whether vitamin D effects are in part an auto/paracrine response, highlighting the importance of precursor availability.
Approximately 50% of patients with CKD stage 3 are vitamin D insufficient (measured as the serum precursor calcidiol). They have increased circulating inflammatory cytokines and are often sub-clinically insulin-resistant. These factors are known to be associated with cardiovascular risk, and are integrally linked. Indeed, Interleukin-1beta (IL-1b), Interleurkin-6 (IL-6)and Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa)have been associated with pancreatic Beta-cell apoptosis, and diminished cellular insulin processing. In experimental models vitamin D can reduce the activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB in various cell lines, and in isolated PBMCs vitamin D decreases production of IL-6 and TNFa. In vitro studies also suggest vitamin D may improve insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation and GLUT 4 translocation in skeletal muscle, together with direct effects on the pancreatic Beta-cells. Lastly, recent animal studies have implicated the vitamin D responsive bone protein osteocalcin in glucose metabolism, possibly through promotion of adiponectin production, an adipokine with known beneficial glycaemic properties.
This double-blinded trial will assess the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in early CKD to raise circulating calcidiol and improve insulin resistance, possibly through reduced inflammatory burden. Patients will be randomised to either vitamin D3 2000IU/day or placebo for 6 months.
At baseline and end-of-study a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp study will be performed to assess peripheral insulin response and correlation with PBMC NF-kappaB activity and circulating inflammatory burden (as quantified
by IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa, known gene products of NF-KappaB). Osteocalcin, adiponectin and markers of bone turnover will also be assessed.</summary>
