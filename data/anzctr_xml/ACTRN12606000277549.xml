  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most patients who present with acute arthritis or inflammation of the joints do not develop rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive, disabling disease, which results from chronic inflammation in the joints. It leads to pain, suffering, and frequently irreversible joint damage. Earlier identification and treatment of patients with RA can reduce permanent joint damage. However, identifying patients with early RA, as opposed to other self-limiting forms of arthritis can be difficult. Current diagnostic tests for RA are limited to those that can detect joint changes after the disease is well established. This study investigates whether two recently developed tests can help predict those patients presenting with arthritis who will go on to develop RA. These tests involve detection of two antibodies, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and soluble HLA (sHLA-DR) in blood and joint fluid. Determining patients with early RA will help prevent exposing patients with other self-liming forms of arthritis to potentially toxic medications. In addition identifying patients who are likely to develop more severe RA may help guide more intensive therapy early</summary>
