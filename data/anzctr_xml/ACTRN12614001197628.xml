  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of 3 dietary supplementation groups: 1) wool derived protein, 2) whey protein, or 3) placebo. The study duration will be 17 weeks, which includes an initial two testing weeks, 14 weeks of exercise and protein supplementation co-intervention and a final testing week.. For the 2 week familiarisation, all participants will consume the placebo. The supplement will only be consumed during weekdays, to coincide with the exercise sessions. 

Supplement: will be delivered in the form of health bars and capsules, to be consumed 2 times per day (post-exercise, 1 hour prior to bedtime), separated by at least 3 hours. The total daily protein dose in each treatment arm will be 40 gram: a) 17 g KDP+23 g whey, b) 40 g whey, or c) placebo - no added protein. The placebo bars will have the supplemental protein energy content replaced with gluten free flour and refined carbohydrate (maltodextrin, glucose) and fat to match energy and minimize protein content. 

Exercise: Exercise Physiologists will supervise 5 days/week intermittent high-intensity mixed-mode, group-based exercise program designed to achieve a fixed-rate 2% gain in exercise load/week. Each training session will be approximately 60 minutes in duration, including: a. Warm-up:10 min light cardio machine exercise and stretching b. Days 1, 2, 4, 5: aerobic (stationary cycle) exercise, comprising a mix of continuous exercise and anaerobic intervals (70-90% of peak power and recovery at 40-50% of peak power). Exercise intensity will be standardised by having all sessions conducted on calibrated ergometers c. Day 3: standardised circuit resistance training (10-30% of the exercise 1 repetition maximum) emphasising the legs d. Cool-down: 5-10 minutes of stretching to cool down Subjects will be required to attend a minimum of 60 sessions over the 14 weeks, and will be provided with the opportunity to complete any missed sessions on weekends.

To ensure adherence to exercise the participants will be supervised. The participants will be required to complete a 3-day dietary recall each time they visit the laboratory for testing, and a text message will be sent to remind the participant to consume the evening dose.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control bars will have the supplemental protein energy content replaced with by refined carbohydrate (maltodextrin, glucose) and fat to match energy.

    <statisticalmethods>The between group effect of treatment will be analysed using mixed linear models via the Proc Mixed utility in SAS (SAS, Cary, NC). Fixed effects within the models will be group (treatment) and time. Random effects (covariance matrix) will be subject, treatment; additional random effects may be added following evaluation of other sources of variability. The baseline values will be added as a covariate to adjust for between-subject variability. Parametric data will be log-transformed prior to analysis, which allows for changes to be expressed as percents and manages heteroscedasticity to adjust residuals to normally-distributed data. Clinical inference and inference to mechanisms outcomes will be via the method of magnitude-based inference.

Sample size estimate was based upon the primary outcome, glucose infusion rate (GIR = glucose disposal rate or the measure of insulin sensitivity). The rationale and calculations are as follows: the test-retest measures for GIR values reported by Defronzo et al and equations for statistical superiority reported in Zhong. The minimum meaningful effect size was set at 23%, a statistically significant outcome following 3 months of diabetic medication. GIR has not been measured following chronic amino acid supplementation, but improvements in HbA1c, fasting and postprandial blood glucose that were seen in T2DM participants following 8 weeks of supplementation, exceeded improvements documented in another study comparing the effect of 3 months treatment with hypoglycaemic medication in poorly controlled diabetes. In that study GIR improved by 23%. To achieve power of 0.80, statistical significance p&lt;.05, and a minimum effect of 23% each group requires 12 participants, which accounts for potential drop-outs.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There has been a recent growing interest in the use of protein supplementation in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) therapy. Dietary amino acids are potent stimulators of vascular and skeletal muscle adaptations that have been associated with improved cardiovascular health and metabolic flexibility. Previous studies have typically derived these dietary amino acids from dairy sources; alternatively, keratin- derived protein (KDP) is uniquely rich in the amino acid cysteine and has high levels of selenium  both key components in glutathione, a critical agent in cellular antioxidant processes. Preliminary findings suggest that KDP supplementation may aid the attenuation of oxidative stress in diseased (e.g. T2DM) skeletal muscle leading to attenuation in muscle-degradative stress and fibrosis. Therefore, the current study will determine whether chronic KDP supplementation enhances the effects of 12 weeks exercise training on systemic glucose disposal and insulin signalling in middle-aged adults with T2DM. The findings may provide a new simple and practical direction for improving diabetic rehabilitation.</summary>
