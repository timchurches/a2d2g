  <interventions>
    <interventions>Respondents will be presented with 8 choice sets, each containing images of four hypothetical food packs, and will be asked to select which product they would like to purchase (or if they would not purchase any product from the choice set). Participants will be randomised to one of the three front-of-pack label conditions; the Daily Intake Guide, Multiple Traffic Lights or the Health Star Rating. The food pack images will either contain the specified front-of-pack label or no label. The food packs will also vary according to the following attributes: healthiness (3 levels), health claims (4 levels), price (3 levels) and food type (4 levels). Each food pack will contain one level of each attribute. All attributes and their levels are described in detail below.

Front-of-pack label:
4 levels: no label (control condition), Daily Intake Guide, Multiple Traffic Lights or the Health Star Rating. Each participant will only see one type of label (or no label) across all products.

Food type:
4 levels: corn flakes, cookies, pizza, yogurt. Each participant will be exposed to all 4 levels of this attribute (i.e. they will be presented with 2 packs of each food type).

Health claims:
4 levels: no claim (control condition) nutrient content claim, general level claim, higher level claim. 

Price:
Contains 3 levels: cheap, moderate price, expensive.

Healthiness:
Contains 3 levels: unhealthy, moderately healthy, healthy. 

Each choice set will be presented for 30 seconds. Participants will complete the experiment online via their own personal computer. Participants will have the option to complete the experiment in one session or log out and return to it at a later time. </interventions>
    <comparator>A repeated measures design will be used testing multiple interventions simultaneously within and across participants. Front-of-pack label, health claim, healthiness, price and food type will vary across foods to reveal to what extent these variables influence choice of and willingness to pay for foods. A control condition will be used for the attributes front-of-pack label and health claim. Comparisons will be conducted across the levels of the remaining attributes (food type, price, healthiness) to observe how choice varies across levels.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>The survey will be completed online via a desktop or laptop computer. Participants will be first assessed for eligibility to participate based on demographic quotas and eating habits. They will provide demographic information (age, gender, socioeconomic status) and state the frequency with which they buy and consume the foods used in the survey. Participants who fall within a demographic category that has reached its quota or stated that they never purchase or consume more than two of the four foods used in the survey will not progress further. Those who do progress will answer questions on diet, nutrition knowledge, food purchasing behaviors and attention to and preference for nutrition information on food packs before completing the choice task. They will then complete 8 choice sets containing 4 mock packs (of the same food type), presented in a row. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 versions of the choice task. Within each version only one type of FoPL will be present or absent on packs. Participants will be simultaneously allocated to survey versions until quotas are reached. 

Thirty blocks consisting of 2 choice sets each will be created in NGene using the following inputs: FoPL (2 levels: no FoPL, FoPL: DIG/MTL/HSR), health claim (4 levels: none, nutrient content, general level, higher level), healthiness (3 levels: unhealthy, moderately healthy, healthy) and price (3 levels: cheap, moderate, expensive). An efficient design allowing for estimation of main effects and 2 way interaction effects will be used resulting in a D error of 0.094. This design will be replicated 12 times across each of the 4 levels of food type the 3 levels of FoPLs. Within their allocated FoPL condition, each participant will view 1 block (2 choice sets) from each of the 4 food products. The order in which these choice sets are presented will be random. 

The choice task will be designed to be as realistic as possible within the constraints of an online survey. To replicate the time pressures present in many food purchase decisions, participants will be given 30 seconds to make their selection. Much like a real world shopping context, the NIP will be available to participants who actively made the choice to view it. Participants will have the option to view the NIP (one at a time) for any of the 4 mock packs within a choice set by clicking a link below the mock pack image. They will also be able to zoom in on any part of the mock pack image. Finally, participants wil have the option to select none of the mock packs.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The non communicable diseases associated with poor diet (e.g., high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, obesity and poor metabolic outcomes) are increasing in prevalence but are also preventable. 

Nutrition labels on the front of food packs is one public health intervention designed to assist people to consume a healthy diet. A variety of other information (health related and otherwise) is available on food packs for consumers to incorporate into their purchase decisions. (such as the Nutrition Information Panel, health claims, price, etc). These sources of information often occur together on food packs, yet past research has generally look at the isolated effects of individual forms of nutrition information without consideration of how these pieces of information interact. The primary aim of this study is to investigate how nutrition information format, healthiness and price interact to affect consumer product choice. </summary>
