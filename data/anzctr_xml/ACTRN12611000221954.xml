  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women with back pain during first stage labour, assessed by visual analogue scale as = 7 will receive 0.1  0.3 millilitres of sterile water for injection. The exact volume injected is determined by visualisation of the resulting blister or bleb by the administering clinician. The injection is given using of one-millilitre syringes and 23 gauge needles, one injection  into four anatomical points surrounding the Michaelis rhomboid over the sacral area: two over the posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS) and the remaining two at two centimetres posterior, and one centimetre medial, to the PSIS respectively. Women may receive repeat injections upon request once the VAS is again = 7. Repeat injections will be of Sterile Water for injection. There is no maximum amount of injections that women may receive during their labour.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control / placebo will be Normal Saline for injection 0.9%, 0.1  0.3 millilitres of sterile water for injection.

    <concealment>Women with back pain in labour, with a pain score assessed by visual analogue sclae as being equal or greater than 7 and providing consent, will be enrolled in the trial. Identical ampuoles of Sterile Water for Injection and Normal Saline 0.9% labelled with a randomly generated study number will be available for use. Following consent two midiwves will remove an ampuole and administer the injections using the standard four injection technique. The midwife caring for the labouring woman will be absent from the room during the administration of the injections.</concealment>
    <sequence>Identical ampuoles of Sterile Water for Injection and Normal Saline 0.9% prepared by the pharmacy will be labelled with a unique study number generated by the Mater Medical Research Institute using block randomisation.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>All women who underwent randomisation will be analysed in their allocated treatment groups (i.e., intention to treat). Randomisation and stratification should ensure that groups are equal in baseline characteristics. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome will be calcuted. Secondary outcome measures of categorical data will be analysed with chi-squared tests and continuous data will be analysed with t-tests for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U test for parametric data. Regression will be used if necessary to adjust for any other confounding variables. All study outcomes will be analysed using a two-sdied P value of &lt;0.05 to indicate statistical significance. The study is only powered to report the primary outcome and for secondary outcomes confidence intervals (CI) will be included as a measure for the effect size. Differences in pre and post VAS scores will be reported in the format recommended by the recent Cochrane Review

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will test to see if the addition of sterile water injections for the relief of back pain in labour to standard pharmacological (nitrous oxide gas, narcotics, epidural) and non-pharmaclogical analgesic options ( shower, water immersion, massage, heat, aromatherapy, TENS) will affect birth outcomes, specifically the rates of caesarean section.</summary>
