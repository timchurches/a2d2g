  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adult residents of intervention clusters will be screened for TB once per year for three years. 
Eligible residents within each cluster will be persons aged 15 years and over who are capable of giving informed consent and who are resident in the cluster at the time of screening.
Residents will be visited in their home, informed about the study and, if they agree to be screened, will answer questions about symptoms of TB and attempt to produce a single spontaneous sputum specimen for testing. The collected sputum specimen will be tested for Mycobacterium tuberculosis using a fully automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Xpert MTB/RIF, Cepheid Inc). Those who test positive will be referred to the TB treatment program for further management. We will conduct a public information campaign within the selected intervention clusters to enhance participation in the screening process. This will include meeting with community leaders, announcements broadcast over loudspeakers in the village and distributing information flyers to households. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The unit of randomisation (cluster) is the sub-commune. 

In order to ensure representativeness, selection is stratified by District. There are 9 Districts. The proportion of the adult population in each District ranges from 6.2% (Nam Can) to 17.9% (TP Ca Mau). The number of clusters to be selected in each District is calculated as this proportion multiplied by the sample size (120), rounded to the nearest 2 (to allow for random allocation to two groups within each stratum). 

The primary sampling unit (PSU) is the Commune. There are 101 Communes. Communes are randomly selected with a probability proportional to size (1).

Within each District, the number of sub-communes to be selected from each Commune (PSU) is calculated based on the relative size of the Commune and the number of sub-communes to be selected for the District.

Within each Commune, the sub-communes are sorted in random order and the first n sub-communes in this list are selected. This represents the study population.

In order to ensure geographical characteristics are balanced between the randomisation groups, the allocation is stratified by District.

Next the selected sub-communes within each District are sorted by adult population size and formed into pairs, so that each pair contains sub-communes with similar adult population sizes. One member of each pair is then randomly assigned to active screening (intervention) with the other assigned to control group.

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be by intention to treat. We will use a two level, hierarchical generalised linear model with a Poisson error distribution to test the effect of treatment group allocation on number of prevalent cases of culture-proven pulmonary TB in the final year.  Treatment group allocation will be the main (fixed) effect. Clusters will be treated as a random intercept term. Cluster population aged greater than or equal to 15 years will be the offset. There will be no interim analyses and a p value &lt; 0.05 will be treated as significant. No covariates will be included in the primary analysis. Proportions will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for clustering. 

We have made the following assumptions for the sample size calculations:
a) the average population (aged 15 years and over) per sub-commune cluster will be 1000 people; 
b) the upper limit of the intra-class correlation coefficient is 0.001 (2006-07 prevalence survey). 
c) the prevalence of culture-proven TB in the control clusters will be 350 per 100,000;
We will need 55 clusters (55,000 adults) in each group to have 90% power to detect a prevalence ratio for culture-proven pulmonary TB equal to 0.6 or lower (i.e., a 40% or greater reduction in prevalence). We plan to recruit 60 clusters for each study arm, to allow for drop-outs. 
We estimate that for each 1000 adults aged 15 years and over, there will be 22 children aged 6 years and expect to test 15 children in each cluster, which give 90% power to detect a prevalence ratio of 0.70 or lower as different (p &lt; 0.05).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During 2010, 8.8 million people developed TB and 1.45 million people died due to the disease. In this project, which will be conducted in Vietnam, one of the countries in our region with a particularly high prevalence of TB, we will test a new form of an old intervention: community-wide screening for TB, not with x-rays but by testing sputum. If the project is successful it has the potential to lead to a giant leap forward towards the elimination of TB as a global health problem.</summary>
