  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ingestion of 5 x 1g krill oil capsules (containing 833 mg EPA + 471 mg DHA) with breakfast once (in the teaching clinic) followed by 1 week washout period, and
Ingestion of 5 x 1g of fish oil capsules (containing 1037mg EPA + 745 mg DHA) with breakfast once (in the teaching clinic) followed by 1 week washout period.
Standardised breakfast (150g mashed potatoes with 600mL water) is provided. The breakfast is mixed with the intervention oil by the researcher before serving to the participants. Therefore adherence ensured.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The health benefits of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from krill oil and fish oil are associated with the incorporation of EPA and DHA into the cell membrane
which then alters the membrane structure and cell functions. Consequently they reduce plasma triglyceride level and inhibit inflammatory response. The bio-availability of these fatty acids from the two oils maybe different due to the binding of fatty acids in the oils. This study will evaluate the
incorporation of EPA and DHA into the plasma and chylomicron after a single dose supplementation. In addition
the effects on cardio-metabolic risk factors will also be investigated.</summary>
