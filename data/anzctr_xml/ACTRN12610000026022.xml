  <interventions>
    <interventions>Skeletal traction protocol consists on (i) application of the olecranon skeletal traction with Steinmann pin and frame under generals anaesthesia, (ii) overhead traction with 1.5 to 2 kg weight, with the forearm in supination and supported on ventral long arm slab, with the elbow positioned at 90 degrees of flexion (iii) continuation of traction from 2  3 weeks depending on the childs age. When the patient could actively lift the arm off the pillow, usually 14 to 18 days after the injury, traction was removed and the elbow was rested in a sling and the patient was discharged. Active mobilization of the elbow was encouraged. No supervised physiotherapy was advised.</interventions>
    <comparator>Skin traction protocol consists on (i) application of the skeletal traction to the forearm with the patient under sedation, (ii) the extremity positioned with the elbow in extension and elevated, the arm was rested on a pillow.Â  (iii) usual weight 1-1.5 kg, (iv) the continuation of traction from 2-3 weeks depending on childs age. When the patient could actively lift the arm off the pillow, usually 14 to 18 days after the injury, traction was removed and the elbow was rested in a sling and the patient was discharged. Active mobilization of the elbow was encouraged. No supervised physiotherapy was advised.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>cubitus varus
The carrying angle (cubitus varus) is measured with a goniometer placed on the anterior aspect of the upper limb with the elbow in extension and the forearm in supination. The axis of the goniometer is placed over the center of the cubital fossa, its proximal arm aligned with the humeral shaft and its distal arm lying on a line from the center of the antecubital fossa to the center of the wrist.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months follow-up
however if the patient does not present to the clinic we try to call the patient and assess up to 6 moths after the procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>elbow range of movement
The flexion ROM and extension ROM were measured with a goniometer placed on the lateral aspect of the elbow with the axis of the goniometer centered over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months follow-up
however if the patient does not present to the clinic we try to call the patient and assess up to 6 moths after the procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>complications rate
Neurovascular deficit was assessed clinically. Radiographs were checked for the presence of myositis ossificans.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months follow-up
however if the patient does not present to the clinic we try to call the patient and assess up to 6 moths after the procedure</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to compare the outcome of 2 different methods of managing displaced supracondylar fractures of humerus applicable in the setting of a tropical hospital characterized by lack of access to the image intensifier as well as limited access to specialized orthopaedic services.  Although current literature supports percutaneous pinning of displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus as preferable method rending the best results, one should notice that this method is not easily applicable in the developing counties. This study may provide good evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines for the management of supracondylar fracture of the humerus in developing countries characterized by both lack of image intensifier and specialized orthopaedic services.</summary>
