  <interventions>
    <interventions>P. falciparum patients will receive either artesunate or DHA-PIP, and P. vivax patients will receive chloroquine.  All drugs will be given by oral route.
Artesunate will be administered at a total dose of 16 mg/kgbw over 7 days (1st day: 4 mg/kgbw, 2nd to 7th days: 2 mg/kgbw/day). 
Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHA-PIP) will be administered at a total dose of 2mg/kg/day DHA and 16mg/kg/day PIP for 3 days.
Chloroquine total dose is 25 mg/kgbw over 3 days. (1st day: 10mg/kgbw, 2nd day: 10mg/kgbw and 3rd day: 5 mg/kgbw).
The WHO 28 day in vivo protocol, used in this study, consists of parasite count and temperature measurements at baseline (day0 before dosing) and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This surveillance study is a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated malaria. The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PIP) and artesunate (AS7) monotherapy for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and chloroquine (CQ) for P. vivax malaria in 3 sites Dehong and Menglian, Puer, in Yunnan province and in Suining county in Jiangsu province, China.  The WHO 28-day in vivo protocol will be used.  People with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with the appropriate drugs and monitored weekly for 28 days. The follow-up consists of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these assessments, the patients will be classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the follow-up period will be used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis will be used to distinguish between a true recrudescence or reinfection.  The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of China in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria.</summary>
