    <statisticalmethods>We will recruit 55 patients assuming a dropout of 2 patients to have 53 completing patients.

The Primary outcome measure is the time spent below 90% oxygen saturation as measured by overnight pulse oximetry. The trial has been been powered to detect a 7 minute difference between morphine and placebo based on a 15.4 minute standard deviation observed in our pilot study with 90% power and a false positive rate of 5% (n=53). We will use a mixed model analysis of variance procedure classifying patients as random effects and the drug and treatment order as fixed effects to test this and the secondary variables for statistical significance. 

We also plan to undertake subgroup analyses to test inside a mixed model whether sleep apnea severity changes the effect of morphine on primary and secondary outcomes by classifying patients as mild or moderate-severe (AHI above or below 20). A test of group*drug will be used to to test for effect modification using an alpha of 0.05 for significance. We will also test AHI as a linear effect modifying variable in sensitivity analyses.

Linear regression will be used to test whether the placebo-adjusted effect of morphine on the primary outcome is associated with the following: plasma morphine levels (and genetic markers for morphine metabolism), wake CO2 threshold, Wake slope of ventilatory response to CO2, Basal Ventilation (litres/minute), Body Mass Index and Upper airway physiological variables (loop gain, muscle response, Pcrit, arousal threshold). </statisticalmethods>
