  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Excess weight gain during pregnancy is associated with negative outcomes for mother and child. Interventions to reduce excess gestational weight gain can be costly and have not been effective to date. Our aim is to establish a simple way of identifying those women who are likely to gain excess weight during pregnancy in order to enable midwives and obstetricians to direct interventions towards women most at risk. Helping those women at risk of excess weight gain during pregnancy should make interventions work better and thus be cost-effective. </summary>
