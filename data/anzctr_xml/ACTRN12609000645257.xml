  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomised to participate in aerobic exercise three times a week for 12 weeks or usual care. The exercise classes include stations of treadmill training, stationary cycling, arm and/or leg ergometry and weight bearing exercise such as steps and overground walking and last for 1 hour. Blinded assessment of outcome is performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care provided by patients' general practitioner and allied health professionals, excluding supervised aerobic exercise programmes for 12 weeks, the same duration as the exercise group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aerobic exercise can improve cardiovascular fitness, mobility and physical function following stroke but it is not known whether it has an effect on cognitive and neurological function. We intend to compare a 12 week exercise program with usual care to document changes in impairment, activity and participation, as well as performing a cost-effectiveness study.</summary>
