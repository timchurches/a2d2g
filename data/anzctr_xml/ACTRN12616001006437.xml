  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate+amodiaquine (artesunate 4 mg/kg body weight + amodiaquine 10mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 consecutive days) and artemether+lumefantrine (20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine in a tablet) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. The doses of artemether+lumefantrine is based on weight bands: one tablet to those weighing 5-14kg; two tablets for 15-24 kg; three tablets for 25-34 kg and four tablets for greater than or equal to 35 kg; once daily for 3 consecutive days.. The treatment will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. These two artemisinin-based combinations will be tested separately. The patient will be given either artesunate+amodiaquine or artemether+lumefantrine. Artesunate+amodaiquine will tested in all sites while artemether+lumefantrine will evaluated in two sites. Eligible subjects will be treated for three days and followed up for 28 days.</interventions>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>As the treatment failure rate to  artesunate+amodiaquine or  artemether-lumefantrine. in the area is estimated to 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients will be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients per site will be included for each drug and per site. A total of 528 patients [352 (88 x 4 sites)] for artesunate+amodiaquine group and  176 [(88 x 2 sites)] for  artemether-lumefantrine will be enrolled.
The final analysis will include:

1. a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2. a description of all the patients included in the study;
3. the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4. the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5. the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6. the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combinations: artesunate+amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum in the sites of BUHIGA, KAZIRABAGENI and KIGOBE MUTOYI in KARUZI , MAKAMBA, BUJUMBURA MAIRIE et GITEGA provinces, respectively, BURUNDI.

Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of the first-line and second-line treatments.

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate+amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.

Study Sites: study will be conducted in 4 sites: Buhiga, Kazirabageni, Kigobe  and  Mutoyi located in Karuzi , Makamba, Bujumbura Mairie and Gitega provinces, respectively. 

Study Period: The study will be conducted from July 2016 to March 2016.

Study Design: A one arm prospective study for each drug combination.

Patient population: Febrile patients aged between 6 months and 11 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection will be enrolled.

Sample Size: 88 patients per drug per site. Artesunate+amodiaquine will be tested in all the 4 sites (352 patients) while artemether+lumefantrine will be evaluated in two sites (176 patients) 

Treatments and follow-up: artesunate+amodiaquine (daily dose for 3 days) and artemether+lumefantrine (twice daily for 3 days) will be given. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.

Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined.

Secondary endpoints: 
1. The frequency of adverse events.
2. Frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13)
