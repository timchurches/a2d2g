    <inclusivecriteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), meeting the following criteria:

               -  Diagnosis confirmed by examination of representative material (lymph nodes or
                  bone marrow) together with a typical immunophenotype CD5+, CD23-, sIgM, cyclin D1
                  nuclear positivity is desirable but not essential

               -  Central review of histology will be performed on diagnostic material

               -  Molecular or cytogenetic confirmation of diagnosis is not required

          -  Previously untreated disease at any stage requiring therapy in the opinion of the
             treating physician

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Life expectancy = 3 months

               -  Life expectancy not severely limited by other illness

          -  Creatinine clearance = 30 mL/min

          -  Not pregnant or nursing

          -  Negative pregnancy test

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception during study therapy

          -  No known serological positivity for HBV, HCV, or HIV

          -  No concurrent uncontrolled serious medical conditions

          -  No severe impairment of renal or liver function (alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin or
             creatinine &gt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal) not related to lymphoma

          -  No known hypersensitivity to murine proteins

          -  No prior malignancy in the past 5 years, except for nonmelanoma skin tumor or
             curatively resected carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix

          -  No history of a psychological illness or condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may adversely affect compliance with study medication

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  No prior chemotherapy</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer
      cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known
      whether giving combination chemotherapy together with rituximab is more effective than
      combination chemotherapy alone in treating mantle cell lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing how well fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide work when given together with or without rituximab in treating patients with
      previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma.</summary>
