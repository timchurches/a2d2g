  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eight week comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) with a cognitive behavioural therapy program for the sensation of breathlessness (CPR + BREVE). The pulmonary rehabilitation program adheres to the recommendations of the COPD-X Plan 2008, and includes three exercise sessions (circuit training group therapy) and a two-hour education session each week (group therapy). The eight week CBT program (BREVE Breathless. Recognise sensations, Explore thoughts and beliefs, Validate whether thoughts are useful or harmful, Evolve and change behaviour) includes one hour group work facilitated by a psychologist supported by an eight module workbook. Each module includes an educational component, individual reflective activity, practice tasks for the exercise sessions and homework.

Interventions and control occur seperately (i.e cycles of pulmonary rehabilation with and without the active intervention occur in randomised sequence)</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>People referred to Repatriation General Hospital to undertake the Comprehensive Pulmonary Rehabilitation (CPR) program will be eligible for inclusion in this study if they have a clinical diagnosis of COPD, intend to undertake the eight week CPR and have a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) &lt; 80 percent predicted and best recorded ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity of &lt; 70 percent (FEV1/FVC &lt;70%).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be only be excluded from this RCT due to the presence of cognitive or memory impairments (Mini-Mental State Examination score &lt; 23/30), have clinically unstable COPD or co-morbidities which are likely to render exercise unsafe (determined by respiratory physician based upon change in medication or symptoms over the past two months) or are currently registered for lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplantation (risk of withdrawal from RCT).</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The staff of the CPR program will retain responsibility for receiving patient referrals, scheduling appointments for CPR and posting materials for the CPR program including an information sheet outlining this RCT. On attending the first assessment for CPR, the project officer will meet each potential participant to provide information, clarification and invite participation in the study prior to requesting written consent. The process of randomisation will be clearly conveyed. That is that in accepting the invitation to participate in this study, participants will attend one additional session per week which will provide an opportunity either to socialise with their group or to practice changing the way they think about breathlessness. The intervention offered is predetermined and will not be known by the project officer . The participant will only know which intervention has been allocated after the baseline assessments are completed. Potential participants will not be able to choose the intervention. Regardless of which group the participant is allocated to, all participants will receive the same CPR. Intervention  and schedule will be provided to the participant in sealed envelop.</concealment>
    <sequence>Pre-determined concealed, block randomisation using random numbers tables . Cycles of pulmonary rehabilitation (8 weeks each) are randomised  to either intervention rather than individuals being randomised to intervention or control within each eight week block of pulmonary rehabilitation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For people with chronic lung disease, breathlessness is common, distressing and difficult to relieve. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs have been demonstrated to improve exercise capacity and quality of life. This study will determine whether changing the way people think about the sensation of breathlessness while completing pulmonary rehabilitation, further reduces distress/anxiety and health service use and improve exercise capacity, disability related to breathlessness and quality of life.</summary>
