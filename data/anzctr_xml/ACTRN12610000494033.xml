  <interventions>
    <interventions>One treatment arms. 
Arm 1: Scanning training- 3x per week for 3 weeks, Mobility training- 3 x per week for 4 weeks. All approximately 60 minutes in duration. Scanning training uses a standardised approach to teach a pattern of systematic visual search strategies, using a Neuro Vision Tech (NVT) device. Scanning skills are graded,  in mobility training,  from an environment that is structured and familiar to the patient, into more dynamic busy environemnts including shopping centres.  This will be performed by mobility instructors from a non-governement organisation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive the standard therapy intervention currently available which includes mobility training and occupational therapy intervention that promotes visual scanning and scanning training. The dosage will be recorded. This group will be wait listed for the visual scanning intervention to be offered at the completion of the six month follow up.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mobility Assessment Course (MAC)
The MAC measures the extent to which a person visually scans and identifies hazards when walking. The MAC assesses performance on a mobility course with targets positioned on the walls along the course. Participants are scored on the number of targets they identify and the time taken to complete the course.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 2, 12, 24 following randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual Scanning Analyser (VSA)
The VSA provides a standardized measure of the extent to which a person scans or neglects their visual fields.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 2, 12, 24 weeks following randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rivermead Behavioral Inattention Test
Rivermead Behavioral Inattention Test, is a short screening battery of tests to assess the presence and the extent of visual neglect on a sample of everyday problems faced by patients with visual inattention</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Visual loss following stroke impacts significantly on activities of daily living and is an independent risk factor for becoming dependent. Routinely, allied health clinicians provide training for visual field loss, mainly with eye movement based therapy. The effectiveness of the compensatory approach to rehabilitation remains inconclusive largely due to difficulty in validating functional outcome with the varied type and dosage of therapy received by an individual patient. 

This study aims to determine which treatment is more effective, a standardized dosage approach or individualized therapy in patients with homonymous hemianopia post stroke.</summary>
