  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will receive five days of paracetamol (two 500mg tablets per oral four times a day) and five days of an identical appearing placebo. The primary outcome, pain, will be assessed subjectively by patients completing a daily diary ( of numerical ratings of pain on an 11 point Likert-type scale with values ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (unbearable), for each of the 5 days of both treatments. In addition, the numbers of breakthrough medications used each day will be recorded. Secondary outcomes of subjective ratings of nausea and vomiting, cognitive impairment (drowsiness and unclear thinking), constipation and overall feeling of well-being will also be assessed using 11 point Likert-type scales. A one day washout period dictates that only data from the last four days of each treatment arm will be analysed to exclude the influence of possible carryover effects. 
At the completion of the study patients will be asked to rank their global satisfaction with the two treatments. They will be given the option of continuing with paracetamol and asked the reason for their choice.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Participants will keep a daily diary for the 10 day trial period and record all breakthrough / rescue medications. The mean number of breakthrough medications will be compared across treatment conditions using a paired t-test. 

In addition, differences in rated pain will be further investigated controlling for number of breakthrough medications required. This is to determine whether any differences that may be found in rated pain are maintained when breakthrough medications are held constant and will be analysed in a regression analysis.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is little evidence base to direct physicians as to when to use paracetamol for the management of pain in palliative patients who require opioids. In particular, it is not known whether the addition of eight large paracetamol tablets (4gm) to the daily medications of patients, using low-dose strong opioids, improves pain control or merely adds to patients tablet burden. This study is a double-blind randomised controlled trial, designed to investigate any analgesic benefits of paracetamol for patients using low-dose strong opioids. It requires patients to take either 4gm of paracetamol or placebo in addition to their usual daily opioids for five days and then to swap to placebo or 4gm of paracetamol for the next five days. Patients are asked to complete a daily diary throughout the ten day study period that records subjective
and objective measures of pain control, aspects of common opioid side effects and quality of life. These records will be quantitatively analysed for statistical significance using paired t-test.</summary>
