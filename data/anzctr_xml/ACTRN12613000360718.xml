  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1 (Treatment Arm): Implanted with Subcutaneous Neuromodulation System (SNS) and fitted within 2 weeks of implantation.  The bilateral implantation procedure is done under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting.  Each device takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes per arm.
SNS therapy for hypertension provides electrical stimulation to the median nerve from a small self-contained implant placed in the subcutaneous space over the median nerve in the forearm.  Subjects receive bilateral implants in a simple procedure under local anesthetic.  The implant is programmed in manufacturing to provide once weekly 30 minute stimulation sessions.  In between sessions, the implant is dormant.  The implant is set in manufacturing to provide low rate stimulation.  Amplitude is settable with a programming controller, and is ramped up to the highest comfortable level for the subject during a fitting session that lasts approximately 45 minutes which includes the initial 30 minute therapy session.  The device contains a battery that will operate for approximately2-3 years, before the device requires replacement.  Next generation systems are expected to last 5 years. </interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2(Control Arm): Implanted with Subcutaneous Neuromodulation System and fitted after 6 months of data collection when only treated with drug regimen. The control arm will have the SNS in place but the stimulation will not be activated. Note that they will have a "sham fitting" by the sponsor technician that will allow the subjects and physicians to be blinded.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Interested adults who are known or present at the research site with uncontrolled hypertension may be initially screened for inclusion in the study. Patients’ medical records will be reviewed for inclusion/exclusion criteria. The patient’s medication regimen will also be reviewed.

Patients who initially qualify will be scheduled for a screening visit to assess general health and hypertension.  An in-office blood pressure measured at the screening visit should be taken according to American Heart Association guidelines confirming systolic hypertension of greater than or equal to 140 mmHg.  Patients will also be questioned for inclusion/exclusion criteria in addition to medical record review.  General health to participate in the study we be further evaluated by the investigator at the screening visit.  
The informed consent will be presented to the individual for consideration at the screening visit. The individual will be given adequate time to have all questions answered and to carefully consider participation. If, after understanding the purpose, potential risk, potential benefits, and requirements of the study, as well as his or her rights as a research participant, the individual agrees to participate as evidenced by providing written informed consent, the subject will be enrolled to enter the baseline period.  The subject should be allowed to take informed consent documents home for further consideration, if needed, and scheduled with an additional visit to complete the screening visit.  Informed Consent shall be included in the patient’s medical record file and noted in the screening CRF.  At this time, the subject will be provided and trained to use a 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) and provided a medication log to keep for 2 weeks. Subjects who continue to be eligible after completing baseline will be scheduled for implantation.  Two weeks after implantation, subjects will return for fitting and be randomized into control or treatment groups.  Randomization will be stratified by study center and will be at a 1:1 ratio to treatment or control.  Investigators, medical staff and subjects will not be informed of subjects’ randomization, and thus are blinded.  Randomization will be provided to the programming technician, and marked on the fitting CRF.  This will be placed into a closed envelope for inclusion in the study file, and can be viewed by the study coordinator, programming technician, and study monitors until completion of the subject’s completion of the 3 month follow up (control period).
</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomization will be used to ensure balance in numbers during the trial.  Patients will be divided into blocks per randomization region.  The block sizes and sequences are not delineated in the protocol in order to ensure that there is no selection bias and the blind is maintained.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Efficacy (BP) analyses will be generated for the ITT, PP, Treated and Responder analysis sets, with the analysis on the ITT set being the primary analysis. Safety analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set:

a) Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All randomized patients meeting the inclusion criteria of the study who are not ineligible because of exclusion criteria; this is the primary analysis population for the efficacy analysis on blood pressures. Subjects are analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized.

b) Per-Protocol (PP): The subset of ITT subjects who complete the three months of follow-up and who received the treatment to which they were randomized. Subjects meeting these criteria will be part of the PP population regardless of whether or not they have had medication changes for low BP or high BP.

c) Safety (through three months post-randomization): All subjects randomized to Control and all subjects randomized to Treatment who received electrical stimulation through implantation of the SNS.

d) Treated:  All subjects who received 3 months of electrical stimulation through implantation of the SNS.

e) Responder Subsets:  Subjects who received electrical stimulation through implantation of the SNS and who achieve at least a 10mmHg reduction in office systolic BP from baseline to three or six months post treatment within a treated set.

An apriori analysis of treatment cohort compared with the control as well as the whole subject population assuming an approximate mean differential of 20 mm HG and a standard deviation of 25 yielded a study sample size of approximately 102 to achieve a minimum of 80% power.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypertension is a serious public health issue, affecting approximately 30% of adults.  Hypertension greatly contributes to the risk for heart disease and stroke, both among the top three leading causes of death in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. While most treated individuals with hypertension are controlled on medication, diet and exercise, at least an estimated 12% are resistant to conventional medical intervention.  This study will examine the safety and efficacy of a chronic therapeutic device that is meant to reduce hypertension in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.</summary>
