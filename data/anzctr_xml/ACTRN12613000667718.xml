  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is a psychotherapeutic approach which addresses dysfunctional emotions, maladaptive behaviors and cognitive processes, and contents through a number of goal-oriented, explicit systematic procedures. It will be provided in a group format for some participants, and individually for others (randomly allocated). Eight sessions will be offered, for 2 hours per session, once per week for 8 weeks.
Emotional Freedom Techniques is a form of counseling intervention that draws on various theories of alternative medicine including acupuncture, neuro-linguistic programming, energy medicine, and Thought Field Therapy. It will be provided in a group format for some participants, and individually for others (randomly allocated). Eight sessions will be offered, for 2 hours per session, once per week for 8 weeks. The total duration of the treatments will be 8 weeks. Followup will occur at 3-, 6- and 12-months post treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Community sample of non-depressed adults. A call for community participants will be made through local online noticeboards (e.g. local government) and will require interested participants to anonymously complete assessment measurements for this purpose only. The self report questionnaires will be offered online, and no inducements will be offered. There will be no identifying information required. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decrease in symptoms of depression. This will be done by using the Beck Depression Inventory II (Beck, Ward ,Mendelson Mock,&amp; Erbaugh, 1961) and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale 21 (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1993) - measure will also include the constructs of stress and anxiety which are common co-occuring symptoms with depression. Finally the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) - a short structured clinical interview which enables researchers to make diagnoses of psychiatric disorders according to DSM-IV or ICD-10 - will be used </outcome>
      <timepoint>end of 8-week treatment, and 3- and 6-month followup</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>decrease in co-morbid symptoms.  The Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale 21 (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1993) which includes the constructs of stress and anxiety which are common co-occuring symptoms with depression will be used, as well as the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) - a short structured clinical interview which enables researchers to make diagnoses of coexisting psychiatric disorders according to DSM-IV or ICD-10 - will be used </outcome>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>30 adults in each condition; EFT versus CBT versus community group control. IN order to achieve a large effect, a G*Power analysis indicated 30 people in each condition would suffice.
Analysis will examine pre versus post effects for each intervention to highlight any differences in self report and the clinical interview, and a repeated measures ANOVA/MANOVA will examine the effect of time on all the self report scores and the clinical interview. Due to the suggestion that EFT has lasting effects on other constructs (e.g. food cravings, PTSD), it is hypothesised that depression symptoms will reduce significantly with the EFT intervention and remain consistent at follow-up points. The CBT intervention as a gold standard may also experience decreases in depression symptoms but its comparison to EFT has not yet been studied. The differences between conditions will be examined at all follow-up points. It is expected that the control group condition will remain unaffected. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is one of the most common of all mental health problems and one in five people experience depression at some stage of their lives. A review by the National Institutes of Health found that some 20% of adolescents suffer from bouts of anxiety and depression before they reach adulthood. EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) has been shown to be efficacious for depression in a number of studies, including three randomized controlled trials. EFT contains elements of both exposure and cognitive therapy but to these established methods, adds the novel element of somatic stimulation. It has been found to have physiological mechanisms consistent with a lowering of the stress response, and a calming of the threat-assessment structures in the midbrain. These include a reduction in the bodys secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol, an increase in endogenous opioids, and a dampening of fear in the amygdala. This present study intends to compare the EFT treatment to a gold standard therapy for depression; Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), and a community control group. Understanding and improving the early intervention and treatment of depression and improving the health and quality of life for those with depression is critical to inform best practice.
Hypotheses will include:

1.	The EFT group treatment conditions will have significantly decreased scores on depression measures from pre- to post treatment, and will be significantly improved compared to the community control group
2.	It is expected the CBT group will also have significantly decreased scores on depression measures from pre- to post treatment, and will be significantly improved compared to the community control group, but that the EFT condition may be superior
