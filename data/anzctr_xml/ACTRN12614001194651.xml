The two groups were compared by Student t-test or Fishers exact test for qualitative variables. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Liver biopsy is an important procedure for the diagnosis and evaluation of liver disease and it can be associated with pain. For years this procedure was performed in Dunedin hospital without Pethidine give prior to the investigation. Two years ago we started giving pethidine immediately before a liver biopsy was performed. This was done to potentially decrease the amount of pain-relief required following the procedure. A recent analysis of our data indicated that this was indeed the case however, an unknown number of patients might have been given Pethidine unnecessarily because they never experienced any pain after the procedure. With this study we would like to assess how effective pre-procedural Pethidine is in controlling pain and anxiety during and after the procedure. </summary>
