    <interventions>Intervention (Arm - 1) - Hospital Inpatient Rehabilitation followed by a Monitored HOme-based programme (HI)

Comparator (Arm - 2) - Standard treatment which is a Monitored HOme-based programme (HO)

Participants will have their elective total hip replacement surgery in an acute hospital.They will be reviewed by the treating team and if assessed as able to be discharged home they will be randomly allocated to one of the two arms of the study.

Those allocated to HI will be admitted to a rehabilitation hospital for 10 days. They will receive supervised physiotherapy comprising of 1-1.5 hours of one:one therapy plus 1-1.5 hours of class based exercises, a total of 2-3hours, Monday through Friday. They will receive 1-1.5 hours of one:one therapy on Saturday and Sunday. The inpatient rehabilitation programme combines general aerobic and functional exercises combined with muscle-specific exercises that focus on lower limb strengthening, joint range of motion, neuromuscular coordination and restoration of a normal gait pattern.

After discharge from the inpatient unit participants will attend the monitored group exercise sessions as per HO (below) for monitoring and progression of the programme. 
  
All participants will be required to complete a diary detailing the programme adherence, health care utilisation, health expenditure and social costs related to carer burden. 

An additional Functional Independence Measure (FIM) will be recorded for this arm on admission and discharge from the inpatient unit.


</interventions>
    <comparator>The Comparator - (Arm - 2) Monitored HOme-based programme (HO)

The HO will be based on the standard care in the local health district and on guidelines for exercises in the elderly and those with osteoarthritis. Prior to discharge from the acute hospital the particpants will be familiarised with a sheet of simple exercises to perform at home. Three weeks after surgery they will attend a group exercise session at their local physiotherapy department and receive instruction on the home-based exercise programme. 
The programme comprises general aerobic components as well as general functional and muscle specific exercises focused on restoring hip mobility, lower limb strength, normal neuromuscular co-ordination and gait patterns. Participants are instructed to perform the exercises, unsupervised at home, at least four days per week, for around forty minutes. They are expected to attend two group classes from the third to tenth week.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Walking distance at 26 weeks after surgery, as measured by the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). In comparison to the 6MWT pre-surgery.

The 6MWT is a measure of functional mobility and is influenced by multiple factors, such as pain, lower limb strength and joint mobility which are altered by total hip surgery. The intervention of rehabilitation aims to address these factors and improve the recipient's ability to walk. The 6MWT is highly reproducible within the individual and is likely to be less susceptible to misinterpretation, cultural sensitivity or be prone to the floor or ceiling effects that are associated with some patient reported outcomes. In addition, the use of this observer-rated outcome is less likely than a patient rated-outcome measure to be influenced by patient preference which is a feature of studies where the intervention cannot be blinded from recipient.</outcome>

    <sequence>Participants will be randomised to one of the two arms using the method of minimisation stratified for variables that affect primary outcome. The variables are; age (less than or equal to 65 years and greater than 65 years), height (less than or equal to 163cm and greater than 163cm) and gender.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Individuals who are eligible for the study but decline randomisation will be asked to join an observational arm. This group of participants will receive standard care; that is they will receive the monitored home-based therapy programme by choice. They will be assessed pre-surgery in the same way as the participants in the HI and HO groups. They will be assessed at 26 weeks for the primary and secondary outcomes as listed previously for the HI and HO groups.
The results of the two nested studies looking at the Minimal Important Change (MIC) of the 6MWT and the parameters of the IBMAT will be reported separately to the results of the main HIHO 2 Study.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary end point is functional mobility at 26 weeks post-surgery, measured using the 6MWT. 28 participants in each group (total of 56) will provide 80% power at a significance level of 5%, to detect a superior improvement in walking distance of 67m in the HI group. Allowing for a drop out rate of 10%, 64 participants will be required. The superiority margin of 67m equates to a moderate to large effect size (0.75 SD) based on a SD of 89m for the 6MWT in THA patients 26 weeks after surgery. (Ref. Vissers MM, BussmannJB, deGroot IB, Verhaar JAN, Reijman M. Physical functioning four years after total hip or knee arthroplasty. Gait Posture 2013;38:310-315)

Mean (Standard Deviation[SD]), median (Interquartile Range[IQR]) and percentages will be used to describe the characteristics of the study groups. Data analysis will be completed using the principle of intention to treat (ITT). Analysis of covariance will be used for the primary outcome, with treatment group as the main study factor and walking distance at baseline, gender, height, presence of other lower limb or back conditions limiting mobility and patient preference as covariates. 
For the continuous secondary outcome variables measured at multiple time-points, mixed model analysis will be used to compare rates of recovery in these variables across time.
Independent T-tests, tests of medians, nonparametric tests and chi-squared tests will be used to compare satisfaction with rehabilitation, surgical outcome, return to work data and adverse-event-related data between the two randomised groups as appropriate.
If superiority of the inpatient intervention is shown, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken incorporating patient health service utilisation and Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) based on EQ5D utility calculations.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is a recognised treatment in Australia and internationally for people with disabling, painful hips. THA patients participate in number of models of rehabilitation, including; inpatient, outpatient and domiciliary programmes. To date there is no definitive evidence to support one model over another. Inpatient rehabilitation is far costlier than outpatient or domiciliary programmes. If the cost is to be justified we argue that the functional outcomes from inpatient rehabilitation should be superior to alternative programmes.
HIHO 2 aims to compare the functional outcomes of individuals who undergo THA and then receive inpatient rehabilitation plus a home-based programme with individuals who receive a  home-based programme alone (standard treatment).
Eligible participants are people undergoing a planned, hip replacement, on one side (first time on that side). They must be able to read English and follow instructions for hospital and home-based programmes. Those who are eligible but decline randomisation will be asked to join the observational arm which receives a home-based programme (standard treatment).
HO-Group (Home-based) - 2 -5 days after surgery a physiotherapist will instruct the participants on exercises to be preformed, unsupervised at home. The participants will attend group exercise sessions in the local outpatient department. On their first visit, 3 weeks after surgery, they will rehearse exercises to perform at home and receive a personalised instruction booklet. They will attend 1 or 2 sessions to advance the exercises tailored to their individual needs. The participants continue to preform the exercises at home, between group sessions. The last session is at 10 weeks after surgery.

HI - Group (Hospital Inpatient followed by home-based) - individuals will be admitted to Braeside Hospital Rehabilitation Ward for 10 days of inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation comprising of 2-3 hours of individual and group based exercises per day. After leaving the rehabilitation hospital, these participants will follow the home-based programme as outlined above.

The baseline characteristics recorded pre-operatively are ; age, gender, height, weight, other health problems and education level. The main outcome is the distance walked in six minutes, 26 weeks after surgery. 
Secondary outcomes will be patient reports of function, pain, quality of life, patient preference for and satisfaction with the type of rehabilitation, satisfaction with surgical outcome and their perceived change in distance walked. Measurements will be taken prior to surgery and at 3, 10, 26 and 52 weeks after surgery. 
Nested studies will examine the minimal important change for the 6MWT and the parameters of a functional mobility tool (IBMAT). The intention is to published these separately to the HIHO 2 study.
