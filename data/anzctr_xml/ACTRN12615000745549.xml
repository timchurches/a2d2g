  <interventions>
    <interventions>An intranasal lacrimal neurostimulator is a device (based on a standard TENS machine) used to deliver tiny electrical currents to the inner cavity of the nose, gently activating the nerves. Participants are instructed to place the tips of the device into both nostrils simultaneously.  Nasoneurostimulation intensity is applied and controlled by pressing the plus (+) or minus (-) buttons on the device.  Neurostimulation is applied for up to three minutes, until it can be felt that the eyes are watering and welling up (reflex tearing).  The location of neurostimulation can be controlled by the depth and angle of insertion until atickle sensation is experienced.  Neurostimulation can be ceased by pressing the minus button on the device or by withdrawing the device from the nostrils. The device is applied 4 times daily (early morning, around lunchtime, late afternoon and before retiring to bed).  This will occur for 5 consecutive days in week 1 or week 2 of the trial (Monday to Friday).  The intervening two days (of the weekend) will serve as a wash-out period, during which contact lenses are not worn and the device is not applied.  Adherence is monitored via text or email submissions daily from the participants.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nasal neurostimulation has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective method for increasing tear flow in individuals with dry eye due to decreased lacrimal gland function.  The aim of this study is to determine whether nasal neurostimulation can increase the number of hours or wear and/or the number of hours of comfortable wear, with decreased dependency on artificial tear supplementation.</summary>
