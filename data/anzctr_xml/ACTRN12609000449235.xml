  <interventions>
    <interventions>Suicide prevention websites will be scored for quality of information about how to help someone who is suicidal, using a 26-item checklist titled Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviours: First Aid Guidelines (Kelly, Jorm, Kitchener &amp; Langlands, 2008). These guidelines were developed using the Delphi methodology whereby a consensus was reached by a panel of experts, to produce guidelines to encourage a suicidal individual to seek professional help or decide against suicide. Website administrators will be emailed a letter giving detailed scoring of their website (on a scale from 0 - 26) and the 26-item checklist, which they can use to improve the content of their own website. An article about how the Guidelines were produced and an Information Sheet about the website evaluation research project will also be included. Scoring will take place at baseline date (pre-test) and 6 months after baseline date (post-test).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control condition will be no feedback to website administrators (i.e. no treatment given).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the content of suicide website quality measured against a 26-item checklist based on document: Suicidal thoughts and behaviours: first aid guidlines (Kelly et al., 2008). Each item in the checklist will be scored 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether or not a particular action is recommended on the website.</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>Websites will comprise teh top 52 English-language websites from a Google Australia search with the terms "help suicide" on 6 Nov 2008.

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Websites will be selected and scored for quality by two researchers, who will provide the Principal Investigator with website IDs numbered from 1 to 52 and their quality scores (the Principal Investigator will be responsible for sending out the feedback letters containing the quality scores and guidelines for improvement). A list of ID numbers from 1 - 52 will be given to a third researcher who is offsite, to determine the allocation schedule.</concealment>
    <sequence>One of the two researchers who scored the websites for quality will provide a list of website IDs numbered from 1 to 52, to a third researcher who is off-site and not involved in the scoring. A restricted randomization will be conducted using a Sequence Generator from the Random.org website, to randomly order the IDs. The first 26 IDs will be in the feedback group and the second 26 in the control group. This will ensure that the two groups have the same sample size.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Data will be analysed using a 2X2 analysis of variance, where the factors are group (feedback or control) and time (pre or post). No missing data are expected. However, if a website were to cease to exist, an intention to treat approach would be used, using data imputation for the missing score.</designfeatures>
