  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty five subjects with diabetic foot ulcer will be treated fortnightly with standard 20-minute wound care (debridement and normal saline dressing) first, to be followed by 40 minutes of electromagnetic stimulator therapy for a period of 6 weeks. An electromagnetic stimulator probe will be applied gently against the ulcer surface by treating podiatrist to deliver 150 V, 100 micro, 100 Hz during which the participant may feel light vibration and then crossover for another 6 weeks on fortnightly standard 20-minute wound care alone with total duration of the study period of 12 weeks. Log of device use time will be utilized to monitor adherence of the electromagnetic stimulator therapy.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complete or partial foot ulcer healing to be assessed fortnightly using specialized 3-D camera. An ulcer is considered completely healed when it is fully covered by epithelial regeneration and remained so until the next visit in the study. Partially healed ulcer is defined as any reduction in ulcer surface area during the period of the study.

The other group will have first 6 weeks of standard care alone to be followed by 6 weeks of both electromagnetic stimulator therapy and standard care. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>All data elements recorded during the study period will be entered and validated in Microsoft Excel. The time to complete ulcer healing will be measured as the number of days from the start of treatment to the date in which each patient achieves complete wound healing. The comparison between the two treatment groups will be made as the proportion of patients (%) who reached target healing of their ulcers at the end of the study. The time to complete healing and the index of re-epithelization of the wound area will be compared between the two groups. The data will be analysed using SPSS Version 22. Tests for normality will be performed and based on the outcome, parametric or nonparametric tests will be employed to determine the differences between the groups. The results will be given as mean + standard deviation.  Chi-squared analysis will be performed for categorical variables and student t test or Mann Whitney U test will be carried out for continuous variables for parametric or non-parametric data respectively. Where appropriate logistic regression will be employed to determine factors contributing to ulcer healing and to validate the effectives of intervention of electromagnetic stimulator therapy. Confounding factors will be taken into consideration for data analysis to avoid misinterpreting the data. A p value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Electromagnetic stimulator therapy (EMST) is a new technology in the care of chronic non-healing wounds [1]. The technology delivers high-energy pressure waves into the wound by enriching the ulcer with adequate blood through formation of new blood vessels. It also stimulates the body to produce natural growth factors which helps in repairing the damaged tissues of the wound [2].  Recently, EMST was reported to be effective in the initiation and acceleration of wound healing in various non-diabetic clinical settings most part involves small case series of bed sores and venous ulcers with scanty reports on diabetic wounds [1-2]. Thus, there is very little information on effect of electromagnetic stimulation in healing ulcers of diabetic foot.  With our earlier report of high rate of diabetic limb amputations in our local population [3-4] we believe EMST technology may have a role to play in the care of our patients.  This technology is simple and can be administered fortnightly as against daily administration in other form of therapies. The treatment with EMST is a non-invasive method and easily tolerated by patients. It is applied through an unfocused applicator which assures an almost painless treatment and no anaesthesia required. Each therapy session only takes about 15 to 60 minutes. As EMST being a viable option of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) care in our high risk diabetic population yet there is no study to show EMST usefulness in treatment of non-healing DFU in Australia. It would be interesting to find out if this technology would change our current daily diabetic foot ulcer care practice for the betterment of the most costly diabetic complications -DFU. 
The main objective of the study was to evaluate the healing rates of chronic diabetic foot ulcers during a 12-week period in patients treated with EMST and usual care compared to usual care alone.
