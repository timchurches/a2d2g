  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study will be randomised with 2 parallel treatment arms and separate control groups. 
Patients 60years of age or older admitted with MI (ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction(STEMI), Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction(NSTEMI)), normal or mildly abnormal LVEF &gt;40%, elevated Left Ventricle End Systolic Volume Index (LVESVI) &gt;30ml/m2 or Left Ventricle End Diastolic Volume Index (LVEDVI)&gt;75ml/m2 (10) and serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) level &gt;100ng/l measured 2 weeks after the event will be randomised to:
Group A - intensive therapy arm
Group B - usual therapy arm.
Patients in the intensive arm will receive appropriate oral treatment including combination of: a beta blocker (one item from the list see below) , an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)inhibitor or (an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) if contraindicated) (one item from the list see below) and an Angiotensin Antagonist (one item from the list see below). The choice of the drugs from the list will be at the discretion of the prescribing physician. The duration of treatment will be 12 months. 
The dose of beta blocker will be titrated to the highest tolerated by the patient (at least 50% target dose).
Medications list and Dosing Targets (50% dose - target dose)

    <concealment>Patients 60 years of age or older admitted to Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) with acute MI (STEMI, NSTEMI) and no identifiable exclusions criteria will be approached. If they agree to attend an initial visit (V0) they will be given information and consent forms. 
Initial visit (V0)
During initial visit all patient concerns/questions regarding the study will be addressed. Consent form will be signed. An entry echocardiography (2D/3D) will be performed. A blood sample for BNP level and Urea and Electrolytes (U&amp;Es)will also be drawn. QOL questionnaire will be completed.
Randomisation visit (V1)
Providing that they meet the study entry criteria patients will be randomly allocated to the intensive or usual medical treatment arms. The on site study coordinator will prepare sealed opaque envelopes with the allocation number (1- intensive, 2- usual therapy).</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation will follow a random number of the study subject generation performed by our study coordinator.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Both study and control group will include even numbers of patients treated with initial invasive strategy (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG),Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)) or medical treatment only. 
Randomisation will be controlled to ensure even distribution between the study arms of patients treated with either initial strategies</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart failure is a deadly condition with a 5 year survival rates of 35% following index admission, exceeding the rate of many cancers
Population based study in elderly patients (&gt;65 years of age) indicates that among Heart Attack survivors over 70% patients develop heart failure by 5 years, more than 60% of which occurs in the first year. Currently there are no sufficient data to support an intensive medical treatment  in patients after heart attack with normal or only mildly abnormal heart function. 
We hypothesize that an optimised medical treatment in patients with initial normal or mild heart dysfunction but elevated Left Ventricle size (volumes) and serum cardiac hormone levels (BNP) as markers of heart remodelling (progressive weakening) may reduce the progression of the disease, delay the onset of heart failure and ultimately reduce the risk of death.</summary>
