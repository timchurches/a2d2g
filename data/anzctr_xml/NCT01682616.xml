  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - ABT-199
Treatment: drugs - Rituximab

Experimental: Arm 1 - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)


Treatment: drugs: ABT-199
ABT-199 is taken continuously once daily. This is a dose escalation study, therefore the dose of ABT-199 will change throughout the study.

Treatment: drugs: Rituximab
Rituximab will be given by intravenous infusion on day 1 of Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. May be reinitiated for an additional 6 months.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and Recommended Phase Two Dose of ABT-199 when administered in combination with rituximab (R) in subjects with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma. - Protocol-defined events, which are attributed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the administration of ABT-199 and/or rituximab, or can not be attributed by the investigator to a clearly identifiable cause such as tumor progression, concurrent illness, underlying disease or concomitant medication, will be considered a dose limiting toxicity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuous dosing at designated dose level up to Month 6. At end of combination treatment, ABT-199 monotherapy may continue up to 4 years following the date of the last subject enrolled. If disease progression occurs, subjects may re-initiate ABT-199.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the exploratory efficacy of the combination ABT-199 and rituximab. - Tumor response or clinical disease progression (ORR, DOR, TTP, PFS, OS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumor Assessments will be performed at: Screening, Day 1 on Months 1, 3, 7, and then every 3 months thereafter. In addition, tumor assessment will be performed at least 2 months after Cr or CRi.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of peak concentration (Cmax), trough concentration (Ctrough) and/or area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of ABT-199 and/or Rituximab. - Blood samples for analysis of ABT-199 and rituximab will be collected at designated time points.</outcome>
      <timepoint>PK samples collected up to Month 6 for ABT-199 and Rituximab. Re-initiated subjects have PK samples collected on Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 3, Day 1 of Months 1 and 4.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of
      ABT-199 in combination with rituximab in up to 50 subjects with Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. The primary objectives of this study are to assess
      the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and establish the Recommended
      Phase Two Dose of ABT-199 when administered in combination with rituximab. The dose
      escalation portion of the study will include approximately 30 subjects. Once the recommended
      phase two dose and schedule have been determined, up to 20 additional subjects will be
      enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the study. Subjects who meet criteria for CR, CRi,
      or MRD-negative PR during the study may discontinue ABT 199. If disease progression occurs,
      as defined by iwCLL NCI/WG criteria for tumor response, subjects may re-initiate ABT-199.</summary>
