  <interventions>
    <interventions>Site One
Three doses will be given; the first will be given at 6-12mths post transplant for bone marrow transplant patients and pre-transplant for liver transplant patients. Patients with Inflammatory bowel disease will receive it at enrolment. The second vaccination will be given in 2 months post the first vaccination. The third dose will be 4 months post the second visit (6 months from the first vaccine). 


Site Two
Three doses will be given, the first will be given at enrolment for patients with rheumatic disease such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The second vaccination will be given in 2 months post the first vaccination. The third dose will be 4 months post the second visit (6 months from the first vaccine). 

At both sites
The vaccines will be given in the non-dominant arm by a trained and experienced paediatric immunisation nurse Dose: Three 0.5 mL doses of Gardasil (registered product)</interventions>

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>Reactogenicity
Measuring Instruments: The subject or carer will be given diary card, a digital thermometer, and ruler. The nurse will provide instructions on how to use the thermometer and how to record any local or systemic reactions on the diary.  
Study nurses will complete an adverse event questionnaire by telephone on day 1 and day 7. Any medical consultations, medications taken and hospitalisations will be ascertained at 3 months, 6 months (follow up visit), 9 months and 12 months (follow up visit)</outcome>
      <timepoint>6- monthly intervals for the first 2 years and every 12 months for the following 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of immunity
Measuring Instruments:  Serological immunity to HPV serotypes in the vaccine at baseline and according to the listed schedule.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6- monthly intervals for the first 2 years and every 12 months for the following 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Immunogenicity
Measuring Instruments: Serological immunity to HPV serotypes in the vaccine at baseline and according to the listed schedule. Serum anti-HPV 16/18 antibody levels will be measured using a Luminex immunoassay. Antibody titres will be determined in a competitive format, where known, type-specific, phycoerythrin-labeled, neutralizing antibodies compete with patient serum antibodies for binding to conformationally sensitive, neutralizing epitopes on the virus like particles (VLPs). The monoclonal antibodies to be used in the HPV cLIA include H16.V5 for HPV 16 and H18.J4 for HPV 18.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6- monthly intervals for the first 2 years and every 12 months for the following 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Immunogenicity to other vaccinations administered- pneumococcal, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, polio and meningococcal. There are limited data on response to these vaccines in immunosuppressed populations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Genital HPV is the necessary cause for cervical cancer, as well as a major contributing cause of several other cancers and conditions. There are now effective vaccines against the main oncogenic HPV types, HPV16 and 18; most research and discussion has focussed around targeting the vaccine to young women and older adolescents. Based on this, a national free HPV vaccination program for adolescent girls will commence in 2007. There is no research on the use of this vaccine in immunosuppressed. Therefore, information on the immunogenicity, safety and duration of efficacy of HPV vaccine when administered to immunosuppressed children is needed.</summary>
