  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease (MCI-AD) for placebo-treated, high-risk, non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian subjects versus placebo-treated, low-risk, non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian subjects - A test from a Cox proportional hazards survival model will be used to compare data from non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasians in the (placebo-treated) low-risk group (ie, the combined placebo groups) with data from non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasians in the placebo-treated subjects in the high-risk group. The event in this analysis will be the diagnosis of cognitive impairment. If this test is significant at the 0.01 level, it can be concluded that the diagnostic prognostic test has differentiated between subjects at low and high risk of being diagnosed with cognitive impairment within 5 years of taking the test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to end of study, anticipated to be about 5 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to diagnosis of MCI due to AD for pioglitazone-treated, non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian subjects versus placebo-treated non-Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian subjects in the high-risk stratum - A test from a Cox proportional hazards survival model will be used to compare data from non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasians in the (placebo-treated) low-risk group (ie, the combined placebo groups) with data from non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasians in the placebo-treated subjects in the high-risk group. The event in this analysis will be the diagnosis of cognitive impairment. If this test is significant at the 0.01 level, it can be concluded that the diagnostic prognostic test has differentiated between subjects at low and high risk of being diagnosed with cognitive impairment within 5 years of taking the test.
If this test is significant at the 0.01 level, it can be concluded that active treatment has delayed the development of cognitive impairment within the 5-year period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to end of study, anticipated to be about 5 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline for cognitive decline on composite score on the cognitive test battery for pioglitazone-treated subjects versus placebo-treated subjects in the high-risk stratum - Composite scores will be derived from the test battery. Only the domains of episodic memory, executive function, language, and attention will be used for the composite score. To form the composite, z-scores will be calculated for each test, each z-score for the domain will be averaged, and then all relevant domains will be averaged to form the composite.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in instrumental activities of daily living (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living - Prevention Instrument [ADCS ADL-PI]) between pioglitazone-treated and placebo-treated groups of the high-risk stratum - Self assessment of memory function will be obtained using the ADCS Prevention Instrument Project- Mail In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument. This is a 14-item self administered yes/no questionnaire to assess recent changes (over the last year) in cognition and functional activities which commonly are affected in the development of MCI.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to qualify the biomarker risk algorithm for prognosis of the
      risk of developing Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease (MCI-AD), and also to
      evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone compared with placebo to delay the onset of MCI-AD in
      cognitively-normal participants who are at high-risk for developing MCI within 5 years.</summary>
