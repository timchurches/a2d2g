  <interventions>
    <interventions>Suitable participants will receive a 7 day course of Curcumin and an 8 day course of over the counter Vitamin E 500IU (taken as one capsule once per day)

Curcumin will be supplied in the form of Longvida (Registered Trademark) sachets. Participants will take 20 grams of Longvida (Registered Trademark) each morning before breakfast for 7 days. This is equivalent to taking 4 grams of Curcumin per day. The sachets may be mixed with a low-lactose drink (supplied). Longvida, (Registered Trademark), is currently not registered for this indication in Australia and is therefore considered an investigational or experimental product. 

At each clinic visit, participants will have a blood test and have photos taken of their eye retina's. To take the photos, pupil dilating eye drops will be instilled into the eyes. Photos will be taken with a scanning laser opthalmoscope. 

In addition, participants will be asked to complete a medication diary during the course of the Curcumin/Vitamin E to record all the medication intake. All Curcumin and Vitamin E containers should be returned to the clinic even if they are empty.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint is to investigate whether retinal amyloid plaques are evident in a younger control cohort, utilizing a retinal imaging system and curcumin labeling in participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be screened for the presence or absence of retinal amyloid plaques after 7 days of taking the investigational product. Baseline images will be collected at day 0, then more images taken after 7 days of curcumin dosing.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second objective is to compare retinal Amyloid Beta protein plaque burden with brain Amyloid Beta protein plaque burden.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Comparison will be made between the retinal images (day 7) and the participant's most recent PET scan (PET scan will be conducted as part of the AIBL study). The AIBL study is not registered</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of other parameters on the retina-brain amyloid association, including ocular history, blood pharmacokinetics, demographics, and APOE genotype. Participant's details regarding demographics and ocular hsitory will be collected by interview with a study doctor at visit 1 (day 0). APOE gentoype information was collected in the AIBL study from a blood test. Pharmacokinetic information will be obtained from the blood tests conducted during this study with blood collection occurring at day 0 (visit 1) and day 7 (visit 2)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Details of other parameters will be collected at visit 1 (day 0, also known as baseline) and visit 2 (after 7 days of curcumin dosing) of this study. APOE gentoype information and brain plaque burden is collected during the course of the AIBL study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>1.	The participant has advanced retinal disease, advanced cataracts or other advanced ocular conditions that in the opinion of the investigator are likely to affect obtaining clear images of the retina. 
2. 	Participant has had prior ocular surgery within 2 months of planned retinal imaging, or is still taking post-operative ocular medications at first day of retinal imaging.
3. 	Participants with known current gallstones. 
4. 	Participants who have undergone angioplasty in the last 3 months. 
5	Participants who have had major surgery within 4 weeks of trial inclusion or planned surgical procedure during the trial period.
6. 	Significant haemorrhagic event (in past 12 months) or cardiovascular disease (ie, history of myocardial infarction within past 6 months of trial inclusion , congestive cardiac failure NYHA grade II ). 
7.	Participant with retinitis pigmentosa. 
8. 	Participants with current bile duct obstruction (participants who have undergone a cholecystectomy will be considered eligible).
9. 	Participants with significant uncontrolled gastrointestinal disorders (including stomach ulcers and uncontrolled hyperacidity disorders) which in the opinion of the investigator will be aggravated by the intake of curcumin. 
10. 	Participants with known allergy to Tropicamide eye drops, vitamin E or turmeric
11. 	Women who are of child bearing potential who do not agree to use reliable contraception from day 0 until at least 6 weeks after the last study drug administration. Pregnant or lactating females are not eligible. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done prior to commencing study drug.
12.	Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to visit one (with the exception of the AIBL trial and behavioural interventions). Participants enrolled in clinical trials involving vitamins, herbal or dietary products may be eligible on a case-by-case following discussion with the medical monitor.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alzheimer's Disease is characterised by the presence of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. More recently, it has been proposed that these plaques may first appear in the retina, at the back of the eye before the plaques are detectable in the brain.

Curcumin, found in the spice Tumeric, is a food additive that has molecular and optical properties that enhance the ability of the image amyloid plaques in the retina. Participants will be asked to have a eye imaging done before and after taking curcumin for 7 days.

The presence/absence of plaques in the eye's retina will be correlated with the results obtained from participation in the AIBL study.  </summary>
