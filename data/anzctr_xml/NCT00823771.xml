  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study assessing the role of the general practitioner in performing follow-up
      reviews on men who have recently completed radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer. This
      will be measured primarily by assessing any changes to the patient's health-related quality
      of life which will be evaluated by the completion of questionnaires by the participant at
      each review visit. The study aims to confirm that patient outcome is identical, independent
      of whether follow-up is performed by a specialist or the patient's General Practitioner.</summary>
