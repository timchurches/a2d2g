    <studytitle>A 2-year, multi-centre double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to determine in men with total testosterone equal to or less than 14nmol/L the efficacy of testosterone treatment together with a lifestyle program in comparison to a lifestyle program alone, to normalise glucose tolerance in those with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or prevent progression to T2DM in those with pre-diabetes.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Will testosterone treatment in combination with a lifestyle program normalise glucose tolerance in men with either pre-diabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, in comparison to placebo and a lifestyle program?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Testosterone treatment comprising 1000mg testosterone undecanoate administered by intramuscular injection at enrolment, 6 weeks and subsequently at 3-monthly intervals for 2-4 years. The trial will have 2 years of recruitment and then a further 2 years of treatment and follow-up. In general, each individual's treatment duration will be determined by when in the recruitment period they join the study. Weight Watchers membership. Weight Watchers is a lifestyle program which involves face-to-face meetings and/or access to the on-line program. It provides guidance on healthly eating and exercise. Participants who choose the meeting option will be requested to attend a weekly meeting. The program also involves diarising of food intake and exercise. Weight Watchers membership will start at enrolment and last for 2 years. Participants will be encouraged to participate in this program and will be asked about their compliance at each study visit. Study visits occur at 6 weeks after enrolment and then every 3 months for 2 to 4 years as described above. For more details see www.t4dm.org.au
T4Bone sub-study: Up to 160 participants enrolled at Austin Hospital will have additional CT scan, DEXA scan and blood sample taken every 12 months for two years to assess the impact of the testosterone intervention on bone density, microarchitecture and turnover.
T4Mood and Behaviour (T4MB)sub-study: All T4DM participants from Fiona Stanley Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Austin Hospital and Princess Alexandra Hospital are also enrolled onto the T4MB substudy. This sub-study involves completion of a one-page questionnaire at baseline and every 6 months until 3 months after treatment end.
Reminder sub-study: Up to 540 men who are registered for the T4DM study but do not attend for lab screening within 4 weeks of registration will be randomised to receive a reminder to attend for lab screening by either text message or phone call. A further reminder at 8 weeks will be sent if they have still not attended for lab screening.
Screening process evaluation sub-study: Prospective participants of the T4DM study will be invited to take part in the screening process evaluation sub-study. Participants will be eligible to take part if the they are enrolled in the main study or decline the main study from June - December 2016. Participants who have not completed lab screening at the close of recruitment in December 2016 will also be eligible. Participation in the sub-study will involve completion of a 5-10 minute online questionnaire followed by a 10 minute telephone interview for a sub-group of participants. The sub-group will be selected based on willingness and principles of theoretical sampling. The online questionnaire and phone interviews will collect information participants preferences and feedback with regards to the screening process for the T4DM study.
T4DM Run-off sub-study: Up to 700 participants who are enrolled on the T4DM study and have completed study treatment after January 2015 will attend for 7 visits after completing study treatment. This sub-study involves completion of quality of life questionnaires, collection of serum and whole blood samples and assessment of weight and concomitant medications.</interventions>
