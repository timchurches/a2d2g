  <interventions>
    <interventions>A diet higher in fish. Participants will substitute their usual meat meals with study food provided on four occasions each week. Study food comprises of a variety of Australian fish and fish products (raw and processed) and provides at least 200mg per day of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) on average. Participants will be advised to maintain their usual diet throughout the study period except for the four replacement meals and to avoid foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Duration of intervention is 8 weeks with a 2-week run-in period.</interventions>
    <comparator>A typical Australian diet higher in meat. Participants will substitute their usual meat meals with study food provided on four occasions each week. Study food comprises of a variety of raw and processed meat products which are matched as closely as feasible in energy, fat, protein and salt contents to the intervention study food. Participants will be advised to maintain their usual diet throughout the study period except for the four replacement meals and to avoid foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Duration of the study is 8 weeks with a 2-week run-in period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies have shown that adequate maternal docosahexanoic acid (DHA) intake during pregnancy is an important factor for optimal development of the foetus. Fish is a good source of DHA, however, its intake in Australian women is generally low and well below recommendation. This 8-week study aims to determine if a diet higher in fish (providing an average of at least 200mg of DHA/day) obtained from consuming Australian fish 4 times a week can improve health-related bio-makers and outcomes (e.g. erythrocytes membrane n-3 concentrations, lipids, inflammatory markers, depression score) without compromising iron nutriture when compared to a typical Australian diet that is generally low in fish and higher in meat. This study will also predict the blood level of mercury if the higher fish dietary pattern was to be maintained long term.</summary>
