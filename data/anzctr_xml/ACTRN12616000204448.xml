    <scientifictitle>A pragmatic, multi-centre, parallel design (1:1:1), open, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a simple short message service (sms) vs tailored sms and home visiting compared to usual parent/carer practice to improve the uptake and timeliness of the primary immunisation series in children aged less than 2 years </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention Group A: a simple reminder sms will be sent once a fortnight starting 2 weeks before until 2 weeks following each milestone due date at 8, 16 and 24 weeks of age. All children not up to date at the 28-week timepoint will have a home visit to complete the primary series.

Intervention Group B: a tailored sms with an educational message will be sent 2 weeks before and the week of the milestone due date. Children not immunised by 2 weeks following the due date will receive a home visit. Tailoring of the message will include a personal reference reference to the parent and child, his/her vaccines due, why it is important to get the vaccines and to be on time (educational component) and information on who to contact to schedule an appoinment. Information about access to transport services will also be provided.

Adherence in both arms will be monitored by recording receipt and opening of sms messages and recording whether a response to the text message was received (response received yes or no).

    <comparator>The control group will be according to the routine pathway parents/carers following with respect to immunising their children. This may include reminders from health service providers and this will be accounted for in the analyses. </comparator>

Codes will be concealed in opaque envelopes that have been prepared by two personnel who will have no contact with study participants and will not be involved in any participant assessments or data collection. At the time of randomisation, staff will contact the study coordinator with the child’s and parent’s details and the next consecutive envelope in that stratum will be selected and opened to allocate the child to a study arm according to the allocation code.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Limited disclosure to participants
To reduce the potential for selection bias and differential reporting behaviours according to knowing about the potential for home-visiting for the immunisation of their infant, parents will not be informed of the detail of the RCT component of the study at enrolment. They will be informed the study will follow children to evaluate immunisation uptake and timeliness and that at various timepoints parents may receive either electronic or verbal reminders that their infants immunisations are due. Limited disclosure involving active concealment to participants is consistent with the NHMRC National Statement if participants will not be exposed to an increased risk of harm and a full explanation of the study aims is provided to participants at the end of the study. We are aiming to encourage parents to take the initiative with respect to vaccinating their child. If they were aware a home visit may occur, particularly for those not in the intensive intervention arm, parents may delay immunising their child until such as time as a home visit would be implemented. This would be both ethically unacceptable and pose a risk to the child.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size 
Our sample size calculations were based on existing data from a cohort of children at one of the study sites that indicated 47% of children were overdue for their primary immunisation series at 7 months of age. 

We are planning a three-armed study with 104 weeks accrual time and 28 weeks follow-up in the cohort. There are no existing data in this population with which inform the potential effect size we may observe. 142 children per group will be required to detect a hazard rate ratio (HRR) for failure to be age-appropriately immunised at 28 weeks of age of 1.4 in the control group compared to the intensive intervention arm with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05. Accounting for a 20% loss to follow-up over the 7 months of participation in each cohort, we will recruit 516 participants (172 per arm p). 

Data Analyses
Overall cohort
Descriptive statistics will be presented for demographic, clinical, economic, risk factor and microbiological data for the study population overall, by centre and by randomisation group and expressed as proportions and/or means of the selected characteristics by proportion fully vaccinated at 24 and 72 weeks of age and mean/median time to vaccine receipt from each time point with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Differences between groups at baseline will be assessed using t-tests for comparisons of means and chi-2 test for comparisons of proportions, conditional on test assumptions for each being satisfied. Non-normally distributed data will be analysed with appropriate non-parametric tests.

Primary objectives
Cox proportional hazards modelling will be employed to evaluate intervention effectiveness and HRRs and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The primary analysis will be undertaken using a frailty model with random effects to account for recurrent events and sibling effects if applicable. The models will be fit for each immunisation milestone and overall.

SOA: Determinants of vaccine uptake and timeliness

Demographic, socio-economic, cultural, familial and health service utilisation and health service provider factors will be evaluated to determine the predictors of complete and on-time vaccination in each cohort within the models described above that incorporate time varying covariates.

SOB: Cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be determined according to established methods that incorporate individual, familial and health service provider perspectives.

SOC: Familial and health service provider knowledge and attitudes
Descriptive analyses will be performed on quantitative data collected and thematic analysis performed on narrative data collected during parent/carer and health service provider interviews.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The uptake and timeliness of the primary immunisation series in infancy is critical to preventing infectious diseases morbidity and mortality. There is a high burden of vaccine preventable diseases in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children irrespective of geographic location, however limited attention has been paid to those living in urban and regional settings. The need to improve the timeliness of the primary series has been known for at least 10 years but there has been little change over that time.  Recent data from a cohort of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Caboolture, Queensland suggests approximately 44% of children have not completed the primary series by 7 months of age. Identifying simple, culturally appropriate and cost effective interventions to improve timeliness is therefore a priority. This trial aims to To evaluate the effectiveness of targeted, culturally appropriate short messaging service (SMS) and/or home visiting in improving the uptake and timeliness of the primary immunisation series in urban/regional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children</summary>
