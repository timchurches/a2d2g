  <interventions>
    <interventions>Evaluation of novel computer algorithm that may reconstruct words from recorded partial speech or whispers.  Subjects will be asked to speak phonetically balanced sentences for 15 minutes and this will be recorded.  Then the computer algorithm will  be used to reconstruct speech.  The accuracy and rate of reconstruction  of the regenerated voice will be rated by both researchers and the subjects.  Ultimately the algorithm would be able to be used on a smart phone or device. A single visit only is required.  Participants will be invited to hear reconstructed speech samples and rate them subjectively once reconstruction is complete. Files can be emailed to participants.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accuracy of reconstructed voice samples compared to actual voiced sentences.  Accuracy assessed by percentage correct measure where number of words correct is calculated vs actual spoken sentence.   </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of reconstructed voice samples compared to normal speech.  This will be assessed by asking raters to classify samples as 'real time', 'slower than normal', 'very slow', 'unable to understand'.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data captured will be de-identified and then analysed through the Engineering Department at Unitec.  Reproduced speech will be graded for intelligibility, accuracy of spoken words, volume, quality and speed of reproduction by two blinded researchers.  Quantitative statistical analysis will be undertaken on the voice samples and ratings.  Statistical analysis will be performed with p values below 0.05 considered significant. 
Power Calculation
Based on a 50% difference in expected speech intelligibility between unaltered voices and voice-reconstructed voices, 65 subjects will be able to detect a real difference where power of 80% and significance levels of 0.05 are used.  A mix of severity of voice dysfunction would be expected, from mild impairment to aphonia (total loss of voice).  This sample size would not allow specific subgroup analysis but will indicate if further subgroup analysis might be useful in future research.
A total of 70 subjects was agreed so that we could aim to broadly recruit 20 subjects each with mild, moderate and severe voice disorders and at least 10 laryngectomee subjects, hence a cohort of 70 subjects.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This translational research proposal aims to develop and evaluate novel algorithms for creating a new rehabilitative method to restore natural sounding speech for those with significant dysphonia and laryngectomy patients, through a real-time speech processing framework. The new method would be non-invasive, non-surgical and capable of turning whisper-like voice into normal speech.
Participants in the study will provide voice samples which will be recorded in a sound-proofed room. These samples will be analysed using computing algorithms to enhance and 'fill in' missing parts of speech to reconstruct full words and sentences.  The study will evaluate the accuracy of the reconstruction eg. did the computer regenerate the correct words? and the speed at which the reconstruction can be achieved.  It will also evaluate the intelligibility of the reconstructed speech by blind ratings from both researchers and subjects.
