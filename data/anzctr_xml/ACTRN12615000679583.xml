  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Since the inception of the after-hours social work service at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 1999, social work staff providing this service have collected summary data on a per-patient basis. To date, these data have not been formally reviewed. The aim of this retrospective study is to transcribe the data from the hard copies into an Excel file to allow descriptive analysis of the types of patients referred, referral source, their location, the type of social work involvement, complexity of the case and its perceived importance. Additionally, data that have been collected regarding the impact of providing these after-hours services on the provider the following day will be collated. As well as analysing these data collectively, trends and changes over time will be reviewed.</summary>
