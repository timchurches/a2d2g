  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of participants with an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 comparing the guselkumab group and the placebo group - The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling. The participant's psoriasis is assessed as 5-point scale as follows: cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of participants with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response comparing the guselkumab group and the placebo group - The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents improvement of at least 90% from baseline in the PASI score.</outcome>
