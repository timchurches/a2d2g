  <interventions>
    <interventions>For the KT group, a licensed physiotherapist taped both the upper (I tape) and lower (Y tape) trapezius using the Kinesiology tape. The Y tape was applied to encircle the lower trapezius, and a fully stretched I-shaped tape was applied perpendicular to the muscle belly of the upper trapezius. The 3M Micropore tape without any stretch tension was applied for the placebo group.
The application for both groups only performed once, and removed immediately after the evaluation finished. </interventions>
    <comparator>The 3M Micropore tape without any stretch tension was applied for the placebo group.
The placebo tape is applied in the same manner and anatomical locations as the KT group but without any stretch tension.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of kinesiology taping on proprioception of scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joint, scapular kinematics and muscle activity, and the relationship among the three. The results shown that our study identified the positive effects of kinesiology taping on scapular joint position sense and movement control. We recommend that kinesiology taping could be used as an  intervention tool to improve the proprioception and neuromuscular control of the shoulder
complex in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome.</summary>
