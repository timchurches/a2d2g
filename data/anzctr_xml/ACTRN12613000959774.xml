  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fixation with a cemented Exeter femoral component. Currently there is much debate in the orthopaedic community about the standard treatment of these types of fractures and whether the use of cement influences mortality rates. At our institution, all of these fractures are treated with a cemented Exeter femoral component as standard, based on current evidence. However, in order to ensure that this has not resulted in an increase in mortality rate, in-hospital mortality rates were observed to ensure they are within safe limits. Data collected from the period April 2010 (when the Hip Fracture Unit was opened) - July 2012</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This cohort study aims to investigate the in-hospital mortality of patients with a displaced femoral neck fracture when treated with a cemented femoral component. This un-selected series will be the largest in the current literature. There is some discussion in the orthopaedic community about the role of cement in post-operative mortality. The aim of this study is to examine this more closely in a controlled setting where every patient requiring arthroplasty receives the same cemented prosthesis as standard care.</summary>
