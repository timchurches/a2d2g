  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>For adults:

          1. Age 25 - 70 years:

             From mid 2013 - mid 2014, subjects aged 25-45 and 55-70 years were enrolled. From mid
             2014, subjects aged 46-54 years were also enrolled.

          2. Overweight or obesity status BMI&gt;25 kg/m2

          3. Pre-diabetes The criteria from WHO/IDF (International Diabetes Foundation) for
             assessing pre-diabetes will be used as the formal inclusion criteria (at screening),
             i.e. having:

             Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG): Fasting venous plasma glucose concentration 5.6 - 6.9
             mmol/l or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT): Venous Plasma glucose concentration of 7.8
             - 11.0 mmol/l at 2 h after oral administration of 75 g glucose (oral glucose tolerance
             test, OGTT), with fasting plasma glucose less than 7.0 mmol/l.

             Due to potential between-lab variation (local assessments), HbA1c is not used as an
             inclusion criteria in the screening.

          4. Informed consent required

          5. Ethnic group - No restrictions

          6. Smoking - Smoking is allowed, provided subjects have not recently (within 1 month)
             changed habits. However, smoking status is monitored throughout the study and used as
             a confounding variable.

          7. Motivation - Motivation and willingness to be randomized to any of the groups and to
             do his/hers best to follow the given protocol

          8. Other - Able to participate at CID's during normal working hours.

        For children and adolescents:

          1. Age 10-18 years

          2. Age-adjusted value corresponding to BMI&gt;25 kg/m2 (Cole et al. 2000)

          3. Since the prevalence of pre-diabetes among children with overweight or obesity is low,
             it is not feasible to include exclusively pre-diabetic children (according to criteria
             of the IDF).

             Therefore, insulin resistant over-weight/obese children will be included, defined as:
             HOMA-IR = 2.0 for Tanner stage &gt; 2. No HOMA criteria is used for Tanner stage 1 and 2.

          4. Informed consent required

          5. Ethnic group - No restrictions

          6. Smoking - Smoking is allowed, provided subjects have not recently (within 1 month)
             changed habits. However, smoking status is monitored throughout the study and used as
             a confounding variable.

          7. Motivation - Motivation and willingness to be randomized to any of the groups and to
             do his/hers best to follow the given protocol

          8. Other - Able to participate at CID's during normal school/working hours.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Based on interview and/or questionnaire, individuals with the following problems will be
        excluded:

        Medical conditions as known by the subjects:

          1. Diabetes mellitus (other than gestational diabetes mellitus);

          2. Significant cardiovascular disease including current angina; myocardial infarction or
             stroke within the past 6 months; heart failure; symptomatic peripheral vascular
             disease ;

          3. Systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg

             disorder potentially causing malabsorption;

          8. Previous bariatric surgery;

          9. Chronic respiratory, neurological, musculoskeletal or other disorders where, in the
             judgement of the investigator, participants would have unacceptable risk or difficulty
             in complying with the protocol (e.g. physical activity program);

         10. A recent surgical procedure until after full convalescence (investigators judgement);

         11. Transmissible blood-borne diseases e.g. hepatitis B, HIV;

             Medication:

         13. Use currently or within the previous 3 months of prescription medication that has the
             potential of affecting body weight or glucose metabolism such as glucocorticoids (but
             excluding inhaled and topical steroids; bronchodilators are allowed), psychoactive
             medication, epileptic medication, or weight loss medications (either prescription,
             over the counter or herbal). Low dose antidepressants are allowed if they, in the
             judgement of the investigator, do not affect weight or participation to the study
             protocol. Levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism is allowed if the participant
             has been on a stable dose for at least 3 months.

             lacto-vegetarian diet is allowed;

         17. Severe food intolerance expected to interfere with the study;

         18. Regularly drinking &gt; 21 alcoholic units/week (men), or &gt; 14 alcoholic units/week

         20. Blood donation or transfusion within the past 1 month before baseline or CID's;

         21. Self-reported eating disorders;

         22. Pregnancy or lactation, including plans to become pregnant within the next 36 months.

         23. No access to either phone or Internet (this is necessary when being contacted by the
             instructor's during the maintenance phase);

         24. Adequate understanding of national language;

         25. Psychological or behavioral problems which, in the judgement of the investigator,
             would lead to difficulty in complying with the protocol.

             Laboratory screening:

             If all of the above criteria are satisfied, the participant is eligible for a glucose
             tolerance test (blood at 0 and 120 mins), and blood glucose concentrations are
             analyzed immediately (Haemocue). In addition full blood count, urea, and electrolytes
             may be analyzed as a further safety evaluation. Having normal (i.e. not prediabetic)
             glucose concentrations at 0 and 2h of OGTT at any stage of the study is not an
             exclusion criterion.

             ONLY IF the glucose tolerance test meets the entry criteria for the study, the
             remaining samples are sent to the local laboratory for a safety check, with the
             following exclusion criteria:

         26. Hemoglobin concentration below local laboratory reference values (i.e. anemia).

         27. Creatinine &gt;1.5 times Upper Limit of Normal (local laboratory reference values).

         28. Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and/or Aspartate Transaminase (AST) &gt;3 times the Upper
             Limit of Normal (local laboratory reference values) Or any other significant
             abnormality on these tests which in the investigators opinion may be clinically
             significant and require further assessment

         29. Electrocardiography (ECG). Any abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator
             might indicate undiagnosed cardiac disease requiring further assessment (e.g.
             significant conduction disorder, arrhythmia, pathological Q waves). This is done in
             adults 55-70 years of age.

             After LCD phase (in adults):

         30. Failure to reach at least 8% weight reduction during the LCD phase. This leads to
             exclusion from the intervention.

        Note:

          -  The listed inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied at screening;

          -  Having normal (i.e. not pre-diabetic) glucose concentrations at 0 and 2 h of OGTT at
             any stage of the study after screening is not an exclusion criterion</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type-2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases worldwide. This trend is
      mainly driven by a global increase in the prevalence of obesity. The PREVIEW study has been
      initiated to find out the most effective lifestyle-components (diet and physical activity) in
      the prevention of Type-2 diabetes. The project consists of a randomized
      lifestyle-intervention with the more specific aim to determine the preventative impact of a
      high-protein and low-GI diet in combination with moderate or high intensity physical activity
      compared with a moderate-protein and moderate GI diet in combination with the same activity
      levels on the incidence of Type-2 diabetes in predisposed, pre-diabetic children, young and
      older adults.

      The trial will be performed in 6 EU countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Spain,
      Netherlands, UK) and Australia and New Zealand.

      A total of 2,500 overweight or obese adult participants (25-70 y) as well as 150 children and
      adolescents aged 1018 y) will be recruited. All adult participants are first treated by a
      low-calorie diet for 8 weeks, with an aim to reach = 8% weight reduction. Children and
      adolescents are treated separately with a conventional weight-reduction diet, with-out a
      specific aim for absolute weight loss.

      The adult participants are randomized into two different diet interventions and two exercise
      interventions for a total of 148 weeks. This period aims at preventing Type-2 diabetes by
      weight-maintenance (prevention of relapse in reduced body weight) and by independent
      metabolic effects of diet and physical activity.

      The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of Type-2 diabetes in the adults during 3
      years (156 weeks) according to diet (high protein/low-GI versus moderate protein/moderate-GI,
      adjusted for physical activity), based on a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and/or HbA1c.

      For children and adolescents:

      Change in insulin resistance at 2 years after randomization to high protein versus moderate
      protein diet, measured by insulin resistance analyzed by the homeostatic model (HOMA-IR) as
      well as physiological improvement of health with respect to pre-diabetic characteristics.

      Our hypothesis is that a high-protein, low-GI diet will be superior in preventing type-2
      diabetes, compared with a moderate protein, moderate GI diet, and that high-intensity
      physical activity will be superior compared to moderate-intensity physical activity.</summary>
