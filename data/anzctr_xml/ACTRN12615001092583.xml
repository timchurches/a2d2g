  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete a 4-week multi-component intervention aiming to reduce total sitting time by 1 hour/day, with an emphasis on interrupting prolonged bouts of sitting and sustaining this target for the duration of the 4-week intervention. The intervention consists of three distinct evidence-based components: (1) Health coaching - consisting of one in-person and two telephone sessions, conducted by project staff trained in motivational interviewing techniques and study protocols, providing individually tailored support for sitting time reduction and breaking up of prolonged sitting time.  The initial in-person session will occur at baseline and will assist in the installation of the sit-stand workstation (see below).  Furthermore, the initial session will provide feedback on baseline levels of sitting time, assess and enhance motivation, and identify/set goals related to opportunities to reduce and breakup prolonged sitting in both the home and work environment.  Total time for the in-person session (including workstation installation and coaching) is expected to be approximately 60 minutes.  The two telephone sessions will be split evenly across the following four weeks of the intervention.  These sessions will be guided by an intervention protocol checklist and will be brief (approximately 10 minutes).  The sessions will be used to check on progress in reducing sitting at home and at work, address problems, revise goals and reinforce gaol attainment.  (2) Providing a sit-stand workstation at their place of employment.  (3) Providing a self-monitoring and behavioural prompting tool in the form of a wrist worn activity monitor (jawbone or similar) to continually monitor their movement patterns (via a steps function).  Through the associated mobile application (IOS and Android), participants can also set goals around these behaviours, and request regular prompts to interrupt their idle states (via vibrations).  Wearing the device will be self-directed and will only be used as an intervention-delivery tool, not to gather outcome data.
A number of assessments proposed in the future RCT will be performed pre and post the 4-week intervention. These include: analysis of blood glucose and insulin metabolism (primary outcome); sitting time and accumulated bouts of prolonged sitting, body composition, blood pressure, fasting blood tests investigating cardio-metabolic markers, endothelial function, and interviewer-administered questionnaires to explore participants overall experience and acceptability of the intervention (secondary outcomes).</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants living in the Melbourne metropolitan area will be recruited via multiple strategies.  Baker IDI databases containing details of current patients and previous participants, who have consented to be contacted for future studies will be our initial target group.  This will be in combination with advertising via local newspapers, radio, social media, and newsletters/flyers with various locations (e.g. Baker IDI clinics, general practitioner clinics, allied health clinics, community houses and senior centres).  Should the need arise we will also engage an external patient recruitment agency (Trialfacts, which has a database containing &gt;25,000 Australian patient and healthy volunteers) to facilitate participant recruitment.  Participants will initially be screened for eligibility via a telephone-administered interview based the above criteria and on the AUSDRISK tool (a score &gt;6 indicating a significant risk of being prediabetic).  If Trialfacts are engaged, they will carry out the initial phone screening and provide us a list of potential candidates.  Following successful completion of phone screening, the trial coordinator will explain the project in lay terms, initially over the telephone.  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be discussed and, provided the patient is suitable and willing to take part, they will be forwarded a copy of the patient information and consent forms (PICF) by mail or email.  They will be called back in the following days to discuss any concerns, before be asked to give verbal consent to undergo, just, the screening OGTT and 10-day physical activity monitoring - the final steps to confirm eligibility. The Baker IDI study coordinator will send pathology request forms (via mail) to each potential participant to attend a local pathology centre (Melbourne Pathology) to complete a standard 75-g OGTT to confirm prediabetes status.  Once confirmed as having pre-diabetes, participant’s sitting time and physical activity will be monitored for 10 consecutive days via an inclinometer and accelerometer.  These monitors will be posted out to participants with instructions on their operation.  While being state of the art devices, externally they are very simple, and participants will not be required to do anything to operate them apart from following basic instructions on how to wear them.  They will allow for assessment of habitual activity and ensure that only participants who sit for long periods (&gt;9 hours per day) and are inactive (&lt;30 min/day of moderate/vigorous physical activity) are included.  Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be invited into the Physical Activity Lab at Baker IDI where, once again, the study will be explained to them. The participant will then be asked to reread the PICF and decide if they are willing to give informed consent for remaining intervention components of the study.
As this is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a future trial, there will be no randomisation or allocation of a treatment as all participants will complete the intervention in its entirety.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>As this is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a future trial, statistical analysis was not performed to determine sample size.  Sample size was determined through discussions between principal and associate investigators.
Regarding statistical analysis to evaluate data, Subjective evaluations of intervention components and assessment procedures will be provided by participants at the completion of the intervention via questionnaires and interviews.  To inform an evaluation of intervention fidelity, all intervention contacts will be tracked regarding attempts, completions and duration of calls. The iAUC will be calculated using the trapezoidal method. Differences between baseline and post-intervention in cardio-metabolic outcomes will be tested using paired t-tests. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rationale
Based on evidence from the AusDiab study, it is estimated that at least 2 million Australians have prediabetes, a condition that carries a 1020 fold increased risk of developing T2D. In people with prediabetes, too much sitting  accumulated throughout the day and across multiple settings  is now understood to be related to increased risk of T2D, microvascular and macrovascular complications, and premature mortality. This is distinct from the known adverse consequences of too little exercise.   Descriptive epidemiological evidence shows that a high proportion of adults aged in their 50s and 60s can spend more than 9 hours each day sitting. Significant health benefits can be gained through innovative and feasible lifestyle-change strategies that take a whole-of-day approach to reducing and interrupting the multiple consecutive hours spent sitting.
Those at risk of diabetes are a high priority group for preventive initiatives. Given the escalating healthcare system, societal and economic burden associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, this will be an important and timely study and a vital step in developing affordable and effective evidence-based interventions to reduce and interrupt prolonged sitting, which will ultimately contribute to Australias national strategy for the prevention of major non-communicable diseases.

Aim
We aim to undertake pilot work to examine the short-term feasibility and acceptance of a proposed future randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the long-term efficacy of an intervention to reduce and interrupt prolonged sitting time in overweight or obese adults with prediabetes.  Over a 4-week period we will examine the acceptability of participants to take part in the trial, and scrutinise the feasibility of interventions and assessment procedures proposed in the future trial.  Conducting this study allow us to refine the design and/or methodology for the proposed future trial.

Hypothesis
We hypothesise that the intervention and assessment procedures used over the 4-week trial period will prove feasible to be included in the proposed future trial.  Furthermore, participants will adapt and maintain compliance with the intervention and, on reflection, will express good acceptability of the intervention.
We also hypothesise that the 4-week intervention will show small improvements from baseline in postprandial insulin and glucose, sitting time and bouts of prolonged sitting, endothelial function, body composition, blood pressure, and cardiometabolic markers.
