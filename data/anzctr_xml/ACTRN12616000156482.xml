    <interventions>Mediterranean diet versus standard diet.   
Patients are randomised to either the Mediterranean diet intervention arm or the standard diet (low fat, National Heart Foundation guidelines, Australian Guide to Healthy Eating) control arm. Participants of both study arms will receive individualised counselling from an Accredited Practicing Dietitian (APD) across a 6 month period and then a phone call follow up at 12 months. The consults with an APD will be face-to-face at baseline, mid-intervention (3 months) and end of intervention (6 months). For these appointments diet adherence will be assessed through food diaries and food frequency questionnaire, blood/urine samples taken, activity levels monitored via accelerometer and anthropometric measures and DEXA scans performed. Each face-to-face appoint will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours. Review phone calls (approximately 15 minutes each) will also be conducted every 3 weeks up until the 3 month review appointment and on a monthly basis up until counselling cessation at 6 months. A final follow up phone call of approximately 20 minutes duration will be conducted at 12 months to assess feasibility of sustaining the diet. Meal plans and recipes relevant to the diet group are provided at baseline. The Mediterranean diet intervention is prescribed ad libitum and composed of a high fat (approximately 40% of total energy intake), moderate carbohydrate and moderate protein intake. Key foods promoted are extra virgin olive oil, nuts, legumes, wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, seafood, fermented dairy products, herbs and spices, with limited intake of red meat. To achieve dietary goals, the intervention group are provided with a food hamper representing typical Mediterranean diet foods (olive oil, nuts, natural Greek yoghurt, tinned fish and legumes) and the control standard diet group are provided a supermarket voucher to purchase low fat/recommended healthy food products. These will be provided at baseline and 3 month appointments.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The standard diet for the control arm is modelled on the National Heart Foundation guidelines for a low fat/moderate carbohydrate diet and the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating recommendations. The control standard diet is prescribed ad libitum and targets a fat intake of less than 30% of total energy with a focus on a reduction in saturated fat (&lt;7% total energy intake) and salt. Polyunsaturated, particularly Omega-3, fats are encouraged as per the National Heart Foundation recommendations. Food group recommendations are based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating recommended daily serves. The control group will receive the same level of attention and dietary counselling as the Mediterranean diet intervention group. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>It is assumed that at the end of the 12-month follow-up, 93% of subjects in the Mediterranean diet treatment arm will not experience a cardiac event and 86% of subjects in the control standard diet arm will also not experience an event. The assumption that the intervention can reduce the event rates by 7% is conservative compared to the observed event rate difference of 11% in the Lyon Heart Study (de Lorgeril et al., 1999). To detect this 7% difference in event rates between the two groups with at least 80% power, 305 subjects per arm need to be recruited (95% significance level is assumed). The aim to recruit 340 subjects per arm (680 subjects in total) allows for a 10% drop out rate.
Continuous data will be expressed as mean +/-SD. Fishers exact tests will be used to evaluate categorical measures. Continuous variables recorded at baseline will be analysed using the Students t-tests. All analyses will be conducted with intention to treat. For intermediate outcomes measured, they will be evaluated by plotting Kaplan-Meir curves. Odds ratios will be calculated with multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models. For continuous measures (risk factors and food diary data) recorded longitudinally at 3 and 6 months, multilevel random-effects modelling will be used. Two-tailed p values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a multicentre, parallel design, randomised controlled trial, at La Trobe University using cardiology patients from two major Hospitals in Melbourne. The intervention will be 6 months in length with a follow up at 12 months. There will be two groups, the Mediterranean diet intervention arm versus the standard care diet (low fat, National Heart Foundation guidelines) control arm. The aim of this study is to determine whether the Mediterranean diet compared to standard diet intervention can prevent secondary cardiac events and improve cardiometabolic risk factors (lipid profile, inflammatory markers, metabolic parameters, anthropometry, body composition) in a multi-ethnic Australian population. </summary>
