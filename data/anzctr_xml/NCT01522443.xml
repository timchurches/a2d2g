  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - cabozantinib
Treatment: drugs - mitoxantrone
Treatment: drugs - prednisone

Experimental: Cabozantinib - Subjects randomized to the cabozantinib arm will also receive placebo mitoxantrone injections (color-matched with methylene blue) and placebo prednisone capsules.
There will be a maximum of 10 infusions for mitoxantrone placebo.

Active Comparator: Mitoxantrone/prednisone - Subjects randomized to the mitoxantrone + prednisone arm will also receive placebo cabozantinib tablets.
There will be a maximum of 10 infusions for mitoxantrone.


Treatment: drugs: cabozantinib
Tablets taken orally once daily.

Treatment: drugs: mitoxantrone
Given by IV once every 3 weeks.

Treatment: drugs: prednisone
Taken twice a day orally by mouth. Commercially-obtained prednisone tablets will be over-encapsulated in order to blind identity.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Histological or cytological diagnosis of castration resistant prostate cancer (serum
             testosterone less than 50 ng/dL).

          -  Evidence of bone metastasis related to prostate cancer on bone scans.

          -  Documented pain from bone metastases that requires opioid narcotic intervention.

          -  Adopted a narcotic regimen that consists of one sustained release opioid agent taken
             daily for chronic pain and one immediate release opioid agent for breakthrough pain.

          -  Received prior docetaxel and either abiraterone or MDV3100 treatment and has evidence
             of investigator assessed prostate cancer progression on each agent independently.

          -  Maintenance of LHRH agonist or antagonist unless treated with orchiectomy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bone metastases and associated pain are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Most approved therapies have shown some ability
      to reduce soft tissue lesions but none meaningfully impacts bone metastases (as demonstrated
      by lack of resolution of lesions on bone scan with these agents) or the pain associated with
      these metastases.

      This study will evaluate the effect of cabozantinib versus mitoxantrone plus prednisone on
      pain response and bone scan response in men with CRPC.</summary>
