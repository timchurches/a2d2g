  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the safety of intralesional (IL) PV-10 for the
      treatment of recurrent breast carcinoma. This study will also include a preliminary
      assessment of response of injected lesions by histologic assessment upon lesion excision at
      1-3 weeks following IL PV-10 administration. Post-excision wound healing will be assessed
      clinically at 1 week and 4 weeks following excision of PV-10 injected lesions.</summary>
