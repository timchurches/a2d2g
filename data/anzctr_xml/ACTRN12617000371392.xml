    <statisticalmethods>There are no similar studies using SLT for the proposed study duration (12 weeks) in an MCI cohort. Thus, we selected a well-designed study that used the same primary outcome measure and a similar cohort with a 16 week intervention. That study also provided effect sizes at midpoint (8 weeks; Craft et al., 2012) and demonstrated significantly improved delayed story recall on the Logical Memory Story-A subtest of the WMS-IV following 8 weeks of 20 IU insulin: a treatment group Ã— time interaction, p = .02, Cohens f = .36. 

We utilised this effect size to conduct a simple a priori sample size calculation based on the Logical Memory Story-A subtest of the WMS-IV. To detect an effect size of Cohens f = .36, at a = .05 and 80 % power, 63 participants across 2 groups are required. Allowing for a 20% drop out, this means 76 participants (38 per group) are required. This was rounded-up to 80 (40 per arm) to facilitate the permuted block randomisation strategy. This study is also a pilot efficacy study, so a larger sample size to reach a higher degree of statistical power is not required.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) causes a slight but noticeable decline in cognitive abilities, and is conceptualised as a transitional prodromal stage between healthy ageing and dementia.  It is estimated that up to 35 % of Australians aged 70 and older have MCI, and 15 % of those individuals will go on to develop dementia within a year.  Currently, there are no treatment options for MCI, and anti-dementia pharmaceuticals are largely ineffective as they act on a single therapeutic target, which does not address the multifaceted pathophysiology of MCI.  

The project aims to evaluate the mechanisms of action and test the efficacy and safety of a novel multi-target treatment for MCI due to Alzheimer's disease: Sailuotong (SLT), a standardised herbal medicine formula.  SLT capitalises on the multi-system approach of Chinese herbal medicine, containing multiple standardised active components including Panax ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, and Crocus sativus (saffron), and has already shown promise as a potential treatment for vascular dementia. 

This project will involve a 12 week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 180 mg/day SLT for cognitive function in people with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease.  The co-primary outcome measures are episodic memory as measured by Logical Memory Story A - Delayed Recall, perceptual processing speed as measured by Digit Symbol Coding, and executive function as measured by the D-KEFS (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System) Trail Making Test Condition 4.

Secondary neuropsychological outcome measures include: Block Design, Digit Span, D-KEFS Trail Making Test Condition 2, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Rey Complex Figure Test, Benton Visual Retention Test, 15-item Boston Naming Test, Semantic Fluency, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test.  

We will also examine the mechanisms of action of SLT in people with MCI by assessing brain activity via electroencephalograph (EEG), autonomic activity via skin conductance and electrocardiograph (ECG), cerebral blood flow via carotid artery ultrasound, and serum inflammatory markers including homocysteine, a1-antichymotrypsin, IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha.</summary>
