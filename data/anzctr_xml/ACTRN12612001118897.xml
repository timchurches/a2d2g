  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assessing the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in Mali. Drug is to be administered orally using the following regimen according to body mass: twice a day for three days - 20:120mg - less than 15kg - 1 tablet, 15 - 25 kg - 2 tablets, 25 - 35 kg - 3 tablets, more than 35kg - 4 tablets</interventions>
    <comparator>Assessing the efficacy of artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in Mali. This combination will be dosed at 4mg/kg/day of artesunate and 25mg/kg/day of SP, one tablet daily for three days.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of  treatment failure (early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure).

Enrolled patients will be assessed for parasitological (using microscopy), clinical responses during the 28 days follow-up and treatment outcomes will be classified according to the latest WHO protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at day 28 following treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of adverse event will be documented. Parents or guardians of all enrolled patients will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients will be evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form. 

Possible medicine related adverse effects include dizziness, itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, headache, bodyache, diarrhoea, tinnitus and increased hair loss, macular rash, reduction in neutrophil counts and convulsions. However, it is likely that many of these effects are disease-related rather than medicine-induced.</outcome>

    <concealment>Subjects over 6 months with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with either artemether/lumefantrine or artesunate-sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and monitored for 28 days. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations.</concealment>
