  <interventions>
    <interventions>Measurement of diet intake using 3-day weighed food record, Cancer Council Food Frequency Questionnaire and 24-hour recall methods. All participants will be asked to complete all three methods of estimating dietary intake. Duration of observation differs for each method: 
3-day weighed food record will be conducted once. Participants choose
two weekdays and one weekend-day within a two-week period. They will be
provided with a set of scales and three separate record sheets to record all
food and beverages consumed on these days. Instructions and a demonstration
will be conducted during the home-visit. A prepaid return envelope is provided
in order to return the scales and food record sheets. 
Cancer Council Food Frequency Questionnaire will be conducted once during the home visit. Participants are asked to estimate the frequency of consumption of
various foods over the previous 12-months.
24-hour recall will be conducted twice; the first time during the home-visit,
and then again two weeks later. It involves participants recalling all foods
and drinks consumed in the previous complete 24 hour period.
To clarify;
The home visit includes; initial 24-h recall, food frequency questionnaire and
instructions for weighed food record. 
Then participants are given two weeks to complete and return a 3-day weighed
food record
Finally, two weeks after the initial home visit a second 24-hour recall will be
conducted via telephone.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no comparison group, since comparisons will not be made between
participants. Prospective observation includes the 3-day weighed food record since this is recorded in real time.
Retrospective observation includes both the Cancer Council Food Frequency
Questionnaire and both of the 24-hour recalls. These methods look back to the
previous 12 months, and 24-hours respectively.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>At present few methods of determining dietary intake in this group have been validated. The aim of the study is to evaluate the validity of two dietary assessment instruments (Cancer Councils Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and duplicate 24h recall) against a reference technique (3-day weighted record) in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. This will potentially provide Dietitians (particularly researchers) with a simple, valid tool to assess dietary intake in this population</summary>
