  <interventions>
    <interventions>First we diagnosed pes cavus from a -bearing lateral radiography of both feet.  The radiological angles  were measured using the AutoCad'Registered Trademark'(AutoCad 2007) software package.
The electrotherapy instrument used to provoke the stretching of the fascia and of the intrinsic muscles of the foot was the TENS MED 931'Registered Trademark'(Enraf-Nonius, Rotterdam, Netherlands).  The neuromuscular stretching was carried out on the subject's dominant foot.  The contralateral foot was the control.  To stretch the fascia and intrinsic muscles through electrical stimulation, the stimulating electrodes were put in place and the subject stood on one leg, holding on to a bar to keep steady.  The current intensity was increased until we observed contraction of the toes (besides, the current intensity depends on the threshold of tolerance of each subject)  At that point we stopped increasing the current.  When relaxation of the toes was evident to the examiner, the intensity of the current was again increased until there was another toe contraction.  This procedure was repeated thrice as is established for post-isometric muscle relaxation procedures. The duration of the stretching varied from subject to subject, but ranged from 2 to 5 minutes.
Post-intervention radiographic measurements were performed immediately after the completion of the neuromuscular technique, following the protocol described above.  To evaluate the short-term effects, these measurements were repeated one week after the intervention.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>-Internal Moreau-Costa-Bertani angle. 
To measure this angle, three points are marked: 
(1) the lowest point of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity; 
(2) the lowest point of the talar head; 
and (3) the plantarmost surface of the internal sesamoid.  

The two lines formed by joining points 1 and 2 and points 2 and 3 give the final angle as a result.


</outcome>
      <timepoint>This angle was measured three times:
- Before the intervention technique (stretching)
-Immediately after stretching
-Second timepoint (one week after stretching)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>-Calcaneal pitch angle.  

This angle results from the intersection of the line tangent to the plantar surface of the calcaneus with the line parallel to the horizontal of the ground.


</outcome>
      <timepoint>This angle was measured three times:
- Before the intervention technique (stretching)
-Immediately after stretching
-Second timepoint( one week after stretching)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>-First metatarsal declination angle. 

This angle results from the intersection between the axis of the first metatarsal shaft and the horizontal.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>This angle was measured three times:
- Before the intervention technique (stretching)
-Immediately after stretching

    <statisticalmethods>The required sample size was calculated assuming a one-tailed hypothesis (subjects in both groups were expected to improve), a between-group allocation ratio of 1:1, a medium effect size (d=0.55), an alpha value of 0.05, and a power of 90% (Gpower 3.1.2´Registered Trademark´ Kiel University, Germany).  Thirty subjects were necessary to complete the study. Given that some subjects might be lost through abandoning the study (although actually there were ultimately zero losses), we included 34 subjects in the study.

Data analysis was performed using the statistical software package SPSS 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois).  A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyse the intra-subject factor for the three times of measurement and the paired-groups comparison.  To determine the relationship between the three radiological angles measured, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesized that neuromuscular stretching applied to cavus feet with radiological angles with values that show a tendency away from normal can be changed to those of a normal foot architecture.

In the foot, to measure the height of the plantar arch, a weight-bearing lateral radiograph is used on which one of the angles that can be drawn is the Internal Moreau-Costa-Bertani angle.  When this angle is less than or equal to 125 degrees, the foot is classified as cavus.  

Objective: This study seeks to determine whether, through neuromuscular stretching applied to the sole, radiological angles with values that show a tendency away from normal can be changed to those of a normal foot architecture.  

Methods: 34 subjects with pes cavus underwent neuromuscular stretching of the sole of their dominant foot using a TENS MED 931 device. Measurements were made of the Internal Moreau-Costa-Bertani (IMCB), the first metatarsal declination (DImtt), and calcaneal pitch (VC, verticalization of the calcaneus) angles before, immediately after, and one week after applying the stretching technique.  

Results: The radiographic measurements showed significant changes in the IMCB, DImtt, and VC angles (p=0.03; p=0.019; p=0.041, respectively), and these were maintained one week after the intervention.  The DImtt angle was that with changes that were more strongly correlated with the IMCB angle (r=-0.77).  

Conclusion: Neuromuscular stretching in pes cavus opens the plantar arch as measured by the IMCB angle, and reduces the inclination of the first metatarsal and the calcaneus relative to the ground.</summary>
