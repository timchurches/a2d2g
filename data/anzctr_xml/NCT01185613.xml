Treatment: devices: Therapy Cool Flex Ablation Catheter
The device under evaluation is the 4mm Therapy Cool Flex Ablation Catheter. The Therapy Cool Flex catheter is a flexible tip, insulated, 7F catheter constructed of thermoplastic elastomer material and noble metal electrodes.
The following CE Mark devices will be used in conjunction with the Therapy Cool Flex Ablation Catheter
IBI-1500T11 Cardiac Ablation Generator (RF ablation generator) with software version 3.0 or higher.
Cool Point Irrigation Pump
Cool Point Tubing set
Data Logger

      <outcome>Procedural parameters - Ablation parameters (such as average power delivered , average tip temperature , average impedance )
Lesion locations (such as PVI, Septal line, Mitral isthmus, CTI or any other lesion location)
Mapping techniques (Mapping system and catheter)
RF application time ( Calculated from the total number of RF application and duration of each RF application)

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AF Recurrence - Recurrence of AF through six months post last RF ablation procedure using Cool Flex catheter. A 24 hour Holter will be provided to the patients for six month follow-up visit in order to monitor AF episodes. An AF episode will be considered a recurrence only if it lasts for 30 seconds or more.
AF recurrences during the blanking period (defined below) will not be reported.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to observe the performance of Therapy Cool Flex catheter by
      documenting the procedural parameters, major complications and recurrence of AF after
      ablation using Cool Flex ablation catheter for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation.

      This study is an observational clinical study which is not based on any specific endpoints.</summary>
