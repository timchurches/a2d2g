      <outcome>Proportion of children with acute asthma exacerbations during treatment period. Exacerbations are defined by the ATS/ERS statement on asthma control and exacerbations, namely: use of steriods (recorded in the concomitant medications) and hospitalisation (recorded in unscheduled events and hospital log).</outcome>

      <outcome>Proportion of viral respiratory infections that result in lower airway symptoms during the treatment period. Presence of upper and lower respiratory tract infection symptoms will be recorded in a patient diary. Detection and identification of virus will be determined using PCR on nasal washes (collected at every clinic visit) and on nasal swabs (collected by study staff at unscheduled visits if possible and by parents during periods of lower respiratory tract infections).</outcome>

      <outcome>Lung function and airway responsiveness over the follow up period. Lung function will be measured by spirometry. Airway responsiveness will be measured by methacholine challenge testing.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background
Asthma is a huge social and economic burden on our community. Acute exacerbations of asthma are linked with worse lung outcomes for children. In school aged children a risk for acute exacerbations include viral infections, which occur mainly in winter, and allergy.

A drug called omalizumab may help prevent acute exacerbations by damping the allergy response.

Aim
We want to see if omalizumab will decrease the number of children with asthma having an acute exacerbation.</summary>
