  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in this study have chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) that is not controlled by medical treatment.  It is important to remember that participants would have been offered Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) surgery for the treatment of CRS, regardless of whether this new laser was available or not. 

The intervention treatment is the PLS Opel Surgical System is a compact solid state surgical laser system. 

In this within-participant controlled study, each participant will receive investigational treatment and conventional surgical instruments to one sinus and conventional surgical instruments alone to the other sinus. The surgeon will decide which conventional instruments to use and how much laser is required during the surgery. 

Participants will be treated in day surgery. The total time of surgery will depend on the type of FESS needed, but is anticipated to be under 1 hour. The time of surgery and time using the investigational treatment will be measured in minutes.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety:
Measured from the adverse events noted in the Intention to Treat (ITT) and Surgical populations. The adverse event data will be 
reported in number and frequency of events.

The known risks of FESS surgery are:
Bleeding  most sinus surgery involves some degree of blood loss; almost all patients will experience a small amount of bleeding.  Some patients require nasal packing that requires removal the next day.  A blood transfusion because of bleeding is rarely necessary (0.75% or less than 1 in 100) and would only be undertaken if your health was at risk. 

Return of chronic sinusitis   (10% to 20%; or a 1 in 10 to 1 in 5 chance) - although FESS surgery has been shown to provide significant benefits for patients suffering from chronic sinusitis, surgery is not a cure for the disease.  A wide range of recurrence has been reported in other studies after sinus surgery using standard instruments, although the likelihood of recurrence is largely influenced by how severe the condition was at the time of the original surgery. Nevertheless, patients can expect to continue with sinus medication even after successful sinus surgery, although the amount of medication should in general be less.    

Cerebrospinal fluid leak (0.17% or less than 1 in 100 chance) - because the sinuses are so close to the brain, there is a rare chance that surgery can cause a leak of the fluid lining the brain or injury the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid leak has never occurred with turbinate reduction but may occur when FESS is conducted in the upper part of the sinuses. If left untreated, the complications from this could be meningitis which is an inflammation of the membranes of the brain and the spinal cord.  If a cerebrospinal leak were to occur, additional surgery might be required to close this.  

Visual problems (0.07% or less than 1 in 100 chance)  there have been some reports of vision being lost after FESS surgery but there have been no reports of visual loss associated with turbinate reduction.  The changes of recovering lost vision are not good.  This complication is fortunately very rare.  Double vision has also been reported following sinus surgery.  Constant tearing or watering from one or both eyes can also result from this surgery but this resolves on its own. 

Other risks of sinus surgery in general include the following:
Change in sense of smell or taste 
Continued and/or worsening of sinus symptoms and facial pain
Swelling or bruising of the area around the eyes
Voice changes
Numbness to the teeth/cheek
Reactions to anaesthesia including unexpected heart, lung or kidney changes
Need for frequent post-surgical visits for cleaning to help prevent the disease from returning and/or need for future medical/surgical care

Risks specific to the OPEL Surgical System may include thermal injury to the tissue being treated (estimated at less than 1 in 100).

    <concealment>Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective candidate will be given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the approved informed consent form and have any questions asked and answered. Once the investigator is assured that the individual understands the implications of participating in the study, the individual will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing the informed consent form.

Upon determining a subject’s eligibility status, the subject will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study, and the will be given a unique screening identifier number subject’s initials will be entered into the study site’s screening log. If the subject undergoes surgery they will additionally be assigned a unique subject identifier in addition to their unique screening identifier.

The statistician will prepare a randomization schedule assigning study and control treatments to the left or right side of the sinuses for each participant.  The randomization schedule will be balanced to achieve a right/left treatment distribution ratio of approximately 1:1 among participants. The study investigator will randomize the left/right assignment for each participant immediately prior to surgery on Day 0.  Allocation is not concealed, and the participant and surgeon will be aware of which sinus the laser was used in addition to conventional surgical instruments. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current standard of practice for the treatment of CRS includes antibiotics either given by mouth or through an injection in your arm, nasal sprays and rinses, oral and nasal corticosteroids and/or anti-allergy medicines.  Despite these treatments some patients are still unable to get relief from their sinus symptoms.  

When the above treatments fail and the disease continues then some patients will move forward to surgery.  This type of surgery is called Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS).   The surgery is quite difficult and requires great surgical skill.  One of the problems associated with FESS surgery is making sure that the area being treated is clear of blood so the surgeon can see the area he is treating.  There are a number of complications associated with bleeding with this type of surgery which your doctor will explain to you.  A potential solution to try and improve the visibility when performing FESS surgery is to use laser throughout the procedure.

Laser is used in many types of surgery, including surgery for ears, nose and the throat (otolaryngology). The laser being tested during this study is a new laser.  It has been designed so that it delivers the laser through a much smaller fibre (a tube that delivers the light to the tissue) and also uses very low power to avoid unwanted damage to nearby healthy tissue, which will hopefully help achieve better results from surgery and also fewer complications with this type of surgery.  

This study is being done to look at the safety and the performance of this new laser when it is used during FESS procedures.  It is important to remember that you would have undergone the surgery regardless of this new laser  the new laser is an additional treatment being used during the procedure.
