  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Treatment Group will receive Tetracaine eye drops that are to be self administered (one drop) every 30 minutes into the injured eye while awake for the following 24 hours. The treatment group will receive a total of 1 ml Tetracaine Hydrochloride 1% (2x 0.5ml minims, approximately 30 drops).</interventions>
    <comparator>The Control Group will receive Saline eye drops that are to be self administered (one drop) every 30 minutes into the injured eye while awake for the following 24 hours. The Control Group will receive one 5 ml bullet of Saline Solution (0.9% Saline).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is to show that short term use of topical anaesthetics for corneal abrasions is safe and will not affect corneal healing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The patients will be followed up at a 48 hour check where a senior medical physician will re examine the cornea under the slit lamp for evidence of adequate healing. Visual acuity will be tested on presentation at the Emergency Department and at the 48 hour follow up.  Patients will be contacted by telephone at 1 week and 1 month where they will be asked additional questions to check how effective they thought he treatment drug was, if their vision has returned to normal, if they have experienced any adverse effects or if the suffered from any complications during or after the treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome of this study is to show that short term use of topical anaesthetics will reduce pain for patients suffering from corneal abrasions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The participants will complete a Pain Questionnaire for the 48 hours after leaving the Emergency Department.  Pain level will be measured on a horizontal 10cm Visual Analog Scale. Participants will record their pain level every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours and then every 2 hours (while they are awake) for the next 48 hours.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria includes any simple acute corneal abrasions from mechanical trauma, ultraviolet light, foreign body, or from removal of foreign body by the physician.  

For patients to be eligible for this study they also need to have presented to the Emergency Department within 36 hours of their initial injury.</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>0</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria.  There are a number of reasons that subjects may be excluded from participating in this study.   

If patients present to the Emergency Department more that 36 hours after their initial injury they will be excluded as the majority of corneal abrasion healing will already have occured.

If patients are under the age of 18.

If patients have had previous eye surgery or cataracts.

If patients wear contact lenses or if their injury was caused from contact lens wear.

If patients are unable to give informed consent.

If patients are suffering from infectious or chemical conjunctivitis.

If the patients eye contains a grossly contaminated foreign body.

If the patient is suffering from an ocular infection.

If the patient currently has herpes keratitis.

If the patient is allergic to Tetracaine or similar medication classes.

If the injury requires urgent ophthalmologic evaluation (e.g.  penetrating eye injuries, large or complicated corneal abrasions or injuries causing a significant disruption of vision).</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>The medical care giver on initial visit will discuss the project with potential participants.  Participants will be provided with an information sheet to read and if they are willing to participate they will be required to complete a full written consent form.  If participants have any additional questions the Principle Investigator will answer these. 

Participants will need to have a basic understanding of the English language to be able to participate in this study.  They will be required to be able to provide informed consent, read the information sheet, fill out a questionnaire and answer basic questions over the telephone.

Numbered sealed envelopes will be placed into a box in the eye treatment area refrigerator. Patients will be assigned a study number in succession and will be given a similarly numbered envelope. Inside each envelope will be either the Tetracaine or Saline eye drops.</concealment>
    <sequence>The decision on which treatment is placed into a given envelope will take place prior to the start of the study.  The selection will occur through a random number generator using block randomisation, with random block sizes chosen from 6, 8 or 10 per block, and will only be known by the study researchers.</sequence>
