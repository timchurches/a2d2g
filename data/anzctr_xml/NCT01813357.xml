  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial comparing Rosuvastatin with
      placbeo in HIV positive people who are at intermediate cardiovascular risk.

      It is possible that HIV positive people will receive a greater benefit from statins because
      of their higher baseline levels of inflammation. Current Australian guidelines recommend
      initiation of statin therapy on the basis of cholesterol level and the presence of other risk
      factors for heart disease (such as diabetes) but do not take into account whether a patient
      is infected with HIV. This study aims to determine what benefit HIV infected people will
      receive from starting statin therapy earlier then currently recommended.</summary>
