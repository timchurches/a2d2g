    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - trastuzumab (Herceptin®)
Treatment: drugs - anastrazole (Arimidex®)

Experimental: trastuzumab + anastrozole - Trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose intravenous (iv) over 90 minutes, followed by weekly doses of 2 mg/kg iv over 30 minutes plus 1 mg oral dose of anastrozole every day for 24 Months in the Main phase and in the Extension Phase.

Active Comparator: anastrozole - 1 mg oral dose of anastrozole every day for 24 Months in the Main phase. In the Extension Phase participants could cross-over to also receive trastuzumab 4 mg/kg initial loading dose intravenous (iv) over 90 minutes, followed by weekly doses of 2 mg/kg iv over 30 minutes.


Treatment: drugs: trastuzumab (Herceptin®)
4mg/kg iv loading dose, followed by 2mg/kg iv weekly

Treatment: drugs: anastrazole (Arimidex®)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS was assessed by the investigator based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria using radiographic tumor evaluations. Disease progression was defined as the appearance of any new lesion not previously identified or an estimated increase of 25% or more in existent bidimensionally or unidimensionally measurable lesions or progression of an existing non-measurable lesion. For bidimensionally measurable malignant lesions with an area of at least 2.0 centimeters squared (cm^2) an increase of 1.0 cm^2 was required and for unidimensionally measurable lesions of 1.0 cm or less an increase of 0.5 cm was required. PFS was defined as the number of days between date of randomization and date of documented disease progression or date of death. Kaplan Meier estimates of PFS are presented.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 Months, End of Study (Up to 5 years)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response at 24 Months - Duration of response was defined as the number of days from the day complete response or partial response was first noted to the day of progression of disease, death or last follow-up.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Response at 24 Months - Time to response was defined as the number of days from the day of randomization to the day complete response or partial response was first noted.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Best Tumor Response at 24 Months - Tumor Response levels were determined by the investigator and an Independent Response Evaluation Committee and Reconciled. Best Response was defined as the best response a patient achieves in the study.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status at Final Visit Compared to Baseline - Participants rated their performance status using the ECOG Questionnaire on the following scale: 0=Fully active, perform all pre-disease activities without restriction; 1=Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory, carry out work of a light or sedentary nature; 2=Ambulatory, capable of self-care, unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than &gt;50% of waking hours; 3=Capable of limited self-care, confined to bed or chair &gt;50% of waking hours; 4=Completely disabled, not capable of any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair; 5=Dead.

Improved: Score decrease from baseline. Unchanged: Score the same as baseline. Worse: Score increase from baseline.</outcome>

    <summary>This 2 arm study assessed the safety and efficacy of adding intravenous trastuzumab
      (Herceptin®) to daily oral anastrozole (Arimidex®) tablets as first- and second-line
      treatment in postmenopausal patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)
      overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (ER+ve and/or PR+ve). Patients were randomized to
      receive either anastrazole 1 mg per os (po) daily, or anastrazole 1 mg po daily + a loading
      dose of Herceptin® 4 mg/kg intravenous (iv) followed by weekly doses of Herceptin® 2 mg/kg
      iv. The anticipated time on study treatment was until disease progression, and the target
      sample size was 100-500 individuals.</summary>
