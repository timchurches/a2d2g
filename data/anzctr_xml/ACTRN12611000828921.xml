    <interventions>Children will receive a personalised alarm watch, with the alarm on the watch set to approximately two hourly intervals by the trial coordinator at times defined by the parents to fit in with the childs daily routine and then locked to prevent tampering. Children will be asked to void approximately every 2 hours while awake using their watches to help them.
1. The watch will be set to alarm approximately every 2-3 hours during the day at times defined by parents to fit in with the childs activities (eg at recess and lunch times). It will not be alarming overnight.
2. The alarm watch will be work daily for the duration of the study treatment period (3 months)</interventions>
    <comparator>Children will receive an identical watch (with normal time and date set by the trial coordinator). Children will be asked to void approximately every 2 hours while awake using their watches to help them.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Daytime urinary incontinence is very common in children and impacts on self-esteem, socialisation opportunities and quality of life, with the potential to lead to adult urinary incontinence with associated psychosocial comorbidities. The estimated annual cost for urinary incontinence in Australian children aged 5-15 is at least $116.1 million (extrapolating from 2001 adult data of $387 per person in 10% children aged 5-15). Timed voiding is an effective, non-pharmacological treatment for treating DUI in adults, but is less effective in children, possibly due to poor compliance. The use of a personal alarm watch may enhance the effectiveness of timed voiding in children.
A randomised controlled trial is the best research method to definitively answer the question of whether timed voiding aided by an alarm watch is superior to timed voiding alone. If found to be successful, incorporating a personalised alarm watch to aid timed voiding will provide a simple, inexpensive but effective non-pharmacological treatment for managing daytime urinary incontinence in children. If the alarm watch does not improve timed voiding, this knowledge will reduce unnecessary financial costs for families.</summary>
