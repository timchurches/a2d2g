    <statisticalmethods>Previous treatment studies examining the efficacy of modified CBT in treating older children with High Functioning Autism/ Aspergers Syndrome and anxiety have found large effect sizes for the effect of treatment on anxiety (e.g. Storch et al. 2013).  Previous studies on interventions that focus on emotional management in children with ASD have found small to medium effect sizes for the effect of treatment on parents mental health and wellbeing (e.g. Scarpa &amp;Reyes, 2011; Whittingham, Sofronoff, Sheffield, &amp; Sanders, 2008). Given that this study is primarily concerned with child outcomes, a large effect size was used to calculate the minimum sample size for the study. As past research has demonstrated the direction of the effect of CBT on anxiety, a one tail analysis was used to calculate sample size. Additionally, as per the convention in clinical psychology an alpha level of .05 was used to calculate sample size. According to the  ClinTools Software for Windows (Devilly, 2007) a minimum sample size of 40 participants was needed to produce an effect size of 0.80 with a power of 0.80 (a = 0.05, 1 tailed) for a between groups designed.
A series of preliminary analyses will be conducted to ensure there are no significant differences between treatment and waitlist condition on demographic variables and outcome measures prior to treatment.  Chi-square analysis will be conducted to test for significant differences between groups for child gender, child country of birth, mother educational level, father educational level and household income.  Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to test for significant differences between groups for child age, mother age, father age and number of siblings.  In relation to childrens functioning at pre-treatment ANOVA will be used to test for significant differences between groups on the Preschool Anxiety Scale, Child Behaviour Checklist, Emotional Awareness Questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and Parenting Sense of Competence Scale and Parenting Stress Index. 
In order to evaluate effects from pre-post treatment, a series of repeated measures, between groups, 2 (Condition: Treatment, Waitlist Control) x 2 (Time: Pre, Post) ANOVAs will be conducted for each of the dependent variables separately. Effect sizes for the Condition x Time interaction will be calculated using Hedges g and will be based upon the changes scores for each conditions mean form pre- to post-treatment. Reliable and clinical change will also be computed to evaluate the meaningfulness of change within each condition. 
 In order to assess for maintenance effects at 3-month follow-up, a series of repeated measures ANOVAS (pre, post, follow-up) will be conducted with the treatment participants only, as the waitlist group cease to be part of the study after post-assessment.  The significance of multiple follow up tests will be determined by using Bonferroni adjustments and partial eta squared will be computed to estimate effect size. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are investigating the use of a parent-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) program for treating anxiety difficulties in children aged four to six with Aspergers Syndrome/High Functioning Autism. Parent-based CBT programs offer an alternative to traditional child-based CBT programs which may be too intellectually demanding for children under the age of seven. Moreover, parent-based CBT programs have be found to effective in treating anxiety in young neuro-typical children and older children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. The design is between groups, repeated measures RCT in which parents will be assigned to one of two conditions: treatment or waitlist control. 

It is hypothesized that from pre- to post- treatment children of parents in the CBT group, compared to children of parents in the waitlist control group, will demonstrate a significantly greater improvement in emotional awareness and a significantly greater reduction in anxiety. Additionally, it is hypothesized that from pre- to post- treatment, parents in the CBT group, compared to parents in the waitlist group, will demonstrate a greater reduction in parenting stress and parenting distress as well as a greater improvement in parental self-efficacy and parental satisfaction. Finally, it is hypothesized that pre- to post- treatment improvement for children and parents in the CBT group will be maintained or improved upon at 3-month follow up.
