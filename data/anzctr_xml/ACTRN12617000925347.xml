  <interventions>
    <interventions>Clear orthodontic aligners (Invisalign) to move teeth.

Test subjects- 60 participants will be treated orthodontically using Invisalign aligners. The aligners are to be worn 22 hours per day. Plaque samples will be taken and analysed prior to the start of treatment and at 6 months of treatment. Presence of white spot tooth lesions and gingivitis will be assessed at these 2 time periods. 

The aligners will be prescribed and inserted by orthodontic postgraduate students under the supervision of fully qualified orthodontic specialists, or by orthodontists at private orthodontic practices.

      <outcome>The association between presence of individual bacterial taxa and the type of orthodontic appliance.

Collection of plaque from the labial surfaces of maxillary lateral incisors and 2nd premolars and the microbiota will be analysed and identified in the laboratory by ion semiconductor sequencing. </outcome>

      <outcome>To analyse the association of individual taxa with the presence or absence of gingivitis, comparing the type of the orthodontic appliance being used. This will be tested for by visual inspection of the gums using the 'Gingival Index' as described by LÃ¶e and Silness. The student researcher will be calibrated to carry out this index.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>There has not been any previous study comparing the microbiome present in the oral cavity of patients being treated with aligners vs brackets. Tanner et al studied the proportion of patients having a particular type of bacteria in the oral cavity with WSL (white spot lesions) vs without WSL and high gingivitis vs low gingivitis. There was a difference of 30% (70% of the patients with high gingivitis vs 40% of patients with low gingivitis) for some of the predominant bacteria, such as Prevotella Cluster IV. The calculation of the present sample size was based on the ability to detect a difference in the proportion of patients (having various types of bacteria in the oral cavity=primary outcome) of 30% between the aligner and the bracket groups (70% vs 40%) with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80%. This calculation indicated that 49 participants were required in each arm; this was rounded up to a total of 120 to account for losses to follow-up.

Statistical analysis:

Primary Outcome: Logistic regression will be used to estimate association between presence of individual bacterial taxa and the type of orthodontic appliance.
	
Secondary Outcome: Logistic regression models will be fitted to analyse the association of individual taxa with presence or absence of gingivitis or WSL, adjusting for the type of the appliance being used.
Estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated, along with any P-values for any hypothesis tests.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research will compare the individual bacterial taxa between 2 orthodontic appliances, the fixed self-ligating bracket system and Invisalign clear aligners. The association of individual taxa and the presence or absence of white spot lesions and gingivitis for both orthodontic techniques will be analysed.</summary>
