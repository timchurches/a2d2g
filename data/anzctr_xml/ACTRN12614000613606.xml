  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single centre, open-label, single dose crossover study testing two oxymorphone transdermal patch formulations in a total of 15 healthy participants.   The two formulations contain different patch excipients/ingredients.  

Eligible participants will receive 2 x 3 day applications of transdermal patches containing 56.8 mg of oxymorphone per application in combination with TPM (tocopheryl phosphate mix) with a 4 day washout period between applications. A subsequent 4 day in-house stay will follow to ensure washout of the oxymorphone to a safe level prior to discharge, in total subjects will remain in clinic for approximately 15 days.

During the entire study period, participants will receive naltrexone 50mg orally twice a day to block the systemic effects of oxymorphone.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two formulations will be tested to investigate different patch excipients/ingredients; each participant will have both patches applied with a washout period in between</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the single dose PK profiles of oxymorphone delivered transdermally from two oxymorphone patch formulations, and of the active metabolite.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic profile will be assessed through collection of blood samples at various time points during each 3 day patch application and during the wash out period. A total of 43 blood samples will be collected from each participant and analysed</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the systemic exposure to the two primary excipients of the oxymorphone patch.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic profile will be assessed through collection of blood samples at various time points during each 3 day patch application and during the wash out period. A total of 43 blood samples will be collected from each participant and analysed</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the single dose safety and tolerability of oxymorphone delivered transdermally from two experimental patch formulations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>* The frequency of AEs
* The frequency of skin irritation at site 
* Clinically relevant changes in vital signs 
* Clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests and assessments monitored at screening, check-in, Day 4, Day 11, discharge and follow up (5-7 days post discharge)
