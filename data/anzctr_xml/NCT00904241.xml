  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  All newly diagnosed patients with suspected neuroblastoma, suspected
             ganglioneuroblastoma, or suspected ganglioneuroma/maturing subtype seen at Children's
             Oncology Group (COG) institutions are eligible for this study

               -  There will be no penalty under any circumstances for enrollment of a patient
                  whose definitive institutional diagnosis, or central review diagnosis, is found
                  to be a tumor other than neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, or ganglioneuroma/
                  maturing subtype

          -  Patients may not have received chemotherapy prior to enrollment on ANBL00B1 and
             procurement of study-related tissues with the following exception:

               -  Patients that in the opinion of the treating physician are too ill to undergo
                  pre-treatment tissue biopsy and require EMERGENT chemotherapy may be enrolled on
                  ANBL00B1; documentation of the emergent nature of therapy initiation is required

          -  It is required that a good faith effort (documented by specimen tracking) be made to
             submit a neuroblastoma sample (tumor, metastasis, and/or tumor-involved bone marrow)
             of sufficient quality for MYCN analysis in the Neuroblastoma Reference Laboratory in
             order for any newly diagnosed patient to be enrolled on ANBL00B1; this should be
             obtained prior to initiation of therapy

          -  Exceptions

               -  In rare cases, patients may be deemed too ill to undergo pre-treatment tissue
                  biopsy and require EMERGENT therapy; the following eligibility guidelines apply
                  to these cases:

                    -  For presumed INSS stage 4S patients: Efforts to submit tumor tissue (e.g.,
                       primary tumor, skin nodule, or metastatic site) within 96 hours of EMERGENT
                       therapy initiation should be made; however, if the child is deemed too
                       unstable for such a procedure they may still be enrolled as long as
                       pre-treatment peripheral blood and serum have been submitted

                    -  For all other INSS stages: tumor tissue should be obtained as soon as
                       possible within 96 hours of EMERGENT therapy initiation; patients without
                       tumor tissues submitted within this time-frame are not eligible for
                       enrollment

                         -  Note: it may not be possible to obtain all necessary tumor biomarkers
                            for therapy stratification in such cases; if a patient enrolled on
                            ANBL00B1 undergoes an additional diagnostic procedure within 96 hours
                            of initiating therapy, additional tumor specimens may be submitted to
                            obtain biomarkers used for risk classification; the decision to perform
                            such procedures, and/or submit these specimens, is to be made by the
                            managing clinicians and should reflect the clinical need to know the
                            status of such biomarkers

                    -  Patients enrolled on ANBL1232 in Group A (either A1 or A2) will not have a
                       tumor biopsy or resection upfront; tumor tissue submission is therefore not
                       required for these patients to enroll on ANBL00B1; a peripheral blood and
                       serum sample is the only specimen required to be submitted for this group of
                       patients; should they undergo a biopsy or resection at a later date tumor
                       can be submitted for biomarker testing at this time

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent

          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute
             (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met</inclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This research trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from patients with newly
