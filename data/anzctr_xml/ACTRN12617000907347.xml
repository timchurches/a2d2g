  <interventions>
    <interventions>Neonates, with no existing respiratory conditions and no respiratory support, who have a nasogastric tube in-situ for feeding purposes will be enrolled in the study. When these neonates are due for a tube change, an appropriately sized Edi catheter will be inserted instead and used as a feeding tube. The catheter will be connected to a Servo-n ventilator and the Edi signal will be recorded for 4 hours which is the duration of the study. After 4 hours, the catheter will be disconnected from the ventilator and used as a standard feeding tube. 
Intervention adherence will be assessed by participating researchers, research nurse and nurse educators through regular communication with data collector. The project will also be discussed during regular research meetings. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation:
Using the estimated mean (+/-SD) Edi peak of 11+/-3 in term neonates, a sample size of 16 preterm and 16 term neonates, will be required to see the mean Edi difference of 30% for alpha 0.05 and power 0.80. 

Planned Statistical Analysis:
Differences between groups will be determined by:
Chi-square or Fishers exact test for categorical data
t test for parametric continuous data
Wilcoxon rank-sum for non-parametric continuous data
Population means, standard deviations, and ranges will be calculated for the duration of the study.
Analysis of variance measures will be performed to compare the population means for each of the states.
Statistical significance is defined as P &lt;0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a new ventilatory technique in neonates to aid babies with respiratory distress. It uses the baby's diaphragmatic electrical activity as a trigger for each breath. This electrical activity is measured using a special nasogastric tube (Edi catheter) with electrodes at the level of the diaphragm. To date, there is a little data on the Edi signal in neonates with no existing respiratory conditions and on no respiratory support. By gaining a reference Edi data range, clinicians will be better equipped to titrate NAVA levels in ventilated neonates. We hypothesise that Edi peak and Edi min were higher in (1) Higher gestational age group, (2) awake and postprandial states and (3) after caffeine administration (caffeine is only administered to those infants using the medication as part of their hospital treatment).	</summary>
