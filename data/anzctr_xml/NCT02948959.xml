    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria :

        Children 6 to &lt;12 years of age, with a physician diagnosis of persistent asthma for =12
        months prior to Screening, based on clinical history and examination, pulmonary function
        parameters according to Global initiative for asthma (GINA) 2015 Guidelines and the
        following criteria:

          -  Existing background therapy of medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with second
             controller medication (ie, long-acting ß2 agonist [LABA], leukotriene receptor
             antagonist [LTRA], long acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], or methylxanthines) or
             high-dose ICS alone or high dose ICS with second controller, for at least 3 months
             with a stable dose =1 month prior to Screening Visit 1.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) =95% of predicted
             normal or pre bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt;0.85 at Screening
             and Baseline Visits.

          -  Reversibility of at least 10% in FEV1 after the administration of albuterol/salbutamol

                  levalbuterol/levosalbutamol), other than as a preventive for exercise induced
                  bronchospasm, on 3 or more days per week, in at least one week during the

    <summary>Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age with uncontrolled
      persistent asthma.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age with uncontrolled persistent asthma:

        -  The safety and tolerability of dupilumab.

        -  The effect of dupilumab in improving patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

        -  The dupilumab systemic exposure and incidence of anti-drug antibodies.

        -  To explore the association between dupilumab treatment and pediatric immune responses to
           vaccines: any vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and/or seasonal
           trivalent/quadrivalent influenza vaccine.</summary>
