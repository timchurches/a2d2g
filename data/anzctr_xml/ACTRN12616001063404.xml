  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention involves participation in the myMoves program - a self-management program consisting of 5 Lessons delivered over an 8 week period. Lessons are delivered via email with support from a physiotherapist via telephone and/or email. The myMoves program aims to build the knowledge and skills required to self-manage physical activity levels over the long term, and reduce sedentary behaviour. Lesson 1 consists of introductory material regarding  physical activity, chronic health conditions and ageing. Lesson 2 focuses on understanding the FITT principles of physical activity (frequency, intensity, time and type), including how to increase and reduce activity levels as needed. Lesson 3 focuses on identifying barriers and building the skills of problem-solving and planning. Lesson 4 focuses on building sustainable activity habits. Lesson 5 focuses on prevention of relapse and summarises the program. Each Lesson is accompanied by one Chapter of The Stories and a Worksheet. The Stories consist of the stories of 6 individuals which follow the participants through the course. The Worksheets are designed to help participants build the skills covered in each Lesson, such as problem-solving and pacing of activity.

The program is tailored to individuals preferences. At the end of Lesson 1 individuals choose whether they want to focus on a program that aims to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase light physical activity (myMoves Up); increase levels of moderate physical activity (myMoves Fit); or a program focusing on improving functional strength (myMoves Strong). The program content (ie Lesson content and Case Stories) is then structured to focus on these specific areas. myMoves Up focuses on individuals making small changes in their everyday life to reduce both the overall time they spend sitting or lying, as well as breaking up prolonged bouts of sedentary behaviour. myMoves Fit focuses on individuals gradually increasing the amount of moderate physical activity they are doing over a week - with a focus on participation in activities that they enjoy and that fit with their lifestyle and ability. There is no set amount of activity prescribed as every individual will need to tailor their activity to suit their own situation and context, however the program does include education regarding the current physical activity guidelines set by the Australian Dept of Health and the World Health Organization. However, individuals will be encouraged to work towards these guidelines slowly and steadily. myMoves Strong will focus on building simple strengthening activities into daily living. Again, there is no program prescription as each individual needs will be different. Instead individuals will be supported to build their own strengthening program with small strengthening activities included in activities of daily living, for example, squats whilst packing the dishwasher and calf raises while brushing their teeth. Also, how activities such as climbing stairs and carrying shopping bags can be easily incorporated into a strengthening routine.

Participants are supported via a telephone and/or email at least once per week. This will allow researchers to monitor adherence to the program, support participants in understanding content and building skills, and gain feedback on program materials and content. It is anticipated that participants will spend 2-4 hours per week on the program, including reading of materials, completing worksheets, discussion with myMoves team via telephone and email, and general consideration and application of program content and skills to their week. This time can be spread over the week as is convenient to the participant. It is anticipated that phone calls will be approximately 10 minutes in duration, with regular checking in with each call and/or email to see when and how the participant would like to be contacted next. 

There is currently no software to monitor adherence, although this is anticipated to be a future development if future funding can be secured. Currently adherence is measured through self-report measures, including questionnaires regarding completion of lessons and duration.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed from all participants at all pre-specified time points, pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 3 months following completion of the program. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe sample demographics and characteristics. Repeated measures ANOVAs will be used to assess for differences in continuous data within the group over time (with a p-value of &lt;.05 set for statistical significance). Should differences be found, paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections will be applied to evaluate changes within the group over each time period. If data is non-parametric then Wilcoxon sign-rank test will be applied instead.  Categorical data will be assessed using McNemars chi-square test. Data analysis will also entail analysis of subgroups where specific outcomes are particularly pertinent to specific groups, e.g. individuals with low vs high levels of baseline physical activity. All data analysis will be conducted using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 for Mac.

As this is an initial feasibility and acceptability study, specific sample size calculations were not undertaken. The data collected form this study will be used to inform sample size calculations on secondary outcome data, such as physical activity outcomes, for future testing of the programs efficacy. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The myMoves Program is an innovative remotely delivered physical wellbeing program, which aims to empower Australians with chronic health conditions to build and maintain safe and healthy physical activity levels. The program has been developed using the successful approach used to develop similar mental health programs by Macquarie Universitiys eCentreClinic, which are now offered by Australias MindSpot Clinic (www.mindspot.org.au). 
The myMoves Program offers older Australians with a chronic health condition a convenient and effective way of improving their physical activity knowledge and skills. The program teaches, supports and empowers older Australians to create an active lifestyle that is right for them, and suits their personal needs and wants. Importantly, because it teaches the principles of managing physical activity levels, rather than prescribing activity, the myMoves program is appropriate for older Australians with a broad range of physical ability levels and can be drawn upon as their physical abilities change over time.

The primary hypothesis for this study is that a remotely delivered self-management program, delivered via email and telephone, focused specifically on increasing physical activity will be feasible and acceptable to adults aged 65 years and over, living in the community with at least one chronic health condition.</summary>
