  <interventions>
    <interventions>CLiAC has been developed based on the aged care-specific clinical leadership qualities framework (ACLQF) and informed by key principles of the content and evaluation of the Clinical Excellence Commission Clinical Leadership (CEC-CL) program. CLiAC aims to achieve safe, high-quality person-centred and evidence-based care by assisting care managers to develop effective team relationships and consumer/client-centred leadership strategies that enable them to deal with the day-to-day realities of care service. 
CLiAC will be a structured program and delivered to middle managers from 6 residential aged care facilities and 6 community aged care services (intervention group) over 12 months by a program facilitator who will be mentored by an expert facilitator. 
The core topics will be covered in 4 modules via 10 full day workshops, combined with action learning, case scenarios, one-on-one interactions with a program facilitator, and individual practice improvement projects and process evaluation including 360-degree review.</interventions>
    <comparator>A no program control (NP) group will receive no special intervention or education. The NP group will continue usual care and practice for the duration of the study.</comparator>

The lead CI (JEON) was invited to explain the study and its processes to senior managers of residential and community aged care services at one of the participating aged care organisation quarterly meetings. The senior managers had the opportunity to ask questions and clarify any issues at the meetings, and then pass this information to their staff and middle managers. 

Initial site selection (site as unit of randomisation): according to the site eligibility criteria described earlier, the research team was advised of all potential eligible sites for the study by the participating aged care organisation central executive management. 

Recruitment of managers to participate in the Clinical Leadership in Aged Care (CLiAC) program: 1) An invitation letter was sent to all senior and middle managers of eligible sites. All potential participants agreed to inclusion on the basis that they may not receive the intervention during the study, but if they were randomly allocated to the non-intervention group, they would have the option of being offered the intervention once the project is completed.  2) All sites that met the eligibility criteria were approached and invited to participate in random order until 12 Residential Aged Care Facilities and 12 Community Aged Care Services had agreed to participate. For this, sites were stratified by type (RACF or CACS) and randomly permuted within each stratum using software available at www.randomization.com.  3) Once the researchers had established the research sites (where middle managers had agreed to participate in the clinical leadership program), restricted randomisation was used to balance the groups. The intervention is being conducted as part of the participating organisationâ€™s leadership development initiative, but the CIs and senior executives of the participating organisation have agreed that there will be no coercion imposed on the managers and the managers will need to volunteer to participate in the intervention and subsequent data collections. 

Recruitment of Managers in the Survey:  All managers from both intervention and non-intervention sites will be invited to participate in the survey.  Return of their questionnaire will be considered as consent (implied consent).
Recruitment of care staff in the Survey: An invitation letter and a set of questionnaires will be sent to all eligible staff of the participating sites from the research team. Return of their questionnaire will be considered as consent (implied consent).  The participants will be asked to return their completed questionnaire in the stamped return addressed envelope provided with the documentation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sites were stratified by type of aged care (residential vs. community aged care). Within each stratum, restricted randomisation was used to balance the groups by: size of the service (number of clients), span of control (staff and management ratio) and geographical location (rural vs. urban). This was done using a program in Gauss supplied by Professor Larry Moulton of Johns Hopkins University, co-author of the textbook â€˜Cluster Randomised Trialsâ€™.</sequence>

Apart from the managers receiving the clinical leadership program intervention (CLiAC), participating staff from all residential and community care sites will be blind to intervention allocation, however, due to the nature of the intervention maintaining blindness may not be feasible. To maximise blindness participating managers will be asked not to discuss their training with their work teams.
Research team members assessing the outcomes (assessor) and analysing the results/data (data analyst) will be blind to allocation of the intervention.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Strong, effective clinical leadership is critical in improving healthcare workforce retention and care quality, and reducing associated costs. Yet little evidence exists about the best ways to enable middle managers of aged care to develop clinical leadership skills, critical to the effective delivery of quality care. The trial is part of a larger study which has two aims: 1) to develop and promote evidence-based tools for improving leadership in the sector including a clinical leadership qualities framework (ACLQF) and a clinical and managerial leadership program in aged care (CLiAC); 2) and using a cluster randomised controlled design, to determine the feasibility and the effectiveness of CLiAC in improving workforce recruitment and retention and care safety and quality, which have not been previously researched in the aged care sector. Hypotheses include: the intervention group will have the following significant benefits over the non-intervention group.
HP1  enhanced work environment for aged care staff 
HP2  improved care quality and safety for aged care recipients
HP3  reduced aged care staff turnover rates
HP4  reduced aged care staff absenteeism 
HP5  improved aged care staff intention to stay and decreased intention to leave
HP6  reduced stress levels in aged care staff
HP7  increased job satisfaction for aged care staff
HP8  reduced cost of retaining and recruiting aged care staff, as well as cost of care
HP9  improved aged care managers knowledge and skills in leadership and management</summary>
