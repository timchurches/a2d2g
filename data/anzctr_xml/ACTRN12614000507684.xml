    <studytitle>Pre-surgical aromatase inhibitor combined with non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug treatment in breast cancer</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Randomised phase 2 trial of pre-surgical aromatase inhibitor, combined with non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug treatment or no additional treatment, in post-menopausal women with early stage operable breast cancer, to determine anti-proliferative response to aromatase inhibitor and effect of both agents on immune cell composition.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>in window of time between diagnosis and surgery, post-menopausal women with ER positive breast cancer will be treated with an aromatase inhibitor alone, letrozole 2.5mg daily oral tablet, or with aspirin 200mg twice daily, oral tablet, in an anti inflammatory dose. Adherence will be monitored by twice weekly nurse review, and blood estradiol levels.</interventions>
    <comparator>control is aromatase inhibitor alone.
study arm is aromatase inhibitor plus aspirin</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>change in biological markers, including inflammation and proliferation,  over 14 days of treatment. Pre- and post treatment tumour samples will be compared, and studied by immunohistochemistry for immune cell subsets, inflammatory cells, and tumour cell Ki67. Gene expression profiling using the same tumour samples will also be studied at a later stage.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days, or day of surgery if this is sooner.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>safety of aspirin over 14 days, including peri-operatively, by twice weekly nurse assessment before and after surgery, using standard toxicity grading, recorded on CRF for specific side effects of interest.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During 14 days of treatment, on day of surgery and at 4-6 weeks</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous work suggests that the presence of inflammation in post-menopausal breast cancer is associated with a poor response to aromatase inhibitor treatment. Here, an anti inflammatory drug aspirin is given with the aromatase inhibitor, and the breast cancer will be sampled before and after the treatment, given in the window of time between diagnosis and definitive surgery  </summary>
