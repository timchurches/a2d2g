Active Comparator: OPAL A plus standard wound care - 

Placebo Comparator: Placebo plus standard wound care - 


Treatment: drugs: OPAL A
OPAL A will be supplied in two formulations: as a Filtrate (0.5 mL per cm2 of ulcer area, applied into the ulcer cavity) and as a Cream (about 1 to 5 g applied as a thin smear on surrounding skin). Both formulations will be applied daily. However, if the ulcer begins to hypergranulate, the OPAL A Filtrate will only be administered once every 72 hours.
