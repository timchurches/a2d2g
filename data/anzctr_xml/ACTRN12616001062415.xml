  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment diet is a 1 wk diet Intervention in lean and obese individuals. This diet will contain double the energy content of the control weight maintenance diet. All food will be given to participants by the researchers, which they will take home to eat unsupervised. The composition of this diet will be made up of whole foods identical to the control diet, with the additional energy to be provided primarily by high energy liquid meal replacements such as Sustagen, protein supplement beverages and flavoured milk. Participants will be free to eat and drink allocated for for a given day at any time they please, They will simply be asked to ensure they eat all of the food provided to them. All food will be provided to participants to be consumed in place of their regular diets. Food diaries will be provided to participants and they will be asked to record all food eaten including any additional food/drinks they consume. Water can be consumed ad libitum.

Washout between control and treatment diets will be three weeks.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Details for the control diet are identical to the treatment diet except the total energy will be based on published equations (1) where the aim is to maintain stable weight. This equation to determine basal energy expenditure is based on calculating sleeping energy expenditure, multiplied by an activity factor (1.375);

sleeping energy expenditure = 47.3+4.05(fat free mass) + 1.12 (fat mass)

with fat and fat-free mass determined by DEXA imaging.

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis of the primary endpoint will be determined using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test comparing upper thoracic fat glucose uptake between diets because these data are always not normally distributed.

Power analysis
The primary outcome variable will be compared within individuals after the two diets in both the lean and obese groups. Power calculations are based on glucose uptake in upper thoracic fat; we have previously determined the standard deviation of the difference (SDD) after a chronic intervention in lean participants to be 19%. We have determined that a 10% change would be clinically and biologically meaningful and determined that 30 participants per group (Power 80%, a=0.05) would be required to detect this magnitude of difference.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of obesity is epidemic in Australia, and current public health, surgical and pharmaceutical strategies have had limited success in alleviating this health crisis. While numerous options are currently available for treatment of complications associated with obesity, most do not result in sustained weight reduction. Fundamentally obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, therefore the search for new methods that correct this imbalance are essential for effective long-term treatment. Rodent studies demonstrate that some types of fat tissue can burn a significant amount of energy, therefore targeting fat tissue via increasing its energy expenditure in humans is potentially a powerful tool for the treatment of obesity related disorders. Therefore understanding energy expenditure in upper thoracic fat in response to increased energy intake will impact possible future treatments aimed at manipulating energy expenditure in this tissue. 

Aim: to determine whether energy expenditure in upper thoracic fat tissue is altered by overeating.

Hypothesis: over-eating will increase energy expenditure in upper thoracic fat tissue.</summary>
