  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will undertake three exercises on three surfaces, in varying orders (i.e. this is a crossover study)

1.Lying on plinth on unstable surface (A novel exercise device - the OOV) in three different leg positions held isometrically for 30 seconds  (Crook lying, 90 degree hip flexion and straight leg raise position) with 2 minutes rest between efforts.  

Five minutes rest between changes in surface.

2. Lying on plinth on unstable surface (foam roller)  in three different leg positions held isometrically for 30 seconds  (Crook lying, 90 degree hip flexion and straight leg raise position) with 2 minutes rest between efforts.

    <concealment>An invitation email has been sent to coaches at a two local sporting clubs to determine interest in running an information session for potential participants. At that session researchers will provide information sheets and describe the study verbally. If potential participants agree to join the study, they will be asked to sign the consent form. Participants will then be allocated a time to attend the UTAS Exercise Physiology Clinic to participate in the trial.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be asked to choose a numbered chip from a hat to determine which condition will be trialled first (1=rest, 2=oov, 3=foam roller). This process will be repeated again (minus the first drawn chip) to determine which condition will be trialled second and third.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous research has found that abdominal muscle activation is greater when core stability exercises are performed on unstable surfaces compared with stable surfaces. The foam roller is one apparatus commonly used to create instability in a transverse plane while performing floor-based exercises to improve abdominal muscle activation. 

The Oov (http://www.oov.com.au/) is a newly designed apparatus intended to assist the individual in maintaining a neutral spine, whilst also creating instability in both the transverse and sagittal planes; allowing the individual to perform core-strengthening exercises, stretches and mobility activities with correct spinal posture. In comparison to the foam roller, which is unstable in only 1 anatomical plane, the Oov is unstable in two anatomical planes. This increased instability may create greater activation of the trunk muscles, but no research into muscle activation while using the Oov has been conducted.

Each participant will perform three tasks: crook-lying (CL), single leg tabletop (TT) and straight leg raise (SLR). These tasks will be performed on a Pilates Trapeze Table under three different surface conditions: flat, foam roller and oov.
