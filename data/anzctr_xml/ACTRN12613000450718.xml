  <interventions>
    <interventions>We used a commercially available sodium butyrate formulation (SOBUTIR, Registered Trademark, Promefarm, Milan, Italy). Butyrate was administered orally at 100 mg/kg/day, divided in 2 doses, with a maximal dosage of 4 g/day, for 1 week. Number of tablets of sodium butyrate (1 gr/tablet) consumed by the child during the trial were reported in a specific form by the parents. A good compliance was considered the intake of at least 80% of the prescribed doses. Parents of the enrolled children were advised to avoid co-administration of other treatments, including anti-diarrheal drugs, antibiotics, probiotics or probiotics during the trial. Children continued their normal diet during the study period. During the entire length of the study, all CLD subjects were examined as outpatients and they had free access to the services of referred hospitals.</interventions>

    <concealment>This was an open trial on subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CLD. The purposes and the modalities of the study were illustrated to the parents during the first visit (Visit 1), and an informed consent was obtained from parents or tutors of each enrolled patient. Baseline clinical and laboratory data were collected during the week before butyrate treatment, and were considered representative of the usual pattern of each enrolled patient. In particular, the parents of each patient were instructed to record daily in a specific clinical chart: number of bowel movements, fecal volume, stool consistency (using a scoring system: normal = 0, loose = 1, semi-liquid = 2, liquid =3), and presence of incontinence. At the end of the baseline week of observation, the clinical chart of the child was collected and the patient was re-evaluated during a new visit (Visit 2). A full clinical evaluation was performed and serum, fecal and urinary electrolytes concentrations; together with serum pH, renin and aldosterone values were determined, as previously described. Fecal electrolyte concentrations were measured on stool samples collected daily during the last 3 days of baseline observational period. The parents of each enrolled subject received a written prescription about the modalities of sodium butyrate administration for 1 week associated with oral NaCl/KCl supplementation, as previously described. In the last 3 days of treatment we collected daily a fecal sample to study the effect of butyrate on fecal Na+ and Cl-  concentration. At the end of the week of treatment with butyrate, the patients were re-evaluated (Visit 3), and serum, urinary and fecal electrolyte concentrations were measured again. Primary outcome of the study is the reduction of Cl- and Na+ fecal losses induced by butyrate therapy. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine whether variables were normally distributed. The chi-square test was applied for categorical variables, and for continuous variables, differences between groups were analyzed by Mann- Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate if the effects of butyrate may depend by clinical or genetic factors. All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. Statistical analysis was carried out by the SPSS software for Windows 16.0 and by StatDirect 1.7.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD) is an inherited disorder characterized due to mutations in the SLC26A3 gene. The clinical picture of CLD patients range from severe neonatal diarrhea, with high risk of life threatening hypoelectrolytemia and dehydration events, to a relatively mild chronic form. In patients with CLD, oral supplementation therapy with a combination of chloride salts (NaCl and KCl) is essential in preventing episodes of dehydration that could result in mental impairment and renal dysfunctions. Unfortunately, this therapy is unable to limit the severity of diarrhea. 
Dietary fibres are fermented by intestinal bacteria microflora into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The role of the SCFA has been increasingly recognized for the management of diarrheal diseases. Butyrate is able to exert a powerful pro-absorptive stimulus on intestinal salts. In a child affected by CLD, we demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of oral butyrate, showing a progressive reduction to normal values in the number of bowel movements and stool volume, an improvement in stool consistency, and a reduction of fecal incontinence episodes. The aim of this study is to evaluated the therapeutic effect of butyrate in children affected by CLD.
