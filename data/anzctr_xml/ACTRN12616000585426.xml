  <interventions>
    <interventions>The proposed electronic CRPC Australian database (ePAD) is a multi-site, national prospective cohort study that will collect data regarding baseline patient characteristics, details at diagnosis, pathological characteristics, details regarding local treatment and use of Androgen deprivation therapy, details regarding diagnosis of castration-resistance, prescription of and effectiveness of each systemic therapy and survival. Additionally, factors that influence decision making around systemic treatment selection and the rationale for change of treatments will be captured.
Participants will be followed up until death and if lost to follow up will be censored at date last visit for analysis purposes. All data on participants will be sourced in the clinic or from medical records.
Primarily, data from ePAD will be used to determine the patterns of care amongst Australian oncologists, urologists and radiation oncologists, and allow comparisons across each group, </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>In order to compare clinical outcomes across different subgroups, Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be defined from survival data and constructed using SAS 'Registered Trademark' software. The stratified log rank test will be used to compare survival curves between different groups of participants. P-values of 0.05 will be considered significant.
Interim analyses:
Planned after enrolment of 100 patients (anticipated to be ~15 months after project initiation) to assess data quality, proportion of older or less fit patients enrolled, variation in treatment regimens used across sites, and progression free and overall survival.
Prevention of skewed data:
To prevent enrolment of a large number of patients from a single site skewing data such that overall results are not representative of widespread community practice, contributions from any one centre will be limited to a maximum of 20% of the total 500 patients.
The sample size of 500 patients will be the largest known dataset of real world mCRPC patients and this number was thought to be sufficient to allow descriptive analyses of the patterns of care within Australia.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose:
The primary purpose of this study is to develop an electronic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) Australian database called ePAD. The data from this will then be used to evaluate the patterns of care for Australians with CRPC.
 
Who is it for?
Patients will be 'recruited' at participating sites; these sites will submit an ethics application to enable them to collect patient data from routine clinical practice. This is a non-interventional study and purely data collection at the approved site/hospital.

Study details:
All participants enrolled in this study will have data collected at baseline and ongoing clinic visits. Follow up data will continue to be collected after the completion of patient enrolment which is anticipated to run until January 2019. Data collected will include patient characteristics, details regarding local treatment and use of androgen deprivation therapy, details regarding diagnosis of castration-resistance, prescription of and effectiveness of each systemic therapy and survival. Additionally, factors that influence decision-making around systemic treatment selection and the rationale for change of treatments will be collected. Data will be collected from clinic visits or from medical records. It is hoped that the findings of this study will allow researchers to determine the patterns of care provided to CRPC patients, and potentially improve knowledge of which treatment options may be the most beneficial for individual patients with CRPC.
