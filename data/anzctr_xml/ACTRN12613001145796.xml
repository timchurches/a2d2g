  <interventions>
    <interventions> The Friendly-Schools Plus teaching and learning resources use a strengths-based approach to focus on positive health rather than emphasising risk factors. The Year 4 and 5 teaching and learning resources are designed to address three key aspects of students school experiences shown to be related to improved social and emotional development: promoting positive peer relationships, promoting positive teacher-child relationships, and explicit teaching related to emotions, social knowledge and social skills. The resources aim to develop students social and emotional competencies to enable them to recognise and control their emotions; build positive relationships; show consideration for others; make thoughtful and sensible choices; and cope successfully with difficult situations. 
The Friendly-Schools Plus program is supported by 1 session of 6-hour training for school personnel and additional session of 6-hour training for classroom teachers. Training of school personnel includes: understanding social &amp; emotional learning; evidence-based policies; building leadership; seven steps for whole school improvement. Additional training for classroom teachers includes: evidence for class teaching; bullying prevention strategies; utilising teacher support resources. The program comprises a whole-school manual, 8-10 hours of classroom teaching and learning materials, delivered one hour per week, as well as online capacity assessment and planning tools (a one-off screening tool to help schools determine current strengths and future improvements for positive student outcomes). The overall program is delivered over two school terms.

The targeted intervention will be a modification of the well-established Cool Kids program. To reduce risk of stigmatisation, the program will be conducted by parents outside school so that only the school counsellor and the investigators will be aware of which children are in the targeted program. The self-help program involves 10 modules covering psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring for child and parents, graduated in vivo exposure, child management and interaction skills for parents, and general social  and relationship management skills for children. Detailed information materials and extensive practice exercises are delivered over the internet, where parents receive the majority of the information, but specific components are directed also to the children. Parents and children are encouraged to complete modules weekly (ie 10 weeks) but as a self-help program, they can work at their own pace. The program will be supported by school counsellors who attend a one-day training workshop conducted by the researchers. Each parent will have 4 scheduled meetings with their school counsellor at key points in the program to discuss goals and problem-solve difficulties. Parents will also be encouraged to contact the school counsellor for additional advice as needed. The overall program is designed to be delivered over 1 school term. 

Schools will be randomly allocated to one of four conditions: 1) Both Cool Kids and Friendly Schools; 2) Friendly Schools alone; 3) Cool Kids alone; 4) School procedures as usual (no intervention). The no intervention schools will receive Friendly Schools Plus at the end of the trial (24 months).
Questionnaire items to schools, counsellors, and parents, will assess use and implementation of both programs. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Approximately 6,000 students from grades 4 and 5 (ages 9-11 years) will be invited to participate in this project. This is based on an assumption that average enrolments in grades 4 and 5 are 80 students. Assuming a 85% participation rate, this will provide a total sample of approximately 5,100 students, with 1,457 students in each of the three treatment conditions and 729 students in the comparison group. It is estimated that 12% of the total sample (i.e., 612 children) will be identified in the targeted subsample.

The most conservative analyses will compare the three active treatment conditions. For the universal population, with a sample size of around 5000 (based on intent-to-treat), power will be sufficient to detect small effect size differences between interventions (standardised mean difference of 0.15; power .80; alpha .05). For the targeted population, a sample size of around 600 students will be sufficient to detect small to medium effect size differences between interventions (standardised mean difference of 0.3; power .80; alpha .05).

On the primary outcomes, self-nominated and peer nominated proportions of students identified as victims will be compared between conditions using log-linear analyses. Odds ratios will be determined to compare with international literature. The proportion of identified bullies can also be compared to see whether the programs have an impact on actual bullying behaviour. Continuous scores on the Personal Experiences Checklist (PECK; Hunt et al., 2012) will be analysed using random effects regression which allows for the test and control of school and class cluster effects. Analyses will be based on intent-to-treat to provide the most salient information for policy relevance. Missing data will be estimated using multiple imputation. Analyses will be conducted on both the overall sample (entire grade population) as well as on the subsample who were victimised at baseline. Similar analyses will be conducted on the additional outcomes. Post-hoc analyses will examine the influence of a variety of moderators on outcome. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the efficacy and costs of implementing two interventions to reduce peer victimisation among children in grades 4 and 5, through schools in Australia. One intervention, Friendly Schools Plus addresses the entire school and aims to create a more positive school environment and greater recognition of victimisation. The other intervention, Cool Kids is targeted directly to children who are more anxious and experience current victimisation, and teaches them skills to empower them to better manage their relationships. The project aims to evaluate the impact on peer victimisation, children's mental health and overall costs and benefits associated with each program alone as well as their combination. </summary>
