  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is based on The Best of Coping (Frydenberg &amp; Brandon, 2007), a coping skills training program developed for adolescents. The current intervention will be an adapted 'diabetes-specific' version of The Best of Coping (BOC). The BOC program teaches productive coping skills using a cognitive-behavioural framework. The modules in the BOC program cover aspects such as learning about productive and non-productive coping, problem-solving, thinking optimistically, goal-setting, time-management, and effective communication.The program employs an interactive approach to learning using role-play, modelling and constructive feedback. The current intervention will involve five weekly sessions lasting for two hours. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will continue to receive standard care at the Diabetes Clinic which includes support from a diabetes team including doctors, a dietician, a diabetes nurse and a social worker. </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be informed about the study by the principal investigator, who will make it clear that their treating physician will not be informed of whether they decide to participate or not. The principal investigator will give the participants the Plain Language Statement and Consent Forms (with a pre-paid envelope). In order to ensure that allocation to the two treatment groups is random and concealed during participant recruitment, this study will use the sealed envelope protocol. The Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit (CEBU) at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) will provide an appropriate number of sealed envelopes with randomly appointed treatment allocations. Once the principal investigator receives a participantâ€™s Consent Form she will open one envelope and that participant will be allocated to that specific treatment group. This protocol will be repeated for all the participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Successful management of type 1 diabetes includes adhering to a complex and often intrusive treatment regimen, which can be especially challenging and stressful for young people. This study aims to adapt and trial a coping skills training program The Best of Coping (Frydenberg &amp; Brandon, 2007) and to assess the programs efficacy in improving glycaemic control, coping skills, diabetes-specific self-efficacy (confidence in ones own ability to manage with diabetes), diabetes regimen adherence, and quality of life in adolescents aged 13-16 years with type 1 diabetes. Hypothesis: It is predicted that the BOC program will improve glycaemic control at the 3 and 12 month follow-up compared to the control group. Hypothesis 2: It is predicted that the BOC program will improve productive coping skills, self-efficacy, adherence to the diabetes treatment regimen, stress levels and quality of life compared to the control group at 3 and 12 months after baseline. </summary>
