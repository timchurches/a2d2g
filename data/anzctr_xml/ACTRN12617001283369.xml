    <interventions>Intervention arm: In addition to usual care, participants randomised to the intervention arm will also receive an exercise and education self-management program. The intervention implements the American College of Sports Medicine Physical Activity Guidelines for people with cancer (Schmitz et al Med Sci Sports Exer 2005;14). The program consists of two appointments with a physiotherapist. These will be 15 to 45 minutes in duration (depending on the needs of the participant). The first one occurs before surgery at the hospital in the outpatient setting and the second appointment occurs after surgery just before hospital discharge. These sessions include 1) assessing the patients readiness for physical activity behavioural change, goals and confidence; 2) verbal education with the patient +/- carers and family about physical activity; 3) provision of resources to support physical activity (including an activity monitor, exercise diary and pamphlet); 4) setting personalized physical activity goals with the patient and a home program; and 5) identifying barriers and enablers for the patient to achieve the physical activity goals. All participants will be prescribed a home walking program and this will be progressed towards performing 150 minutes per week at a moderate intensity based on the American College of Sports Medicine Physical Activity Guidelines for people with cancer (Schmitz et al Med Sci Sports Exer 2005;14). In addition participants will be prescribed a home resistance training program, using body weight, that are targeting major muscle groups and progressed towards performing this two to three times per week. The exercises including type of exercise, repetition number, frequency and duration are tailored to the individual patient's ability. The intervention is personalised to the individual participants needs because patients with lung cancer present with other comorbid disease, including depression and COPD, and therefore to improve efficacy a targeted approach to physical activity is required that addresses the participants individual goals and that can be prescribed from their current physical activity levels.
The patient will receive weekly phone calls to promote adherence to the set physical activity goals, discuss barriers/issues and progress exercise. The phone calls occur weekly between the first physiotherapist face to face appointment until hospital admission for surgery (duration depends on wait list for surgery), and weekly after hospital discharge to 3 months post-surgery. The duration of the phone calls will be 5 to 20 minutes each depending on the needs of the participant. Participants will be asked to keep an exercise diary during the intervention period to record their daily exercises and physical activity levels.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual medical, nursing and allied health care will be provided to both groups. Usual physiotherapy care does not routinely involve assessment or treatment pre-operatively or after hospital discharge following surgery. Inpatient ward based physiotherapy in the post-operative period (when patients are in hospital after surgery) will be provided to both groups as per usual care and this follows a clinical pathway (as per usual care). The physiotherapist providing the inpatient physiotherapy to both groups will be blinded to group allocation.  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>All data analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat approach: participants will be analysed in the group to which they were randomized, regardless of deviations from study protocol. We expect missing data will be missing completely at random (MCAR) so missing data will be ignored unless otherwise specified. For the primary analysis, the  EORTC QLQ-C30 physical function domain at 3 months will be compared between the two arms (intervention and usual care) controlling for EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline and the hospital site (used to stratify the randomisation) using ANCOVA. Prior to analysis, tests for normality will be undertaken and if the assumptions are violated, non-parametric (bootstrapping) methods will be used. For the secondary objectives, the effect of the intervention, measured by physical activity levels and self-efficacy, physical function, muscle strength and function, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, sleep and symptoms in patients with operable lung cancer, similar analyses will be performed at 3 month follow-up. To evaluate whether primary and secondary outcomes are maintained over time (3 and 6 months; quality of life to 12 months), a mixed-effects linear model adjusting for baseline will be performed. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be documented prior to data base lock.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the effect of an exercise and education self-management program on physical function and functional recovery in people undergoing surgery for lung cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, plan to undergo surgical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and do not currently meet physical activity guidelines. 

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups prior to undergoing surgery. Participants in one group will continue to receive usual care throughout the study. Participants in the other group will receive an exercise and education self-management program in addition to usual care. The program consists of two appointments with a physiotherapist (one pre-operatively and one before hospital discharge post-operatively). Additionally, the patient will receive weekly phone calls before surgery and up to 12 weeks after surgery to promote adherence to physical activity goals, discuss barriers/issues with their exercise and progress their exercise program. 

All participants will undergo a number of tests including measurement of physical function, quality of life and physical activity before surgery, at hospital discharge, and 3 and 6 months post-surgery. We will also follow up to look at quality of life, health care resource usage and the cost effectiveness of the intervention over 12 months from surgery, and survival up to 5 years post-surgery. This study will provide important information on the effects of an exercise based intervention for people with lung cancer.</summary>
