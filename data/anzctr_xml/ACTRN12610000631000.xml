  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study involves women who have had trouble falling pregnant.   The study plans to offer women a course of either acupuncture treatment plus lifestyle modification or lifestyle modification only designed to improve menstrual regularity and improve the likelihood of pregnancy.

Women who are trying to have a baby without success will be asked to either undertake acupuncture treatments plus diet and exercise programs for 3 months or to adopt a diet and exercise program only.  Both options are designed to increase fertility.   Acupuncture will be offered from either Campbelltown or a city clinic and each woman receiving acupuncture is expected to attend weekly for 1 hour.</summary>
