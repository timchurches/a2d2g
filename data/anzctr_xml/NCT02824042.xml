Experimental: Anetumab ravtansine - The evaluation of multiple ECG parameters and the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of anetumab ravtansine parameters when administered alone and together with itraconazole 100 mg oral capsules will be conducted in 2 sequential parts. On Cycle 1 Day 1, anetumab ravtansine will be given alone at a dose of 6.5 mg/kg in Part 1 and Part 2. On Cycle 2 Day 1, anetumab ravtansine will be given together with itraconazole at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg in Part 1, and at a dose of 6.5 mg/kg (planned) in Part 2.


Treatment: drugs: Anetumab ravtansine (BAY94-9343)
Anetumab ravtansine given IV On Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle Part 1: Cycle 1 Day 1: 6.5 mg/kg of body weight (BW) Cycle 2 Day 1: 0.6 mg/kg BW Part 2: Cycle 1 Day 1: 6.5 mg/kg BW Cycle 2 Day 1: 6.5 mg/kg BW (planned dose) Continuous treatment: Cycles =3 Day 1: 6.5 mg/kg BW once every 3 weeks (Q3W)

Treatment: drugs: Itraconazole
Itraconazole 100 mg oral capsules given by mouth Cycle 1 (Day 18): 200 mg twice daily (BID) (Days 19 - 21): 200 mg once daily (QD) Cycle 2 (Days 1-8): 200 mg QD 12 days in total (Part 1 or Part 2)
