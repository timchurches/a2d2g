  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Volcano Vascular Imaging Balloon Catheter is used for imaging and/or dilatation of native and/or stented coronary arteries.  The catheter is administered through a guide catheter during a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure in a cath lab, and is expected to be in the body for less than 10 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE): Cardiovascular Death, Non Fatal Myocardial Infarction, and Target Vessel Revascularization.  These will be assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG) and lab draws for cardiac enzymes.</outcome>

      <outcome>Major Adverse Cardiac Events: Cardiovascular Death, Non Fatal Myocardial Infarction, and Target Vessel Revascularization.  These will be assessed by ECG and lab draws for cardiac enzymes.</outcome>
