  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who undergo surgery (admission 1 night or greater) and are discharged with prescription opioid medication will be followed up by phone at 2 weeks post hospital discharge. This follow up will determine if opioid therapy has ceased and the handling of opioids post hospital discharge.  The phone call will take approximately 10min. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of surgical patients in the study cohort that have excess opioid medication at 2 weeks post hospital discharge (have ceased therapy and have left over dispensed opioids). This will be determined by what patients report during the phone interview. </outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks post hospital discharge</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of admitted surgical patients who receive opioid medication on hospital discharge. This will be determined by review of hospital pharmacy records. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Time of hospital discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Description of the post discharge pain experience of surgical patients who received discharge opioid medication after surgical care. This will be determined by what patients report at the phone interview. Specifically whether they have experienced severe pain post hospital discharge and their current pain score (0-10 verbal numerical rating scale) </outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 weeks post hospital discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of patients still requiring opioid analgesia 2 weeks post hospital discharge. This will be determined by patient self report at phone interview. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 weeks post hospital discharge</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>This study will involve a fixed term (8 week) audit period at each of 4 hospitals and a total estimated study cohort of 1500 patients is anticipated.  The large sample will allow a comprehensive snapshot of opioid handling post surgical discharge.

The intent of this study is to describe the extent of the community opioid reservoir post hospital discharge for surgical care and as such descriptive statistics (proportions / percentages/means/medians with appropriate measures of variability) will be the main results reported.  However, exploratory analysis of predictive factors for ongoing opioid therapy and high pain scores at 2 weeks post surgery and requirement for additional opioid prescription (including age, gender, type of surgery, pain history and opioid therapy at admission) will be performed.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will map the pain and opioid analgesia experience of patients following inpatient surgical care in a variety of hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. This study will determine if there is a significant opioid pool in the community which is sourced in the acute care setting along with the pain experience of patients undergoing surgical care.  Measurement of current handling is the first step in developing an opioid stewardship program.  </summary>
