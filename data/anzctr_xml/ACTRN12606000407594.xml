  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Patent Foramen Ovale(PFO) Closure System is a delivery system and permanent implant for percutaneous closure of the patent foramen ovale. Percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale is a way of closing the foramen ovale without opening up the chest. A small cut or incision is made in the groin area. A narrow tube called a catheter is passed into the incision and into a blood vessel. The catheter contains a special closing device, and this is passed up though the blood vessels to the heart. The closing device is moved into position at the foramen ovale and then released so that it keeps the two tissue flaps together. X-rays and ultrasound will be used during the procedure to evaluate the device placement. The patient will be monitored at one month, six months and twelve months to assess the patients response to the implant.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility ofa new Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) closure device. The foramen ovale is a hole in the wall that divides the two sides of the heart. Its present in the heart of a developing fetus, but normally it closes up soon after the baby is born. If it doesnt close up, its known as a patent foramen ovale (PFO).</summary>
