  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women with a diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer will be recruited from 4 Brisbane hospitals and randomised into one of three arms: supervised exercise program, unsupervised exercise program or standard care.
Intervention arms:
Intervention 1 - Supervised exercise program: Participants allocated to this group will receive a workbook that includes information relating to the exercise program.  All supervised sessions will be individual sessions led by an Exercise Physiologist.  Sessions will run from 20 mins to 60 mins. They will progressively increase over time.  The first intervention session is scheduled 6 weeks post surgery.  This intervention progresses women from a supervised setting to an unsupervised exercise setting over 8 months.  
Intervention 2 - Unsupervised mail-based exercise program with telephone follow-up support: Participants allocated to this group will receive the same workbook as those assigned to intervention 1.  Telephone support will be used to supplement the print information as well as to provide motivation for exercise adherence.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will provide valuable information in relation to the feasibility of integrating supervised versus unsupervised exercise interventions into clinical practice. It will also enable a better understanding of the physical and psychosocial benefits attained and sustained through participation in the interventions in comparison to current care.
The exercise physiologist will not be aware during the data collection testing phases which intervention arm the participants have been allocated to.</summary>
