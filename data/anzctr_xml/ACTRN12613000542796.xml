  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to either Usual Care, or one of two possible interventions.

Arm 1
Information: In addition to usual care, patients will receive a written resource Facing the future: Living with confidence after treatment for head and neck cancer.  This 61-page publication was developed by a number of health professionals involved in the treatment of people with head and neck cancer, and contains detailed information and recommendations about coping with issues such as diet and swallowing problems, oral health, fatigue, pain, stress, emotional concerns and communication. The resource has been reviewed by consumers and pilot tested at Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital, Herston, Australia.

Arm 2
Intervention: As with the Information Arm, patients will continue to receive usual care and the resource Facing the future: Living with confidence after treatment for head and neck cancer. However they will also meet with an oncology nurse who has undergone specific training in developing a tailored survivorship care plan. 
The face-to-face meeting will take between 30 and 60 minutes and will focus on issues which are of concern to the patient. For example the care plan might include a graded approach to improving fatigue, or a plan about how to get into a routine to manage oral health. It might include details about how to cope with social interactions and relationship concerns, or fear of eating in public. The care plan will be designed to not just list information  it will be designed to enable participants to work out how to feel more in control of their health, deal with anxiety and give them confidence about when and how to get professional advice as needed.  
Once the survivorship care plan is complete the patient will receive a written copy so that they can keep working on the issues in it. A copy will also be sent to their General Practitioner so that the GP is familiar with the issues the patient is working on can provide ongoing assistance as necessary.
Oncology nurses who are providing the intervention will undergo focused training which will include completion of a self-directed training manual and a day-long skills development session. During the delivery of the intervention the nurses will also participate in fortnightly clinical supervision, facilitated by study investigators highly experienced in health professional education and skill development. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: Patients will continue to receive the standard care provided at the clinic where they received treatment, including usual appointments with dieticians, speech pathologists or other health professionals.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Treating clinicians at the participating sites will identify patients who are potentially eligible and introduce the study to them, and ask patients if they are agreeable to speak to a research assistant who will explain the study in detail and obtain informed consent. Details of consented patients will be forwarded to the central project manager for allocation to a study arm using a computer-generated list of random numbers. 
Patient resources will be sent directly according to the allocation and when appropriate the nurse who will be providing the intervention will be provided with the patient contact details so that a time can be arranged to meet. 
The research assistant who will be conducting the follow-up measures will be blind to patient allocation.  If the research assistant  becomes aware of the patient allocation while completing follow-up measures then this finding is to be recorded, and later reviewed for possible bias.

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS v21. Descriptive statistics of patients demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline will be generated for each treatment group to consider the success of the randomisation. Summary measures at T1, T2 and T3 will be calculated as means for continuous variables and as proportions for categorical measures, including 95% confidence intervals. Separate analyses will be conducted for each outcome variable. For continuous variables, the difference between groups in the change in mean scores over time will be evaluated using a Linear Mixed Effects Model, and all available data. Otherwise, a logistic regression will be conducted using a Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model. A group by time interaction effect will be included in all models. All analyses will be done on an intention-to-treat basis. 
This study will generate qualitative data which will be critical in understanding the enablers and barriers to implementation of this model of survivorship care into routine clinical practice. 

There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to calculate an accurate sample size for a psychosocial intervention in H&amp;N cancer patients. There are limited data about meaningful change in scores in the FACT-HN although this is the most appropriate measure to capture the unique concerns of patient with H&amp;N cancer. Hence for this preliminary study, the sample size of 40 patients per group (a total of 120 patients) is based on our capacity to enroll and retain patients, and conduct the interventions and follow-up, within the limited timeframe.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the effectiveness of structured interventions to improve quality of life in head and neck cancer survivors. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more, and have a diagnosis of head and neck cancer for which you have completed treatment within the past month at one of the participating sites. Trial details: Participants in this trial are randomly (by chance) allocated to one of three groups. Participants in group 1 will receive a written resource, Facing the future: Living with confidence after treatment for head and neck cancer in addition to usual care. The 61 page publication was developed by a number of health professionals involved in the treatment of people with head and neck cancer, and contains detailed information and recommendations about coping with issues such as diet and swallowing problems, oral health, fatigue, pain, stress, emotional concerns and communication. Participants in Group 2 will continue to receive usual care and the resource Facing the future: Living with confidence after treatment for head and neck cancer. In addition they will meet with an oncology nurse who has undergone specific training in developing a tailored survivorship care plan. The face-to-face meeting will take between 30 and 60 minutes and will focus on issues which are of concern to the patient. For example the care plan might include a graded approach to improving fatigue, or a plan about how to get into a routine to manage oral health. It might include details about how to cope with social interactions and relationship concerns, or fear of eating in public. The care plan will be designed to not just list information  it will be designed to enable participants to work out how to feel more in control of their health, deal with anxiety and give them confidence about when and how to get professional advice as needed. Once the survivorship care plan is complete the patient will receive a written copy so that they can keep working on the issues in it. A copy will also be sent to their General Practitioner so that the GP is familiar with the issues the patient is working on and can provide ongoing assistance as necessary. Participants in Group 3 will continue to receive only the standard care provided at the clinic where they received treatment. Participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires at the start of the study, and 3 and 6 months later in order to assess their quality of life. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the two interventions will also be assessed.</summary>
