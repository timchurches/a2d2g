Experimental: Treatment (sargramostim and dinutuximab) - Patients receive sargramostim SC QD on days 1-14 and dinutuximab IV over 10 hours on days 4-7 (dinutuximab infusion may be extended up to a total of 20 hours per day for anticipated toxicities). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease control - The probability of remaining event-free as a function of time since enrollment will be estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. The complementary log-log transformation of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 12 month disease control probability will be used to construct confidence intervals of that probability. Only patients who can be confirmed to be free of detectable disease 12 months after enrollment, without intervening disease progression, will be considered to have experienced 12 month disease control.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the first 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of unacceptable toxicity, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 - A Bayesian rule will be used to monitor for excessive toxicity. Descriptive analyses of this safety information will be performed and will include the incidence of adverse events, severe adverse events, serious adverse events, and fatal adverse events. Type, frequency, and severity of laboratory abnormalities will also be analyzed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 4 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab - The average and standard deviation of estimates will be reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 4 hours, and immediately before end of dinutuximab infusion on day 4, 4 hours before, immediately before, 4-8 hours, and 4-10 days following dinutuximab infusion on day 5 of course 1, and then prior to the start of course 2</timepoint>

    <summary>This phase II trial studies how well dinutuximab works when given with sargramostim in
      treating patients with osteosarcoma that has come back after treatment (recurrent).
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may find tumor cells and help kill them.
      Sargramostim may help the body increase the amount of white blood cells it produces, which
      help the body fight off infections. Giving dinutuximab with sargramostim may work better and
      kill more cancer cells.</summary>
