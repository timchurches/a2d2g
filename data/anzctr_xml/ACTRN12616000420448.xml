      <outcome>Safety- The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE) will be used to classify and grade the intensity of adverse events after each treatment cycle.
AEs include the following;
- All suspected adverse drug or device reactions
- All reactions from drug or device  overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, toxicity or
failure of expected pharmacological action (if appropriate)
- Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening (severity, frequency) of pre-existing illnesses
- Injury or accidents.
- Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat examination)
- Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond
ordering a laboratory test).
- Any untoward event that occurs after the protocol-specified reporting period, which the Investigator believes may be related to the study drug or device.</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>1. Adults (18 years or over) with metastatic or locally recurrent gastro-oesphageal cancer
which:
a. has arisen in any primary gastro-oesophageal site (oesophago-gastric junction
(GOJ) or stomach); and
b. is of adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma histology, and
c. is evaluable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST

7. Adequate cardiac function (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 'greater than or equal to 50% or above the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the Institution (whichever is lower). Cardiac function should be assessed within 3 months prior to randomisation, but after completion of any anthracycline containing chemotherapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this Phase III study is to determine whether regorafenib is effective in prolonging survival in patients with Advanced Gastro-oesophageal Carcinoma

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with advanced (metastatic or locally recurrent) Gastro-oesophageal Carcinoma
which has not responded to 2 lines of prior anti-cancer therapy.

Trial Details: 
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants will either take regorafenib (Group 1) or a placebo (Group 2) tablet oncer per day on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle. Treatment will continue until disease progression or prohibitive adverse events. Participants will not know whether they are taking regorafenib or the placebo until after the trial is completed. Participants will be followed up every 2-4 weeks in order to evaluate how they are responding to treatment. </summary>
