Experimental: BNP + Health Management - Subjects will provide information from home regarding weight,signs and symptoms, and will perform BNP self testing. This information including BNP results will be used by the investigator as an aid to treatment decisions. BNP results are blinded to subjects.

Active Comparator: Health Management - Subjects will provide information from home regarding weight, signs and symptoms, and will perform BNP self testing . BNP results will be blinded to the investigator and subject; weight, signs and symptoms will be used by the investigator as an aid to treatment decisions

Placebo Comparator: Control - Subject will provide information from home regarding weight, signs and symptoms and will perform BNP self testing. All these data will be blinded to the investigator. BNP results will be blinded to the subject.


Other interventions: Interventions with heart failure medications
Therapeutic interventions with heart failure medications per decision of treating physician for subjects in all study arms but using the different information available in each study arm.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average number of "hard' events per subject - With hard events defined as:
HF related death,
HF related readmissions to the hospitaL,
IV treatment with diuretics or unusual oral diuretic change in ER
Unplanned outpatient treatments for decompensated HF</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over 180 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Adults (18 years of age and &lt;75 years of age); AND

          2. Admitted to the hospital or treated in an outpatient clinic with a diagnosis of
             decompensated HF for which treatment will be administered;

        i. BNP &gt; 300 pg/mL (or NT-pro-BNP &gt; 1500 pg/mL) during hospital admission or clinic visit.

        OR c. Seen in an outpatient setting (i.e. heart failure clinic, general practice or
        cardiology office, urgent care unit) with a documented history of HF and with signs of
        worsening HF condition or decompensation, where worsening HF condition is defined as one or
        more of the following;

        i. Increase in NYHA class with worsening symptoms (i.e. dyspnea, fatigue) at same level of
        activity ii. Symptoms requiring change in dosage of one or more of the following
        medications:

          1. diuretic

          2. beta blocker

          3. ACE inhibitor iii. Physical evaluation consistent with worsening HF signs (i.e.
             elevated JVP, ankle edema, dyspnea, abdominal distension, &gt;4 lb or &gt;1.8 kg weight
             increase in past week) iv. HF admission in last 30 days with a documented BNP &gt; 300
             pg/mL (or NT-pro-BNP &gt; 1500 pg/mL) during or since admission AND d. Presence of left
             ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;40%); e. Successfully trained and
             deemed proficient on how to perform a fingerstick and to use the Test System. Each
             subject will undergo two proficiency assessments.

             i. The first assessment will be performed at the time in which the subject is found to
             meet the inclusion criteria, and deemed willing, able and reliable to complete the
             study tasks, and following initial training on the use of the test system. Successful
             completion of this first proficiency assessment will result in the enrolment of the
             subject into the study.

             The second assessment will be performed following one week (7 days Â± 2 days) of home
             testing to demonstrate retention of the training. Successful completion of this second
             proficiency assessment will result in randomization of the subject into one of the
             three study arms of the study. Failure to demonstrate proficiency at this second
             assessment will result in the withdrawal of the subject from the study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria:

               1. Unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent;

               2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that is a primary diagnosis; or secondary diagnosis
                  that is concomitant with the primary diagnosis of decompensated HF and for which
                  treatment will be provided.

                  Note: A history of ACS is not cause for exclusion if it is not concomitant with
                  the present decompensated HF for which admission is being made. Small elevations
                  in cardiac troponin that are considered by the treating physician to be
                  associated with myocardial injury due to the acute decompensated HF and not due
                  to a concomitant ACS or myocardial infarction are not a basis for exclusion.

               3. Previous cardiac transplantation - or cardiac transplantation anticipated within
                  3 months;

               4. Current or planned use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), use of
                  outpatient intravenous inotropic HF therapy, major surgical procedure or
                  percutaneous coronary intervention within 3 months;

               5. Life expectancy less than 6 months due to causes other than HF or cardiovascular
                  disease (e.g., cancer);

               6. End stage renal disease (dialysis dependency);

               7. Receiving any investigational medication;

               8. Hematocrit outside the 25 to 50% range of the HeartCheck system;

               9. Prisoner or other institutionalized or vulnerable individual;

              10. Dementia, tremors or other impediments to performing daily home BNP testing via
                  fingerstick (unless BNP testing will be conducted by qualified caregiver);

              11. Deemed by the investigator not to be likely to comply with study-mandated
                  procedures or instructions;

              12. Residence in regions where either transmission of test system data or home visits
                  are not possible.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if heart failure subjects whose treatment is
      assisted by home BNP measurements integrated into a home health management system will have
      better clinical outcomes than subjects whose treatment includes home health management
      without BNP or than subjects treated by standard care.</summary>
