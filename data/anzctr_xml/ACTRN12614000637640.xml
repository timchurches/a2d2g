Both treatment with rocuronium as well as the control (saline) treatment will be administered sequentially to all participants within a 5 minute time interval during surgery. The sequence of administration is subject to randomization and blinding. </concealment>
    <sequence>randomization sequence is generated via randomly permuted blocks. The allocation to "rocuronium first" or "saline first" is placed in a sealed envelope and each envelope his handed to the attending anaesthetist in theatre who will administer treatment and placebo in the allocated order with the researcher as well as the surgeon to remain blinded to this allocation.   </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The effect of muscle relaxation on latissimus dorsi ease of flap dissection are unknown though the technique has frequently ben recommended. The purpose of the trial is to measure the facilitation of flap dissection by means of assessing the force (N) required to lift the flap a few centimetres off its surface, thus mimicking surgical handling of the flap. The measurement is done with a sterile scale. 3 measurements will be done: 1. baseline, 2. after either rocuronium or saline administration intravenously, and 3. after administration of the drug (rocuronium or saline) not yet given at 2..
The measurement will be done by a researcher blinded to the administration sequence of the drugs.
