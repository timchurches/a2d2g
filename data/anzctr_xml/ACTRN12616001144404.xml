    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 650 patients would provide 90% power at p=0.05 to detect a difference of 4 mmHg in the primary outcome, assuming an SD of 15mmHg. A sample of 650 would also have 85% power to detect a 3mmHg difference in average 24hr SBP (SD 12 mmHg) and 85% power to detect a 25% increase in proportion with controlled blood pressure (RR of 1.25) assuming 50% will be controlled in the control group. All calculations allow for a 10% dropout or data loss rate.  

All analyses of study outcomes will be conducted according to the principle of intention-to-treat.  The primary analysis of change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 12 weeks will be performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including the treatment arm and baseline SBP as a covariate. Continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed similarly. Additional analyses will include both 6-week, 12-week, 26-week and 52-week measurements in a longitudinal model including treatment arm, visit, and treatment by visit interaction as well as the baseline measurement. Within-patient correlations will be modelled using generalised estimating equations.  A similar approach will be applied to binary endpoints (e.g. hypertension control) with log-binomial regression used in place of linear regression. There will also be pre-defined subgroup analyses, including by baseline blood pressure, gender, age and hypertension treatment history.

    <summary>The QUARTET Trial is a double-blind randomised controlled trial of low-dose quadruple combination therapy (LDQT) versus current guideline-based care. This study was funded by National Health and Medical Research Council. It aims to recruit 650 patients with high blood pressure (untreated or not controlled on one medication). Patients will be randomised to LDQT or irbesartan. The primary outcome is the difference between groups in office systolic blood pressure at 12 weeks. </summary>
