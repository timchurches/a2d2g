  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two pharmaceutical interventions which will be given simultaneously to the intervention group, as studies have shown these medications to have synergistic analgesic activity.

The first is gabapentin, which is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue, which was developed as an anti-epileptic before becoming widely used in neuropathic pain. This medication is taken orally in three daily doses, and will be titrated up in increments of 300mg/day from 300mg to the maximum tolerated dose for an individual (usually in the range of 1800-2200mg/day, with 2200mg being the ceiling limit in this trial).
 
The other pharmaceutical being trialled is nortriptyline. Nortriptyline is a tri-cyclic antidepressant (TCA) which has recently come into vogue as a treatment for neuropathic pain. Nortriptyline will be taken orally once daily at the maximum tolerated dose for the individual (up to 50mg/day). Like gabapentin, this this dose will be titrated up over the course of 7-10 days, starting at 10mg/day.

Both of these medications will be taken by the intervention arm of this study between week 6 post-operatively and 3 months post-operatively (a total of 6 weeks).

The possible adverse effects will be explained to the participants in advance, and they will be given the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about the medications. Over the titration period, adherence will be monitored by telephone interviews with participants to monitor any adverse effects they may be experiencing. Participants will be instructed to return any unused medication to the researchers for disposal at the conclusion of their time in the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Following discharge from hospital after these operations, there are no formal medical management pathways, save radiographic scans to check for implant wear rates and correct placement. Pain management following these surgeries typically involves the patient being discharged with short prescriptions for non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (such as paracetamol and ibuprofen), and opioid analgesics (such as codeine). There is, however, no formal clinical pathway for the management of pain in these individuals following discharge.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or absence of chronic pain, as determined by a pain score equal to or greater than 4 (out of 10) on a visual analogue scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three (3) months post-operatively</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Predicting post operative pain from baseline data, which will be collected by the multiple psychometric questionnaires conducted at baseline, the results of the cold pressor test, as well as the participants' relevant medical records. This will be tested by the same visual analogue scoring system as above,</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six (6) weeks post operatively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Predicting pain post operatively in the group receiving routine management. This will, as above, be measured by the visual analogue scale, and the potentially predictive tools will be the psychometric questionnaires, and the cold pressor test.
