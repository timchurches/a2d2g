    <scientifictitle>In patients from rural regions who have undergone active cancer therapy, is the implementation of a survivorship care plan more effective than usual care in improving patient ability to self-manage psychosocial concerns? </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interventions include involvement of allied health professionals to assess and assist the patient to manage patient concerns, where warranted. Allied health professionals may include counsellors (help participants with specific concerns e.g. establishing reciprocal understanding with family and friends regarding health issues being faced following therapy and the effects on lifestyle, physiotherapists to manage physiological concerns e.g. lymphodoema, Dieticians to aid with concerns around weight and/or dietry balance, Dermatologists where skin irritations persist or occur independently for other reasons, Exercise physiologist, if required to assist with appropriate exercise to aid in recovery, Social Worker to help participants manage lifestyle changes related to social networks, Psychologist if required for concerns such as depression. Outcomes of allied health professional assessments will enable appropriate intervention to be designed within a survivorship plan.
Determination of the requirement for intervention is based on results from assessment of changes in each of the symptoms (fatigue, fear of cancer returning, depression, coping with home/work duties, learning to live with new normal), from baseline information. 

The timeframe is dependent on whether assessments from allied health professionals are warranted

Participants in this trial will be followed up until 30 months from recruitment</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparison is assessed with patients not receiving preventative interventions. That is, the initial data collecting phase will be the control group. The interventions required for specific concerns and the outcomes of those interventions will inform the primary and secondary outcomes with the aid of a survivorship care plan informed through questionnaire and interview. </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gain an understanding of what is being experienced by individuals following cancer treatment, to inform the creation of a survivorship care plan (SCP) dedicated to the psychosocial and best supportive care needs of the individual.
This outcome will be achieved using questionnaires and interviews.

The questionnaires used are PROMIS29 and the Distress Thermometer and will be analysed according to the scoring tools for each test with in-built result calculators.
The interviews will be coded and a Grounded Theory technique used to evaluate the needs of patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On completion of active therapy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine differences in needs between tumour groups and histological stages.
Statistical analysis tools used will be the t-test to compare the actual difference between the two means in relation to the variation in the data (different tumour groups). The p-test will be used to determine the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is attempting to gain an understanding of what is being experienced by individuals following cancer therapy in order to establish interventions where required to improve quality of life and therapeutic management. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years, diagnosed with any cancer and will complete cancer therapy during the final two weeks of this trials recruitment phase. The trial involves a set of three questionnaires at 3-monthly time intervals and an interview.
Where warranted, allied health professionals will assess and assist participants to manage their concerns after cancer therapy. Assessments will be conducted using questionnaires and interviews. The allied health professionals assessing the participants may include counsellors (to help participants with specific concerns such as establishing reciprocal understanding with family and friends regarding health issues being faced following therapy and the effects on lifestyle), physiotherapists (to help participants with managing physiological concerns such as lymphoedema), dieticians (to aid participants with concerns about weight and/or dietary balance), dermatologists (for concerns such as skin irritations), exercise physiologist (to assist with appropriate exercise to aid in recovery), social worker (to help participants manage lifestyle changes related to social networks), and psychologist (to aid with concerns such as depression). Outcomes of allied health professional assessments will enable appropriate intervention to be designed within a survivorship plan. The determination of the requirement for intervention will be based on results from assessment of changes in fatigue, fear of cancer returning, depression, coping with home/work duties, and learning to live with new normal in participants in comparison to baseline information. </summary>
