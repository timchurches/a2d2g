    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants who have expressed interest in participating in the study by contacting the principal investigator, will be screened over the phone by one of the student investigators and all communications will recorded.  Potential participants will be asked a series of questions to assess eligibility for the study, those who meet the criteria will be invited to the initial meeting if they are still consenting. 
The initial meeting with the participants will be held at the city campus of Victoria University. The entire process of the trial will be explained by the principal investigator. Participants will be asked to read information sheets regarding the trial and consent forms will have to be signed before participating in the trial.
Having satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and after signing an informed consent form, participants will be randomized into two equally sized groups, A or B, using a coin toss. Participants will be directed to take one of their allocated tablets, three times a day. Blinding of practitioners will be achieved by receiving the products in containers labeled either “A” or “B”. The researchers will be unaware of the contents of the containers. The supplier of the products will be advised not to announce the contents of the containers until the conclusion of the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Glucosamine sulphate is a supplement that is marketed as a joint builder. Potential benefits include: restoration in joint function, an increase in joint flexibility, and alleviation of joint pain. Previous investigations into glucosamine sulphate have found it to have a positive effect on cartilage regeneration within the knee joint, along with a lower incidence of adverse reactions when compared to other over the counter medications used to treat knee pain, such as non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

This study will aim to determine whether oral supplementation with a product containing GS is effective in reducing pain and improving physical function of the knee joint in young people suffering from regular (once a week), mild, undiagnosed knee pain. 
Male and female participants aged between 18-35 years of age will be recruited and randomly allocated into one of two groups:
1. Glucosamine sulphate containing product
2. Placebo (Maltodextrin, which is has no published effects on joint function)

The trial will last for 8 weeks, and a number of measures will be employed during this time to assess the effects of the glucosamine sulphate supplementation e.g. a daily log of medication usage and physical activity.</summary>
