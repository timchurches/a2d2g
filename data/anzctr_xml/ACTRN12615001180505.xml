    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. For missing data, the number of available observations will be reported. No assumptions will be made about the missing data. Baseline cohort characteristics such as age, sex, presenting problem will be compared between treatment groups using chi-square tests for categorical variables and independent sample t-tests (or the non-parametric equivalents) for continuous variables. The tests will be two-sided and considered statistically significant if p&lt;0.01. . The primary outcomes and secondary outcomes that are continuous variables will firstly be compared between study groups using either parametric (t-test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney) statistics, depending on the underlying assumptions of the test being met. Regression techniques will be used to model the effect of the treatment group (CPAP and usual care compared to usual care), with adjustment for potential confounders.

Sample size and power
Calculations are based on 90% power and an alpha level of 0.05 (PS Power and Sample Size Calculations, V 3.0, Jan 2009):
Respiratory rate: The mean decrease in respiratory rate under standard care of 4.1 breaths per minute (13%) (SD 5.8 breaths per minute) was determined from 1729 SJA-WA cases transported between 20.09.2012 and 19.09.2013 with APO (15% of cases), COPD (36%) or respiratory tract infections (49%). Assuming the SD of 10.4 observed in the pilot study, if there is an additional 20% difference in the respiratory rate in the experimental group, we need to study 60 patients in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal. 
Dyspnoea score: Based on prehospital data, the decrease in dyspnoea under standard care is approximately 1 unit (SD 3.1). Assuming the same SD, and an additional 2 unit difference in the experimental group, we need to study 25 patients in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal.
To ensure sufficient power to enable sub-group multivariable analyses and assuming a minimum prevalence of 16% (1/6) in each subgroup: (1) patients with respiratory rates &gt;=25; 2,17,24,25 (2) APO; (3) COPD; (4) respiratory tract infections; we plan to recruit 360 patients per group (for 1/6 prevalence we require 6 x 60 patients per group), i.e. 720 in total. We intend to have ethics approval and training scheduled prior to the commencement of the grant. Expanding the selection criteria to include severe respiratory distress and not solely APO, having CPAP masks in a larger number of ambulances and engaging more paramedics to recruit patients, we are confident that recuitment of the 720 patients required for this study is realistic and achievable over a period of 2 years.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare clinical outcomes for patients with severe respiratory distress who receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in addition to usual care to those who only receive usual care in the pre-hospital setting. 

CPAP is a central part of treatment for patients with severe respiratory distress in the emergency department (ED) and in hospital. The evidence for the use of CPAP in the pre-hospital setting is weak and studies have measured outcomes such as in-hospital mortality that can be attributed to in-hospital care. Furthermore, there is a paucity of robust studies from pre-hospital settings that do not rely on physician or critical care specialist managed care. Robust studies are essential to demonstrate the benefit of CPAP in the pre-hospital setting before the widespread introduction of the therapy into Australian prehospital clinical practice. 

The study will be conducted in the Perth metropolitan area. St John Ambulance (SJA-WA) provides all road-based emergency ambulance services in WA. All emergency calls for an ambulance in WA are received by SJA-WA service operations centre located in Perth. Ambulances are staffed by paramedics with advanced life support skills.

This study will use dyspnoea scores as a primary outcome. Dyspnoea (respiratory distress) is a highly distressing symptom: patients describe a sensation of air hunger or suffocation. Alleviating suffering from severe breathlessness is a top priority in the care of patients with severe respiratory distress. The American Thoracic Society stress dyspnoea can and should be measured. Dyspnoea scales have been shown to predict hospital admissions, in-hospital mortality and early readmission in acute exacerbations of COPD. As such, dyspnoea scales are an appropriate primary outcome measure for pre-hospital research in patients with respiratory distress. Any pre-hospital study that demonstrates a reduction in patient distress is likely to change ambulance practice in the same way that interventions that reduce pain would be implemented. 

In summary, severe respiratory distress is a medical emergency. CPAP improves outcomes in patients with severe respiratory distress in the ED and in-hospital setting but there is a paucity of information on the efficacy of CPAP initiated early in the Australian pre-hospital setting. It is incorrect to assume that interventions applied in-hospital have similar efficacy pre-hospital, due to the differences in capacity and capabilities between the two settings. Therapies shown to be efficacious in hospitals need to be evaluated in the pre-hospital setting to ensure their safety and effectiveness prior to introduction. This information is critical to establishing the evidence base underpinning this therapy prior to ambulance services incorporating CPAP as routine clinical practice. </summary>
