  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will have 6 month access to a web site which allows them to generate text for their own messages. Participants will also determine when the messages will be sent to their mobile phone. The frequency of use of the web site and messaging is at the participants own discretion. They are the most qualified to determine when they will need a prompt to consider their safety and drinking behaviour. The control group will have 3 months access to the web site messaging. This is a feasibility study. The researchers do not wish to lead the participants regarding message content or frequency. The web site will provide instructions on how to use the messaging but no suggestions for message content.  At the end of three months, both the intervention and control groups will have access to the intervention. This is to assess longevity of use and engagement with the web site.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control treatment is 3 months access to a web site which has a community chat page and instructions on how to use the pending messaging option. This is the same web site that the intervention group will access but the message function will be hidden from the Control group. At the end of 3 months the control group will be given access to the message component.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>SPILL IT is a small study which aims to assess whether young drinkers (aged 18-34) would use a web site which helps them to get reminders on their mobile phones to keep safe while drinking.  To ensure the safety messages are relevant, the young drinkers will write their own message and set the date and time when the message is sent to their phone. The reason for this is that plans to keep safe during drinking are forgotten when they have had a few drinks and are interacting with friends.  A text message to their phone, while they are drinking, may remind them of their plans and therefore stop them getting hurt.</summary>
