  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dental decay has been described as the most common disease of childhood that is not self-limiting or responsive to short-term pharmacological management.  Regrettably, Australian Aboriginal children have, on average, twice as many teeth affected by decay as other Australian children.  The disease is a particular burden for pre-school children who do not routinely have access to dental care provided by the state/territory programs.  The goal of this project is to develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a community-oriented, primary health care intervention to prevent dental decay among pre-school children in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.  The cluster randomized design provides a practical approach to the problem of small numbers of children living in remote communities. The results obtained from this research proposal would make an important contribution to the health care of Australian Aboriginal children and other disadvantaged children throughout the world.</summary>
