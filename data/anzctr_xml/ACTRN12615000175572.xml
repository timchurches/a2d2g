  <interventions>
    <interventions>Negative-pressure wound dressing by Smith &amp; Nephew called PICO.
PICO is a pocket sized portable device attached to laparotomy wound dressing via a long thin tubing.  
The device is left switched on for 7 consecutive days with no further dressing change required.  A negative pressure milieu of 80 mmHg (nominal) +/- 20 mmHg is applied to the wound surface.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Wound infection  -   Definition based on definitions published by VICNISS, the major healthcare infection surveillance organisation for Victoria.  This outcome is assesed by our research/stoma Nurses at Dandenong Hospital on day 7(up to day9) of having had surgery</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction.  Measured with satisfaction questionnaire on various aspect of patient's experience of his/her wound dressing.  Satisfaction level graded on a linear scale from 1- to 10.   This is completed over the phone at day 30 by researcher</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was determined to be 160 patients.  This is based on 
Power calculation for Superiority Trial.   we estimated number of SSI with conventional wound dressing is 20%,  Estimated number of SSI with PICO dressing is 5%.  Using Power 80%, alpha 0.05, number of patients per arm required is 73 patients.  We allow for dropouts and other events, so 80 patients per arm was derived.

Data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis
Number of SSIs will be compared between the two groups, using Pearsons Chi Squared test. Relative risk and absolute risk reduction will be calculated, and if there is a benefit to PICO, the number needed to treat. 
Risk factors will be analysed with appropriate statistical tools including Chi square, fishers exact, univariate/multivariate analysis, students (unpaired) t-test
2 tailed p values will be calculated, with a value &lt;0.05 considered statistically significant

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to assess a new kind of dressing, to see whether it reduces the rate of wound infections after abdominal surgery. The dressing is attached to a small, portable device that creates suction or negative pressure on the wound, to help suck away any fluid that leaks from the wound. 
These dressings have been assessed as being safe, and are already in use in the hospital. However, there is no conclusive evidence that they provide a benefit to patients by reducing wound infections.

We will hopefully answer that question, and help to provide better outcomes to future patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
This study is in part funded by the company that makes the dressing used. However, they do not provide any direct payment to the investigators, and do not have any role in collecting information or deciding what the results of the study are.
This research is being conducted by doctors and nurses working in Dandenong Hospital, under the auspices of the Monash School of Medicine.
