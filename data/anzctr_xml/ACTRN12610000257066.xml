  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is designed to determine if Internet-based cognitive therapy with minimal therapist contact can improve the efficiency of psychologists and general practitioners in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. In addition, the project will allow us to investigate the effect of an Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy intervention in a clinical sample. The primary hypothesis is that the Internet-based program will lead to a larger reduction in depressive symptoms than a wait list control condition.</summary>
