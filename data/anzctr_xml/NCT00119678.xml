  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn whether Abatacept can treat and
      prevent lupus flares; specifically, in patients with active lupus flares in at least one of
      three organ systems: skin (discoid lesions); inflammation of the lining of the heart
      (pericarditis), or inflammation of the lining of the lung (pleuritis/pleurisy); or
      inflammation of more than 4 joints (arthritis). All participants will receive prednisone or
      prednisone-equivalent treatment in combination with study medication. The safety of this
      treatment will also be studied.</summary>
