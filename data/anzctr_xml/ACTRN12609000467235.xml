  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty-eight male volunteers were sub-divided in three groups: ten presented chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD  69+/-9 years); nine presented chronic heart failure (CHF - 62+/-8 years) and; nine were healthy with 64+/-5 year-old (control). During all experimental protocol, the subjects were monitored at the chest-manubrio lead (MC5) to record the heart rate (HR) beat-to-beat. The ECG and HR were obtained from a one-channel heart monitor (TC 500, ECAFIX, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) and processed using an analog-digital converter Lab. PC+ (National Instruments, Co.,Austin, TX, USA), which represents an interface between the heart monitor and a Pentium III microcomputer. The signals were recorded in real time after analog to digital conversion on a beat-to-beat basis using specific software. The three groups the electrocardiography signal were obtained on the following conditions: 1) supine position for 15 min; and 2) supine position during the respiratory sinusal arrhythmia (M-RSA)for 4 min. The data were analyzed by the time and the frequency domain. Regarding the M-RSA indexes, the expiratory/inspiratory ratio (E/I) and the inspiratory/expiratory difference (IE difference) were calculated. All evaluations were performed on the same day.</interventions>
    <comparator>There was a control group where all volunteers were healthy for to compare the cardiac autonomic control. The control volunteers underwent the same evaluated of patients. Additionally, there were two patients groups: 1) volunteers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 2) volunteers with chronic heart failure.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria for COPD patients were: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) / forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt; 0.7 and FEV1 &lt; 60% of predicted; clinical stability for at least 3 months prior to the study; nonsmokers; no participation in a regular physically active program in for the last 6 months; and presentation of dyspnea under low and medium physical effort. Inclusion criteria for CHF patients were: previous history of stable symptomatic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, documented in at least six months (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45 % predict); no recent hospitalizations and no history of pulmonary disease or angina. Subjects in the control group were free of chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, immune, and metabolic disease.</inclusivecriteria>
