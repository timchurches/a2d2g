  <interventions>
    <interventions>IMPACT Advanced Recovery is a beverage made by Nestle which contains special nutrients (immunonutrients) which may enhance the immune system in patients having major surgery, improving patient recovery. In our treatment group, patients undergoing surgery for colorectal (bowel) cancer will be given a pamphlet containing information on healthy eating for surgery, as well as IMPACT Advanced Recovery drinks to consume before the operation. These participants will be instructed to take 3 x 237 mL drink packs a day, for 5 consecutive days before their operation, with the last drink to be taken two days before their operation.

The ingredients in IMPACT Advanced Recovery (Vanilla) are: Water, Sugar, Calcium caseinate (milk), Sodium caseinate, L-arginine, Refined fish oil (anchovy, sardine) and less than 2% of corn oil, Citric acid, Medium chain triglycerides, Maltodextrin, Natural and artificial flavor, Yeast extract, Potassium citrate, Potassium chloride, Calcium phosphate, Magnesium phosphate, Salt, Magnesium chloride, Cellulose gel, Cellulose gum, Choline chloride, Sodium ascorbate, Sucralose (sweetener), Carrageenan, Zinc sulfate, Ferrous sulfate, D-alpha-tocopherol, Niacinamide, Soybean oil, Dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, Calcium pantothenate, Copper gluconate, Manganese sulfate, Vitamin A palmitate, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Thiamine hydrochloride, Beta-carotene, Folic acid, Potassium iodide, Sodium selenite, Sodium molybdate, Chromium chloride, Vitamin K1, Biotin, Vitamin D3, Vitamin B12.

The pamphlet for the treatment group provides the same information as the control pamphlet, as well as information on what IMPACT Advanced Recovery is, its ingredients and reported benefits, and how to take it before one's operation. These pamphlets have been made specifically for this study by Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital's Nutrition and Dietetics department.

Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by use of a chart given to each participant in the treatment group, which will contain checkboxes for each day and time at which the participant is to take the IMPACT Advanced Recovery drink. In addition to this, participants will also be instructed to return any unconsumed packs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients undergoing surgery for colorectal (bowel) cancer will be given a pamphlet containing information on healthy eating for surgery. This pamphlet explains why special attention to one's diet before surgery is important. It highlights the benefits to post-operative healing of eating protein at each meal, encourages a variety of nutritious foods as well as maintenance of one's weight, provides further information on extra considerations for diabetic patients, as well as advice to drink enough water and to fast for one's operation as directed. </comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The infective complications rate for patients undergoing colorectal resections in Bankstown is around 30%. To demonstrate a reduction in infectious complications to 10% from preoperative immunonutrition, 62 patients are needed in each arm. This was calculated using an alpha of 5% and power of 80%. Assuming around 10% of patients with breach of protocol or not proceeding to elective surgery, this brings the total required to 136.

The statistical software to be used is SPSS. T-test will be used for age, Chi squared test for proportions, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for non-parametric data. Differences will be considered significant where the probability is less than 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate whether immunonutrition can improve patient recovery following surgery for colorectal cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 to 85 years, and have a confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer for which you plan to undergo elective curative surgery. 

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive a pamphlet containing information on healthy eating for surgery. Participants in the other group will receive the pamphlet, as well as a beverage called IMPACT Advanced Recovery. This beverage is made by Nestle and contains special nutrients (immunonutrients) which may enhance the immune system in patients having major surgery. Participants allocated this treatment will be instructed to take 3 x 237 mL drink packs a day, for 5 consecutive days before their operation, with the last drink to be taken two days before their operation.

All participants will be followed-up for 30 days post-surgery in order to evaluate the incidence of any complications, such as infection, and to measure various immune markers in the blood. It is hoped that immunonutrition will reduce infections after surgery for bowel cancer and improve patient recovery.</summary>
