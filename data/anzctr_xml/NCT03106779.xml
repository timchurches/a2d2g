             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she
             considered not of child bearing potential.

             drug during treatment and for 3 days after stopping treatment and should not father a
             child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well
             as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the drug via
