  <interventions>
    <interventions>Bariatric Surgery: 
- Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding [approximately 1 hour]
- sleeve gastrectomy (laparoscopic or open) [approximately 1-2 hours]
- gastric bypass (laparoscopic or open) [approximately 2-3 hours]
- BPD [approximately 2-3 hours]
Choice of bariatric surgery will be at patient and clinician discretion. 

Liver biopsy and adipose tissue biopsy will be taken during the operation. 
- Liver biopsy may sometimes be taken by the surgeon if there is obvious liver disease macroscopically, or pre-operative suspicion. It is not routine for all patients. 
- Adipose tissue biopsy is not part of routine clinical care and is taken for research purposes only. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size has been powered to observe a difference in mean NALFD activity score of 0.90, based on previous data of histological changes in paired liver biopsies [Mathurin et al, 2009]. In this study, the pre-operative mean NAS was 1.97 +/- 1.33, and post-operative mean NAS was 1.07 +/- 1.26. This created an effect size of 0.694. The G*power 3.1 program was used to calculated the power with alpha error of 0.05 and power of 0.90. Two tailed t-test using differences between the mean was used. The determined sample size calculated was 24 patients. 
To account for 75% of patients consenting to further biopsy, we would need 36 patients with NASH. With a 25-50% incidence of NASH in the obese, we would be aiming for approximately 100 patients. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective cohort study for patients undergoing bariatric surgery who have risk factors for NAFLD, to investigate the impact of surgical weight loss on the liver.  
Patients who are already scheduled for bariatric surgery who fit criteria for likely NAFLD will be recruited from The Alfred Hospital, to undergo an intraoperative liver and adipose tissue biopsy. Patients with significant liver disease on initial biopsy (NAFLD activity score (NAS) greater than 4 or fibrosis score greater than F1) will be offered a follow-up liver biopsy at 12-months post-operatively. 
Liver tissues will be investigated for markers that may indicate disease prognosis and underlying pathophysiology, particularly immune cell markers. </summary>
