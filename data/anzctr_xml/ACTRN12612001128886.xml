  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assessing the efficacy of artesunate+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in one site (Jamame) in Somalia. Patients will be treated with artesunate (4mg/kg over 3 days)  co-administered with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (single dose of 25mg sulfadoxine/1.25mg pyrimethamine per kg on day 0).  Medicine will be administered orally.</interventions>
    <comparator>Assessing the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in two sites (Jannale and Jowhar) in Somalia.  A fixed combination of 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine in a tablet) will be administered according to the recommended weight as follows: One tablet to those weighing 5-14kg; two tablets for 15-24 kg; three tablets for 25-34 kg and four tablets for greater than 35 kg. The full course of treatment for all study patients consists of 6-doses given twice daily over 3 days. Medicine will be administered orally.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of  treatment failure (early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure).

Enrolled patients will be assessed for parasitological (using microscopy), clinical responses during the 28 days follow-up and treatment outcomes will be classified according to the latest WHO protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at day 28 following treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of adverse event will be documented. Parents or guardians of all enrolled patients will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients will be evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form.

Possible medicine related adverse effects include dizziness, itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, headache, bodyache, diarrhoea, tinnitus and increased hair loss, macular rash, reduction in neutrophil counts and convulsions. However, it is likely that many of these effects are disease-related rather than medicine-induced.</outcome>
