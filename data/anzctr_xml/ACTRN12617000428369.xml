  <interventions>
    <interventions>At the first intervention session (compulsory initial two hour session) parents (in both intervention conditions) will receive informational material, including a booklet of information about normal infant sleep patterns, sleep cycles and the potential for an infant to wake overnight several times. A flowchart on how to undertake each sleep intervention will also be provided to each participant. Benefits of an infant learning to fall asleep independently, parental dependence and learning theory will be discussed. Trainers will teach parents a step-by-step guide of how to reduce infant dependence on parental settling based on the principles of their specific intervention. Trainers will also teach parents to identify problems with implementation and compliance of the intervention. Barriers to success, such as attitudes, crying thresholds, parenting confidence, social support and parenting styles will be discussed.

The booklets and flowcharts that will be given out to parents have all been previously utilized in clinical settings. The controlled crying information has been taken from the Raising Children Network website. The Responsive intervention information has been taken from The "Paediatric Sleep Clinic" in Adelaide that specialise in delivering this intervention. 

The controlled crying intervention will be delivered by a nurse who has been trained in the intervention by published experts in this field. This intervention will entail the following; parents will be asked to put their infant into bed (while still awake) and leave their infant alone and ignore any cries of protest for progressively increasing periods of time (for example, a parent will only return to their infant after waiting increasing intervals at their discretion such as 2, 4, 6, 8, 15 minutes, each night). Parents will then attend to their child quickly and quietly until leaving again for a longer period.

The responsive intervention method will be presented by an experienced and published clinical psychologist with over 10 years experience in delivering sleep interventions.  This intervention will entail the following; parents will be asked to put their infant into bed (while still awake) instead of ignoring the infant for the allocated 2, 4, 6 minutes and leaving the room, parents will stay in the room and respond to the child as much as the parent pleases, but reduce the frequency and intensity of the interaction (at parental discretion) with them so that dependency on parental assistance is gradually reduced.

The mode of delivery for these sessions is face-to-face group sessions. The initial two hour session is compulsory and will be held in this format. The additional follow-up sessions are optional and if parents are unable to attend the face-to-face session, a phone call session will be held instead. The purpose of these two follow-up sessions/phone calls are to trouble shoot any issues that parents may behaving with the interventions, as well as complete follow up measures of our outcome variables (infant sleep, parental depression, sense of competency etc) 

Adherence to the program will be assessed subjectively using a compliance scale ranging from "complied with the program 100%" to "did not comply with the program at all". To maintain adherence parents will be reminded about the importance of compliance with the program. Compliance measures will be taken at multiple time points throughout the interventions (i.e. at the beginning of the intervention, 2 weeks post, and 4 weeks post intervention). This will allow us to determine if parents are complying with the program and to follow-up with those that are not to see if they need further assistance with the program.

There will be 3 sessions per condition. The first session is a 2-hour compulsory training. The following two are dependent on parental availability, and will only be 1 hour long. These sessions will be held every two weeks over the period of a two months. Follow up phone calls will also be made at 3 and 4 months post intervention delivery.

The location of the intervention will be in a workshop room at Central Queensland University at the Appleton Institute, in Adelaide, South Australia.

    <comparator>The control group of parents will attend their first compulsory session (only 1 hour long, at the Appleton Institute) to receive informational material, including a booklet of information about normal infant sleep patterns, sleep cycles and the potential for an infant to wake overnight several times, as well as be guided on how to complete the questionnaires. They will not need to attend the venue for any further sessions. They will not receive information on any specific sleep intervention, thus, no treatment will be given. The control group will be a 'wait-list' control group' meaning they can receive the intervention of their choice at the end of the study (four months after the start of the intervention) to ensure they do not miss out on the benefit and are not disadvantaged by not receiving the intervention. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Methods:
Power analyses suggest a sample of at least 125 participants is needed to ensure detecting effect sizes of .25 with .8 power and 5% error probability. Allowing for an attrition rate of approximately 30% (based on past research (Hiscock &amp; Wake 2002)) we will recruit at least 195 families in total  65 per condition to be included across two waves, of 30-40 infants per condition.

Statistical Analysis:
Quantitative data will be collected over four months across the conditions in two waves. The primary outcome variables are infant sleep disturbance (measured by the Actiwatch), infant stress (cortisol), and parental stress (cortisol and SUDS scale). Secondary variables include parental mood (depression), parental competency scores, parent-child attachment, and compliance and attrition rates. 
Aim One: A linear mixed effects model will be run to determine differences in infant sleep disturbance (measured objectively by the Actiwatch) between groups (controlled crying, responsive and control group) across the time points (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4). 

Aim Two: A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) will be run to determine group differences in parental depression and levels of competence, as well as determine the relationship between these factors. 

Aim Three: A linear mixed effects model will be run to determine group differences between the interventions (controlled crying, responsive and control group) at the five time points in relation to the two secondary variables of interest; compliance and attrition, as well as explore the relationship between these two variables. This analysis will be followed up by a qualitative analysis using Nvivo to determine reasons for attrition.

Aim Four: A linear mixed effects model will be run to explore group differences in levels of stress (measured objectively by cortisol) between conditions (controlled crying, responsive and control group) at different cortisol collection time points (four samples a night after 6pm) on different days (Day 1 &amp; Day 2 of baseline measure).

Qualitative data analyses:
To further achieve the third aim of understanding compliance and attrition, all parents who withdrew from the study will be immediately invited to participate in a short five minute telephone interview to gain accounts of their reason for discontinuing the interventionThey will also be mailed out follow-up qualitative questionnaires at the same times as other participants (eight and 16 weeks) to determine if they have since sought advice, implemented or trialled either or both interventions, or experienced spontaneous improvement of their infants sleep. At the conclusion of the whole study, all parents (including those who withdrew from the study) will also complete an exit survey which will include open ended questions such as Which aspects of the intervention were most helpful for you? All interviews will be recorded, transcribed and analysed with the aid of NVivo (version 10, developed by QSR), a software tool for organising, searching, and coding qualitative data. Thematic and content analyses will be undertaken to get both an interpretation of the meanings of participant responses, and gather information on the reoccurring responses.

Controlling for Covariates:
Running linear mixed effects models allows us to control for confounding variables that include age, health status, infant temperament and mother-infant attachment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The cumulative impact of infant sleep and settling problems is consequential for both the infant and their parents. Options to improve infant sleep disturbance most commonly include behavioural sleep interventions. A large amount of research has focused on extinction based sleep interventions (controlled crying) that are typically centred on ignoring an unwanted behaviour (night time crying) to allow the infant to settle on their own. However, majority of parents find controlled crying unpalatable. Recently, there has been an increased focus on finding alternatives that focus on responding to infant cries rather than ignoring them (cue-based or responsive methods). These methods have not been directly and empirically tested against controlled crying are not systematically available.

The aims of this study are to investigate the differences between two forms of infant sleep interventions (controlled crying and responsive methods) compared to a control group, on infant sleep disturbance and parental and infant well-being. These aims will be achieved by providing parents with education on infant sleep based on which intervention group they have been assigned to. After these sessions, parents will undertake this intervention in their own home and complete the outcome measures to determine the success of each intervention.
