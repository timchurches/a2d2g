  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjects were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy: compliance to therapy and patients as well as physicians global assessment for efficacy. 
Global assessment of efficacy was performed using the following grades: (i) excellent = reduction of &gt;75% of symptoms, (ii) good = reduction of 5175% of symptoms, (iii) fair = reduction of 2650% of symptoms, and (iv) poor = no improvement or reduction in &lt;25% of symptoms. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month for treatment 
3 months for followup after completion of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain intensity measured by Brief Pain Inventory, and McGill pain, and maximal comfortable mandibular opening, at baseline and again after 4 weeks of treatment.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and again after 4 weeks of treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerability was assessed by recording patients global assessment; the tolerability of the drug and percent of the patients experiencing any drug-related adverse events (like sensitivity to the components). 
The global assessment of tolerability was performed using following grades: (i) excellent = no adverse drug reaction, (ii) good = mild adverse drug reaction but no interference with normal lifestyle, (iii) fair = mild adverse drug reaction which interference with normal lifestyle. However, benefits of drug therapy outweigh the inconvenience, (iv) poor = drug withdrawn.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month for treatment 
3 months for followup after completion of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The mandibular function, the maximal comfortable mandibular opening measured in millimeters at the subjects's maximum incisor to incisor mouth opening using a ruler, as a secondary outcome.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month for treatment 
3 months for followup post completion of treatment </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Self report of facial ache or pain in the muscles of mastication, the TMJ, or the region in front of ear or inside the ear
Positive clinical diagnosis of TMDs. The TMD diagnosis is classified using axis I of the research diagnostic criteria (RDC) for TMDs. The RDC diagnosis consists of joint pain at rest (spontaneous pain) and evoked pain (hyperalgesia) on palpation of the TMJ, TMJ reduction consists of reciprocal clicking or joint noise with mandibular movement examination.
For joint pain complaint, subjects will be required to have a self-report of at least 1 month of daily or nearly daily pain.
Subjects with myogenic pain will be included if they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria since patients with TMDs are known to exhibit muscle pain secondary to their joint dysfunction.

Subjects with pain attributable to confirmed migraine or head pain condition other than tension headache;
Subjects with acute infection or other significant disease of teeth, ears, eyes, nose or throats; subjects with untreated depressive disorder or not on stable antidepressant medication for more than 6 months;
Subjects with dental diseases that required ongoing treatment, which would confound the evaluation of orofacial pain;
Subjects who are not competent in giving consents.
Pregnant or lactating women
Subjects with sensitivity to the ingredient of Reparil
