  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ropivacaine
Treatment: drugs - 0.9% Saline

Experimental: LA - Use of Ropivacaine

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Use of 0.9% saline


Treatment: drugs: Ropivacaine
In the treatment arm patients will receive 10mls 0.75% ropivacaine diluted to 50mls with saline immediately before closure.
At closure, two small 2 mm catheters will be placed in the peritoneal cavity at the site of the operation to infuse local anaesthesia. This will penetrate through the skin once closure is complete. This will be attached to a small infusion pump (On-Q pain buster). This pump will contain 270mls of 0.2% ropivacaine. After 68 hours the pump will be stopped and the catheter will be removed in a similar fashion as routine drain removal.

Treatment: drugs: 0.9% Saline
In the placebo arm patients will receive 50 ml 0.9% saline into the peritoneum soon after the creation of the laparotomy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim:

      The general aim of this research group is to improve the recovery of patients after abdominal
      surgery. The specific aim of this study is to conduct a randomized, double blinded,
      controlled trial to investigate the effect of intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia application
      on postoperative pain and post-operative fatigue. This will be conducted in the setting of an
      enhanced recovery after surgery program (ERAS).

      Methods:

      Patients will be randomised by computer generated random numbers and opaque envelope method.
      In the treatment arm patients will receive 10ml 0.75% ropivacaine diluted to 50mls with 0.9%
      saline soon after the creation of the laparotomy . In the placebo arm, 50mls of 0.9% normal
      saline will be used in a similar fashion. At closure, two small 2mm catheter belonging to the
      On-Q pain buster system will be placed in the peritoneal cavity. This will be attached to a
      pump which will contain either a 0.2% ropivacaine solution or 0.9% saline placebo running at
      4mls/hr for 68 hours. All members involved in patient care (with the exception of one nurse)
      will be blinded to the above. After 68 hours the pump will be stopped and the catheter will
      be removed. Assessment of postoperative pain will be performed by visual analogue scale, and
      fatigue assessment will be done using the Identity Consequence Fatigue Scale (ICFS) at
      various intervals post-operatively. Blood tests for inflammatory markers including glucose,
      cortisol, CRP, albumin and several cytokines as well as local anaesthetic levels will be
      taken.

      Significance to health:

      This method of analgesia administration has not been investigated in open major colonic
      surgery. This trial has wide reaching implications, with the potential to improve pain and
      thus recovery after abdominal surgery.</summary>
