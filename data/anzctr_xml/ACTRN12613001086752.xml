  <interventions>
    <interventions>6 bouts of high-intensity intermittent exercise @ 100% VO2max, on a stationary cycle ergometer with a work-to-rest ratio of 1:4  over a period of 30-minutes. Active recovery consists of cycling @ 50% VO2max and performance will be monitored on the software associated with the cycle ergometer. 
A minimum wash-out period of three days will take place between trials.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes Mellitus is a global health concern and a national health priority area in Australia. In particular, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is emerging as one of the greatest health threats in Australia, with approximately 90% of all individuals living with diabetes mellitus having T2DM. Being overweight or obese greatly increases the risk of progressing to T2DM (increasing the risk by four-fold). The link between obesity and progression to T2DM is attributed to changes in the immune system, specifically the inflammatory changes seen in individuals who are overweight or obese. Being inactive has also been shown to increase the risk of developing T2DM by two-fold. Although we know that the intensity of exercise can change the level of improvement seen in insulin sensitivity (higher intensity having greater effect), there is limited research investigating the role of high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIT) on insulin sensitivity. HIT uses alternating bouts of high-intensity and low-intensity exercise over the duration of the exercise bout and has recently demonstrated significant beneficial effects on health measures including body mass index (BMI).  


Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine how insulin sensitivity and the immune system can be affected by exercise intensity. We hypothesise that the high-intensity intermittent exercise will be more effective in regulating glucose. </summary>
