  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reducing power consumption in the cochlear implant is crucial to the development of future
      smaller sound processors. The commercial MP3000 sound coding strategy has been shown to be
      more efficient in power consumption to the standard ACE strategy. However in order to develop
      smaller sound processors, further battery life power savings are required. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate three experimental sets of MP3000 parameter sets, compared against the
      default ACE program. In the background for each of the four strategies, experimental noise
      reduction programs (SpatialNR and NR3) will also be in use. In an additional phase of the
      study, low stimulation rate ACE programs will also be evaluated against the default
      stimulation rate.</summary>
