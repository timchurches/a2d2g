  <interventions>
    <interventions>Community based functional electrical stimulation to the ankle dorsiflexors during the swing phase of gait. The electrical stimulation is applied through a device known as a Walk Aide which is strapped to the leg just below the knee. The tilt sensor is programmed so that stimulation is turned on at the commencement of swing phase through to initial contact. The intensity of stimulation will vary according to each individual but all participants will have a frequency of 33Hz and a pulse width ranging from 25 to 300 micro seconds. The amplitude will be participant controlled by a dial. Participants are asked to use the Walk Aide for a minimum of 4 hours a day, 6 days a week over the 8 week intervention period. Weekly to fortnightly school and home visits will be conducted for each participant to monitor the intervention. The Walk Aide has an inbuilt usage log therefore at each visit, this data will be downloaded so that the participant and the family can receive feedback regarding adherence to the dosage. Families will also have direct access to the principle investigator via mobile text message and email if there are any queries or concerns.</interventions>

    <concealment>This is a matched pairs randomised controlled trial. Potential participants meeting the inclusion criteria are referred to the study from physiotherapists and paediatric rehabilitation consultants. An initial appointment is then scheduled to determine FES tolerance and study protocol.  Once informed consent is obtained from two participants that meet the criteria for a match, they are then randomly allocated - one to the FES group and one to the control group. Allocation is not concealed</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Participants are matched by age (within 2 years for children between 5 and 10 and within 6 years for children between 11 and 18) and GMFCS level (1 or 2)</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>The distributions of strength, ROM, muscle volume, ankle power and the COPM will be assessed for normality through the Shaprio Wilks test and the Q plot. SMC, SCALE, sensation, spasticity (ASAS) and CBMS are ordinal scales that cannot be assumed to be equal interval, therefore non-parametric tests will be used for these outcomes. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the subjects, difference between the groups at baseline will be assessed. Difference scores will be assessed using either an independent t test or the Mann Whitney U test (depending on the distribution of the variable). Between group analysis will be performed using an independent t test. When normality assumptions are not met the non-parametric equivalent will be used (Wilcoxon rank sum). Mixed model ANOVA will be used to determine significance between group and within the group for each time point.   Sample size was calculated from the pilot study strength data. Based on effect sizes observed in a pilot study of FES use (Pool et al., 2014), a one tailed alpha of 0.05 and power of 80% power analysis suggested that each group required at least 15 participants to identify a change of 6 heel raises, the least change considered clinically significant.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine the effects of community applied functional electrical stimulation in ambulant children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. A device known as the Walk Aide will be given to the intervention group to wear daily for a period of 8 weeks. This controlled trial will determine the effects of using such a device on a range of outcome measures covering the International Classification of Functioning (child and youth version). The outcome of this trial will deepen our understanding of the effects of functional electrical stimulation in a paediatric population and shape our clinical recommendations based on the available evidence.</summary>
