  <interventions>
    <interventions>All procedures in this study will be conducted with standard care at clinician discretion in the control arm, with the addition of virtual reality to standard care at clinician discretion in the active arm.
Virtual reality digital content is played through a smartphone via software application. The smartphone is placed into the a Google Daydream headset which provides a stereoscopic display to create a 3D experience. The virtual reality experience will be provided as an adjunct to standard care (e.g. topical local anaesthetic) during the needle procedure. The content is an animated and immersive age-appropriate visualisation. The intervention will be delivered in both inpatient and outpatient (pathology collection centre) settings by the research team in conjunction with the proceduralists (doctors, nurses, phelbotomists).</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is standard care at clinician discretion. Standard care includes non-pharmacological procedural pain management (e.g. explaining the procedure to the child, distraction), pharmacologic management (e.g. topical local anaesthetic) and physical measures (e.g. positioning, restraints). In line with standard care topical local anaesthetic should be applied where possible (i.e. where not contraindicated or refused). 
The investigators acknowledge standard care is variable, and will ensure this data is collected.</comparator>

    <summary>To investigate whether using Virtual Reality distraction (using a computer simulation of an environment) can reduce the pain and distress children aged 4  11 year olds experience during needle based procedures. In addition, will determine whether Virtual Reality has an impact on the amount of anxiety parents feel about what their children are experiencing, procedural time and number of needle attempts. </summary>
