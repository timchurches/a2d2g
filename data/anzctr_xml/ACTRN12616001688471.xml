  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention period of the study will last 12 weeks. Coaches in the intervention arm in Australia will receive two group workshops (weeks 1 and 5; February/March 2017), each lasting 3 hours. Workshops will be delivered at a pre-arranged central location (e.g. Sport Club or Department of Sport and Recreation) or at Curtin University.  Venues will be organised in advance to ensure suitability, and accessibility for attendees.
The workshops will be delivered by trained researchers with expertise in psychology and delivering interventions in sporting contexts. Individuals presenting the workshop will be trained using video recorded demonstration workshops, in-depth trainer notes and key slide notes.  
The workshops will be delivered face to face using interactive presentation (PowerPoint, group discussions).  In addition to standard anti-doping education topics, the intervention workshops will include content aimed to develop motivationally adaptive communication styles. Coaches will be provided with workshop packs (printed copies of slides, support materials and information to access online materials outside of the workshop).
In the intervention group the online material will include detailed descriptions of self-determination theory (SDT) based communication techniques and how they can be operationalised in the context of coach-athlete discussions about doping. To the extent that resources are available, we will also develop video material with examples of motivationally supportive and unsupportive communication.  The study website and online material will be developed, designed and/or tailored specifically for this study.  Online discussions/Q&amp;A sessions will be organised based on participant availability and resource demand.  The online website/discussions etc. are available as an additional resource for participants in he intervention group, and participation is not a compulsory component of the study.
Coaches in the intervention group will also be provided with online materials, activities and support during the 12 week intervention period. Online materials will be delivered through an online group (e.g. closed Facebook group, protected pages on the study website), and will include online group discussions/Q&amp;A session led and directed by the research team.  Handout material will support coaches in implementing what they learn in the workshops during their training sessions. Examples include scenarios of doping and communication techniques that coaches can use to talk to their athletes.
Intervention arm workshop  workshop outline
Workshop 1
understanding of motivation
Communication style in supporting or undermining athletes motivation
Applying motivation principles based on contemporary research
Principles to practice

Workshop 2
Anti-doping rules and practices
Applying motivational strategies to reduce athletes willingness to dope and risk of unintentional doping
Intervention fidelity will be assessed using filmed-observations between a selected number of coaches and an athlete in a roleplay scenario (e.g. coach-athlete conversation about the athlete considering use of a prohibited substance).  The role of the Athletes will be undertaken by a trained researcher.  Observations will be analysed and coding of the communication style used by the coach will be conducted.  Researchers undertaking the Athlete role will be train in self-determination theory and concepts and to improve inter-rated reliability.  The researchers ("Athlete") will be blinded to the experimental allocation of the coach.</interventions>
    <comparator>The workshop will be delivered by trained researchers with expertise in psychology and delivering interventions in sporting contexts. Individuals presenting the workshop will be trained using video recorded demonstration workshops, in-depth trainer notes and key slide notes.
Eligible coaches assigned to the control arm will receive usual practice: a 90 minute group anti-doping education workshop.  The workshop will be delivered face to face using interactive presentations (PowerPoint, group discussions)  They will also  be directed to available online materials including to WADA online educational program, and other anti-doping websites and resources to provide information about checking for prohibited substances, prohibited status of medication etc.

Coaches in the control arm will be offered an additional face-to-face motivation training workshop at the end of the study (after follow-up assessments). The motivation training will last for 3 hours, and will provide coaches with an understand of motivational and self-determination theory and how it can be applied in sporting context successfully.
The workshop will be delivered by trained researchers with expertise in psychology and delivering interventions in sporting contexts.  

Workshops will be delivered at a pre-arranged central location (e.g. Sport Club or Department of Sport and Recreation) or at Curtin University.  Venues will be organised in advance to ensure suitability, and accessibility for attendees.

In this way the principal researchers are blinded to group allocation. It is not possible to blind the researchers delivering the programs, or the coaches, to group allocation, but they will be blinded to the primary aims of the study.

Coaches within a single club, as well as from geographically nearby clubs, will be allocated to the same arm.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Power estimates were calculated with the Optimal Design Software (Raudenbush, et al., 2011) for clustered RCTs with treatment at level 2, primary outcomes at level 1, repeated measures, estimates of moderate effect, and oversampling by about 30% to counter possible missing values and coach/athlete dropout from the study. 

Descriptive statistical analysis will be used to report on coach and athlete recruitment, acceptability of the intervention (coaches), and rates of adherence and dropout. Questionnaire and observation (interviews and video-recording) data will be analysed using multi-level growth modelling (mixed linear modelling) to examine how within-person changes in coaches perceptions of their own instructional style predict within-person changes in their athletes perceptions of the coaches instructional style and willingness towards doping attitudes and behaviours.  We will also implement: 1) a process evaluation of the intervention, via coach interviews, coach questionnaires on ease and usefulness of the training material, and 2) fidelity to the protocol assessments, via coach observations (audio or video-recording).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim and hypothesis: This project aims to support the principles and aims of the Olympic Charter by developing and testing a preventative motivation theory informed and evidence-based intervention.

Methods: The intervention will deliver anti-doping education and psychological training to support coaches in communicating with athletes in a needs supportive manner. The intervention will be compared against usual practice (i.e., education programs run by National Anti-Doping Organizations).

This is a multi-centre research project with sites in Western Australia, the UK, and Greece. The project is a cluster randomised control trial (2 arms; total across 3 countries: 60 coaches and 600 athletes in each arm). Athletes will be asked to complete a questionnaire package of psychological measures. The constructs of the questionnaire will include rating their willingness to take prohibited performance enhancing substances, their anti-doping attitudes, efficacy to resist doping-related temptations, and perceptions of coach behaviours. Similarly coaches will be asked to complete a separate package of psychological constructs and measures. The measures will ask coaches to rate their efficacy to foster anti-doping attitudes and deliver anti-doping information, and their efficacy to confront athletes about doping.

Data collection and analysis: Baseline data (0 week) (video-recording of coaches, athlete/coach questionnaire packages) will be collected prior to the first workshop (control/intervention). Questionnaire packages will be repeated at the end of the intervention (12 week) and again at a follow-up (20 week). Interviews with coaches in the intervention arm will take place after the second workshop. We will use advanced statistical analysis (multilevel growth models) to account for both the longitudinal and nested (athletes within coaches) nature of the data. We will implement: 1) a process evaluation of the intervention, via coach interviews, coach questionnaires on ease and usefulness of the training material, and 2) fidelity to the protocol assessments, via coach observations, and 3) we will analyse the data and disseminate the results of the intervention via coach information sessions, printed material, policy briefings, media interviews, and social media engagement.</summary>
