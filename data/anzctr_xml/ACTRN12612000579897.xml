  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomised to the intervention will commence two supplementary bolus feeds (standard enteral formula 1.5kcal/ml with fibre) per day in addition to usual dietary intake at the time of gastrostomy placement.

The supplementary feeds will continue pre treatment and throughout treatment. Most patients will be anticipated to be receiving chemoradiotherapy with a duration of 7 weeks. Tube placement is usually within 1-2 weeks prior to chemoradiotherapy, and so total predicted duration of intervention is 8-9 weeks.

Additional feeds will be commenced as clinically indicated during treatment by the clinical dietitian.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomised to standard care will commence water flushes via the gastrostomy at the time of gastrostomy placement and throughout treatment. Feeds will be commenced as clinically indicated throughout treatment as per current standard care.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the outcome of early tube feeding compared to commencement of feeding as per current standard practice in patients undergoing gastrostomy prior to treatment for head and neck cancer. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with head and neck cancer, and have been referred for a preventive gastrostomy (insertion of feeding tube into the stomach) prior to treatment for your cancer. 

Trial details Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two treatment groups. Participants in one group will commence two supplementary feeds per day at the time of feeding tube insertion (gastrostomy). These feeds will be in addition to the patient's usual dietary intake and will continue throughout cancer treatment. Participants in the other group will receive standard care. This involves water flushes via the gastrostomy throughout cancer treatment and feeds will be commenced by the dietitian as clinically indicated during treatment. 

Participants will be assessed at baseline and 3 months post completion of treatment in order to determine impact on nutrition outcomes, quality of life and clinical outcomes.</summary>
