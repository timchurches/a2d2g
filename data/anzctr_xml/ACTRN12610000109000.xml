  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises screening for alcohol problems followed by written personalised feedback regarding alcohol consumption delivered to participants in the mail. Emergency Department (ED) staff invite eligible patients to participate in a phone survey regarding their alcohol consumption. The principal investigator contacts consenting patients and administers the screening questionnaire, which consists of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The written personalised feedback presents the participant's responses on the AUDIT items relative to normative data from residents of the same rural communities. This feedback is mailed to participants on a single occasion approximately 1 week after he/she completes the screening questionnaire.</interventions>
