  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oral n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment (2 grams per day) will be provided in an open label design for the first two months.  Participants will continue on the trial for an additional six months and will be randomly assigned to NAC.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to intervention for mood symptoms will be the primary outcome for this study. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed following the open label phase, at each monthly visit for the duration of the randomised trial (six months).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcomes include but are not limited to the following rating scales; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Bipolar Depression Rating Scale (BDRS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Clincial Global Impression (CGI) improvement and severity scales, Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGIBP), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Streamlined Longitudinal Interview Clinical Evaluation from the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (SLICE/LIFE), Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE/RIFT), Life Functioning Questionairre (LFQ), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), cognitive testing, and investigations of blood for oxidative markers. </outcome>
      <timepoint>These will be assessed during the open label phase (three fortnightly visits) and at each visit of the randomised trial (six monthly visits).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for bipolar disorder, have current symtpoms of depression with a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score over 12 at baseline, have the capacity to consent, be on stable therapy for at least one month prior to randomisation. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Individuals with a known or suspected clinically relevant medical disorder, elderly individuals with respiratory insufficiency, individuals who are pregnant or lactating, individuals currently taking greater than 500 mg/day of NAC, 200 ug of slenium/day or 500 International Units (IU) of vitamin E/day, individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to NAC or any component of the preparation.</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Treatments were randomly assigned into pack numbers by an individual independent of participant recruitment.  Trial clincians recruited particpants and allocated them sequential pack numbers thereby adhering to double blind procedures.</concealment>
    <sequence>Treatments were allocated into pack numbers by a simple coin tossing method.  Participants were then recruited and allocated sequential pack numbers.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Other</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Initially all participants will be on open label treatment followed by a double blind randomised placebo controlled trial.  Trial clinicians and participants will be blinded to the randomised treatment.  Participants will be unaware of any change in trial treatment.  Data analysis will be conducted under blind conditions.</designfeatures>
