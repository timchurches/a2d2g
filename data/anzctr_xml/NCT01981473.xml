DAS28 will be calculated twice, utilizing first ESR, and then CRP as the acute phase reactant: 1) DAS28-ESR = 0.56 sqrt (28 painful/tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (28 swollen joint count) + 0.70 (ln ESR) + 0.014 GH, where GH=subject general health VAS (0-100 mm). 2) DAS28-4 CRP = 0.56 sqrt (28 painful/tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (28 swollen count) + 0.36 (ln CRP+1) + 0.014 GH + 0.96, where GH=subject general health VAS (0- 100 mm), higher scores were indicative of a worse outcome. The specific components of the DAS28 assessment that were used in this study are: Tender/Painful Joint Count (28), Swollen Joint Count (28), ESR/CRP, and Subject's General Health VAS assessment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ DI) Scores for for Etanercept, Adalimumab, or Infliximab Compared Between Participants Who Are Antidrug Antibody Positive Versus Negative. - The HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing "no difficulty," 1 as "some difficulty," 2 as "much difficulty," and 3 as "unable to do." Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. The total score range for the HAQ-DI scale, minimum score was 0 (best), maximum score was 3 (worst).</outcome>
