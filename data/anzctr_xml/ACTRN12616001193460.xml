  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive verbal and written nutrition education from a student dietitian focusing on how to select and prepare foods and beverages low in free sugars. This includes a booklet created by the student dietitian which includes information on label reading for free sugars, food exchanges which are low in free sugars, artificial sweeteners and recipes low in free sugars. Participants will attend weekly one-on-one consultation clinics (for approximately 30 minutes) for four weeks. Dietary free sugars intake will be measured at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire and 3-day weighed diet record. Participants will then attempt to undertake a diet low in free sugars for four weeks (target &lt;5% total energy intake/day) from the second weekly consultation visit (once baseline measures have been taken), consuming foods and beverages of their own choice. Participants will then receive tailored nutrition advice and support from a student dietitian for maintaining a diet low in free sugars.

Over the period there will be a log of attendance. At four weeks, participants will complete the same food frequency questionnaire and another 3-day weighed diet record to assess nutrient intakes and monitor adherence to the intervention. In addition, participants will attend a semi-structured interview at the end of the low free sugars diet period to evaluate effectiveness of the dietary support aids.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a mixed-methods exploratory research project exploring the barriers and facilitators faced by individuals attempting to reduce their free sugars intake in line with World Health Organisation recommendations and within the current food environment.	

There is growing concern that high intakes of free sugars increases energy intake and may reduce the intake of more nutritious foods leading to an unhealthy diet and weight gain. Also of concern, is the association between free sugars intake and tooth decay. To prevent and control unhealthy weight gain and tooth decay, the World Health Organisation recommends that the intake of free sugars be &lt;5% of total energy intake/day. For an average adult, this is approximately 5 teaspoons of sugar per day. Free sugars are defined as sugars added to foods and drinks by the consumer, cook or manufacturer as a sweetener and includes honey, fruit juices, syrups and purees. Previous studies have indicated it may be difficult for people to adhere to the World Health Organisation free sugars recommendation, and facilitators and barriers to adherence are unknown. It is also unknown whether adhering to a diet low in free sugars is associated with other dietary changes that can affect health (it is likely that such changes will be beneficial to health but this has not been tested). Therefore, more research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of dietary support aids, and to explore whether diets low in free sugars are associated with other dietary changes that may influence cardiovascular disease risk markers. </summary>
