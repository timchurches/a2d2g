  <interventions>
    <interventions>Proactive telephone support provided by another mother with breastfeeding experience, in the early postnatal period i.e. weekly calls of varying duration (dependent upon need)for up to 12 weeks after birth. the volunteer mother providing support will have have had some training provided by the Australian Breastfeeding Association and be provided with ongoing support form the Peer Volunteer coordinator</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peer support provided by telephone in the postnatal period will increase the proportion of infants receiving any breast milk at six months by 10% compared with standard care(from 46% to 56%).Telephone interviews will be conducted for all participants 6 months after birth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baby six months of age</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Test if telephone peer support intervention increases mean breastfeeding duration.Telephone interviews will be conducted for all participants 6 months after birth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baby six months of age</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Test if telephone peer support increases exclusive breastfeeding at six months.Telephone interviews will be conducted for all participants 6 months after birth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baby six months of age</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the interventions from the participant and peer support volunteer perspectives. A telephone interview will be conducted at the conclusion of telephone support from the peer volunteer.
Peer volunteers will keep a record of contact with the breastfeeding mother and at trial completion peer volunteers will complete a short questionnaire evaluating their experience of providing support.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of peer support. The economic evaluation will first compare the incremental costs and all consequences of the intervention to the control group and then assess cost-effectiveness against any breastfeeding at six months. Data collection for economic evaluation is integrated in the process and outcome evaluation components e.g. household expenditure on infant feeding materials and equipment; health service use since discharge (e.g. admissions, GP visits, drug treatments, use of midwife/ MCHN/other sources of help and advice). Resource use detailed in activity logs will be costed using standard unit costs for telephone expenses and for time use of peers and participants.  The trial team will keep detailed records of resources used in peer recruitment, training, support and coordination.</outcome>

    <concealment>Research midwives will recruit women to the trial in the postanatal wards of the study hospitals, at least 24hours after the birth(unless earlier discharge is planned) and prior to discharge from hospital.
The research midwife will review a computer generated list of all women who have given birth to their first baby in the previous 24hours , then approach staff in the postnatal ward to confirm eligibility.The research midwife will follow a protocal to approach women, explain the study, offer trial participation and obtain written consent. it will be made clear that women can withdraw at any time.
Allocation to an intervention or non-intervention group will be via a centralisied computer randomisation system.</concealment>
    <sequence>Women will be stratified by trial site, then randomised to one of the two trial arms. The randomisation sequence will be done using using small blocks of varying size.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breastfeeding has many benefits for mothers and babies, but although many women in Victoria start breastfeeding,  many stop sooner than they had planned. Telephone support from another mother with breastfeeding experience has been found to increase breastfeeding in other countries, but we dont know whether this approach would work here in Australia. The aim of the project is to find out whether providing breastfeeding support by telephone could increase the percentage of women breastfeeding for at least six months.</summary>
