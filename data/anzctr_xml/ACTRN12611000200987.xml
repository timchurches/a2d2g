  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial was conducted as a prospective,
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind. Eligible participants were randomized into four groups: 
The control group(G1) - consisting of 35 participants received capsules containing placebo - microcellulose capsule;
The Tibolone Group(G2) - consisting of 30 participants received capsules containing 2.5 mg tibolone per day(Reduclin (Registered Trademark) 2.5 mg, produced by Farmoquimica S/A, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, registered in the Ministry of health  science of Brazil number 1.0390.0136-001);
The alpha lipoic acid group(G3) - consisting of 32 participants received capsules containing 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid per day;
The tibolone and alpha lipoic group(G4) consisting of 32 participants received capsules containing 2.5 mg of tibolone per day and 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid per day.
This study  lasted 12 weeks. Participants were assessed at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects were recruited among women patients of
eight healthcare centers in the city of Parnamirim, State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The menopausal
status of the subjects was defined according to the
Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop menstrual
criteria. This study was approved by the local Ethics
Committee (number  294/2008) and all the
women gave their informed consent prior to the inclusion in
the study. Subjects were given a short questionnaire to
obtain information about race, age, antecedents gynecological, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical exercise, previous HRT,and diagnosed diseases. The climacteric symptoms were assessed by screening the Blatt Menopausal Index (IMK). Women with case history of
alcoholism, smoking, diabetes, and  chronic disease
are excluded.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method used to create the random order for the allocation of subjects into different groups. Subjects were randomized in the ratio of 1:1, i.e.
the number of patients in the active groups was 
similar of the placebo group. Randomization was performed by a central randomization who obeyed the order of selection of volunteers  for input on trial.</sequence>
