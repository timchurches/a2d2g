  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to test whether giving a medication called desferrioxamine (commonly used in patients with iron-overload conditions such as beta-thalassaemia) in the setting of a heart attack can reduce the amount of heart muscle injury. We hypothesise that that this medication may therefore improve the outlook for people following heart attacks. This medication has been used safely in adults and children with beta thalassaemia at even higher doses. This drug has been shown in experimental, animal and a few human studies to reduce the oxidative stress (that is, acts as an antioxidant) of tissues which have had their blood supply compromised (as in the case of a heart attack). Some of the animal studies have also shown that it reduces the size of heart attacks.</summary>
