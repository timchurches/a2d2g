  <interventions>
    <interventions>muscle strengthening, walking program, cognitive behavioural training

Participants will complete a home program of 6 hip and thigh muscle strengthening exercises at home 3 times per week (3 sets of 10). They will also walk at least 15 minutes continuously 2 times peer week. The intervention will last 10 weeks. Participants will receive 10 consultations (one per week) with a physiotherapist who will ensure proper performance of exercises and safe progression of the program (increased resistance for strength, increased time for walking). At each consultation they will also receive 45 minutes of cognitive behavioural training administered by a trained physiotherapist.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common musculoskeletal condition that affects many adults and is likely to become more common as the population ages. Much of the research to-date has focussed on identifying treatment strategies to reduce physical problems such as knee pain and dysfunction. However, we also know that many individuals with knee OA report psychological issues such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, treatment of knee OA should focus not only on the physical impairments, but psychological and emotional ones as well. By addressing both of these, we hope to improve the overall burden of the disease on affected individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatment that combines physical components through strengthening and walking exercises with psychological components through discussion of symptoms and their effects.</summary>
