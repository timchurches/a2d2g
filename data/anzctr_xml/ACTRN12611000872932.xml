  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to survey 400 parents for their recall of febrile and other reactions following their childs vaccination with the 2011 seasonal influenza vaccine manufactured by GSK (Fluarix).
This will be a retrospective telephone survey of parents of infants and children, who received 2011 Fluarix influenza vaccine, and will be conducted by the practice nurses, in the general practice who administered the vaccine to the infants or children.
Recruitment is expected to take  2 months, or until 400 survey have been received which ever is the first.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study will be to determine the rates of febrile events in young children aged 6 months to 8 years inclusive within 24 hours of receipt of any dose of 2011 Fluarix (2011 seasonal influenza vaccine manufactured by GSK).
Parental recall to questions on the survey instrument will be recorded 
Recall of fever (Yes/No) if yes did the fever occur between 1-4 hrs, 5-8 hrs, 9-24 hrs or after 24hrs
Was the childs temperature measured (Yes/No) if yes what was the measured temperature. Fever, endogenous elevation of at least one measured body temperature of 38C
Were there any other reactions (Yes/No) These will be coded  as myalgia, arthralgia, malaise and headache etc.
Was anti-fever medicine given (Yes/No) if yes was it given before or after vaccination
Did you need to call or see a doctor (Yes/No) if yes who, where and why</outcome>
      <timepoint>30/09/2011, at the end of the study once all data is collected</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the reactogenicity of Fluarix, in young children aged 6 months to 8 years inclusive, associated with febrile AEs after any dose. Descriptive statistics will describe all baseline variables and key outcome variables and paired t-tests used to evaluate per person changes in temperature (temperatures will be characterised  by reporting of mean, median and ranges). Incidence rates for febrile AEs will be further characterised by assessment of severity (by temperature grades of febrile AEs (38C, 39C and 40C), whether the febrile AE was medically attended, and any associated seizures (according to Brighton Collaboration seizure definitions). Patterns of febrile AEs with associated symptoms in other organ systems will also be characterised by incidence rates, with exploration of the associated severity of fever by major symptom clusters.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identify any confirmed febrile convulsions (observed and conforming to Brighton Collaboration definitions for level one, two or three diagnosis.)</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate all cases that include fever and at least one other symptom and follow up to allow further clarification and classification by a Clinician. The Clinician will confirm the events via Medical records, parental discussion and or attending Medical practitioner.</outcome>
