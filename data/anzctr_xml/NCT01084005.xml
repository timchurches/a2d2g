  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HbA1c Change From Baseline to Week 24 - HbA1c is measured as a percentage. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 24 HbA1c percent minus the baseline HbA1c percent. Means are treatment adjusted for baseline HbA1c and prior use of insulin.</outcome>

      <outcome>HbA1c Change From Baseline to Week 6 - HbA1c is measured as a percentage. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 6 HbA1c percent minus the baseline HbA1c percent. Means are treatment adjusted for baseline HbA1c and prior use of insulin.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>FPG Change From Baseline to Week 24 - This change from baseline reflects the Week 24 FPG minus the baseline FPG. Means are treatment-adjusted for baseline HbA1c, baseline FPG and prior use of insulin.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>FPG Change From Baseline to Week 6 - This change from baseline reflects the Week 6 FPG minus the baseline FPG. Means are treatment-adjusted for baseline HbA1c, baseline FPG and prior use of insulin, week repeated within patient and week by treatment interaction.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With HbA1c &lt;7.0% at Week 24 - The percentage of patients with an HbA1c value below 7% at week 24 was calculated for each treatment arm. If a patient did not have an HbA1c value at week 24 they were considered a failure, so HbA1c above 7%. Only patients with baseline HbA1c &gt;= 7%</outcome>
