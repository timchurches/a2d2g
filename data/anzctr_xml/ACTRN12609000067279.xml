  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Bacterial contamination of regular lenses cases when used in conjunction with marketed and antibacterial contact lenses on a daily wear (ie. wearing contact lenses during the day and removing prior to sleep) schedule.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised into one of the two groups:
1.Commercially available NIGHT &amp; DAY lenses with regular lens case 
2.Investigational antibacterial lenses (AB lenses) with regular lens case. 
Participants will wear lenses on a daily wear (ie. not sleeping in the lenses) basis for 4 months. Lens performance will be assessed at the baseline visit, and after 2 weeks, 1 month and 4 months. Lens cases will be collected for microbiological analysis at 1 month and 4 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess bacterial contamination of regular lens cases when used in conjunction with investigational or marketed contact lenses on a daily wear (ie. contact lenses worn during the day and removed prior to sleep) schedule. Used contact lens storage cases will be collected at the end of the clinical trial and tranfered to IER microbiology laboratory. Swab samples will be taken from inner surfaces of lens cases for routine microbiology isolation and identification. Contamination rate of used cases will be then determined based on data from microbiology analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 1 month and 4 months from the baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate ex vivo bacterial adhesion performance of investigational and marketed contact lenses with daily wear schedule. Bacterial assay will be performed on worn and unworn lenses and the results compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 1 month and 4 months from the baseline visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>Pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health;
any active corneal infection or any active ocular disease that would affect wearing of contact lenses;
a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication up to 12 weeks prior to and during the trial;
any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse manner or beneficial manner;
previous corneal refractive surgery;
contraindications to contact lens wear;
currently enrolled in another clinical trial;
participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for dispensing studies;
pregnant women are excluded from the trial - formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient.</exclusivecriteria>
