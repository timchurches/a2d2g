  <interventions>
    <interventions>The effect of time, sociodemographic factors, perceived social support, self-reported health, comorbidities, type and length of intervention, and mood and anxiety on health-related quality of life at 3-months, 6-months and 12- months after baseline for chronic disease clients attending the program will be examined.  In addition, changes in medical and medication out-of-pocket costs, and hospital status will be compared for the 6 months prior to baseline to the 6-months after baseline. 

A diverse range of individualised, interdisciplinary education and exercise therapy programs such as Back School, a Healthy Lifestyle program, and pain management programs; and individualised discipline specific consultations are provided.  Sessions vary from 10-15 minutes in length to several hours depending on the clients requirements.  The duration of intervention is not set but varies from one patient to another (days to years).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The benefits of interdisciplinary programs have been widely acclaimed, however there is little evidence regarding their effectiveness in chronic disease management programs, particularly for people with one or more different chronic diseases (i.e., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disease).  This study aims to investigate the effectiveness over time of a unique interdisciplinary student clinic (CAHP) in Central Queensland that provides prevention and intervention programs to people with one or more chronic diseases. It is expected that information will be gained regarding the health outcomes and cost effectiveness of such a program.  This information will assist in developing an ongoing evaluation framework for the CAHP clinic and for similar programs that may be set-up by Queensland Health, and will provide information to design a controlled clinical trial.</summary>
