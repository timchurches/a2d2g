    <interventions>Condition 1: 10 sessions of CBT over 12 weeks  Cool Kids Program

Condition 2: 10 sessions of CBT over 12 weeks  Cool Kids Program with amended skills directly derived from models of the maintenance of social anxiety. The program includes the same cognitive and behavioural strategies as condition 1 and has been amended to also include exposure to subtle avoidance, attention processes, and target self-perception biases. 

CBT sessions include psychoeducation about anxiety and social anxiety, and skills to manage anxiety. Skills focus on thinking styles and behavioural responses to anxiety. Sessions include both children and parents (less parental involvement for adolescents) and are delivered individually (to each family). 10 sessions are ideally delivered weekly, except for weeks 9 and 11 where there is a break from CBT sessions. Sessions are approximately 50 minutes in duration.

Participants are provided with a parent and child workbook.
Therapists are provisional psychologists completing postgraduate training in clinical psychology with prior experience treating anxiety, registered psychologists or clinical psychologists.
Treatment will be delivered at the Centre for Emotional Health Clinic at Macquarie University, Sydney Australia

Treatment integrity will be assessed by independent raters by watching therapy sessions and coding for adherence or violations from the treatment manuals.

    <concealment>Participants self-refer to the clinic or research team, are sent information about the research trial, provide screening information and if determined to meet inclusion but not exclusion criteria from this information, attend a diagnostic assessment and complete research measures and tasks.
Suitability is determined from the diagnostic interview and if suitable participants make payment for treatment and are then randomly allocated after diagnosis and completion of baseline measures to condition and booked in for their treatment sessions/appointments.
Randomisation list is held by an investigator who is not involved in the assessment or treatment of clients. 
Allocation to conditions will be done by the project co-ordinator who will remain blind to the next condition in the sequence until after the participant has completed baseline assessment and consented to participate. </concealment>

Categorical data will be analysed via chi-squared tests, and continuous data with parametric or equivalent non-parametric tests including mixed linear models.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Social anxiety is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders in both children and adults, with mean onset age in childhood. Historically, treatment programs for anxiety disorders in youth have been generic, which means that children have received the same intervention regardless of the type of anxiety disorder diagnosed. These generic cognitive behavioural treatment programs have shown good efficacy, with 50-60% of children achieving remission immediately after treatment, and 70% achieving remission after a few months.

Despite the widespread use of generic anxiety management programs for young people, some evidence is beginning to suggest that specific anxiety management programs  that is, programs developed for a specific disorder  may show better efficacy. However, to date, this evidence comes only from cross-study comparisons through meta-analyses. Direct comparison between generic and specific anxiety management programs within the one randomised trial has not been conducted. Theoretical models of the maintenance of social anxiety disorder among adults (Clark &amp; Wells, 1995; Rapee &amp; Heimberg, 1997) have guided research and adult treatments for the past 20 years. More recently emerging research about the key cognitive and behavioural processes that underpin social anxiety in children predicts specific targets to build on within treatment to create specific treatments and optimise efficacy.
We have recently developed a modified version of our widely used youth anxiety program, Cool Kids. This modification includes strategies to specifically target cognitive and behavioural processes that maintain social anxiety.
The primary aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of a specific, theoretically-derived intervention for social anxiety disorder in young people compared against generic child anxiety treatment, which is current best practice.</summary>
