  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This primary objective of this study is to the effect of andecaliximab (GS-5745) on
      pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in adults with cystic fibrosis
      (CF) after 8 weeks of treatment.

      There will be 2 parts to this study. In Part 1, andecaliximab 600 mg or placebo will be
      administered for 8 weeks. In Part 2, andecaliximab 300 mg, 150 mg, or placebo will be
      administered for 8 weeks. Part 2 will be initiated after completion of Part 1.</summary>
