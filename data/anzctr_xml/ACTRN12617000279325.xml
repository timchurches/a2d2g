    <interventions>A newly developed comprehensive online training program for managers will be evaluated through a clustered randomised controlled trial conducted within industry partner organisations. The intervention has been developed from evidence-based training resources and in collaboration with psychiatrists with expertise in workplace mental health and mental health online training experts. The program aims to help managers and supervisors in male-dominated industries better recognise and understand mental health in the workplace, and highlight what managers can do to help keep workers as mentally healthy as possible. The training program is divided into 3 broad topics and each topic is divided into a set of 10 minute modules. 

Topic 1.	Common Mental Illnesses
- Recognising Mental Health Issues
- The Workplace and its People

Topic 2.	How to Help an Employee you are Concerned About
- Identifying People at Risk
- Having the Talk
- Providing Support
- Facilitating Help Seeking
- Modifying work to help recovery
- Returning to Work

Topic 3.	Minimising Mental Health Risks in the Workplace
- How to be a respectful and responsible manager
- Managing existing and future work
- Managing individuals within a team
- Managing difficult emotions

Each module comprises of text material, activities, short videos and practice exercises to complete as part of the training. It is expected the entire program will take approximately 2-2.5 hours. The program has been designed so users can complete it at their own pace and preferred times across a 6 week period. The intervention will be delivered through a mobile responsive website and individuals can complete the intervention on a desktop, laptop, tablet or smart phone.

Adherence to the online training program will be monitored through the online research platform. Reminder emails will be sent to participants who have not completed the program throughout the 6 week training period, Data will be available through the research platform on how many modules each participant completed during the trial, and how many minutes they spent completing the training program.</interventions>
    <comparator>A waitlist control design will be utilised for this study. Participants in the control group will complete the pre- post- 4-month questionnaires at the same 3 time points as the intervention group. At completion of the 4-month follow up questionnaire for both groups, the waitlist control group will be offered the intervention training program. No post training assessment of the control group will be conducted.

Direct reports of the managers in the intervention and control group will be invited to complete a survey prior to the commencement of the intervention and at 4 month follow up. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary analyses will be undertaken within an intent-to-treat framework, retaining all participants as randomised, regardless of extent of engagement with training or withdrawal from the study. Likelihood based methods (mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM)) will be used to assess significance of change in the two primary manager outcome measures. Clustering will be accommodated by a random cluster membership (work site) factor. A priori planned comparisons of change from baseline to the 4-month endpoint will test the primary hypothesis. An unstructured variance-covariance matrix will be used to accommodate relationships between observations at different occasions of measurement. Stratification variables, partner employer , and any variables found to be substantially imbalanced between intervention arms post randomisation will be tentatively included in these models and retained if statistically significant and influential on outcomes. Length of time from baseline to complete training and associated post-intervention assessment will also be introduced tentatively into models to evaluate the effects of adjustment for possible effects associated with some managers undertaking these assessments earlier than others and earlier than control group participants.

Similar analyses of scaled secondary manager outcomes will assess differential change due to intervention arm. Mathematical transformation or categorisation of raw scores may be undertaken to meet distributional assumptions and address any violation of assumptions attributable to outliers. Comparable analyses of employee measures will additionally accommodate the nesting of employees within managers by including a random effect for managers where this is possible.
Additional per-protocol analyses to assess effectiveness of the program will focus on managers who completed at least one of the three topics. This subgroup will be compared to all responders in the waitlist control group and, secondarily, with managers who completed less of the training material.  The latter comparison will inform the dose-response profile of the intervention and, in particular, whether completing only a subset of the earlier components of HeadCoach has a benefit comparable to the complete program.

All tests of treatment effects will be conducted using a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals.  A member of the research team who is blinded to the intervention and waitlist control allocations will perform this analysis. 


An effect size of 0.4 would be considered a significant shift in such a measure. In order to achieve 80% power to detect an effect of this size, with an alpha value of 0.05 and two tailed tests, 200 managers will need to complete this trial.

Our industry partners estimate that they will be able to provide us with the details of 415 managers meeting the eligibility criteria for this study. Based on previous research we have conducted regarding this type of training, we expect to be able to recruit 60% of these managers and to have a drop out rate of around 30%. As a result, we should be able to comfortably recruit 200 managers to this study</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our research team has recently been awarded an Australian Mental Health Award by Beyondblue and the Movember Foundation that will fund a program of research aimed at developing and evaluating a range of new e-health interventions for men.  The study aims to evaluate a comprehensive online training program for managers in male-dominated industries to determine its effectiveness in modifying manager's behaviour, improving mental health literacy, reducing stigma and enhancing managers confidence in discussing mental health matters with their staff. 
Managers have a key role in the well-being of their staff.  They often become involved when a staff member is having difficulties and should always have a role once someone is away on sickness absence.  However, managers often report feeling unsure what to do when a staff member is ill, particularly if they are suffering from a mental illness.  These problems are amplified in male-dominated industries, where there is culture that makes discussing emotions difficult or impossible.  
Together with our collaborators, we have recently developed two new types of face-to-face manager training for male-dominate industries; one focused on how depression may present in a male dominated workforce and helps managers develop the skills and confidence to have conversations about emotions with their staff, while the other focuses more on primary prevention via teaching managers how they can modify work-based mental health risk factors, such a job demands, job control and perceived support and promote the positive aspects of work.  We propose that a combination of these two approaches would provide a comprehensive manager mental health training that would simultaneously address mental health literacy, stigma reduction and promote primary, secondary and tertiary prevention approaches to mental health in the workplace.
This comprehensive online training program for managers will be delivered via a mobile responsive website and has 3 topics each with a set of 10-minute modules to work through. Completion of the program can occur in one go or spread out over a few days or a few weeks. This freedom and flexibility has been incorporated in the design so learning pace is matched to individual styles.
Evaluation will be conducted through a randomised controlled trial within industry partner organisations. Waitlist control participants will be offered the training 6 months from the commencement of the study once follow up data is collected from the intervention group. </summary>
