  <interventions>
    <interventions>Collection of 40ml venous blood from the antecubital fossa of participants, on two separate occasions up to one week apart. Pre-analytical loss of glucose will be determined on both occasions, using three different blood collection tube systems. (One is the 'new' citrate/fluoride collection tube, the other two collection tubes are in common everyday use, that is they are used in routine clinical care).  </interventions>
    <comparator>Laboratory plasma glucose measured using the 'new' citrate/fluoride tubes will be compared at times 0 hours, 2 hours and 24 hours with a) fluoride 'grey top' tubes and b) lithium heparin PST tubes </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Method comparison statistics, including Bland Altman comparison of plasma glucose values obtained from blood samples undergoing delayed separation of red cells from plasma, with those samples  undergoing immediate separation and are therefore deemed to give accurate glucose values. 

A sample size of 40 is considered a minimum number for validation of a new laboratory assay procedure. Also, a previous study published by ourselves (Chan H et al. Plasma glucose measurement in diabetes: impact and implications of variations in sample collection procedures with a focus on the first hour after sample collection, CCLM 2014) was powered to show a clinically significant effect with 62 participants who had their plasma separated &lt;1 hour after collection. We anticipate we will need smaller numbers in a study focusing on a longer time delay when separating plasma from red cells.   </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Accurate estimation of laboratory plasma glucose is important for the screening, diagnosis and management of several conditions, including diabetes. One of the reasons why laboratory plasma glucose results may not be accurate relates to in vitro glycolysis i.e. glucose is lost due to red cell uptake of glucose, if red cells are not separated immediately from plasma, following venesection. Routinely available blood collection tubes are not good glycolysis inhibitors. A 'new' citrate/fluoride blood collecting system, manufactured by Terumo, is thought to be much better at inhibiting glycolysis. Published information is however limited and there is virtually no information available from study participants with hyperglycaemia.  The current study aims to compare pre-analytical glucose loss using the 'new' collection system with the systems already in routine use.  The study also aims to compare intra-individual rates of glycolysis. If rates of glycolysis are similar both between and also within participants, then it may be possible to apply a correction factor when undertaking comparisons of serial glucose values across 'old' and 'new' collection systems.  </summary>
