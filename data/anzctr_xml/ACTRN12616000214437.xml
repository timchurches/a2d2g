  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single platelet rich plasma injection into the Antero-inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) of the ankle will be administered within 14 days of injury.
1-2mL of 2% lignocaine will be infiltrated to the skin and superficial tissues. Blood will be drawn and centrifuged at 3000RPM for 8 minutes. The PRP will be manually aspirated. 0.5-1mL of PRP will be injected with a 25 guage needle into the defect of the AITFL seen on ultrasound in the intervention group. The exact volume will be individualised and recorded, to minimise hydrodissection of the injured tissue by excessive volume injected.
All injections will be performed by radiologist Dr James Linklater (JL) at Castlereagh Imaging St Leonards, Sydney. 
After the intervention, participants will be given oral analgesia, and record a one week pain score and this will have the primary investigators contact details should there be any concerns.</interventions>
    <comparator>A single administration of dry needling under ultrasound guidance using a peppering technique (to achieve a prolotherapy effect) will occur within 14 days of injury.
1-2mL of 2% lignocaine will be infiltrated to the skin and superficial tissues. Blood will be drawn and centrifuged at 3000RPM for 8 minutes. The PRP will be manually aspirated. For participants in the control group, PRP inside the syringe will be not be injected into the AITFL. Instead, the 25 guage needle will be passed 5 times into and adjacent to the defect of the AITFL seen on ultrasound.
All ultrasound-guided dry needling procedures will be performed by radiologist Dr James Linklater (JL) at Castlereagh Imaging St Leonards, Sydney. 
After the intervention, participants will be given oral analgesia, and record a one week pain score and this will have the primary investigators contact details should there be any concerns.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations are based on published data (available at http://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000033.full.pdf+html).
Sample size was calculated for a two-tailed comparison of an experimental group to a control group with a significance (alpha) of 0.05 and a power (1- beta) of 0.80. This was calculated using an inference of means method (mu1= 48 days, mu2= 69 days and common standard deviation sigma= 20 days). Under these assumptions, we calculate that we will need 15 subjects per group to complete the study. Assuming a 20% allowance for attrition, we will enroll 18 subjects per group.
Analysis of data will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22. Descriptive statistics will be performed on all continuous variables including histogram frequencies to assess normality. Baseline characteristics including age, weight, height, and syndesmosis width on MRI will be analysed using t-tests to detect any significant differences between cohorts. Similarly, quantitative outcome measures of pain, function and time to return to play will be analysed to compare groups using t-tests of independent samples. Where data is not normally distributed, non-parametric tests will be used to detect differences between groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As a low risk, readily available treatment, PRP injections are becoming an increasingly popular therapeutic adjunct offered by musculoskeletal clinicians. However, there is a clear need to scientifically assess the merits of this treatment option for athletes with ankle syndesmosis injury in order to establish recommendations for evidence-based practice. 
We published a pilot study entitled- "Effectiveness of a single platelet-rich plasma injection to promote recovery in rugby players with ankle syndesmosis injury". Available at http://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000033.full.pdf+html
We found a reduction in return to play by 20.7 days for the intervention (PRP) group, when compared to an historical control treated with the same rehabilitation protocol. The study supports the viability of an RCT to fully evaluate this treatment. We have calculated that a minumum of 30 participants would be required to detect a significant difference between groups in return to play, but would define a clinically significant difference as a minimum of one week.

We will conduct a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing single US-guided PRP injection to an active placebo prolotherapy. Assessors, investigators and participants will be blinded to their allocation and only the treating radiologist who will only interact with particpants to perform injections, will know allocations. 

Prospective participants from Rugby union clubs within the Sydney Rugby Union Championship will be invited to enrol. On clinical assessment, only those with a low probability for ASI will not be referred for MRI. After MRI, those meeting enrolment criteria and consenting to participate will be randomly allocated to PRP or active placebo groups, and given usual injury management in accordance with our previously published milestone based rehabilitation protocol (Samra et al 2015). 

A single injection by co-author JL will be provided within 14 days of injury. A central randomisation register will provide the allocation to JL only. The injection protocol will be identical between groups, except for lack of injection of the PRP in the active placebo group. 1-2mL of 2% lignocaine will be infiltrated to the skin and superficial tissues. Blood will be drawn and centrifuged at 3000RPM for 8 minutes. The PRP will be manually aspirated. 0.5-1mL of PRP will be injected with a 25 guage needle into the defect of the AITFL seen on ultrasound in the intervention group. The active placebo group will undergo the same process with the omission of injection of the PRP. Instead, a peppering technique of 5 passes into the AITFL will be performed. Participants will be given oral analgesia and post-injection care information and followup. No other injections of the ankle will be permitted during the rehabilitation of these athletes or within 1 week of return to play.

Return to play will be recorded in days from injury onset to first competitive match (of any duration) played since injury</summary>
