  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to one of three trial conditions (smaller incentive vs. larger incentive vs. control). There will be two intervention groups, both of which will involve provding a Personal-Financial Incentive (PFI) to pregnant women who successfully abstain from smoking. 

The first intervention will involve a smaller PFI. Women randomly allocated to this first intervention group will be provided with the opportunity to receive a PFI at eight out of 10 study sessions, contingent upon smoking abstinence. This study will involve 10 study sessions 8 of which will be intervention sessions. The amount of the monetary reward will begin at $20 and will increase by a further $20 at every intervention follow-up session participants are found to abstain from smoking. Smoking abstinence will be assessed through a self-report survey and confirmed by saliva cotinine analysis. At each of the eight intervention follow-ups, women who biochemically-validated self-report smoking abstinence will receive their potential incentive for that follow-up period (i.e. $20 for the first follow-up). Eight intervention study sessions where women are eligible to receive a reward will be conducted. They will be conducted at study sessions held during womens scheduled antenatal appointments. These eight intervention study sessions will provide participants with an opportunity to receive a total of $720 if they cease smoking for the entire study period. 

The second intervention group will involve a larger PFI. Women randomly allocated to this second intervention group will be provided with the opportunity to receive a PFI at the eight intervention study sessions, contingent upon smoking abstinence. The amount of the monetary reward will begin at $40 and will increase by a further $40 at the eight intervention follow-up participants are found to abstain from smoking. Smoking abstinence will be assessed through a self-report survey and confirmed by saliva cotinine analysis. At each intervention follow-up, women who biochemically-validate self-report smoking abstinence will receive their potential incentive for that follow-up period (i.e. $40 for the first follow-up).  Eight study sessions where women are eligible to receive a reward will be conducted (out of a total of 10 sessions). The intervention sessions will be conducted during womens scheduled antenatal appointments. These eight intervention study sessions will provide participants with an opportunity to receive a total of $1440 if they cease smoking for the entire study period.

If a participant in both intervention groups fail to abstain at one of these eight intervention study sessions or do not present for their scheduled follow-up they will not receive the incentive for that period. However the incentive scheme will only re-set to the amount the women were previously up to, therefore providing women with an opportunity to receive their incentive during their next intervention study session.</interventions>
    <comparator>The third group will be the control group. Women randomly allocated to this group will receive usual care delivered by the midwife. No financial incentive will be offered for quitting smoking. However, self-report smoking, and saliva analysis will be conducted with participants in the control group to assess smoking status.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Ninety consenting pregnant women, who self-report smoking will be randomised to one of three trial conditions (smaller incentive vs. larger incentive vs. control). Self reported smokers attending an Australian public hospital antenatal clinic will be identified and randomly allocated using block randomisation into one of three groups. saliva cotinine analysis will be used to validate self-reported smoking status. Continuous or long-term smoking cessation will be assessed through hair analysis of patient’s cotinine levels. The unit of randomisation will be the day and session of the patient’s antenatal visit to minimise potential contamination and deception. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation of days of the week to study groups was done using Proc Plan in SAS.  For each of the 10 weeks the procedure randomly assigned two sessions to each of the 3 treatment groups using a randomised block design.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to conduct a feasibility trial to test the efficacy of a Personal Financial Incentive (PFI)-based intervention at increasing smoking cessation in pregnant women attending a public hospital for antenatal care. Ninety consenting women will take part in the trial, with 30 women being randomised into one of three groups: the control group, the small PFI group and the larger PFI group. Women in the intervention groups will be eligible to receive a total of eight PFIs, if they successfully abstain from smoking for a 7 day period. Each time a participant in the intervention groups abstains from smoking their PFI will increase. As this is a Proof-Of-Concept study the main aim of the trial is to assess the viability and acceptability of this intervention.</summary>
