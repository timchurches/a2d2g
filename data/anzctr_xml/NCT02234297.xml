             product.

         11. Known or suspected sensitivity to Indocyanine green (ICG).

         12. Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, known or suspected transient ischemic events

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced
      patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal
      tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. We hypothesize
      that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of
      the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in real-time as
      operate. This is a safety study to assess the safety of BLZ-100 in patients with gliomas
      undergoing surgery.</summary>
