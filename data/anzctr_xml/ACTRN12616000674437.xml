    <interventions>A total of 42 eligible subjects will be randomized in 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the seven treatment cohorts. Then within a cohort, a subject will be further randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either ZYN002 or placebo. Therefore, six eligible unique subjects will be randomized to a treatment cohort. Within a treatment cohort, four subjects will be randomized to receive ZYN002 and two subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. Participants will be randomised to one of seven treatment groups as indicated  below. 
Treatment A  10 g of 2.5% ZYN002 or placebo applied twice daily (AM and PM) to right and left upper arms/shoulders (Total active daily dose 500mg)
Treatment B  10 g of 2.5% ZYN002 or placebo applied twice daily (AM and PM) to right and left upper thighs (Total active daily dose 500mg)
Treatment C  10 g of 2.5% ZYN002 or placebo applied twice daily on right and left upper arms/shoulders AM and right and left upper thighs (PM) (Total active daily dose 500mg)
Treatment D  6 g of 4.2% ZYN002 or placebo applied twice daily (AM and PM) to right and left upper arms/shoulders (Total active daily dose 504mg)

Treatment E  6 g of 4.2% ZYN002 or placebo applied twice daily on right and left upper arms/shoulders AM and right and left upper thighs (PM) (Total active daily dose 504mg)
Treatment F  4.7 g of 4.2% ZYN002 or placebo applied twice daily (AM and PM) to right and left upper arms/shoulders (Total active daily dose 394.8mg)
Treatment G  4.7 g of 4.2% ZYN002 or placebo applied twice daily on right and left upper arms/shoulders AM and right and left upper thighs (PM) (Total active daily dose 394.8mg)
Participants will receive the same number of treatments of placebo gel as the number of active study drug in order to keep the study blinded.
The gel will be thoroughly massaged into right and left upper arms/shoulders or right and left upper thighs by the participant. Once the participant has completed their treatment application they will be instructed to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water to remove any residual gel. Participants will be instructed to not lay or lean on either shoulder/arm, for at least 30 minutes post dosing/  Subjects will be permitted to shower more than 90 minutes prior to each mornings dosing..  Dosing period will be 13 days plus one morning dose on day 14. Adherence to treatment will be monitored by empty gel syringe return and collection and review of participant dosing diary.

    <concealment>The trial site will receive a list of randomization numbers to be used in the study but will be blinded to which treatment the participant is receiving.  The trial site will screen and enroll subjects that meet the study criteria.  Once it is determined the subject/patient qualifies to participate in the study the site will choose the first randomization number for the participant.  The site will continue to use the next randomization number in the sequence provided for each subsequent subject enrolled, until they have randomized the appropriate number of subjects for the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomization schedule will be prepared by a statistician.  The software application SAS will be used to generate the randomization codes.  A series unique codes will be issued on a per protocol treatment cohort allocation.  On Day 1 eligible healthy subjects will be randomized to one of the seven treatment cohorts receiving randomized treatment twice daily. Subjects in each treatment cohort will be randomized to receive either active treatment or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Pharmacokinetics: PK parameters listed above for ZYN002 (CBD) and THC will be calculated/derived from the data using non-compartmental analysis with WinNonlin. Actual sampling times and actual dose will be used to estimate plasma PK parameters. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, coefficient of variation, geometric mean) for the individual PK parameters and plasma concentration over time will be presented by treatment group and time point. Differences in dose-dependent PK parameters (Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, Cav,ss, AUC) between Treatments (A-G) will be compared via an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model or an appropriate non-parametric approach.
The pre-dose Ctrough plasma levels over the days of dosing will be compared statistically for assessment of steady-state for each ZYN002 dose level. Attainment of steady-state will be concluded if the 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio between two consecutive time points (i.e. Day 10 vs. Day 8) is completed within the acceptance range of (0.80  1.25).
Safety Analyses: All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analysis.
AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the MedDRA version 19.0 or higher. AEs and SAEs will be tabulated by treatment group. Additionally, the total number of AEs and the total number of subjects with AEs will be identified for each treatment.
Vital signs collected by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presented by treatment. Changes from baseline in the vital signs will also be summarized by treatment. ECGs, safety laboratory test results and change from baseline will also be tabulated by treatment group. Application site irritation will be summarized using counts and percentages for each treatment and time point.
Sample size for the study is chosen for the purpose of the study. No formal statistical assumptions are used to determine the sample size.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>What is this study about The purpose of this study is to investigate how safe and tolerable repeat doses (applied twice daily for 13 days and once on the 14th day) of ZYN002 transdermal gel is in healthy volunteers.  The study will look at how the body absorbs the study drug.  This will be done by analysing the levels of ZYN002 in your blood at various times following drug administration.  
Your skin at the application sites and your hands will be checked to see if there is any irritation or reactions present after ZYN002 application.  In the study you will be provided with moisturizer to apply to assist with potential dryness of the skin caused by the study treatment.
Who is if for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 55 years and are in general good health. 

Study details: This study will investigate various doses of ZYN002 compared to a placebo gel (a treatment with no active ingredients which looks like the real thing but it is not).  This study is double-blind which means you and your study doctor, together with the study staff administering the study treatment will not know whether you are receiving ZYN002 or placebo gel.  

What does study participation involve? Your participation in the study includes A screening visit, which could be up to 28 days before your study treatment..Throughout the study you will have various medical tests (physical examinations, vital signs measured, ECG measured, C-SSRS assessment and will have several blood and urine samples collected for laboratory analysis.

You will report to the clinic your first day of treatment (Day 1).  The study treatment will be applied twice daily for 13 days with one treatment on day 14.  Days 1-13, each morning while at the research facility, you will apply your AM treatment of ZYN002 or placebo gel.  You will apply the study treatment to the treatment site assigned to you (either your left and right shoulder and/or upper arms, or your left and right upper thighs).  You will apply your AM dose of all the study drug to clean, dry, intact skin, thoroughly massaging it into the application sites assigned.  You will continue to massage study drug into the application site until the application site feels dry to the touch.  This will take approximately 2-4 minutes but everyones skin is different so it could take less or more time for you.  You will repeat this procedure at your home for the afternoon application on Days 1 to 13.  You will return to the research facility every morning on Days 1-13 for the AM dose. On Day 14 you will stay at the research facility until the evening of Day 15, 36 hours after the last study treatment.  You will return to the research facility on Days 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 31 and Day 35 for study assessments.
