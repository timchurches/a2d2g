  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dietary intervention of a low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) diet.  The low FODMAP diet is a diet with very low amounts of these fermentable sugars and requires the restriction of foods such as milk, apples, pears, watermelon, wheat, rye, onion and garlic.  Participants were provided with low FODMAP meals (3 meals and 3 snacks daily) but asked to control the meal/snack portions according to their appetite.  The average daily FODMAP content on the low FODMAP diet was less than 2g compared to the average typical Australian diet of 20g.  Participants are required to follow a low FODMAP and typical Australian diet for three weeks each and all food is provided.  This trial is a crossover study which was already provided in a later field of this trial record.  All food will be provided on three weeks of the low FODMAP and three weeks of the typical Australian diet. All participants will have a minimum of three-week washout period (returning to their usual diet) before crossing over to the alternate diet</interventions>
    <comparator>A typical Australian diet will be used to assess changes in symptoms and faecal characteristics compared to the low FODMAP diet.  The typical Australian diet will include commonly eaten foods and meals (e.g. apples and chicken risotto) and will include FODMAP at each meal and snack.  Participants will remain on the typical Australian diet for three weeks and all food will be provided.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall gastrointestinal symptoms on a low versus typical Australian diet using a visual analogue scale (VAS) which participants will complete daily.   Participants will indicate symptom severity by a marking on a 100mm line.  0 indicates no symptoms and 100mm worst symptoms ever experienced.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On a daily basis over the three weeks of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Specific gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, passage of wind and dissatisfaction of stool consistency on a low versus typical Australian diet by using the VAS as described for the primary outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On a daily basis over the three weeks of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Faecal biomarkers of whole gut transit time, pH, short-chain fatty acids and microbiota on a low versus typical Australian diet.  Transit time capsules will be ingested on day 17 of each diet intervention and a five-day faecal sample collected and immediately stored in provided portable freezers.  Stool will be x-rayed to determine time that transit markers were passed and pH, short-chain fatty acids and microbiota will be assessed at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) using their current methods of analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After three weeks of intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intestinal permeability on a low versus typical Australian diet.  This will be assessed on the last day of each diet intervention by a five-hour urine collection after the ingestion of the sugars lactulose and rhamnose.  The ratio of lactulose and rhamnose in the urine indicates the amount passed across the small intestine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After three weeks of intervention</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from Eastern Health Functional Gut Clinic, Monash University Breath Testing Centre, advertisement through local newspapers and word of mouth.  People interested in participating in the study will be assessed by a gastroenterologist to determine eligibility.  If eligible, each participant will be randomised by central randomisation by computer.  The participants will be blinded to the diets which are referred to as 'pink diet' and 'yellow diet' instead of typical Australian and low FODMAP diets.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>FODMAPs are poorly absorbed sugars that putatively contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Supporting evidence comprises confirmation of mechanisms of action, effects of acute challenge with individual FODMAPs/foods, observational studies in IBS and quiescent Crohns disease, randomised controlled trials of fructose and fructan rechallenges in IBS patients with controlled symptoms on a low FODMAP diet and a non-randomised comparative study.  
We aim to fill evidence gaps regarding effects on symptoms over the longer term with the low FODMAP diet compared to the moderate FODMAP intake on a typical Australian diet by comparing GI symptoms in unselected IBS patients consuming such diets with those in healthy and disease controls (quiescent Crohn's disease).</summary>
