  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The parietal component is incisional pain experienced at the port sites and visceral component is deep intra-abdominal pain related to diaphragmatic irritation caused by pnemoperitoneum and postcholecystectomy wound. Shoulder tip pain is presumably referred pain related to distension of diaphragm caused by pneumoperitoneum and resultant phrenic nerve neuropraxia.The aim of our prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to evaluate the intensity of visceral, parietal and shoulder tip pain, and to determine the efficacy of peritrocal injection and intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine on each pain.</summary>
