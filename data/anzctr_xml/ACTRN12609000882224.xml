    <interventions>Treatment regime involves 3 stages with L-citrulline, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and 1 wash out period between Treatments 1 and 2. There is no wash out period between Treatments 2 and 3. Volunteers will participate in all 3 treatment stages. 
Treatment 1: either L-citrulline or placebo; 3g powder in sachets taken twice a day for 12 weeks
Wash out period: 4 weeks followed by a cross-over design
Treatment 2: either L-citrulline or placebo; 3g powder in sachets taken twice a day for 12 weeks
Treatment 3: all volunteers receive a combination of L-citrulline (3g powder in sachets taken twice a day) and BH4 (50mg per tablet, 3 tablets taken 3 times a day) for two weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Maltodextrin (3g powder in sachets taken twice a day) is used for placebo. Placebo will be given during either treatment 1 or 2 for 12 weeks. All volunteers will receive placebo for 12 weeks as this is a cross-over study.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim of Study:
To determine the therapeutic efficacy and effects on arterial function of oral L-citrulline and of the combination of L-citrulline and BH4 in patients with peripheral arterial disease

Background to study:
Loss of the protective actions of L-arginine derived nitric oxide is a cardinal feature of endothelial dysfunction, which contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease. Supplementation with L-arginine has been shown to improve vascular function in some but not all clinical studies. Importantly L-arginine bioavailability is low. In contrast L-citrulline, a natural precursor of L-arginine, raises plasma L-arginine levels more effectively. In addition there is a naturally occurring substance called tetrahydrobipterin (BH4) which is a key co-factor in the production of nitric oxide. We believe that there may be additional benefit using the combination (L-citrulline plus BH4).  Therefore this study will investigate the clinical effects of oral L-citrulline and combined BH4 supplementation in patients with peripheral arterial disease.</summary>
