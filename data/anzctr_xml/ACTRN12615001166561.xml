  <interventions>
    <interventions>A nasal spray containing saline solution and 1.6 mg/ml carrageenan will be taken by participants in the active group during a cold. Each spray contains 0.14ml of the solution..

Participants will spray each nostril 4 times per day (first thing in the morning, at lunch time, at dinner time and before bed) for 10 days at the start of cold symptoms.   Participants will fill in an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) at baseline with no cold, and on day 7 and day 14 of a cold.  From the start of a cold, cold symptoms and peak flow will be recorded daily for 14 days, and for a further 7 days if cold symptoms persist.  Nasal swabs will be taken to establish virus type and viral positive colds on day 2 and day 10, and a further swab will be taken on day 18 if cold symptoms persist. Participants will be followed for 16 weeks between April and November (peak cold season), and will treat up to two colds using the spray during this time, if they experience cold symptoms.  Nasal spray bottle weights will be measured to determine compliance.  Participants will be skin prick tested to common environmental allergens (house dust mite, cat, mixed grasses) to establish their atopic status.  </interventions>
    <comparator>A nasal spray containing saline solution will be taken by participants in the placebo group during a cold. Participants will spray each nostril 4 times per day for 10 days at the start of cold symptoms. 

Methodology for the placebo group will be the same as the the protocol for the active group (outlined in the intervention/exposure* section above).  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be the difference from baseline in ACQ scores with a cold between the placebo and active groups. </outcome>
      <timepoint>After 7 days of having a cold (ACQ score in past 7 days).   </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bronchodilator medication use between the active and placebo groups. This will be measured by self-reporting in the symptoms diaries.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the 14 days following the start of cold symptoms.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage reduction from baseline in respiratory peak flow between active and placebo during a cold. Daily peak flow meter readings as recorded in symptom diaries. These measures will be compared to the baseline peak flow reading taken at the enrolment visit when they do not have a cold.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Average over 14 days from the start of a cold.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of days with cold symptoms between the active group and the placebo group. These will be self-reported cold symptoms as recorded in the symptom diary.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the 14 days following the start of cold symptoms.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of cold symptoms between the active group and the placebo group. The severity cold symptoms is measured by taking the total score for each symptom over the duration of a cold and dividing it by the total number of days of a cold.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the 14 days following the start of cold symptoms.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average level of rhinovirus in nose on day 2 and day 10 of a cold between the active group and the placebo group. Rhinovirus levels will be measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 2 and days 10 of a cold. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ACQ at baseline and on day 7 for atopic and non-atopic asthmatics in the carrageenan group, and in the placebo group. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7 from the start of a cold.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of viral positive nasal swabs taken on day 10 of a cold will be compared between atopic and non-atopic individuals in the carrageenan and the placebo group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Nasal swabs for viral analysis will be taken on Day 10 after the start of a cold.. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported GP, after hours medical centre or hospital A&amp;E visits for asthma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of each cold, we will ask participants if they had needed to see their GP, after hours medical centre or hospital A&amp;E Department for asthma during the cold.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Allocation concealment of bottles between placebo and active will occur by the manufacturer, off-site, who will use central randomisation by computer to allocate bottle codes.

    <sequence>Permuted block randomisation by computer. Two lists will be generated, and those who've had an emergency visit for asthma in the past 12 months will be assigned to one list, and all other asthmatics to another.  This is to distrubute those few participants with severe asthma evenly between the active and placebo groups. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Assuming 75% of participants in our proposed study will develop cold symptoms during the 16 weeks of participation, then 150 subjects in each group will have 82.8% power to detect a reduction in ACQ of 0.34 with a cold.  Assuming a dropout rate of 15% we will recruit 360 participants into the study (180 in each group).  The primary analysis will use a hierarchical linear model with individual as the lower level and the size of the increase in ACQ.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>New Zealand has high rates of asthma and hospitalisations for asthma. Viral respiratory infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. Preliminary laboratory and clinical evidence points to carrageenan nasal spray (an extract of red seaweed) being a potentially exciting new treatment for cold virus infections. This study will investigate how effective using a nasal spray containing carrageenan is as a treatment against the development of asthma exacerbations caused by cold infections, in adults with asthma. </summary>
