  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is investigate effects of fish oil on learning and behaviour of children from predominantly Indigenous schools in the Northern Territory. Children will receive fish oil or placebo on school days for 2 school terms (Phase 1; 10 weeks each with one week's break) and then both treatment and placebo groups will receive fish oil for a further 2 school terms (Phase 2; following a 4 week semester break). The study will be double-blinded for Phase 1 and single-blinded for Phase 2.</summary>
