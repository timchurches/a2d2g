    <interventions>A 10 week professional development program will be delivered to early childhood educators by speech pathologists. The program is known as the Training in Interaction, Communication and Literacy (TICL) program and aims to improve the language and early literacy skills of children by up-skilling their educators.

The TICL program covers the following skill areas known to facilitate improved language and literacy skills in preschool-aged children (El-Choueifati, McCabe, Munro, &amp; Purcell, 2008; El-Choueifati, Purcell, McCabe, &amp; Munro, 2012);
*Developing positive and responsive adult and child interactions
*Explicit literacy instruction
*Developing storytelling skills
*Encouraging all children in a group to participate
*Fostering peer to peer interactions
*Developing responsive family involvement in language and literacy

The program includes 1x1 hour small group workshops and 1x1 hour coaching sessions facilitated face-to-face by a speech pathologist. These sessions occur once a week for 10 weeks.

    <concealment>This is a cluster-randomised trial. Preschool/childcare centres will be recruited via a community organisation and then individuals will be provided with information about the trial and offered the chance to participate (early childhood educators and children via their parents). 50% of preschools will be allocated to receive the treatment and 50% will act as controls. This random allocation will be done by a University of Sydney researcher who is independent and blind to the study.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation: 
Preschoolers
- An effective sample size was determined using a power analysis, with power =0.80, an effect size of 0.5 and a significance level of 0.05 using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007). The results indicated that an effective sample size of 128 preschoolers in total would be required; 64 preschoolers in the TICL group and 64 in the control group. 
- Next, an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.0138 was calculated based on pilot research.
- We then calculated the minimum number or preschoolers required if we recruited 4 or 6 preschools/clusters (based on realistic resources) and ascertained that we would need 57 preschoolers from 4 preschools or 30 preschoolers from 6 clusters.
- Finally, a decision was made to recruit 6 preschools based on the more realistic number of preschoolers in each cluster required to get an effective sample size of 128.
- Based on pilot research we also predict that there will be a 12% attrition rate. Taking this into account, we believe that aiming for an average of 35 preschoolers from each preschool/child care centre will allow for a natural attrition of up to 12% with enough power to still show a medium effect. Additionally, we believe that 35 preschoolers from each preschool/child care centres is a realistic number.

Early childhood educators
- The intended sample size is 24 based on the above sample size of preschoolers. Currently the required ratio of early childhood educator to child is 1:11 for children aged 36 months and over (http://www.careforkids.com.au/articlesv2/article.asp?ID=127). Therefore we expect 4 early childhood educators to be recruited with each group of 35 preschoolers from each of the six preschools/child care centres. We are unable to conduct a power analysis on this group of participants and their outcomes are secondary in the project.

Preschool/childcare centres

-Based on the above sample size of preschoolers, 6 preschool/childcare centres will be recruited.

Preschooler and ECE data will be analysed using a series of 2 (group) x 4 (times) factorial Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) nested by preschool with repeated measures on the second factor."

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will evaluate the Training in Interaction, Communication and Literacy (TICL) program through a cluster randomised trial. TICL is a 10 week professional development program for Early Childhood Educators (ECEs), delivered by Speech Pathologists, and designed to improve the language and early literacy skills of preschoolers. Pre and post measures of changes in the knowledge and skills of ECEs and the language and literacy skills of the preschoolers they care for will be taken. These results will be compared with a control group of ECEs and preschoolers. We hypothesise that TICL will improve the language and early literacy skills of preschoolers when compared with no treatment.</summary>
