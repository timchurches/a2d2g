  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in
      patients with active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) who have an inadequate
      clinical response to NSAIDs and corticosteroids. In Part I of the study patients will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive iv infusions of RoActemra/Actemra (8mg/kg iv for patients &gt;=30kg,
      or 12mg/kg for patients &lt;30kg) or placebo, every 2 weeks. Stable NSAIDs and methotrexate will
      be continued throughout. After 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, all patients will have the
      option to enter Part II of the study to receive open-label treatment with RoActemra/Actemra
      for a further 92 weeks, followed by a 3-year continuation of the study in Part III in which,
      for patients who meet specific criteria, an optional alternative dosing schedule decreasing
      the study drug administration frequency will be introduced. Anticipated time on study
      treatment is up to 5 years.</summary>
