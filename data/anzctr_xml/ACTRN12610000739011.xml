  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients in this trial will be taking methotrexate (MTX). The dose will vary between patients depending on their disease activity and the decision of their prescribing physician.

The exact mechanism of action of methotrexate remains unclear but it acts as a folate antagonist. Therefore all patients receiving methotrexate receive 5mg/week of oral folic acid in an effort to reduce occurrence of methotrexate associated adverse effects. Patients will continue taking folate for as long as they remain on methotrexate (MTX). This may be long term if it is providing adequate control of their rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 

The intervention is a reduced dose (0.8mg/weekly) of oral folate as a supplement to methotrexate.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is 5mg/weekly of oral folate. Patients will continue taking folate for as long as they remain on methotrexate (MTX). This may be long term if it is providing adequate control of their rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Methotrextate (MTX) remains the most commonly used drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The exact mecahnism of action of MTX remains unlear but it acts as a folate antagonist. Thus it is recommended that all patients receiving MTX also receive at least 5mg/week of folic acid in an effort to reduce occurrence of MTX associated adverse effects. Previous research has suggested that supplemental folic acid has no detrimental effects on control of RA. However we have shown that patients with higher red blood cell (RBC) concentrations of folic acid have more active RA compared to those with lower RBC concentrations. we now wish to determine whether reducing the amount of extra folic acid patients receive will help improve disease control in those patients receiving MTX.</summary>
