Placebo Comparator: Sugar capsule - One normal healthy subject and two heart failure subjects will be randomized and given placebo throughout the trial period.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of multiple doses of SG1002 - Concomitant medication use, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and adverse events will be used to assess safety of each dose.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with heart failure are reported to have lower levels of hydrogen sulfide in their
      blood, even though sulfur is available naturally in the diet. Hydrogen sulfide is a molecule
      that has been shown to have a number of beneficial effects and thus the low levels may
      contribute to the disease. This trial is testing whether a medical food product of synthetic
      sulfur molecules, SG1002, can overcome this deficit in blood levels of hydrogen sulfide.</summary>
