  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is a feasibility/ pilot study to establish if the administration of the treatment enteral feed (1.5 kcal/ml) increases mean daily energy delivery (kilocalorie per day) by &gt; or equal to 20% compared to the control (1.0 kcal/ml). The study will provide baseline data to allow for the planning and funding of a larger multi centre trial to determine if delivery of additional energy to critically ill adults over the first 10 days of their ICU stay affects clinically important outcomes.
Following the 10 day study treatment period, if required, patients in both groups will receive additional nutrition according to the centres standard care.
The pilot study will be conducted in 6 centres in Australia with 100 patients enrolled over a six month period.</summary>
