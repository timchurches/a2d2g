    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At each centre, people referred to the study will be sequentially allocated an ID number. This ID number will be used for all subsequent study documentation for that participant. The procedures outlined in the Allocation of ID number Standard Operating Procedure are to be followed.

All people with suspected bowel obstruction secondary to malignancy presenting to hospital because of vomiting, or inpatients who develop evidence of bowel obstruction will be referred to the study.  The study nurse will ask the consultant in charge for permission to approach potentially eligible participants. This referral will be recorded within both the Case Report Form and the participantâ€™s clinical file.

If participants are suitable for entry and prepared to consent to the study, they will undergo baseline assessments and assessment of eligibility criteria and commence study the following morning. A screening log will be kept of all potentially eligible participants including the reasons for non-entry.

On notification of a participant, the pharmacist at each site will consult the schedule, and will allocate the next code available and prepare one or the other of the treatment arms delivered in a labeled syringe. The participant ID, allocation code, dates of request, preparation, and dispensing will be recorded in a log maintained by the pharmacist.

All syringes will be prepared by the site clinical trial pharmacist according to the randomisation schedule. Each syringe will be numbered according to the pre-determined randomisation code and labeled as 003/07 study - octreotide 600mcg/placebo normal saline 10mls according to the prescription from the investigator (or 400mcg in the case of severe renal impairment). All syringes will look identical in volume and colour to preserve the blinding irrespective of the contents.

At all times, from eligibility screening to completion of the study, all study staff are unaware of the treatment allocation. Allocation is concealed from the investigator at the time of the participant inclusion in the trial; the allocation is determined by contacting the site pharmacy.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation schedules will be developed for each site using random number tables, generated at an independent centre (central registry). Treatment for each participant will be allocated according to a block randomisation schedule held by the central registry in a 1:1 ratio. Block randomisation will ensure even allocation to each code. The central registry will supply site randomisation schedules to each site pharmacy. There will be no stratification at the randomisation level for this study.</sequence>

In some cases it is possible that participants will offered pre-consent, as in the case where the participant have an episode of partial or complete bowel obstruction that is not operable, or has known malignancy within the peritoneum and is therefore at risk of subsequent bowel obstruction.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of the drug octreotide in palliative care management of bowel obstruction caused by cancer in people with advanced cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have widespread and advanced cancer and you have a related bowel obstruction which requires hospital admission or a change in care if you are already in hospital, but surgical removal is not currently considered appropriate. 

Trial details 
Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive a continuous infusion of the drugs octreotide and ranitidine under the skin (subcutaneous) in addition to intravenous doses of dexamethasone and intravenous or subcutaneous fluids for 72 hours. The other group (control) will receive fluids under the skin only. Bowel obstruction is a common medical problem in people with advanced cancer. Current treatment options include combinations of surgery (where this is possible), nil by mouth, a feeding tube placed into the stomach, pain relief, and medications that reduce secretions. None of these options has been tested in a study that is large enough to determine which works best. Octreotide can inhibit the release of hormones that cause secretions into the gut that may make the pain of bowel obstruction worse. Inhibiting these secretions with Octreotide may help relieve pain and improve the quality of life.</summary>
