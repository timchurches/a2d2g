  <interventions>
    <interventions>A home-based unsupervised progressive resistance exercise program that requires no additional equipment for participants.

Participants have the program individually tailored to suit the strength and endurance of their calf muscle in consultation with the principal researcher who is a RN and Exercise Scientist.

The exercise protocol is split into 3 stages
1. Seated heel raises
2. Standing heel raises (both legs)
3. Standing heel raise (one leg)

The participants progress through each stage by the various 4 levels
1. 10 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day
2. 15 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day
3. 20 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day
4. 25 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day

Participants move on to the next level or stage the once they have comfortably completed the current level for at least 3days or until ready to progress based on their feedback and in consultation with the principal researcher.

The exercise program is in addition to usual care (compression bandaging and wound care)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study was to establish if a home-based progressive resistance exercise program was feasible and then determine if there was clinical improvement in the healing rates of venous leg ulcers as a result of the intervention. Secondary aims were to examine if participation in the home-based program improved calf muscle pump function or the physical fitness parameters measured as part of this pilot study.</summary>
