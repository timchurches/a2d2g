  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment, also known as Evidence-Based Supported Employment (EBSE): individualized intensive employment support services integrated with primary health care services, provided by 2 Employment Consultants to general practice patients seeking Sickness or Invalid's Benefit renewals for work incapacity because of psychiatric or substance dependency problems.  The Employment Consultants will see participants on a as-needed basis, depending on their health and vocational needs, for the total duration of the study period (18 months).</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group will comprise Dunedin Work and Income clients matched for age, sex, NZDep2006 small area deprivation score, and work incapacity diagnosis to intervention group participants on a 2:1 ratio (control:intervention).  This group will use existing employment support services available in the community, that is, "treatment as usual".</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acquisition of competitive employment (open job market).  Employment consultants will keep in regular phone and face-to-face contact with clients during the job search and after employment is attained, as part of the IPS model of service delivery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During study period (18 months).  At least monthly but it is likely that support will be more intensive during the job search phase and initially at job acquisition, and will be driven in part by client needs, although an assertive outreach approach may also be used to address the needs of clients who consistently fail to make contact.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to first job, duration of longest job tenure.  Through contact with the Employment Consultant as described above.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During study period (18 months).  At least monthly.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annualised number of weeks worked.   Through contact with the Employment Consultant as described above.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During study period (18 months).  At least monthly.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychological symptoms as assessed by the Kessler 10, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Drug and Alcohol Use Scales</outcome>
      <timepoint>During study period (18 months).  3-6 monthly, via questionnaires delivered by 2 researchers who are also clinical staff at the study clinic.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Emergency department presentations and hospital inpatient admissions.  By examination of medical records data (at Dunedin Hospital), by the 2 researchers mentioned above.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During study period (18 months), assessed at the end of the study period.  Compared with the year prior to study commencement.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The intervention cohort will be recruited from patients at the free clinic (Servants Health Centre) seeking assessment for the Sickness or Invalidâ€™s Benefit because of psychiatric problems or substance dependency.  Patients will be referred by their general practitioner, and patients consenting to enter the study will receive IPS delivered by the employment consultants.</concealment>

    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Data for comparison with the IPS group will come from the Dunedin Work and Income office.  They will identify a group of Sickness and Invalids Beneficiaries who live in matched NZDep2006 areas but who do not consult at the study clinic, and provide the research team with data on the employment status of this group.  The comparison group will matched by frequency on a 2:1 ratio to IPS participants by age, sex, ethnicity and diagnostic classification.  Because the reference intervention is treatment-as-usual, there will be no restriction on what vocational support members of the comparison group receive.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic unemployment adversely affects health and increases suicide risk.  New Zealand has very high youth unemployment and suicide rates.  Unemployment is common in people with mental illness, and mental illness is the most frequent reason for work incapacity on the Sickness Benefit (SB).  Unemployment, mental illness, and being on the SB are more common in Maori.  The Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment has proven effectiveness in specialist psychiatric care for helping people with mental illness find open employment.  IPS is yet untested in primary care, where most SB medical assessments occur.  Two employment consultants will be appointed and trained to deliver IPS to Sickness Beneficiaries with mental illness and/or substance dependence at Dunedins free GP clinic.  A cohort study is proposed comparing employment outcomes between Sickness Beneficiaries receiving IPS at the free clinic and beneficiaries receiving existing employment support at Work and Income.  Participants mental health symptoms and use of hospital services will also be monitored.  Realistic Evaluation will be used to identify factors promoting the implementation and uptake of the IPS programme.</summary>
