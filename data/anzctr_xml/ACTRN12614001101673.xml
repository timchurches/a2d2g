  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a Phase I dose-response trial designed to find out how much physical activity, in the form of walking, can be prescribed for people living in the community post hip fracture in terms of safety, tolerability and feasibility. 
Participants will be individually supervised during their walking by an allied health clinician and can walk with their usual assistive device. Participants will walk for a prescribed period of time (dose level) at a location that is convenient to them. Participants will be instructed to walk at a moderate level of intensity which will be determined by the BORG CR-10 rating of perceived exertion scale, where 3 = moderate I am still comfortable but am breathing a little harder. Walking can occur indoors or outdoors and the dose can be spread out over a period of 1 week depending on the participants' needs but participants will be encouraged to complete their physical activity in bouts of 10 minutes or more. For example, dose 3 (35 minutes per week) could be reached in 3 ways: 1) 2 bouts of 10 minutes and one bout of 15 minutes per week; 2) one bout of 25 minutes and one bout of 10 minutes per week; or 3) one bout of 35 minutes per week.  
The dose level will follow a modified Fibonacci scheme starting with an initial dose of 10 minutes of supervised walking per week for the first 3 participants, with early larger dose increments which get smaller for higher doses until the guideline stopping value of 150 minutes of walking per week is reached (e.g. 10, 20, 35 etc. minutes). Dose escalation will depend on the presence or absence of adverse events or tolerability issues. One hundred and fifty minutes is the maximum minutes of prescribed walking per week because if this is achieved without incident it means that participants can safely meet physical activity guidelines for older adults.
Each participant will be involved in the study for a period of 7 days only. </interventions>
    <comparator>There will be no control group but the trial will involve dose comparison. The first cohort of 3 participants will walk for the same initial dose of 10 minutes within 1 week. If no participant stops due to an adverse event or the dose not being tolerated, the next cohort of 3 participants receive the next higher dose of 25 minutes. If 1 participant per cohort stops due to an adverse event or the dose not being tolerated, a second cohort of 3 participants are prescribed the same 10 minute dose. If 1 out of 6 participants exhibits an adverse event or does not tolerate the dose, then the study continues as planned at the next higher dose (25 minutes). If 2 or more participants out of the 6 exhibit an adverse event or do not tolerate the dose, the dose escalation stops at that level and the previous dose is considered as the maximum tolerated dose.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>The maximum tolerated dose of physical activity will be identified when either:
1) A cohort of participants cannot complete the dose of physical activity due to safety or tolerability issues
2) A cohort of participants achieve 150 minutes of prescribed walking within 1 week. Dose escalation will not occur if this dose of physical activity is achieved as this amount fulfills current physical activity guidelines. </timepoint>

    <designfeatures>This is a Phase I dose-response trial using an algorithm-based A+B design; the 3+3 design. These designs are commonly used to determine the maximum tolerable dose for medications. 
Participants will be consecutively assigned to a dose level according to the algorithm.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis will be based on decision rules described by Lin and Shih (2001) to determine the maximum tolerated dose of physical activity (minutes of walking) in relation to adverse events and tolerability issues. 
Feasibility issues will be classified separately and refer to issues preventing participation but not resulting from participation. These will be described.

Secondary analyses will describe baseline mobility, walking confidence and demographic data. In addition, secondary outcomes will be used for preliminary exploration of any associations between walking dose and change in mobility or confidence and any associations between maximum dose and participant characteristics. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We already know that the amount of walking completed by people in rehabilitation is very low and people find it hard to regain their walking ability in the community after having a hip fracture. This study will find out how much walking can feasibly and safely be completed by people who have been recently discharged from hospital after having a hip fracture. The results will help guide therapists as to how much walking they could prescribe to patients living in the community for long-term health benefits. </summary>
