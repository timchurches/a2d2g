    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Random allocation to a specific bowel preparation will occur at the time of booking for colonoscopy and will be via computer generated random numbers. This process is conducted by the endoscopy booking office (central administration) and not by the study investigators.

All patients presenting for colonoscopy at The Western Hospital colorectal unit will be eligible to take part. Exclusions included patient who cannot consent, unable to speak English or understand the bowel preparation regimen adequately, pregnant women and children under the age of 18yo. Each suitable patient will be consented for both the colonoscopy and then entry into the trial by the consultant surgeon booking their procedure.
When contacted by the Western Hospital endoscopy booking office the patient will verbally confirm they have agreed to the trial and then be randomised into either the standard bowel preparation group or the new bisacodyl and diet group and appropriate information given to them. There is a contact number on the patient information sheet for the study investigators, dietician and pharmacy to answer any questions.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to study a new way of cleaning the bowel prior to colonoscopy. Current methods of cleaning the bowel are very effective but have some limitations. Bowel preparation currently involves drinking a large volume of salty tasting fluid which many patients do not like. An alternative method involves drinking a smaller volume of solution that can cause complications associated with dehydration and decreased salt levels within the body. 
In this study we will evaluate a new way of cleaning the bowel involving the use of a more gentle tablet laxative and diet restrictions in the three days before your colonoscopy.
We are also interested in how you as the patient feel about this method of cleaning the bowel and we will ask you to fill in a questionnaire prior to your colonoscopy. 
The laxative we are using in this trial (Dulcolax) is freely available and works by stimulating the colon to pass bowel motions. It is a safe drug that is proven to be effective in helping empty the bowel.  
Dulcolax (bisacodyl) is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia to treat constipation and evacuation of the bowel.

This study will be conducted at The Western Hospital Footscray. 
200 people will be asked to participate in this trial.</summary>
