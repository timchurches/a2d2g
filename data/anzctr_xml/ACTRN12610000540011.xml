  <interventions>
    <interventions>To investigate:

1.the prevalence of persistent cough, upper airway dysfunction and dysphonia following H1N1 (swine flu) infection,
2.the role of associated risk factors such as 
asthma, rhinitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Ace-I use, obstructive sleep apnoea, poor vocal hygiene and other.
3. clinical course and characteristics of post H1N1 persistent cough such as duration, severity, and associated symptoms such as vocal cord dysfunction / Laryngeal Paraesthesia / voice by questionnaire. Cough reflex sensitivity, Extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness and Bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
4. mechanisms of increased cough reflex sensitivity and airway hyperresponsiveness,
5. relation to viral persistence.

These observations will take place in a respiratory clinical room of the John Hunter Hospital (JHH) in Newcastle, New South Wales (NSW) and will occur after the potential participant has be identified from the pathology database as having been tested for H1N1 infection and contacted as to their interest to participate in the research study. After consent has been obtained the participant will visit the clinic at (JHH) for a maximum of 2 occassions (first visit will last for around 40 minutes and the second visit of around 50 minutes)* to complete the above observations. * However, these 2 visits may be combined into a single (1)  90 minute visit if appropriate.</interventions>

      <outcome>Vocal hygiene by questionnaire and voice testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will occur at one of the two visits (or a single combined visit for adults when deemed appropriate) in the speech pathology clinic that the participant will attend after they have been identified as having previously been tested for H1N1 infection, been contacted about the study and given their consent to participate in the study.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This new research will investigate the prevalence of persistent cough, breathing difficulties and voice changes following H1N1 (swine flu) infection.
We will also be investigating the role of cough risk factors including asthma, rhinitis (hayfever), reflux, Ace-Inhibitor use (for high blood pressure), obstructive sleep apnoea (a sleep disorder), voice changes, etc. As well as characteristics of persistent cough including length of cough, how severe the cough is, cough sensitivity, associated symptoms, breathing and voice changes.
The current H1N1 influenza pandemic provides an opportunity to address many of the knowledge gaps in post viral cough. 

Our hypotheses are that there will be a prevalence of 10% of persistent cough and upper airway dysfunction following H1N1 infection.
That upper airways disorder and heightened cough reflex sensitivity will be 
increased following H1N1 infection, and that voice changes will be more prevalent following H1N1 infection.</summary>
