  <interventions>
    <interventions>ERCP is commonly performed in either the left lateral decubitus or prone position. 
The left lateral decubitus position for performing ERCP will be in half of the randomised group. 
Measurement of time to biliary cannulation and complication rates will be recorded.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator group will be active group of patients undergoing ERCP but those that have been randomised to the prone position. 
Similar parameters as outlined in the "active/intervention" group will be assessed.</comparator>

      <outcome>The secondary objective is other complications including perioperative cardio-respiratory anaesthetic complications and other complications directly as the result of ERCP - this will be assessed by reviewing the vital signs recorded during the procedure, reviewing the patient's electronic medical records, and where apropriate - a phone call to the patient at 4 weeks post procedure</outcome>

Subjects are randomised to an initial position for performing the procedure. If the procedure is unsuccessful in that position, they will be repositioned to the other position, but they are not acting as control for themselves. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>If there is no significant difference between the standard and the experimental treatment groups, then 194 patients are required to be 90% sure that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) will exclude a difference in favour of the standard group of more than 10%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients having an ERCP may have the procedure lying on their left side or on their stomach. Currently, the position chosen is decided by the doctor performing the procedure. We do not know if one position is better than another. This project aims to assess whether the position a patient is in affects the ease and time taken to perform the procedure as well as any affect this may have on the rate of potential complications.</summary>
