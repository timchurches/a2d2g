  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a 10week diet-induced weight loss intervention. Participants receive weekly support from an Accredited Practising Dietitian. Face-to-face consults are for 30-60mins in weeks 0, 1,2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 with phone consults for 10mins on alternate weeks. Individual estimated energy requirements are reduced by 2000kj with the aim of weight loss.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the control group continue their usual lifestyle practices for a 10week period. After this control period, participants receive the exact diet induced weight loss intervention as described above.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity and asthma are two of the most common conditions affecting Australian children and adolescents. Epidemiological studies have indicated a link exists between obesity and asthma. Obesity is associated with chronic systemic inflammation. Given that asthma is characterised by chronic inflammation of the airways, we hypothesise that obesity is amplifying airway inflammation and impacting adversely on clinical asthma outcomes in children and adolescents.</summary>
