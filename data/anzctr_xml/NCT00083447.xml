    <summary>TransMID treatment or best standard of care for patients with advanced glioblastoma
      multiforme

      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a type of brain tumour. GBM tumours are usually treated with
      surgery and radiotherapy. Unfortunately, this type of brain tumour may continue to grow or
      come back (recur) despite treatment.

      This trial will compare a new drug called TransMID with the best standard treatment that is
      currently available. TransMID is a drug that is a combination of a protein called transferrin
      and a poison called diphtheria toxin.

      Cancer cells need iron in order to continue to grow. They need more iron than normal cells.
      Transferrin helps cells to take up available iron. So the cancer cells are attached to the
      transferrin in TransMID, and the diphtheria poison kills them. The aim of this treatment is
      to kill the cancer cells while not affecting the normal brain cells. This treatment for brain
      tumours may have fewer side effects than other treatments because it targets cancer cells.

      The best standard treatment will involve giving chemotherapy. You may have chemotherapy as
      part of the treatment when you are diagnosed. Or it may be kept in reserve to treat your
      brain tumour if it comes back or continues to grow. Your cancer specialist (consultant) will
      decide which chemotherapy drugs you should have.</summary>
