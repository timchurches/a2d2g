    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants in DAS 28 C-reactive Protein (CRP) Remission at Month 12 - Number of participants who achieved remission at Month 12 of treatment, as defined by a Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28-CRP score of &lt;2.6. DAS 28-CRP is a continuous measure, a composite of 4 variables: number of tender joints out of 28 joints, number of swollen joints out of 28 joints, CRP (in mg/L), and subject assessment of disease activity measure on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of 100 millimeters (mm). The DAS28 scale=0 (best) to 10 (worst), indicating the current activity of the rheumatoid arthritis. A DAS28 &gt;5.1 = high disease activity; &lt;=3.2 = low disease activity; &lt;2.6 = remission.</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Radiographic Total Score to Month 12 - To assess joint damage progression, the Genant-modified Sharp scoring method was used to evaluate radiographs of hands/wrists and feet for erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN).

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Response at Month 12 - Physical function was evaluated using the HAQ-disability index (HAQ-DI), a questionnaire with 20 questions assessing function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty; 1 = with some difficulty; 2 = with much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. The 8 category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction.

The scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life. Two summary scores (physical and mental component summaries) were produced taking a weighted linear combination of the 8 individual subscales. Change from Baseline=Post-baseline - Baseline value; adjusted for baseline value.</outcome>

The erosion score range is 0 (no radiographic damage) to 145 (worst possible radiographic damage). The joint space narrowing score range is 0 (no radiographic damage) to 145 (worst possible radiographic damage). Higher scores indicated more damage.

For the anti-abatacept assay, minimum required dilution is 400-fold, therefore seronegative samples are those &lt; lowest reportable titer (&lt;400). For the anti-CTLA4-T assay, minimum required dilution is 25-fold, therefore seronegative samples are those &lt; lowest reportable titer (&lt;25).</outcome>
