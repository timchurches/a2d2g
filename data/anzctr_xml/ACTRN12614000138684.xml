  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved physical health outcomes assessed by:

Mental state - ICD10 Diagnosis, symptom rating using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) and self-rating of anxiety and depression using the Kessler 10

Metabolic and endocrine monitoring - FBC, U&amp;E, Lipids, glucose, LFT, TFT, weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist/hip or hip/chest ratio

Cardiovascular - Baseline ECG, Sitting and Standing BP, Pulse

Respiratory - Cigarette smoking history (pack years), Peak flow and carbon monoxide level

Drug and alcohol assessment using the Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Tool (ASSIST)

Medications  type, dose, frequency.  Side effects will be measured using the Self rated UKU side effects rating scale.

Quality of life data will be collected using the World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQOL  BREF).

WA health data bases and patient medical records will be accessed gather demographic data, to confirm ICD 10 diagnoses and gather data related to medication and blood results. 

Standard Measures 
The Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) was developed in the United Kingdom to measure severity of symptoms for people with mental illness. The scale comprises 12 items covering a range of common problems often experienced by people with a mental illness. Each item is rated on a five-point scale (0 = no problem; 1 = minor problem; 2 =mild problem; 3 = moderately severe problem; 4 = very severe problem). The HoNOS data is collected routinely as part of the National Outcome and Case mix Collection  a national reporting requirement of all mental health services in Australia (Australian Mental Health Outcomes and Classification Network 2012)  

The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10): Measures both depression and anxiety across 10 items and has been utilised in the measurement of psychological distress in survey research and clinical settings (Andrews &amp; Slade, 2001). It has been found to have moderate to strong internal consistency (a=.93) and significantly associated to the CIDI (see Andrews &amp; Slade, 2001) with good specificity and sensitivity found between (.8 -.88) indicating good validity.

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is clinician rated scale in the public domain that measures psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations and unusual behaviour.  This test consists of 24 symptom constructs, each to be rated in a 7-point scale of severity ranging from 'not present' to 'extremely severe'.  The BPRS takes approximately 25-30 minutes to administer (Lukoff, Liberman, &amp; Nuechterlein, 1986). 

The self-rated UKU side effects rating scale (UKU SERS Pat) (Lindstrom et al., 2001) is a comprehensive side effect rating scale developed to be used in clinical drug trials and in routine clinical practice. It comprises ratings (0-4) of 48 single items, a global assessment of the influence of the reported side effects on daily performance, and a statement of the effects of the adverse events on continuation of the medication. The items are clustered into four sub-groups: Psychic, Neurological, Autonomic and Other side effects.  This scale takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.

The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST V3.0) consists of eight questions or items that can be answered by most patients in around ten minutes. The ASSIST (V3.0) is able to discriminate between substance use, abuse and dependence (Newcombe, Humeniuk, &amp; Ali, 2005) and is a valid screening test for identifying psychoactive substance use in individuals who use a number of substances (Humeniuk et al., 2008).  Eight questions cover tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, sedative, hallucinogen, opioid and other drug use, misuse and abuse.  This ASSIST is in the public domain and may be amended with due reference to the original documents. 

The World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQOL  BREF) (Skevington, Lotfy, O'Connell, &amp; Group, 2004) is a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100.  It produces scores for four domains related to quality of life: physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. It also includes one facet on overall quality of life and general health.
Medication effects
To enable comparisons of medications and doses, antipsychotic medication will be converted to chlorpromazine equivalents (CPZE).  The conversion of antipsychotic doses into CPZEs is generally accepted and widely practiced in schizophrenia research (Centorrino et al., 2002)  (Hargreaves, Zachary, LeGoullon, Binder, &amp; Reus, 1987)  (Humberstone, Wheeler, &amp; Lambert, 2004)  (Owen et al., 2002)  (Woods, 2003).  CPZE will be calculated using Table 3, (Andreasen, Pressler, Nopoulos, Miller, &amp; Ho, 2010).



Statistical analysis
Demographic data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and Chi Square analysis to examine between group differences.  

The following statistical analyses will be completed to address the hypotheses posed
1. Paired sample t-test will be used to compare baseline BMI  with BMI at12 months 

2. Paired sample t-test will be used to compare baseline smoke rates to rates at 12 months.

3. Paired sample t-test will be used to compare incidents of COPD, diabetes, nutritional disorders or hypertension during 12 month study period with the 12 months prior. 

4. Between group differences in BMI, Smoking levels and incidence of COPD, diabetes, nutritional disorders or hypertension will be analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with participant group as the dependent variable.

5. Between group differences in mental health outcomes as measured by BPRS and HoNOS scores will be analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with participant group as the dependent variable.

6. All antipsychotic medications will be converted to CPZE and compared according to medication type.  Medication group differences in CPZE will be compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with medication type as the dependent variable.  All other medications will be analysed according to daily doses and compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with participant group as the dependent variable.

7. Between group differences in quality of life as measured by WHOQOL-BREF scores will be analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with participant group as the dependent variable.

In all statistical analyses p &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

Calculation of sample size
Using local data reported in (Stanley, Laugharne, Addis, &amp; Sherwood, 2013) where the BMI in patients with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder (M=28.32, SD 6.84) was compared with a group of patients with mild mental illness (M= 26.79, SD 5.3) the sample size estimate for testing differences between two means, was calculated according to Cohens calculation where sample estimate is the  difference between two population means divided by  the population standard deviation (Cohen, 1988).  Thus the effect size d = 28.32  26.79 / 6.07 = 0.252.  Using Cohens table (1988, p55)  it was estimated for an effect size of 0.3 at a significance level 0.05 and a power of 0.80 that approximately 175 participants would be needed in each group.
