    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Following admission to the unit where the study is undertaken, the patient's medical record is screened to determine appropriateness. Patient's are assessed by the study nurse as to whether they meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusioncriteria. If so they are invited to participate in the study. If patient consents to inclusion they are then randomised by person not involved in study
A large opaque envelop contains 100 slips of paper: 50 marked "circuit", 50 marked "usual". As each subject is enrolled a slip of paper is drawn out to determine allocation. The slip of paper is not replaced in the envelop.</concealment>
    <sequence>simple randomisation - consecutive subjects were randomised using a simple  sequence.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physiotherapy improves a persons balance and mobility. This project will compare the traditional one-on-one model of physiotherapy with a workstations training model. With workstations, patients complete specifically designed activities at a number of stations. Each station will address a specific aspect such as strength, flexibility or balance. Workstations have been shown to be effective with chronic stroke patients, fallers and adults with cerebral palsy however to date there is no published research evaluating such an approach with hospital inpatients. This study will address the 2 questions:
- Does a physiotherapy workstations training program result in improved balance and mobility in a post acute inpatient group
- Is a physiotherapy workstations training program as effective as one on one physiotherapy intervention in improving balance and mobility in a post acute inpatient group?</summary>
