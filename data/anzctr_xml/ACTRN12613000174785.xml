  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) The intervention in this study is a decision aid booklet. This can be read by participants alone and unaided but may be read in the presence of others if wished.
b) Each participant that receives a decision aid booklet will read it once. They will then undergo a telephone survey one week later. They may then either keep or discard the booklet. They may reread it as often as they wish.
c) Every participant will be surveyed twice. The first and second telephone surveys will be conducted one week apart. No other contact will be made with participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator: usual care.

a) Usual care will involve uninterupted ongoing medical care by participants' general practitioner or specialists. All participants in the control group upon completion of the study will be provided with a decision aid booklet. 

b) The participants will receive usual care for one week i.e. the time period between the first and second telephone interviews. No contact will be made by the researchers outside of this time period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decisional conflict - 

This will be measured using the low-literacy decision conflict scale [O'Connor 1993]. This will form part of both telephone interviews.

OConnor AM. Low literacy decisional conflict scale. Ottawa: OHRI, 1993 (updated 2010). Available from https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/eval_dcs.html.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One week after the first telephone interview, the second telephone interview will be conducted. The participants in the intervention group will receive a copy of the decision aid booklet within 2-3 days of the first telephone interview. Thus allowing them 4-5 days to read the booklet before the second interview.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knowledge - 

This will be measured using a brief knowledge questionnaire adapted from the Ottawa knowledge questionnaire template [O'Connor 1999]. This will form part of both telephone interviews.

The participants in the intervention group will receive a copy of the decision aid booklet within 2-3 days of the first telephone interview. Thus allowing them 4-5 days to read the booklet before the second interview.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decision - 

This will be determined by asking participants what their decision is regarding driving retirement. They will be asked if they will to continue driving unchanged, drive less, stop driving now, stop driving later or other. This will form part of both telephone interviews.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One week after the first telephone interview, the second telephone interview will be conducted. The participants in the intervention group will receive a copy of the decision aid booklet within 2-3 days of the first telephone interview. Thus allowing them 4-5 days to read the booklet before the second interview.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Booklet acceptability - 

This will be measured using an acceptability questionnaire adapted from the Ottawa acceptability questionnaire template [O'Connor 2000]. This will form part of the last telephone interview.

OConnor AM, Cranney A. Ottawa acceptability questionnaire. Ottawa: OHRI, 2000. Available from http://decisionaid.ohri.ca/eval_accept.html.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One week after the first telephone interview, the second telephone interview will be conducted. The participants in the intervention group will receive a copy of the decision aid booklet within 2-3 days of the first telephone interview. Thus allowing them 4-5 days to read the booklet before the second interview.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Booklet use - 

Booklet use will be examined by establishing the length of time required to read the booklet and whether assistance was required by the reader to use it. This will form part of the last telephone interview.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One week after the first telephone interview, the second telephone interview will be conducted. The participants in the intervention group will receive a copy of the decision aid booklet within 2-3 days of the first telephone interview. Thus allowing them 4-5 days to read the booklet before the second interview.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decisional satisfaction - 

Satisfaction with decision will be measured with the validated satisfaction with decision scale [Holmes-Rovner 1996]. This will form part of the first and second interview.

      <timepoint>One week after the first telephone interview, the second telephone interview will be conducted. The participants in the intervention group will receive a copy of the decision aid booklet within 2-3 days of the first telephone interview.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be invited to become involved via a newsletter advertisement. If they express interest they will be forwarded a participant information sheet and consent form. Upon receipt of written consent, a research assistant will assign each participant with a code. 
Each coded participant will be randomly allocated either to receive a decision aid booklet or not. Half of all participants will receive the booklet. Half will not and will serve as the control - they will receive usual care. 
Concealed opaque envelopes will be used to ensure that allocation is blinded from the research assistant. As each participant is coded at the point of allocation then selection bias will not occur. 
The decision aid booklets will then be mailed to half of all participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>All participants will first be coded. Then a random number generator (www.random.org) will be used to randomly allocate coded participants into either (i) intervention group - i.e. receive the booklet, or (ii) control group - i.e. no booklet but will receive usual care.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to determine if the use of a decision aid by drivers with dementia results in improved decisional uncertainty/conflict. It will also involve establishing if the decision aid booklet improves participant knowlege and decisional satisfaction. Booklet use, acceptability and impact upon decision will also be evaluated.</summary>
