  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will recruit 2000 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of Christchurch Hospital with the primary complaint of breathlessness.

Blood samples will be taken at presentation in the ED, at 24 hours and at discharge to test the diagnostic performance of Ghrelin signal peptide (GHRsp) and Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin signal peptide (NGALsp) against and alongside N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) and procalcitonin (PCT) for the diagnosis of pneumonia, HF and concurrent pneumonia and HF. 

Patients will be followed up at 30 and 90 days and 1 year to allow for assessment of prognostic power of GHRsp and NGALsp to predict subsequent events.All diagnoses will undergo standardised adjudication by two clinicians blinded to marker results.

    <statisticalmethods>Based on current enrolment data (n=500), we anticipate that of the 1200, approximately 13% (~160) will have pneumonia and ~2.5% (~30) will have concurrent ADHF and pneumonia. On the basis of our data a sample size of 30 for the combination diagnosis group (the smallest of the groups) will provide sufficient power (&gt;90%) to detect ROC AUCs &gt;0.75 as statistically significant (two-tailed alpha=0.05). The test performance of each marker to diagnose pneumonia, ADHF and co-existing pneumonia/ADHF will be assessed by AUCs of the ROC curves and calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and overall accuracy for specific cut-points. The prognostic utility of markers for all-cause mortality, readmission with HF, pneumonia or other infection, all cardiovascular and infectious events  and all readmissions at 30, 90 and 365 days will be examined using Kaplan-Meier curves with groups defined by ROC curve- derived optimal cut-points and with multivariate analysis using Cox Proportional hazards regressions using a base model incorporating standard clinical predictors of outcome with rotation of single and multiple candidate markers through the model to test for independent predictors of these outcomes. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a pressing need for additional tools to help differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in acutely short of breath patients, and to improve our ability to provide accurate prognostic information and sound therapeutic management to heart failure patients. Where ADHF is the primary cause of dyspnoea, plasma BNP is a proven diagnostic adjunct. However, where pneumonia and ADHF co-exist, lack of specific pneumonic findings can delay appropriate introduction of antibiotic therapy. Misdiagnosis or delay in the introduction of appropriate therapy leads to significant morbidity and mortality from respiratory/circulatory failure and septicaemia. There is a need for biomarkers that can; 1) assist in the rapid diagnosis of pneumonia in ADHF, 2) assist in the prediction of who may be at risk of serious pneumonia-related complications and 3) aid the decision to administer antibiotic therapy where there is suspicion of pneumonia present in ADHF.
The SIGNIFICANT-HF Study is an initiative to assess a new and unique biological markers in an acute shortness of breath population. 1200 people presenting to the Christchurch Hospital  Emergency Department with non-traumatic shortness of breath will be invited to participate. 3 additional blood samples will be collected during admission for analysis of the levels of these newly identified heart hormones.
