  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             significantly outside the reference range for the population being studied may be
             included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures. Subjects with lymphocyte counts outside the normal range should always be
             excluded from enrollment.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MIU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the protocol-approved contraception methods.
             This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication
             until the study follow up visit.

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GSK2018682 is a potent and selective agonist for the sphingosine-1- phosphate receptor
      subtype 1 (S1P1) with the potential to be an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS).
      The immunomodulatory properties of GSK2018682 are related to functional antagonism of S1P1 on
      lymphocytes, resulting in sequestration of lymphocytes within the lymphoid organs, rendering
      them incapable of migrating to sites of inflammation and leading to lymphopenia. Orally
      administered GSK2018682 is very effective in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
      (EAE), an animal model of human MS. This study will assess the relative bioavailability of
      different oral formulations of GSK2018682 in healthy volunteers. A tablet formulation is
      desired for progression into future clinical safety and efficacy studies as the current
      capsule formulation is not suited to large scale manufacture. The information obtained in
      this study will help to establish the optimal dosing form for future studies, and also
      determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of GSK2018682.</summary>
