    <interventions>The primary objective of the research is to evaluate the effects of Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a brief (two sessions) pre-treatment intervention, to enhance treatment engagement in an IPV treatment for men who have been identified as high risk of IPV behaviour. 
The research will comprise three main phases: an evaluation of the current approach (control group), a training study in which staff at Aviva (hosting organization) will be trained in MI (by members of Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers) in preparation for the third phase of the study which is an evaluation of MI for engagement. 
Phase 1: Control group
     Participants: The study will comprise men who have referred to Aviva for IPV Treatment as there is a concern of potential serious family violence harm. 
      Procedure: The current standard engagement procedure, Reach Out program -- explained below-- will be conducted by staff at Aviva. Recruiting will occur for 4 months.
     Measure: The mean number of IPV treatment sessions attended is the primary outcome measures. The number of sessions attended will be recorded and reported by staff at Aviva.
Phase 2:  Training Study 
     Participants: Staff at Aviva who provides the initial contact with men referred via the ISR pilot for IPV treatment.
     Procedure: Aviva staff will be trained in MI by members of the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT). The training sessions would be 2x weekly group workshops lasting the whole day for each session (9-4pm). Aviva staff will also be provided with feedback and coaching on their MI skills. A focus group with Aviva staff will be conducted to explore their experiences of MI after they have been trained in MI and had the opportunity to utilise it with clients.  Thematic analysis will be used to analyse the focus group data. For the phase 3 of the study, MI will be provided by Aviva staff as part of the standard intake procedure.
Phase 3: Evaluation of MI for Engagement 
       Participants: Men who have been referred to Aviva via the ISR pilot for IPV treatment. Same as in Phase 1.
       Procedure: Men referred to for IPV treatment at Aviva, will receive two MI for engagement sessions before initiating the standard IPV treatment sessions. The duration of each MI session is between 20-40 minute. The MI intervention is based on the premise that motivation for treatment includes, but is not limited to, the motivation for change. Explicit attention will be paid to participants hopes, as well as practical and psychological barriers (cost, access to the treatment, time, low energy, anxiety), negative perception of treatment and past experiences (it doesn't work), cultural attitudes (stigma), and negative relationship experiences (intrusive, manipulative). The key processes of MI comprise engaging the participant in a mutually respectful relationship, focusing on an agenda in a collaborative manner, evoking the participants intrinsic motivation for attending treatment, and if ready, developing a plan for attending treatment. Consistent with respect for each perpetrators autonomy, participants will be asked permission before providing information (e.g. regarding the content and logistics of the IPV treatment), and then will be asked their point of view regarding the information provided. Acceptance, compassion, partnership, and evocation will be emphasized throughout all sessions and will shape the foundation for what has been described as the spirit of MI. The MI session will conclude with summarizing the male perpetrators perspective, and if appropriate, eliciting commitment to treatment.
     The IPV treatment approach at Aviva is called Reach Out program. Reach Out is an early intervention service for men wanting support to move away from a life of relationship conflict, anger, and violence. This treatment is an individual one-on-one session. The sessions are usually once every week. However, it depends on the needs of the client. After the client has shown the ability to do more self-management and has some good tools in place, the sessions will be tapered off to once 2-3 weeks. Each session is usually 1 hour in duration. It also could be more depending on the level of support needed vs current events in life/relationship. 
     The purpose of the sessions is to learn what is going on for the client, what is working for them, what they want to work on and to help them recognize what is safe and unsafe in the relationship they have, and to support them to move in the direction they identify they want to take. Also, to help them develop skills/mastery in their lives to build confidence, self-esteem and positive connections which support and enable them to make the changes they want/need. Another purpose is to help them to recognize types of abuse. Because most of the time they don't realize that abuse can come in many different forms, not just physical/sexual/verbal. 
Recruiting at this phase will also occur for 4 months. 
     Measures: Whether IPV treatment was initiated, and the mean number of IPV treatment sessions attended are the primary outcome measures. The number of sessions attended will be recorded and reported by staff at Aviva. Secondary measures (parts 1 and 3) include: self-ratings: on the Change Questionnaire, in which participants in the control and MI groups will be asked to rate the importance, commitment, and ability to change their violent behaviour  on a scale of 0-10 (0=definitely not,10=definitely); and the Readiness Ruler determines the participants readiness to change on a scale of 0 to 10 in which the lower numbers indicate less readiness, and the higher numbers indicate greater readiness for change.
