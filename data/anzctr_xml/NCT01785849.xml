  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Etelcalcetide
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Etelcalcetide - Participants received etelcalcetide administered by intravenous bolus injection at the end of each hemodialysis session three times a week, for 26 weeks.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants received placebo administered by intravenous bolus injection at the end of each hemodialysis session, three times per week (TIW) for 26 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Etelcalcetide
Administered intravenously three times per week. The starting dose was 5 mg. The dose may have been increased at 4-week intervals by 2.5 mg or 5 mg on the basis of the predialysis parathyroid hormone and corrected calcium concentrations obtained in the prior week. The minimum dose was 2.5 mg and the maximum dose was 15 mg.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Administered intravenously (IV) three times per week.
