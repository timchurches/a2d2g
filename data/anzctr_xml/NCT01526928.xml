  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rociletinib is a novel, potent, small molecule irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
      that selectively targets mutant forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while
      sparing wild-type (WT) EGFR. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      and safety profile of oral rociletinib; to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral rociletinib; to assess the safety and efficacy of
      rociletinib in previously treated NSCLC patients known to have the T790M EGFR mutation.</summary>
