Active Comparator: Apremilast - Subjects initially randomized to apremilast 30 mg twice a day, and who demonstrate a PASI 75 response at Week 32 will be randomized (1 to 1) to either continue to receive apremilast 30 mg ) BID or to receive placebo (until effect is lost). At the time effect is lost, subjects will be treated with apremilast 30 mg twice a day for the duration of their participation in the study.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Subjects initially randomized to placebo, are assigned to apremilast 30 mg twice a day beginning at Week 16 for the duration of the subject's participation in the study.

Active Comparator: Apremilast 30 mg - Apremilast 30 mg by mouth (PO) twice a day (BID). Participants initially randomized to apremilast 30 mg BID, and who were able to demonstrate a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) -75 response at week 32 were randomized (1 to 1) to either apremilast 30 mg BID or oral placebo (until effect is lost). At relapse/loss of response to therapy prior to Week 52 (the time at which 75% improvement in PASI score compared to baseline was lost) or at Week 52, participants were re-treated with apremilast 30 mg BID for the duration of their participation in the study. Non-responders or partial responders (PASI response &lt;75) received additional topical therapies or phototherapy beginning at Week 32.


Treatment: drugs: Apremilast


Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Identical matching placebo

Treatment: drugs: Topical treatments or phototherapy
At week 32, participants considered partial responders or non-responders had the option of adding topical therapies and/or phototherapy to their treatment regimen.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Improvement (Response) in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI-75) at Week 16 From Baseline - PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least 2 Points Reduction From Baseline - The sPGA was a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall severity, the Investigator factored in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and did not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign was averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions. In the event of different severities across disease signs, the sign that is the predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Percent of Affected Body Surface Area (BSA) at Week 16 - BSA was a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis was estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand (entire palmar surface or "handprint" including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area.
BSA percent change from baseline (Visit 2 Week 0) was determined at each visit of the study, which is calculated as 100*(visit BSA - baseline BSA) / baseline BSA (%).</outcome>

      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16 - Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score. The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.
PASI score percent change from baseline was calculated as 100* (visit score - baseline score)/baseline score (%).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 50% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score (PASI-50) at Week 16 From Baseline - A participant was classified as having at least a 50% improvement in PASI score from baseline, which was equivalent to a percent change from baseline ranging from -100% to -50%. PASI score is based on an assessment of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling), and the percent area affected as observed on the day of examination.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Week 16 - The Pruritus Visual Analog Scores (VAS) were used to measure the amount of itching and discomfort a participant experiences. Participant's Assessment of Pruritus (Itch) asked: On average, how much itch have you had because of your condition in the past week? All VAS values range from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to more severe symptom or disease. Change from baseline was calculated for the VAS scale, where change = visit value - baseline value.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16 - DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from "Very Much" (score 3) to "Not at All" or "Not relevant" (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if "No," then the participant is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being "A lot," "A little," or "Not at all" (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Mental Component Summary (MSC) Score of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-item (SF-36) Health Survey Version 2.0 at Week 16 - The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations-physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained - a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS).
Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value - baseline value.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Both a 75% Improvement (Response) in the PASI and sPGA Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least 2 Points Reduction From Baseline at Week 16 From Baseline - PASI-75 response was the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. See Outcome Measure #1 for further description.
sPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. See OCM #2 for further description.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) in the Placebo Controlled Phase - An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Psoriasis Flare or Rebound During the Placebo Controlled Phase - Psoriasis flare was defined as a sudden intensification of psoriasis requiring medical intervention, or a diagnosis of new generalized erythrodermic, inflammatory, or pustular psoriasis. Rebound is defined as a severe and sudden worsening of disease that occurs after treatment has been discontinued. Note categories below. [1] Psoriasis adverse events (ie, preferred term as Guttate psoriasis, Psoriasis, Pustular psoriasis) started on or after the first dose date and on or before the last dose date within the phase. [2] Psoriasis adverse events (ie, preferred term as Guttate psoriasis, Psoriasis, Pustular psoriasis, Rebound psoriasis) started after the last dose date for participants who discontinued within the phase. [3] PASI &gt;= 125% of baseline score at any visit after the last dose date for participants who discontinued within the phase and were not included in [1] and/or [2].</outcome>

    <summary>This study evaluated the effects of an called apremilast. Apremilast works by lowering some
      of the chemicals that affect psoriasis and therefore improves the symptoms of psoriasis. The
      purpose of this study was to test apremilast and compare its effects to placebo (an inactive
      substance which contains no medicine but is in the same form as the drug). This study was
      able to test for efficacy (improvement of signs and symptoms) and safety of apremilast in
      patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.</summary>
