    <interventions>The carpometacarpal (CMC) and metacarpophalangeal (MP) immobilization orthosis was one short thumb immobilization orthosis that did not cover the thumb interphalangeal and wrist joints, and the orthosis was custom-molded by an occupational therapist with more than 6 years of experience. Participants wore the orthosis with their right hands for the duration of the testing procedure, approximately 30 minutes. 

The grasp distance was the distance between the handle and the main shaft of the dynamometer. We designated the first, second, and third handle positions on the dynamometer as the grasp distances: Distance 1 (D1) was 42.25 mm, Distance 2 (D2) was 54.64 mm, and Distance 3 (D3) was 68.90 mm.

This study required only a single test session for each participant. Each participant performed three trials per condition for a total of 21 trials (maximal grip × 3 trials and 3 distances × 2 orthoses × 3 trials). The level of orthose factor was two: with or without orthosis.  The order of the (distance × orthoses) conditions was randomly assigned. Rest periods of 1 minute were given between each trial, and periods of 5 minutes, between each condition. The participants could prolong the resting time if tired. 

Grip Strength Measurement. Participants sat on a chair, and the seat height was adjusted so that their feet were flat on the floor with their knees and hips flexed at about 90 degrees. They then placed their right forearm on the table with the shoulder in adduction, the elbow at 60 degrees to 90 degrees flexion, the forearm in neutral position between pronation and supination, the wrist in neutral position between the ulnar and radial deviation, and the wrist at 10 degrees to 20 degrees extension,
and they concurrently grasped a Baseline digital hand dynamometer (Model 12-0112; Fabrication Enterprises, White Plains, NY). The values displayed by the dynamometer
were recorded. This participant positioning was adopted from Mathiowetz et al. (1985); however, the dynamometer was reversed to allow participants to see the readings. The forearm was placed on the table to help support the weight of the dynamometer.</interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>The inclusion criteria for RA patients were (1) diagnosis of RA according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology revised criteria (Arnett et al., 1988); (2) stable disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy within the preceding 6 months; (3) aged 20-80 years; (4) right-hand dominant; and (5) prescription of an immobilization orthosis by a doctor.

The inclusion criteria for non-RA patients were (1) aged 20-80 years; (2) right-hand dominant; (3) no history of right upper-extremity injury; and (4) normal functional performance of right upper-extremity. </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>2x2 mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the maximal grip strength data and nEMG% data of each muscle for the group(2) x orthosis(2) experimental design. 2x3 repeated measure ANOVA was used to analyze the nEMG % data of each muscle for the orthosis(2) and grasp distance(3) experimental design. A least significant difference test was used as a follow-up test for pair-wise comparison of means. Significance was noted for a probability of a false positive of less than 5% (p &lt; .05).

The clinical assumption of this study is patients with RA require more muscle loading to produce the same grip strength as healthy adults.

The statistical assumption is supported by the research of Hakkinen, Hakkinen, and Hakkinen (1995). In thier research, the mean grip strength of patients with RA were 58+/-17kg.  The mean grip strength of healthy adults were 79+/-20kg. 

We used G-Power 3.1.5 software to calculatte the sample size of our study. By the ANOVA: Repeated measures, between factors method, A priori test was performed. The effect size (f=0.5657111, tyep I error alpha =0.05, Power=0.8) were calculated by inputing the data of Hakkinen, Hakkinen, and Hakkinen (1995). The sample size advised by G-power  software was 22 participants iin each groups. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aimed to determine whether individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) require greater muscle loads to produce the same grip strength as healthy adults, and to find the optimal grip distance for RA in the carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal immobilized orthoses using electromyography (EMG) of forearm muscles. A 2x2 (group x orthosis) and a 2 x 3 (orthosis x grasp distance) factorial experiment was used. Grip strength and EMG were measured.
