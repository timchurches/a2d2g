  <interventions>
    <interventions>In patients who have taken bowel preparation solution for an endoscopy examination (colonoscopy +/- gastroscopy) their intravascular fluid status will be assessed using echocardiography views before and after passive leg raise testing.  The volume assessment will take approximately 20minutes and occur immediately prior to the endoscopy procedure start. This aims to determine if patients are intravascularly deplete prior to endoscopy examination.  

All assessments will be completed on the day of the procedure. </interventions>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of hypotension (Systolic BP less than 90mmHg or 25% decrease from baseline) during endoscopy in patients who are intravascularly deplete (positive primary outcome) compared to those that have normal intravascular volume status. Blood pressure will be measured by automatic sphygnomanometer on a 2.5 minutely cycle.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>TTE performed immediately prior to endoscopy examination and blood pressure measured throughout the endoscopy procedure at 2.5 minute intervals. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>As this is the first assessment of the intravascular fluid status of patients following bowel preparation by TTE and a non-invasive cardiac output device reliable sample size calculation isnt possible.  However, a study addressing a similar question (effect of fasting on volume status) and utilizing the same primary end point was conducted in 100 patients. 
 100 patients should allow for meaningful assessment of the cohort under study even with incomplete data collection that is an anticipated problem due to the patient dependent nature of TTE measurements.  

The change in the measured haemodynamic variables from baseline to after passive leg raising will be reported with their 95% confidence intervals. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is important in defining the baseline physiological state of patients presenting for outpatient endoscopy.  It has been observed that intravenous fluids do not prevent hypotension in patients who are undergoing endoscopy.  One possible explanation for this is that patients are not intravascularly deplete after bowel preparation solution. This study will determine what the rate of intravascular depletion in patients undergoing endoscopy after bowel preparation solution is.   </summary>
