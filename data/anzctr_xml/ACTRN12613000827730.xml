  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a novel emulsion developed at the University of Otago School of Pharmacy and Sir John Walsh Research Institute which consists of rice bran oil, soy lecithin, propylene glycol and water. 
 The saliva substitute will be delivered in a metered dose spray bottle. The participant will be asked to use the product at least 4 times per day but more if they wish for one week. They will be asked how often they use the product and how many sprays were required each time. The contents of the return bottle at the end of one week will be measured.
Participants will be asked to use either an active treatment or placebo in a randomised order for one week. There will be a one week wash out period followed by one week use of the alternative product.</interventions>
    <comparator>The test product will be compared against 2 products
1) An active control of carboxymethylcellulose saliva substitute, which is currently the only publicly funded saliva substitute available in New Zealand
2) A placebo of water with a flavour added.

Each product will be delivered in a metered dose spray bottle. The participant will be asked to use the product at least 4 times per day but more if they wish for one week. They will be asked how often they use the product and how many sprays were required each time. The contents of the return bottle at the end of one week will be measured.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>It is a requirement that participants have received radiation therapy to the head and neck region within the last 10 years at Christchurch Hospital. 
Participants will be asked a global question regarding xerostomia. "How often does your mouth feel dry?"
Responses are: Never, Occasionally, Frequently, Always.
Participants who respnd Frequently and Always will be considered to have xerostomia and will be included in the trial.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be given the opportunity to participate when they attend routine appointments with their usual oral health care provider (not the primary investigator). They will be provided with information on what the trial involved and have the opportunity to ask questions. They will then sign a consent form.
The participants will be allocated to one of 2 crossover groups by way of random numbers generated by computer. Odd number will be allocated to group one - trial of the new emulsion against a placebo of water
Even number will be allocated to group 2 - trial of carboxymethylcellulose against a placebo of water.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Each participant will then have the order that they receive either the intervention or the placebo randomised by way of random number generation by computer. 
A research assistant will put together a randomisation table which will be given to the pharmacist making up the test products. Each bottle will look identical but will be given a unique number  on the label according to the randomisation table which ensures the primary investigator does not see which product each participant is using.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A power calculation was carried out using data from a previous study involving participants with Parkinsons disease using TOMASS as an outcome measure. This calculation indicated a sample size of 34 was required, therefore for this trial a sample size of 40 was chosen to allow for drop-out.
For the outcome measures of the xerostomia inventory and the visual analogue scale a multiple linear regression model will be used to assess the difference in each group, adjusting for a difference in sequence of the products.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Healthy saliva cleanses and lubricates the mouth, it protects the teeth by reducing bacteria and neutralising acid, and plays a crucial role in tasting, chewing and swallowing of food. A well documented side-effect of radiotherapy for treatment of cancer of the head and neck is a dry mouth due to damage of the surrounding salivary glands (Wijers et al 2002). Such a decrease in saliva flow following radiotherapy results in significant compromise of quality of life and has been shown to lead to an increase in tooth decay and infections in the mouth and cause difficulty with eating and swallowing.
Researchers at the Sir John Walsh Research Institute and the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Otago have recently developed a novel oily formulation for the treatment of dry mouth, to act as a saliva substitute. The aim of this randomised, double blinded, within-subject study is to trial the new formulation as a saliva substitute on measures of mastication, subjective feeling of oral dryness and product acceptibility, and compare outcomes to a currently available saliva substitute and a control of water. Forty participants who have been treated with radiotherapy to the head and neck region will be selected to participate in the trial. Participants will be randomised to receive mouth spray presentations of either an existing saliva substitute or the new formulation; both will use water as a control condition. The researchers and the participants will be blind as to the contents of each spray bottle which will be prepared and labelled in the pharmacy and distributed by a dental assistant.
The differences in each product will be measured using three tests. The first is a simple behavioural  test of chewing and swallowing, the second is a questionnaire designed to test the subjective feeling of dry mouth and the third is a questionnairre designed to test the patient acceptibility of each product. Outcome data will be gathered in a single session after the first administration of both the products and placebos to evaluate immediate effects, and after 7 days of use to evaluate longer-term effects. Order of the 7 day use of test product or placebo will be randomised.
The results of this trial will be used in further development of the new saliva substitute, which potentially could influence quality of life and swallowing safety in patients after radiotherapy treatment
