  <interventions>
    <interventions>Those in Intervention group will be assessed for alcohol use using the Audit-C and receive the Brief intervention using the 5As model from the nurses practitioner. The 10 minute intervention will be conducted as a part of the routine 30 minute appointment. The BI will comprise of Assessing people for their alcohol use, readiness to quit/reduce and level of alcohol dependence; Advising how they may stop drinking and the provision of evidence based written information; Agreeing on a realistic set of goals with the patient; Assisting with a plan to stop drinking and Arranging follow up with a specialist Alcohol and Drug service.

The questionnaires for the intervention and control groups include Audit C, which assesses people for risky alcohol use
Timeline Followback_Alcohol measures how much alcohol a person drinks over a 30 day period and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life (Brief) questionnaire. Demographics will also be collected.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive routine care i.e., they may be asked if they drink alcohol and are advised to stop; receive no formalised alcohol assessment or intervention and be seen by clinicians in the clinic as usual . 

The outcome measures for the intervention and control groups include Audit C, which measures alcohol use.

    <statisticalmethods>Data Analysis: Spss will be used to analyse the data.
Categorical data will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Fishers exact test and logistic regression will be used to compare differences between groups. Continuous data will be expressed as the difference between 8 weeks and baseline, and will be described by means and standard deviations.  ANOVA and t-tests will be used to analyse the relationships between two or more groups. 
Sample Size:  The main outcome variable is change in reported alcohol consumption in a 30 day period and will be measured using the Alcohol Timeline Followback survey. A 50% reduction of alcohol intake over a 30 day period would be seen as a clinically meaningful reduction.  It is expected giving participants the Alcohol Timeline Followback Survey will measure a result of 5% of the control group having clinically meaningful alcohol reduction. Sample size calculations were made with a power and sample size program (PS) using a Fisherss exact test, assuming that 5% of the control group and 25% of the intervention group will show a clinical alcohol reduction. The sample size required to detect this difference using a two sided significance level of 0.05 and 80% power is 118. Allowing for a 10% drop out rate, the required sample size for this study will be approximately 132 people (66 in the control group, and 66 in the intervention group), Assessment and and Brief Intervention.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol consumption is a foremost determinant for the prognosis of people with chronic viral hepatitis.  There are vital benefits in providing assessment and brief intervention for reducing alcohol consumption and associated harms in people attending primary care settings. This randomised controlled trial aims to identify the effectiveness of an evidence based assessment and brief intervention in reducing or stopping harmful alcohol consumption in people with chronic viral hepatitis.  Participants will be randomly allocated to three groups: Group1. (assessment and brochure),  Group2. (assessment and brief intervention) or Group3. (routine care with no formalised intervention). </summary>
