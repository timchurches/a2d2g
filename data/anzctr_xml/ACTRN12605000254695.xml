  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To investigate whether low-dose lithium is an effective agent in indicated prevention amongst subjects at ultra-high risk of developing a psychotic disorder. This aim will be achieved by treating a high-risk patient population with low-dose lithium (450mg/day) and investigating its effects using clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging and cell biological approaches.
We will recruit 30 patients considered to be at ultra-high risk of developing a first psychotic episode, currently receiving treatment at the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) clinic in Melbourne, Australia. PACE criteria for identifying patients at high risk include subjects with a family history of psychosis and a decrease in functioning (30% GAF) AND/OR attenuated psychotic symptoms AND/OR brief psychotic symptoms (BLIPS) resolving without treatment. Patients who give informed consent will receive treatment with a slow release form of low dose lithium for a period of a year, plus supportive therapy. Patients who do not consent will receive supportive therapy only. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, twelve weeks and one year post-recruitment. Assessments will include cognitive functioning, structural MRI, 1H-MRS at 3Tesla and cell biological parameters (bcl-2, AP-1; NIMH, Washington DC). In addition, all patients will be seen on a monthly basis for a clinical interview, covering psychopathology, global functioning, and quality of life.</summary>
