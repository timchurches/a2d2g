  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Valproate

Experimental: ICV Valproate - Patients receive a daily dose of ICV Valproate that increases from 3 mg to 60 mg (or MTD) over 8 weeks. A placebo week is randomly inserted in the dose escalation. During the placebo week, the patient receives normal saline.


Treatment: drugs: Valproate
ICV Valproate is a dilution of the commercially available Epilim product, which is a sterile intravenous (IV) formulation of Sodium Valproate.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) - The ICV Valproate dose will be escalated stepwise through Day 64, if tolerated, or stopped earlier upon establishment of a subject's MTD. The MTD for each subject will be determined based on the highest dose tolerated without experiencing a dose-limiting AE.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 months</timepoint>

             brain weight or significant volume loss etc. and is approved to have surgery.

          3. Subject had onset of epilepsy after age 5, had normal brain development up to age 5,
             and has full scale IQ &gt; 70 by testing or functional assessment.

          4. Subject has brain volume which is not noted to be abnormally small due to atrophy by
             either the radiologist reading on MRI scan or the treating clinicians (the
             neurosurgeon) review of the MRI scan.

          5. Subject has had confirmed epilepsy for a minimum of 1 year, with diagnosis of focal
             seizures with temporal lobe onset, with or without secondarily generalized seizures,
             as defined by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification of
             Epileptic Seizures (1981).

          6. In the opinion of the investigator, subject has disabling seizures. Disabling refers
             to seizures that are severe enough to cause injuries, or significantly impair
             functional ability in domains including employment, psychosocial education and
             mobility.

          7. Subject has had a CT or MRI of the brain to rule out progressive structural lesions.

          8. Subject has had an EEG or video EEG or invasive monitoring within the past 3 yrs
             consistent with partial seizures (a normal interictal EEG is consistent with partial
             seizures)

          9. Subject has previously failed at least 3 AEDs in single or combination use.

         10. Subject is taking currently approved AED medication(s) (but is not on valproate or

             Screening.

         11. Subject has completed all investigations necessary to satisfy the PI that noninvasive
             therapies are not likely to be satisfactorily successful.

         12. For the 3 months before informed consent an average of four or more clinically
             significant focal seizures of temporal lobe onset, with or without secondary
             generalization, per month. Only seizures with objectively visible manifestations
             should be counted. The subject should have no period longer than 30 days in the 3
             months prior to enrollment with less than 2 seizures. Seizures of hippocampal origin
             are preferred if the seizure origin is known or determined from imaging and seizure
             localization.

         13. Subject has seizures that are distinct, stereotypical events that can be reliably
             counted, in the opinion of the Investigator, by the subject or caregiver.

             with or without corrective aids, including keeping a seizure and medication diary
             during study follow-up.

         15. Subject understands study procedures and has voluntarily provided signed, informed
             consent in accordance with institutional and local regulatory requirements.

             assistance of a competent individual.

         19. Women of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted method of
             contraception and have a negative qualitative ß-human chorionic growth hormone (ß-HCG)
             pregnancy test result from a urine or blood sample collected at Screening.

        Non-childbearing potential is defined as any female who is post menopausal since the last 1
        year or has had hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or is surgically sterilized.

        Medically accepted forms of birth control include:

          1. Intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months

          2. Adequate barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm and foam), or an oral contraceptive in
             combination with another method (e.g., spermicidal cream). An oral contraceptive alone
             is not considered adequate for this study.

        If on hepatic inducing AEDs which could lower serum hormone levels (phenytoin,
        phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, zonisamide, rufinamide,

    <summary>Patients with medically refractory epilepsy will be treated by intracerebroventricular (ICV)
      delivery of valproate using an implantable drug pump system. The dose of valproate will be
      escalated weekly during a blinded-evaluation period through Day 64 to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). After Day 64, patients can continue for 52 weeks in the open-label
      evaluation period (non-blinded).</summary>
