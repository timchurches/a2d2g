  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients will be included who have a positive serum beta hCG and are less than 13 weeks pregnant, as determined by the size of their gestational sac or crown rump length on ultrasound. Definitions for types of miscarriage are:
1) Early embryonic demise = Mean sac diameter (MSD) &gt;20mm with nil internal structures
2) Anembryonic pregnancy = empty gestational sac of at least 12mm and no growth over 3 or more days
3) Early fetal demise = fetus crown rump length (CRL) at least 6mm with nil fetal heart beat on transvaginal USS
4) Incomplete miscarriage = mixed echogenicity within endometrial cavity +/- disordered gestational sac</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients are referred to our Early Pregnancy Assessment Service (EPAS) by Local Medical Officers and Emergency Departments. If miscarriage is diagnosed at the initial visit the patients are counselled regarding the treatment options (medical vs surgical). If the patient elects medical management they will be seen by the clinic nurse who will discuss the trial, give out the patient information statement and gain consent. Eligible participants will be randomised to receive either misoprostol alone or mifepristone + misoprostol. Concealment will be achieved using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Envelopes will be kept in the office of clinic nurse not involved in the study. We hope that by having clinic nurses rather than registrars and consultants consenting the participants we will avoid dependent relationships forming between participants and those involved in the trial.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are doing this study to determine the most effective medication for treating women who have a miscarriage during the first three months of their pregnancy.

Our clinic offers different treatment options for managing miscarriage. The first involves a single medication (Misoprostol) and the second, two  separate medications (Misoprostol and Mifepristone). At present there is no evidence to show that one  works better than the other.  Currently, the treatment you are given depends on the womens choice and which one the treating doctor feels will be best for the patient. 

Currently, it is not clear if one treatment is better than the other . We hope that this study will if adding mifepristone to the treatment improves its effectiveness so that we can better manage miscarriage.</summary>
