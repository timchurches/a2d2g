  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CK-301 is a fully human monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype that directly binds to Programmed
      Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and blocks its interactions with the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and
      B7.1 receptors. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of CK-301 when administered intravenously as a single agent to subjects
      with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers.</summary>
