  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Oral mucosal immunoprophylaxis (OMIP)
Other interventions - Placebo

Experimental: Oral mucosal immunoprophylaxis (OMIP) - Participants are administered oral mucosal immunoprophylaxis (OMIP) daily for 12 months.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants are administered, via the same route as the experimental group, an oral placebo solution daily for 12 months.


Other interventions: Oral mucosal immunoprophylaxis (OMIP)
OMIP consists of a mixture of allergen extracts including 0.2 milliliters (mL) timothy grass, 0.2 mL cat, and 0.2 mL house dust mite for a total daily dose of 0.6 mL.

Other interventions: Placebo
The placebo consists of three 0.2 mL vials of solution mixed together for a total daily dose of 0.6 mL.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Allergic Sensitization at Month 36 Status Post Treatment Completion - Allergic sensitization is defined as a positive serum allergen specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) CAP test[1] or a positive allergy skin prick test[2]. Not experiencing allergic sensitization is the better outcome for this measure.
A positive serum allergen specific IgE CAP (ImmunoCAP) test result is defined by a result &gt;= 0.35 kU/L. Higher scores indicate greater allergic sensitization.
A positive skin prick test is defined as a wheal diameter that is 3 mm larger than that produced by a negative control. Higher wheal sizes indicate greater allergic reaction or sensitization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three years (36 months) after Treatment Completion</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Current Asthma at Month 36 Status Post Treatment Completion - Participants who currently have asthma three years after end of treatment. Asthma is defined as three distinct episodes of wheeze after the first year of life, each of which lasts 3 or more consecutive days and occurs in a clinical setting where asthma is likely and other likely conditions have been excluded. Episodes must be separated by at least 7 days without wheeze. Current asthma is defined as a diagnosis of asthma and at least one episode of wheeze lasting 3 or more consecutive days in the past 12 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three years (36 months) after Treatment Completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Onset of Asthma - Time to first onset of asthma is the time from the day a participant is randomized and initiates study treatment to the diagnosis of the first of three episodes of asthma. Asthma is defined as three distinct episodes of wheeze after the first year of life, each of which lasts 3 or more consecutive days and occurs in a clinical setting where asthma is likely and other likely conditions have been excluded. Episodes must be separated by at least 7 days without wheeze.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Treatment Initiation to Month 36 Status Post Treatment Completion</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether early childhood exposure to common
      allergens (substances that can trigger allergies and asthma) can prevent the development of
      asthma in children at high risk for developing the disease.</summary>
