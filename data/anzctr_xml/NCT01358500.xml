  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study seeks to determine the suitable doses of fentanyl with acceptable adverse effect
      and safety profile in opioid-dependent patients. The investigators anticipate that a well
      tolerated dose of fentanyl which produces demonstrable analgesia will be found and will be
      related to the patient's maintenance opioid dose.</summary>
