  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project seeks to investigate the efficacy of an internet based fully automated self-help mindfulness program in the promotion of wellbeing and the reduction of symptoms of anxiety and depression amongst 18 to 25 year Australian tertiary education students. The Mindfulness Online program will be located on the Swinburne University's eTherapy Unit website. Participants within the target demographic will be invited to participate via the Swinburne eTherapy webisted and paper-based flyers. The program consists of three sessions designed to make an individual more mindful or aware of moment to moment experiences. The programs duration is 3 weeks. Participants will be randomly allocated into either a control waitlist group or an active experimental group. The experimental group will access the mindfulness program immediately and will be advised to complete one session per week. In addition participants will be encouraged to practise mindfulness each day for five minutes. The participants will be given feedback on their mental health and wellbeing at the beginning of each session and will be asked to provide feedback on their mindfulness practice sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study employs a randomised controlled design. Participants will be allocated to either an intervention group who will receive access to the online intervention immediately or to a waitlist control condition.The Waitlist control group will  be given access to the intervention after the three month follow up time point for the experimental group.</comparator>

    <sequence>Once participants give their consent, they will be randomly allocated (based on the date and time of registration, via computer generated random numbers) into one of two groups: a Waitlist Control (WC) group or a Mindfulness Online (MO) group. Once participants finish the pre-intervention surveys they will be informed on the screen about which group they have been allocated to. The WC group will be advised that they will be placed on a waiting list and asked to complete the surveys three more times, and then in 15 weeks they will receive an automated email giving them details of how they can access the MO program. The MO group will be informed of how they can immediately access the MO program. The MO group can then re-enter the MO website at a convenient time and location.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Swinburne's eTherapy Unit will run a research trial to investigate the efficacy of a fully automated self-help online mindfulness intervention, Mindfulness Online, in the promotion of wellbeing amongst 18 to 25 year old TAFE and Further Education students. Swinburne University of Technology's eTherapy Unit and National eTherapy Centre (NeTC) have developed numerous internet-based prevention and treatment programs that are available to the general public for the treatment of clinical conditions and the promotion of well being. To continue the development of effective online programs information relating to the appropriateness and efficacy of specific programs for specific user groups is required. The current project seeks to examine the efficacy of the Mindfulness Online program (developed by Dr Jo Mitchell) in its application to a group of 18 - 25 year old Australian Tertiary education students. The results of this research will inform future development and recommendation of internet based interventions for specific user groups.</summary>
