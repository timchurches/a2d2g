  <interventions>
    <interventions>Coping-Together takes on a holistic approach to coping with cancer by including strategies to manage physical, social, psychological, and existential cancer-related challenges. The key component of Coping-Together is a series of four booklets, which translate the most up-to-date research on effective, practical coping strategies and render it readily available to couples. Each booklet addresses one of the following challenges: 1) symptom management, 2) communicating effectively with health care professionals, 3) supporting your partner, and 4) managing worries and emotions. For each challenge, specific coping strategies are proposed, including a step-by-step guide to mindfulness and muscle relaxation, practical self-care tips to manage side effects, using a question prompt list to improve communication with health care professionals, and worksheets to encourage joint problem-solving. Multiple coping strategies are presented to couples to facilitate a personalised approach, where couples can pick and choose and apply those that most closely correspond to their needs. Also, the booklets contain information about additional health care resources that can contribute to optimal coping and illness adjustment, including the type of support that can be expected from different members of their health care team. The Coping-Together booklets are complemented by electronic media, including a relaxation CD and 'coping coach' DVD, which features content from the communicating effectively with health care professionals booklet. Participants will be able to use any or all of these resources at their own discretion and pace prior to collection of the outcome data, which will be 2 months following baseline measurements.</interventions>
    <comparator>Minimal ethical care (MEC): Couples will receive usual oncology and follow-up care, as well as a booklet(s) from the Cancer Council NSW 'Understanding Cancer Series'. These participants will receive fortnightly follow-up phone calls from research staff over a 2 month period following baseline measurements.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test the feasibility of providing a Coping-Together self-directed supportive care intervention to couples affected by prostate cancer. It is anticipated that using the proposed Coping-Together skills will be primarily associated with couples experiencing less anxiety. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible for this study if you have recently been diagnosed with a primary, early-stage prostate cancer, are currently receiving or planning to receive treatment, gain a score of 4 or above on a Distress Thermometer (DT) measurement, have a partner who is willing to participate in the study, and you are both able to understand and complete feedback surveys on your level of care and support. 

Trial Details:
You will be randomised to one of two treatment arms in this study, either the Coping-Together (CT) arm, or to the Minimal Ethical Care (MEC) arm. The purpose of this study is to test which arm works better in couples to enhance your illness adjustment, along with how well the two of you are able to cope with your illness. Both arms involve being supplied with cancer and coping information; all or some of which you can use at your own pace. You will also receive fortnightly follow-up phone calls from research staff over a 2 month period following baseline measurements.</summary>
