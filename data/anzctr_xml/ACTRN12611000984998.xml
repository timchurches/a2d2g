  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment group would be treated with platelets concentrate prepared from their own blood (which was drown by 4 regular 5 cc blood collecting tubes). The concentrate will be applied to the operated area (hip) 24 hours after the surgery via a drainage left 
at the site during the procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo group will go through the same process as above without applying the PRP concentrate into the joint. instead the same volume of saline would be administrated.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hip arthroscopy is a surgical treatment technique which commonly address intra articular cartilage and labral pathologies. There is a growing evidence that PRP can improve articular cartilage healing, both when applied during surgery or as a sole method of treatment, when prescribed for the proper indication. PRP injection has been proposed as a novel treatment modality for the management of articular cartilage injuries of the knee, hip and ankle. Even though high level of clinical evidence is lacking, basic research supports the use of PRP derived growth factors to improve tissue healing. There are few published clinical studies on the use of PRP in cartilage pathology. The study hypothesis is that the new treatment (PRP) would improve patients outcome after arthroscopic treatment for FAI (hip impingement).</summary>
