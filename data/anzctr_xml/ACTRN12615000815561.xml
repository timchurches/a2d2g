    <scientifictitle>A pivotal in vivo bioequivalence study comparing Eumovate cream to Clobetasone butyrate cream, using the appropriate dose duration (ED50) for Eumovate cream calculated from the Pilot dose duration-response study, using healthy male and female volunteers who meet the responder and detector criteria.</scientifictitle>

  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>A pivotal in vivo bioequivalence study conducted in healthy volunteers with no health condition or problem studied.

This study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the conditions that Eumovate cream is indicated for. 

Eumovate cream is indicated for the short term (up to 7 days) treatment of the milder form of eczema, dermatitis and other steroid responsive skin conditions which do not require the use of a more active topical corticosteroid in children and adults.

  <interventions>
    <interventions>A multiple dose study design whereby each participant receives 10 mg (5mg/cm2) per site of the  test formulation of clobetasone butyrate 0.5mg/g (0.05% w/w) cream and 10 mg (5mg/cm2) per site of the innovator formulation of clobetasone butyrate 0.5mg/g (0.05% w/w) cream. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of 0.5mg/g (0.05%w/w) clobetasone butyrate cream.

Subjects will be healthy subjects who have shown a vasoconstriction response to a single dose of Eumovate cream. 

The test and reference cream will be applied to pre-allocated sites at times determined from the pilot study results (ACTRN12615000723583) on the same day (no washout period). Based on the results of the pilot study the Reference cream will be applied to one site at 10.20am (D2), two sites at 11.40am (ED50) and one site at 12.20pm (D1) and the Test cream will be applied to two sites at 11.40 am (ED50), total of 6 treatment sites.

The cream is then removed from all sites at 1.00pm and the Chromameter measurements for the pharmacodynamic responses of the topical corticosteroid will be carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6, 19 and 24 hours following removal.

There will be 16 sites in total (8 on each arm whereby 6 sites will be treated with the test or reference cream and 2 sites will be untreated control sites).

All application times will be recorded and checked in individual subjects Case Report Forms.

Cream is applied by a trained staff member using pre-filled applicators.

Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in this study. Pre and post study laboratory tests will be performed along with an ECG and medical evaluation. A follow up visit will also be completed to assess for safety.

    <comparator>Multiple dose study design whereby each participant receives 10 mg (5mg/cm2) per site of the test formulation of  clobetasone butyrate 0.5mg/g (0.05% w/w) cream and the innovator formulation of Eumovate 0.5mg/g (0.05% w/w) cream at various dose durations applied to 6 sites on each arm. The comparator/control for this trial is the innovator formulation of clobetasone butyrate cream, Eumovate Cream.

 Two sites per arm are untreated.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the in vivo bioequivalence of clobetasone butyrate  0.05% w.w cream and Eumovate cream (as summarised by AUEC (Area Under the Effect Curve)) using vasoconstriction. Blanching will be evaluated objectively using a Minolta CR30 Chromameter. The values will be used to measure the degree of colour change of each treatment site using a formulation that will be calculated and plotted against time.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cream is applied at various times to 6 sites per arm.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All formulations will be labelled as Formulation A and B. The identification of each treatment will only be known to the Managing Director and the Section Head - Trials and Regulatory Affairs. 
Randomisation will be performed using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation).

</concealment>
    <sequence>Each participant will be identified by a 3 digit screening number which is determined by the order in which the participants give consent, ie the 1st participant to give consent is allocated 001. and a 2 digit subject number which is determined by simple randomisation using a computer generated true random number generator at www.random.org. The screening number will be issued once the participant has given written consent to participate in the study and the two digit subject number will be issued after acceptance into the study.

The Randomization Scheme is computer generated by Zenith and as such, treatment sequences are randomly assigned to each subject number
