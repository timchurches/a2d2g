  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study does not evaluate the EVAR procedure, but rather obtain detailed information in order to further refine the existing predictive model. 
Participants in this study will require elective, non-urgent EVAR repair. 
Participants will attend a pre-opreative appointment, followed by a post-operative review within 6 weeks of EVAR, at 6 months and then follow up appointments annually for three years. Biomarkers will be collected pre-operatively and at every follow up visit to assess whether specific biomarkers are able to predict the incidence of postoperative EVAR failure and hence contribute further to the predictive model.</interventions>

Participants will undergo detailed vascular assessments at the preoperative appointment, and at each follow up. Participants will also have a Computed Tomography (CT) or Ultrasound performed at every visit, standard blood tests +/- biomarkers and concomitant medication and adverse event assessment.</outcome>

Participants who elect to undertake this separate component of the study will have blood samples taken pre-operatively, and at every follow up appointment. Blood samples will be analysed by Professor Jonathan Golledge, James Cook University.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this project is to prospectively evaluate and improve an interactive model for predicting outcomes for individual patients following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair
(EVAR). The model was developed to allow clinicians to preoperatively predict the likelihood of individual failure based on the following outcomes: perioperative and aneurysm-related mortality, need for reintervention, type I &amp; III endoleaks and 3 year survival. The secondary aim
is to assess whether specific biomarkers are able to predict the incidence of postoperative EVAR failure and hence contribute to the predictive model.

This study will include 1000 patients who require elective, non-urgent EVAR repair, recruited at multiple sites over a 2 year period. Data will be collected for a minimum of 3 years from the time a patient is enrolled into the study.

Active endovascular surgeons at participating hospitals will be responsible for ensuring the data submission forms are completed for the duration of patient involvement in the study. The University of Adelaide, Department of Surgery in Adelaide, will administer the study and assign a team of data coordinators, researchers, statisticians, and programmers to undertake this study.

Data will be collected preoperatively, immediately post-operatively and at follow up. Patients will be reviewed at 30-days and at six months post-operatively, and then annually for three years. Biomarkers will also be collected pre-operatively and at each follow up vsit for the duration of the study.</summary>
