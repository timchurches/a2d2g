  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Polyphenols, compounds found at high levels in berry fruit, have been shown to have health
      promoting benefits through various mechanisms both in vivo and in vitro. These benefits
      include antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory properties, and monoamine oxidase (MAO)
      inhibition. This study aims to expand on the extremely promising animal data in the
      literature, and our own pilot study results, to investigate whether drinks containing berry
      fruit can improve cognitive performance and mood in healthy human participants.

      Our central hypothesis is that fruit extracts can reduce the breakdown of neurotransmitters
      such as dopamine and serotonin. This reduction in breakdown could therefore increase the
      levels of these neurotransmitters and convey some benefits in regards to mood and cognitive
      function. The investigators will assess the pharmacokinetic activity of berry fruit extracts
      on MAO activity to test this hypothesis.

      A second hypothesis is that berryfruit polyphenols may alter circulating levels of glucose
      that may in turn affect cognitive performance and mood.

      A prior study carried out by Plant &amp; Food Research through collaboration with the University
      of Northumbria, UK, found promising results after acutely supplementing participants with a
      berry fruit based drink. This study aims to use the results from the previous study to assess
      in depth the effect of berry fruit drinks on human behaviour.</summary>
