    <concealment>This study is to assess the effect of intravenous single iron therapy versus standard care for patients after surgery in the Launceston General Hospital. Patients who receive the standard care and not eligible for the study will be also followed up to assess their outcomes with their consent. The study will be explained in detail to the patients mainly preoperatively, and if necessary postoperatively and a written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects prior to their enrolment.</concealment>
    <sequence>A full patient profile will be obtained including medical and drug history, usual diet and exercise regime. The patientâ€™s demographic and physical detail (weight, height etc) will be measured and recorded.

Eligible patients for the trial will be counselled on any side effects from the iron and ensured that if they decide to withdraw from the study at any time this will in no way affect their care or procedure at the LGH.

The patients will be randomized by an impartial party in the Pharmacy Department to avoid any possible bias using a randomly assigned computed system. The research assistant at enrolment will use the random assigned number schedule issued by the pharmacy. Patients will be randomized initially to 1) intravenous iron or 2) standard care.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary end points will be Hb, iron studies levels at discharge, amount of transfused blood, lenghth of stay at the hospital.  The study design is a randomised controlled trial with two-way randomisation. Multivariable analyses will be conducted to compare the outcomes in the two treatment groups, unadjusted and adjusted for actual and potential confounding variables (e.g. age, gender, initial Hb, and operation site, body weight, final post-operative Hb where relevant): post-operative Hb and ferritin levels by repeated measures ANOVA using general linear modelling; peri-operative blood transfusion volumes by Poisson regression.

It is estimated that we would screen about 1000-2000 patients over an 18-24 month period, and that 10% of these would fit the inclusion criteria. Sample size calculations indicate a requirement for 52 completed patients per treatment group for both outcomes based on assumptions: i) a minimum effect size detection of 2g/l increase in postoperative Hb and a 45% reduction in units of blood transfused; ii) an untreated rise in Hb of 0g/l and SD 2.8g/l, and an expected untreated transfusion rate of 2.2 units per patient SD 1.8g/l (data from Iron pre-load for major joint replacement Transfusion Medicine 1997; 7: 281-6); iii) alpha value of 0.05 and power of 80% allowing drop-out and missing data. A minimum effect size reduction of 36% in transfusion rate would require 100 patients per group (200 in total).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Since 2007, we have conducted several studies assessing preoperative anaemia in different settings including elective surgery. We noted that there was an inherent delay in the management of preoperative anaemia with most of these patients proceeding with the planned surgery without having their iron deficiency anaemia addressed. Despite the improvement in preoperative management, it has been found that there are a significant, although unknown number of patients who have postoperative iron deficiency anaemia. Furthermore, there is lack of data regarding prevalence of postoperative iron deficiency anaemia or amount of blood transfusions in patients who undergo elective surgery. Hence the importance of this trial to study all of these factors in Tasmanian patients attending the Launceston General Hospital in order to provide a pragmatic solution to this problem of postoperative anaemia.

This study is aiming to recruit patients with iron defciency  anaemia and to then randomise them between administration of a single intravenous iron carboxymaltose and standard care.

Participants will be followed up by the research assistant from the time of recruitment/randomisation until 3 months post-operatively. This allows for the completion of a questionnaire regarding their wellbeing at the time, outcome of trial medications, and blood tests as required.

In summary, this study is dealing with an important problem, post-operative anaemia after surgery patients, an issue that to date has not been addressed by our health system, and which is usually significantly increased in this group of patients.

This trial is focusing on treating postoperative anaemia adequately to minimize risk factors of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion and hence its subsequent complications/hazards. Another possible benefit of this trial is that it will help to relieve the current shortage of blood supply from the Red Cross. We also aim to minimize the patients stay in hospital and improve their quality of life.

Iron infusion would be performed in the LGH utilising the currently available facilities. The newly available iron infusion (15 min) is part of standard therapy and is routinely performed in this area without adding extra load to the system. </summary>
