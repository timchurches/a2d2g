  <interventions>
    <interventions>The administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, celecoxib,( Celebrex(trademark)) , for the control of post tonsillectomy pain
 Post operatively, patients will receive regular analgesics routinely given to post tonsillectomy patients. with allowance for IV Morphine as rescue analgesia, Ondansetron / Maxalon Metoclopramide (taken orally)  as antiemetic and other medications deemed necessary..
2 doses of IV Dexamethasone 8mg will be given to all patients post-operatively and on the first morning post surgery.
Upon discharge patients will be supplied with a treatment or placebo pack.  Both packs contain 
Paracetamol (1gm (4 times per day) 12 days), Penicillin (500mg (twice per day)  5 days), endone (5mg (as required) /6 hrly) and either Placebo (2 capsules (twice per day)  7 days) OR Celecoxib ((200 mg capsules), 2 capsules (twice per day),  7 days)). All medications are taken orally
Study participants will be asked to return all unused medications to the study coordinator at the final outpatient appointment.  These will be checked against their patient drug diary to ensure protocol adherence. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is Celecoxib a useful adjunct in post tonsillectomy pain control? Assessed using all the outcomes listed  
Pain is scored using a 1 - 10 numeric scale (0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain) recorded in a patient diary.  The diary is completed at the same time everyday (at the time of the evening meal) and is assessed when resting, drinking and eating. </outcome>
      <timepoint>28 days </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Does Celecoxib have more incidence of post tonsillectomy haemorrhage?
Measured on a 3 point haemorrhage scale 
1. No bleeding
2. Minimal bleeding - managed medically with no blood transfusion
3. Profuse bleeding - requiring theatre admission or blood transfusion </outcome>
      <timepoint>28 days </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is the pain free day earlier in the drug or placebo group?  Pain free day is the day when the patient scores the pain as a zero in their patient diary. </outcome>
      <timepoint>28 days </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is the readmission rate for dehydration or poor oral intake lower in the study group</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Does the study group have less side effects e.g. Nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness 
Study participants are given a patient diary and asked to specify all side effects experienced</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 days </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Does the study group take less rescue analgesics. This will be recorded in a diary given to all study participants. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the treatment of post tonsillectomy pain.  The pain experienced is severe and has a tendency to get worse five to seven days after surgery.  This often has an impact on the patients oral intake prolonging the return to normal activity.  The narcotics given for pain control are often associated with side effects. 

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Celecoxib (Celebrex(trademark) are superior for the control of pain minus the side effects.  In this study the patient will be randomised to one of two groups and given a study pack on discharge.  Both packs contain an antibiotic (Penicillin) and a rescue analgesic (Oxycodone - Endone(Trademark) ). One pack contains paracetamol and one contains paracetamol and Celecoxib/Celebrex. 

Patients will be asked to chart their recovery until their pain ceases.  A data collection chart will be given to each patient on discharge.  Each patient will be followed up in outpatients 5 days and 4 weeks post-surgery.
