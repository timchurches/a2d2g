  <interventions>
    <interventions>Frozen shoulder patients first received thermotherapy, a electrical heating pad was applied on the shoulder region for 15 minutes. Patients with frozen shoulder could control the heating temperature by themselves. After the thermotherapy followed by one-session muscle release treatment for about 30 minutes right after the pre-test examination. There was a single 45-minute treatment session only. All treatments were done by a licensed physical therapist with at least 2 years of clinical experience. The target muscle was positioned in the lengthen position, while physical therapist gave a sustain pressure directly on the muscle belly for 60 to 90 seconds. This intervention mainly focused on pectoralis major, upper trapezius, infraspinatus, teres major and posterior deltoid. There was no any strategy used to monitor the intervention. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purposes of this study are to compare differences in shoulder muscle activity and kinematics between patients with frozen shoulder and matched healthy subjects; and to determine the effects of one-session muscle release techniques on shoulder muscle activity and shoulder kinematics. 20 patients with unilateral frozen shoulder and 20 asymptomatic subjects were recruited. All subjects received pre-test examination including shoulder kinematics, range of motion and muscle strength, pain scale, and electromyography of pectoralis major(PM), infraspinatus(IS), teres major(TM), upper trapezius(LT), and lower trapezius(LT). The data of shoulder muscle activity and kinematics were recorded during scaption, hand to neck and thumb to waist. Patients then received one-session muscle release treatment and the post-test examination immediately. Compared to the asymptomatic controls, the patients with frozen shoulder revealed significantly decreased LT and IS muscle activity , and increased PM activity during functional tasks. After one-session of muscle release treatment, both UT and LT muscle activity improved during shoulder elevation. The TM muscle activity decreased 4.38% (p=0.033) which was closer to the level of the asymptomatic controls. In addition, the angle of shoulder flexion (SF), scapular posterior tilt (PT) and upward rotation (UR) were significantly decreased in patient group, and after one-session of intervention, scapular posterior tilt was improved 3.14 degree during shoulder elevation. Conclusion: Patients with frozen shoulder showed abnormal muscle activity and shoulder kinematics during three functional tasks. After one-session of muscle release techniques, the abnormal muscle activity was normalized accompanying with improved scapular kinematics. Clinical Relevance: The abnormal shoulder muscle activity, especially of the trapezius muscles, may contribute to abnormal scapular dynamic control in patients with frozen shoulder and may influence functional movements in their daily life. </summary>
