    <interventions>Fifty adult male patients who were planned to undergo a transurethral prostate resection (TURP) under regional anesthesia due to benign prostate hypertrophy were included in the study with informed consent obtained from each patient. This is a prospective, randomized, and double-blind study including cases with Caudal Block (group C) or Saddle Block (GroupS) for TURP. 
 Group S 5% 10 mg levobupivacaine and 25micrograms fentanyl were administered to the subarachnoid space by L4-5 interspace once only for the Saddle Block. The patient was held in the sitting position with the aid of an assistant for 5-7 minutes to allow the Saddle Block to develop. </interventions>
    <comparator>In caudal anesthesia group (Group C, n=25), patients were turned into a left lateral decubitus position with knees pulled up to the abdomen at 90 degrees. Following the identification of sacral corns and sacral hiatus, the site of injection was infiltrated with 2 ml of 1% lidocaine. A 7 cm long 25 G needle was introduced at an angle of 45 degrees at the vertical axis to the skin, sacrococcygeal membrane was penetrated and typically was felt that it entered a space, then the needle position was brought to a 30 degree angle to the skin and was advanced to the epidural space for 4-5 cm. After no blood was seen with aspiration, 14 ml 0.5% levobupivacaine and 25 micrograms fentanyl were injected into the epidural space in a rate of 0.5 ml/sec. The patients were placed in a neutral supine position. The patient was made to wait until a block at the T10 level was obtained. Before placing the patients into a lithotomy position, sensorial block levels were evaluated with a pinprick test. Motor block was evaluated with the Bromage scale. All these anesthetics were administered to sacral epidural space (Caudal space) once only. </comparator>

Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a scale in which the patients responded to the question. comfort score, age, body mass index, and duration of the operation were recorded. After the operation finished the satisfaction scores of patients  were evaluated. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: Caudal Anesthesia and Saddle Block are preferential methods in transurethral prostate resection (TURP). We aimed to compare the efficiency of Saddle Block and Caudal Anesthesia in postoperative analgesic consumption and patient comfort using levobupivacaine.
Methods: Fifty ASA I-III patients were divided into two groups. Using 0.5% 10 mg levobupivacaine and 25 micrograms fentanyl, Saddle Block was performed by L4-5 interspace for Group S and using 14 ml 0.5% levobupivacaine and 25 micrograms fentanyl, Caudal Anesthesia was applied for Group C. Sensorial and motor block initial time, satisfaction of the patients, painless interval after operation and the total postoperative analgesic requirements for 24 hours were recorded.
Results: The age, gender, body mass index, operation time and postoperative painless interval time were similar between the groups (p&gt;0.05). The initial time of sensory block in Group S was statistically lower than in Group C  (p=0.001). The comfort score in Group S was higher than in Group C  (p=0.0001). The total amount of postoperative analgesic requirement for 24 hours in group S was found to be lower than in Group S (p=0.001). Motor block was developed in Group S and no motor block in Group C (p=0.0001). Hemodynamic parameters were similar in both groups (p&gt;0.05). 
Conclusions: Using levobupivacaine and fentanyl, Saddle Block was found more advantageous than Caudal Block regarding patient comfort score, postoperative total analgesic requirement for 24 hours and initial time of sensorial block in patients undergoing TURP.    </summary>
