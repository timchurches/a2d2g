  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study examined the effectiveness of a four-week kindness intervention (based on the intervention of Layous and colleagues, 2012). After completing the baseline questionnaire (which happened in class during school hours), the primary investigator instructed children in the experimental condition to perform a minimum of three kind acts every Wednesday during the four-week intervention. Children were free to choose what kind acts they carried out and for whom (e.g., getting coffee for a teacher, lending a pencil to a classmate, or comforting a little brother). All children received a form (based on that of Layous and colleagues, 2012) including a description of what kind acts are, examples of kind acts, and the instruction to perform a minimum of three kind acts on Wednesday, which was read out loud by the primary investigator. Teachers were asked to help remind children about this by handing out the same instruction forms on Tuesday. Moreover, all children received a diary to keep track of the kind acts they performed. The diaries included detailed instructions on how to correctly report the kind acts. Every Thursday during the intervention, children were given the opportunity to fill in their diary during school hours. More specifically, they were asked to report the date, the type of kind act they performed, and the recipient of the kind act. The diaries were collected directly after the post-intervention questionnaire (i.e., 4 weeks after baseline).</interventions>

    <sequence>After the headmasters provided active consent for the children from the fifth and sixth grade to participate, schools were randomized at school level to avoid contamination between conditions using simple randomization (coin tossing). To assure equal sample sizes across conditions, the primary investigator clustered the schools into two groups based on the number of students per school and grade level.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis using G*Power indicated that n = 90 per condition would suffice to detect a significant effect (a = .05) with power = .80. In order to compensate for potential dropouts we aimed to include 125 children per condition (N = 250). After contacting several schools throughout the Netherlands, 6 six schools expressed interested to take part in the study. Therefore, the total amount of children that were randomized and allocated to either one of the conditions was 490. The total number of children that actually participated in the study (after drop-outs) was 438. 

To assess the effect of the kindness intervention on childrens wellbeing and peer acceptance, four mixed two-way repeated measures ANCOVAs (a = .05) with condition (experimental vs. control) and time (baseline vs. post-intervention) as independent variables were conducted. Positive affect, happiness, satisfaction with life, and peer acceptance were separately examined as dependent variables.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For many years, research into childrens social and emotional development has focused on ways to treat problematic and risk behaviours, whereas there studies focusing on strategies to promote positive development fell short. This is unfortunate, as children who fare well report less deviance and conduct problems and have better self-concept, integration into school, and closeness to others, when compared with children reporting only moderate psychological welfare. From a positive psychological perspective, this study therefore aimed to examine how we can encourage children to thrive and flourish. One type of behaviour related to flourishing is prosocial behaviour, which comprises all acts that benefit another person. In 2012, Layous and colleagues found that prompting children to act prosocial by means of a kindness intervention has positive effects on two indicators of welfare among Canadian children, namely wellbeing (i.e., positive affect, happiness, and life satisfaction) and peer acceptance. The goal of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of the kindness intervention in sample of Dutch children. It was expected that children who were exposed to the four-week kindness intervention would increase in wellbeing and peer acceptance over time, whereas children in the control condition would not. </summary>

    <publicnotes>Unfortunately, ethics approval was not attained prior to recruitment of the first participant as the present study was part of a masters' thesis that had to be completed within one academic year. Ethics approval from the ethical committee of the Radboud University was requested in November 2015, but approved in February 2016. To be able to finish the project in time for graduation, we had to stick to the planning and start the intervention in January. </publicnotes>
