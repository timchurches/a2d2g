    <interventions>Group 1: Participants will be treated with a multilayered high compression system (gold standard evidence based practice) once per week throughout the duration of the study. Those randomised to Group 1 will receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) treatments. Each HBOT treatment will consist of oxygen at 2.4 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 110 minutes. Oxygen is pressurised in a cyclical routine through a number of compression/decompression phases during the treatment. Patients will receive these HBOT treatment 5 days/week for 6 weeks or until healed, an upper limit of 30 treatments.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2: Participants will be treated with a multilayered high compression system (gold standard evidence based practice) once per week throughout the study. Those randomised to Group 2 will receive a sham HBOT treatment. Each sham HBOT treatment will consist of an exact time replica of the treatment protocol using air pressurised to 1.2 ATA then decreased to 1.0 ATA. This is repeated in a cyclical routine through the compression/decompression phases of the treatment protocol. The patient is maintained at 1.0 ATA through the 85 minute treatment phase. Participants will receive the sham treatment 5 days/week for 6 weeks or until healed, an upper limit of 30 treatments.</comparator>

a patient has been identified by the clinician in

invite them to participate and give them an
information and consent package. If the patient
consents to participate in the study, the
Research Assistant will collect baseline data
from the patientâ€™s records and give the patient
a questionnaire to fill in. Where more than one ulcer is present, a target ulcer will be identified for the purpose of the study (i.e., the largest ulcer).The Research
Assistant will open a randomisation envelope
and the patient will be allocated to either
Treatment group 1 or Treatment group 2. A
staff member not working on this project will
have previously filled sealed opaque envelopes

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to conduct a blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for patients with non-healing venous leg ulcers on progress in wound healing, pain, quality of life and cost effectiveness of care.

Study Therapy:  
Active - Oxygen at 2.4 atmospheres absolute for 110 minutes in the Hyperbaric Chamber.
Placebo - Exact time replica of the treatment protocol using air pressurised to 1.2 ATA then decreased to 1.0 ATA. This is repeated in a cyclical routine through the compression/decompression phases of the treatment protocol. The patient is maintained at 1.0 ATA through the 85 minute treatment phase. 
	
Study Population:	Male and female adults with non-healing venous leg ulcers and who fit with the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited into the study. 
To complete 58 study participants in the HBOT blinded study, at least 84 volunteers will need to be enrolled into the four week pre-HBOT treatment assessment period. 
	
No. Centres: 1. Wesley Centre for Hyperbaric Medicine
	
Study Design: The study has a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled design.
	
Study Duration: Total of 16 weeks including the four weeks prior to and six weeks following the HBOT intervention of six weeks duration.
	
Objectives of the Study: To determine the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for study participants with non-healing venous leg ulcers on progress in wound healing, pain, quality of life and cost effectiveness of care.
	
Study Endpoints:  (Primary and Secondary)	
Primary wound healing outcome measure will be the incidence of complete wound closure  at the completion of the study (12 weeks after initiation of the HBOT study).  
Secondary outcomes will include time to healing, ulcer area percentage reduction and differences in PUSH scores.
The primary safety endpoints will be incidence of treatment emergent adverse events.  Study participants are assessed prior to commencing HBOT and then at every treatment for adverse effects e.g. ear barotrauma, oxygen toxicity effects (seizures, myopic visual effects).  These side effects are all temporary changes. 
Quality of Life data will be measured at the beginning and end of the 16-week study.</summary>
