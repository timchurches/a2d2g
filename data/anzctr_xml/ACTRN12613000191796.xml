  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to the trial however all participants will precede random allocation with a 2 month very low energy diet (optifast- consisting of one month of 3 shakes per day followed by 2 weeks of 2 shakes per day + food followed by 2 weeks of 1 shake per day + food. AT two months they will be randomised to one of two diets- a low glycemic index/high protein diet or a standard hypocaloric diet. All patients will receive identical lifestyle modification advice and the same model and volume of self directed exercise will be prescribed for all participants. More information regarding the interventions is outlines below.

This is a parallel study design which means once a patient has been randomly allocated to their intervention groups they will not crossover to the other intervention program. 

Very low energy diets are frequently used as an efficient and rapid means of controlled weight loss prior to patients transitioning to a maintenance diet. There is a strong body of evidence using VLED in overweight/obese sleep apnea patients as a precursor to other treatment options. The VLED program structure has been provided by RPAH Metabolism and Obesity Services and has been utilised in clinical services and other research trials frequently in the past. The state of ketosis is achieved as large amounts of fatty acids are broken down in response to extreme energy restriction. VLEDs also contain the recommended daily requirements for vitamins, minerals, trace elements, fatty acids and protein. 
Those patients achieving desired body weight prior to completion of the 3 month shake period will be reviewed by the study physician and supervising nutritional staff to determine whether to graduate them to a maintenance diet earlier than projected. The specific VLED program can be found in the standard operating procedures manual. Patients will follow a full VLED program for an 8 week period (3 shakes per day) then an initial transition phase for 2 weeks (2 shakes, one meal) followed by a latter transition phase (1 shake, 2 meals) before initiating their randomised maintenance diet. Shakes will be made up to 240 mL using water, each sachet is 40 g and is equivalent to 635 kJ. 

At baseline patients will see an exercise physiologis/nutritionist for approximately 1.5 hours for individual assessment and introduction to the very low energy diet. 
Participants will then receive a phone call or skype session at 1 week and 2 weeks to follow up progress with the very low energy diet and allow the opportunity to ask questions. At one month participants will be scheduled to attend the clinic for a routine blood test, safety measures and anthropometry measurements. They will also receive an individual lifestyle modification session focused on exercise. Exercise will be "self managed" throughout the trial however patients will be provided a structured program based on their individual requirements and comorbidities that is focussed on establishing 30 minutes of exercise daily with 2 strength training sessions per week as recommended for the Australian population before progressing to 45-60 minutes of exercise daily (cardio) with 2 strength sessions per week as recommended for clinically significant weight loss. This will be standardised for all participants and a home based strength training program is provided along with clear instructions and demonstrations in clinic. The home based program consists of body weight based exercises such as push ups, participants however will have the option of attending a gym if this is their preference. This is beyond the delivery of the trial however appropriate exercises will be recommended should a participant choose to exercise in this environment. 
Once the participant reaches their ideal weight their exercise prescription will revert to the 30 minutes daily cardio exercise plus 2 days strength training as recommended for the adult population for the maintenance of weight and health. This is a lifelong recommendation.

Participants will then attend the clinic at 2 months for an overnight stay where all outcomes are measured. It is at this point that patients are randomised to a low glycemic index/high protein diet or a standard hypocaloric diet. Participants will also receive dietary counselling regarding the transition from a very low calorie diet to their appropriate dietary group.
Calculations will be performed based on the participants current age, height, weight and activity level to determine the calorie  intake required to maintain their weight loss. Diet plans have been designed in a unit model whereby filling the units will ensure the various energy requirements/intake is met. Diet plans are equivalent to 5,7,9 and 11 megajoules as required by each individual.

DIETARY GROUP DESCRIPTION: LOW GLYCEMIC INDEX/HIGH PROTEIN DIET
Participants in this group will be coached to adopt a high protein/low GI weight loss diet based on a 500 calorie restriction (as determined by Harris Benedict Equation). The goal of the diet is to maintain a minimum of 5-10 % weight loss over a 12 month period with sustainable changes in eating patterns.
The target macronutrient contribution is 45% of energy from carbohydrates, emphasising low glycaemic sources, 30% from fat and 25% from protein. This macronutrient distribution is similar to the Australian average diet but the GI is lower. The diet will aim to be as low in GI as practical as achieved by replacing higher GI carbohydrates (e.g. conventional white bread, breakfast cereals and potatoes) with lower GI carbohydrates (e.g. Burgen (Registered Trademark) grain breads, oats, pasta, basmati rice). The GI of the low GI/GL diet will be less than 50 (glucose is equivalent to 100) and calculated using published data for Australian foods. The diet will emphasise lean sources of protein and restriction of saturated and transfats (but not total fat).
Participants will be provided with The Shoppers Guide to Low GI that outline the carbohydrate choices and the food amounts that constitute one serving. They will also be provided information on the whole diet to ensure energy and overall nutrient balance. 

Both diets incorporate all food groups (including cereals, grains, pastas, breads, dairy products, meats and other proteins, fish and seafood, fruit, vegetables and healthy fats and occasional foods. They are healthy sustainable diets. The dietary intervention will finish at 6 months however patients are encouraged to maintain their weight loss by permanently following their dietary pattern. Each diet promotes a lifelong way of healthy eating that is indicated for health benefits unless development of a specific medical condition later in life (such as liver disease or kidney failure- not related to these diets) warrants future dietetics assessment and recommendations

The lifestyle modification sessions continue with a 3 month phone or skype session, a 4.5 month phonecall or skype session and a 6 month overnight stay where all outcomes are measured. 
The lifestyle modification sessions entail dietary and exercise advice as described as well as health coaching and the use of appropriate tools to aid behaviour change. This incorporates action planning, the recognition and management of lapses and relapses and long term goal setting. 

Patients presenting with low adherence to dietary program or demonstrating a need for additional support via more frequent anthropometry may be offered to participate in face to face sessions instead of skype/phonecall sessions. This will be at the discretion of the study physicians and study coordinator where a consensus must be met based on weight loss and patient compliance monitoring.

At 6 months the active intervention ceases and patients are encouraged to maintain their weight and health for the following 6 months where they will receive a follow up phonecall at 9 months and a final overnight stay at 12 months to assess all outcomes.</interventions>
    <comparator>In this second arm of the trial all participants will precede randomisation with a 2 month very low energy diet (optifast- consisting of one month of 3 shakes per day followed by 2 weeks of 2 shakes per day + food followed by 2 weeks of 1 shake per day + food. AT two months participants will be randomised and the second arm is a standard hypocaloric diet.

DIETARY GROUP DESCRIPTION: STANDARD HYPOCALORIC DIET
Participants in this group will be coached to adopt a variety of healthy foods from all food groups  based on a 500 calorie restriction (as determined by Harris Benedict Equation). It will be modelled around the current Australian guide to healthy eating. The goal of the diet is to maintain a minimum of 5-10 % weight loss over a 12 month period with sustainable changes in eating patterns. Patients will be encouraged to choose whole grains, sources of high fibre, reduce sugar intake and decrease fat intake (specifically saturated and trans fats). The target macronutrient contribution is 60% of energy from carbohydrates, 23% from fat and 17% from protein. This macronutrient distribution is within the recommendation ranges provided by the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.
Participants will be provided with The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating that outlines the carbohydrate choices and the food amounts that constitute one serving. They will also be provided information on the whole diet to ensure energy and overall nutrient balance. 

The standard hypocaloric diet group receive a copy of the Australian guide to healthy eating and are educated regarding portions sizes. They are encouraged to increase fibre intake and reduce saturated fat intake and consume a variety of nutritious foods.

Both diets incorporate all food groups (including cereals, grains, pastas, breads, dairy products, meats and other proteins, fish and seafood, fruit, vegetables and healthy fats and occasional foods. They are healthy sustainable diets. The dietary intervention will finish at 6 months however patients are encouraged to maintain their weight loss by permanently following their dietary pattern. Each diet promotes a lifelong way of healthy eating that is indicated for health benefits unless development of a specific medical condition later in life (such as liver disease or kidney failure- not related to these diets) warrants future dietetics assessment and recommendations

The lifestyle modification sessions continue with a 3 month phone or skype session, a 4.5 month phonecall or skype session and a 6 month overnight stay where all outcomes are measured. 
The lifestyle modification sessions entail dietary and exercise advice as described as well as health coaching and the use of appropriate tools to aid behaviour change. This incorporates action planning, the recognition and management of lapses and relapses and long term goal setting. 

Patients presenting with low adherence to dietary program or demonstrating a need for additional support via more frequent anthropometry may be offered to participate in face to face sessions instead of skype/phonecall sessions. This will be at the discretion of the study physicians and study coordinator where a consensus must be met based on weight loss and patient compliance monitoring.

At 6 months the active intervention ceases and patients are encouraged to maintain their weight and health for the following 6 months where they will receive a follow up phonecall at 9 months and a final overnight stay at 12 months to assess all outcomes.</comparator>

Sequential treatment allocations will be enclosed in numbered, opaque sealed envelopes, and distributed to each participant at their baseline visit stratified according to treatment to evenly distribute patients between treatment groups and aid generalisability.

Recruitment will primarily be conducted through the physicians at the Sleep Clinics of:
The Woolcock Institute
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital
Potentially eligible participants will be given an information sheet detailing the aims of the study, basic eligibility criteria and the study staff coordinator contact number to call if they are interested in participating. Participants who are recruited from one of the Sleep Clinics listed may fill in a form requesting to be contacted by a study investigator if they prefer. Other sources of potential volunteers include:

The Woolcock Clinic: Treating physicians, all Woolcock affiliated, will be alerted to the study and asked to inform candidate patients of the trial. Patients will be assured that an unwillingness to participate in the trial will in no way affect their ongoing treatment and level of care.

Local print media including newspaper advertisements, local newsletters, university mail and newsletters etc.

Specialist/GP Referral and potential advertisements in GP wait rooms

Sleep Disorders Australia website

Australasian Sleep Trials Network website

Australasian Sleep Association website

Databases from previous studies where individuals have consented to be contacted for future studies

Advertisements may also be displayed in health magazines, websites or papers that are targeted at similar patients. Sleep Disorders Australia and larger general practices will also be advised of the trial to advertise the trial for potential participants.
To assess the eligibility for the SLEEEP Study, interested volunteers will undergo a telephone screening. The questions on the form were designed to address all inclusion and exclusion criteria. A 15-30 minute phone call from the interviewer will allow all volunteers to answer the questions and ask any that they may have about the study. A confidential study database will maintain a record of all screens conducted and indicate potential participants and note those who wish not to be contacted in the future.
Participants will be informed about their eligibility or be placed on hold for further medical information and/or investigation(s). An information package will be sent via email or post to the potentially eligible subjects and will include an appointment to see the study physician, information regarding the location of the screening, testing venue, a permission slip for access of medical records, a study information sheet including a brief outline of the assessment procedures and a brochure outlining the weight loss program and diets. If not eligible, the researcher will ask volunteer’s permission to retain their contact details in case their situation changes over time and they become eligible at a later date. To obtain medical clarification for volunteers, letters will be sent to their relative doctors along with the signed permission slip from the volunteers indicating that the physician may release relevant medical information where this information may be lacking at the discretion of the study physician.
Potentially eligible participants will be given the informed consent and will be guided through all aspects of the information sheet and offered the opportunity to ask any questions related to the study when they attend their screening visit at the Woolcock Institute. Those subjects who agree to participate in the area will be asked to sign the consent form according to the guidelines of the Sydney Local Health District’s Ethics Review Committee. If the patient is willing to participate in the study, they will be requested to also provide written and witnessed informed consent for use of a sample for Pharmacogenetic Research. To determine final eligibility the study physician will examine, consult and review the medical records and telephone screening of each subject. Screening bloods will be collected to check against inclusion/exclusion criteria along with a 12 lead resting ECG. If necessary, a screening overnight PSG will requested to confirm OSA prior to the participant being entered into the study. 
Eligible subjects will then be asked to attend a baseline visit. Baseline visits will take place overnight at The Woolcock Institute (Glebe). Eligible volunteers will all commence Optifast for the proceeding two month period prior to be randomised to one of the intervention arms as stratified by treatment versus non-treatment use. </concealment>
    <sequence>Only eligible adults providing written informed consent according to the current approved protocol will be enrolled into the trial. OSA volunteers will be enrolled sequentially according to two pre- allocated randomisation lists stratified as the treatment and non-treatment users  and randomised in concealed variable blocks of 4-8 into the standard low calorie diet and lifestyle modification program OR a low GI and High protein diet and lifestyle modification program following three months of VLED. The dietary intervention is an open label study as participants cannot be blinded to their treatment allocation.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Randomisation will not occur until the completion of a 2 month very low energy diet where patients are able to achieve 5-10% weight loss. 

Patients who are unable to tolerate the VLED will be considered by the medical supervisory staff to determine whether they are able to reduce their VLED prescription while maintaining an acceptable rate of weight loss so as to enable them to remain in the study. These decisions will be considered on a case by case basis. Patients who are unable to be randomised due to inability to lose weight through the VLED will undertake an exit interview prior to exiting the trial and will be offered medical support as required.


BOOSTER SESSIONS
Patients presenting with low adherence to dietary program or demonstrating a need for additional support via more frequent anthropometry may be offered to participate in face to face sessions instead of skype/phonecall sessions. This will be at the discretion of the study physicians and study coordinator where a consensus must be met based on weight loss and patient compliance monitoring.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot trial to describe the variability of weight regain in these two different maintenance diets following a very low energy diet. Recruitment will enrol a maximum number of participants within a target period of six months. No power calculations have been conducted as this is a pilot trial however we anticipate that 20 people will be recruited for each study arm for a total of n=40 over the 6 month recruitment phase. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Mixed model analyses of variance will be used to test each diet treatment effect. Treatment will be the fixed effect and individual patients the random effect. Main effects for the trial will be regarded as statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05. 95% confidence intervals will be used to analyse weight rebound in order to measure the variability associated with weight regain. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will investigate the effect of two different diets for patients with obstructive sleep apnea who are trying to lose weight. This study will look at changes in sympathetic activity (which controls your fight or flight response) as well as assessing your cardiometabolic health and disease risk factors. All participants who choose to enrol in the study will follow a very low energy diet for three months followed by nine months of free health coaching and weight loss therapy delivered by an accredited exercise physiologist and nutritionist. Those who proceed with the trial will be randomised to a low glycemic index/high protein diet or a standard low calorie diet based on the Australian guide to healthy eating after following a very low energy diet for three months.</summary>
