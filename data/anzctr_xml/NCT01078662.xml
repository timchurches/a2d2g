  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tumour Response Rate - Tumour response rate is the proportion of patients who experienced complete or partial response at least once during the assessment period, according to the definitions of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour assessments carried out at baseline ie 28 days before first study drug dose and then every 8 weeks up to 6 months after starting study treatment, then every 12 weeks until objective disease progression, assessed maximum up to 29 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate - Objective response rate is the proportion of patients with at least one measurable lesion at baseline, who experienced complete or partial response at least once during the assessment period, according to the definitions of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour assessments carried out at baseline ie 28 days before first study drug dose and then every 8 weeks up to 6 months after starting study treatment, then every 12 weeks until objective disease progression, assessed maximum up to 29 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival - Progression free survival is defined as the duration from first dose till objective progression or death. In absence of progression or death, the time is calculated from first dose till last evaluable scanning visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour assessments are carried out at baseline ie 28 days before first study drug dose and then every 8 weeks up to 6 months after starting study treatment, then every 12 weeks until objective disease progression, assessed maximum up to 29 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival is defined as the duration from first dose till death. In absence of death, the time is calculated from first dose till the date subject last known to be alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Survival follow-up from first dose till death of the patient or till end of study in absence of death, assessed maximum up to 29 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival Rate at 12 Months - Overall survival rate at 12 months is defined as the proportion of patients who are alive 12 months after date of first dose</outcome>
      <timepoint>Survival follow-up from first dose till death of the patient or till end of study in absence of death, assessed maximum up to 29 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Duration of response is calculated from the date of first documented response (complete or partial) until date of documented progression (as defined by RECIST 1.1) or death (by any cause) in the absence of disease progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From onset of first occurrence of complete or partial response till documented progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression, assessed maximum up to 29 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Control Rate at Week 16 - Disease control rate is the proportion of patients with best response of complete or partial response or stable disease according to definitions of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1) till week 16.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour assessments carried out at baseline ie 28 days before first study drug dose and then at week 8 and week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
