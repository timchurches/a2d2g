    <interventions>This study aims to compare the speed and accuracy of ultrasound versus landmark technique of identifying the cricothyroid membrane (CTM) and to secondarily assess the confidence of providers in the method that they have undertaken.

Patients will have their CTM identified via use of ultrasound immediately prior to undergoing routine CT imaging of the cervical spine. This will be performed by study staff (consultant emergency physicians or advanced trainees in emergency medicine, who have completed the training protocol and basic credentialing in emergency ultrasound, with at least eFAST and AAA competency). The CTM will marked by placement of a radiopaque marker  and held in place using micropore tape. This will be removed at completion of the CT scan. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will have their CTM identified via digital palpation and use of superficial landmarks prior to undergoing routine CT imaging of the cervical spine. This will be performed by study staff. The CTM will marked by placement of a radiopaque marker  and held in place using micropore tape. This will be removed at completion of the CT scan. </comparator>

      <outcome>To determine if there is a significant difference in accuracy between ultrasound and landmark CTM identification in patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 25.

The accuracy of the technique will be assessed by calculating the percentage of patients in each group where the centre of the radio-opaque marker lies over any part of the cricothyroid membrane in the judgement of the assessing radiologists (who will be blinded to the technique used to place the marker).</outcome>

Using a significance level of 0.05, and power of 80%, 28 patients are required in each arm; to allow for dropouts, a target of 31 patients in each arm (62 in total) is intended.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A small number of patients who are brought to the emergency department need a general anaesthetic. This lets us help them by keeping their airway open and breathing for them, and allows us to perform tests and provide further treatment. In very rare cases, the breathing tube cannot be passed through the mouth. This is a life threatening emergency, and an emergency procedure called a cricothyroidotomy then has to be performed. This involves making a cut in the front of the neck, directly into the windpipe, so that the breathing tube can be put directly into the airway. This is similar to a tracheostomy.

The area of the neck where the cut is made is called the cricothyroid membrane, and it is usually identified by feeling the front of the neck with a finger. Recently, it has become clear that ultrasound scans can be used to locate the membrane, but it is not clear if this is more or less accurate than locating it by feel, and whether using an ultrasound takes more or less time.

The study aims to compare two groups of patients. One group will have their cricothyroid membrane identified by touch, and the other group will have it identified by ultrasound. The participants in the study, will be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin) into one of these two groups.

Immediately before having a CT scan, a doctor will try and locate the patients cricothyroid membrane using either touch or ultrasound (depending on the group they are randomised to), and then place a marker (a small metal cross) on the neck, which will be held in place with adhesive tape.

After the CT scan, an x-ray specialist will then be able to see whether or not the marker has been placed accurately. We will then compare whether one method is more accurate than the other, as well as how long it took to place the marker.

With the exception of (1) the attempt of cricothyroid membrane localisation, via ultrasound or landmark palpation and (2) placing a marker on their neck, the rest of the participants care will be carried out as normal.</summary>
