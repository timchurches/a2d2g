  <interventions>
    <interventions>A study to find the flow rate which enables the delivery of a desired inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) in healthy volunteers.
Each participant will have a nasopharyngeal catheter inserted, then they will be started on oxygen through the Fisher and Paykel high flow humidified nasal interface system (MR880, RT241, RT033/034).
FiO2 at different flow rates will be calculated from measured end expired oxygen (FETO2) and carbon dioxide (FETO2) fractions. 
Measurements will be made at rest with quiet breathing both for mouth and nose breathing and then repeated with exercise.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is likely that high flow nasal systems are able to deliver a more constant and reliable FiO2 than traditional methods.
Our proposed method of measurement of FiO2 is through the insertion of a nasopharyngeal catheter and continuous measurement of end expired oxygen (FETO2) and carbon dioxide (FETCO2) fractions.
Measurements of FiO2 will be made with increasing gas flow rates, inspiratory flow rate (with exercise) and during mouth and nose breathing.</summary>
