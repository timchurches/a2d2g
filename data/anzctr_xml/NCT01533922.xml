  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Inspiratory Capacity at Rest Before Constant Work Rate Cycle Ergometry to Symptom Limitation at 75% Wcap - Inspiratory capacity (IC) at rest before constant work rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% maximal work capacity (Wcap).
Wcap was defined as the maximum work rate achieved for at least 30 seconds during the incremental cycle ergometry performed at Visit 1.
The presented means are adjusted means from the MMRM (Mixed Effects Model Repeated Measures) model.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Endurance Time During Constant Work Rate Cycle Ergometry to Symptom Limitation at 75% Wcap - Endurance time during constant work rate cycle ergometry (CWRCE) to symptom limitation at 75% work capacity (Wcap).
Wcap was defined as the maximum work rate achieved for at least 30 seconds during the incremental cycle ergometry performed at Visit 1.
The presented means are adjusted mean from the MMRM model.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Slope of the Intensity of Breathing Discomfort During Constant Work Rate Cycle Ergometry to Symptom Limitation at 75% Work Capacity - Slope of the intensity of breathing discomfort during Constant Work Rate Cycle Ergometry (CWRCE) to symptom limitation at 75% Work capacity (Wcap). The intensity of breathing discomfort was rated using the modified Borg scale with ratings from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (maximal).
Slope of breathing discomfort is defined as: (intensity of breathing discomfort at the end of exercise minus intensity of breathing discomfort at rest) / endurance time.
A decrease in slope indicates improvement.
The presented means are adjusted means from MMRM model.</outcome>
