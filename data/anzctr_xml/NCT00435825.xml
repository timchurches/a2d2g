  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg) Seroconversion 24 Weeks Following End of Treatment - Blood was collected for HBeAg. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the absence of HBeAg (a negative result for HBeAg) and the presence of anti-HBe (a positive result for anti-HBe) determined at 24 weeks after the end of treatment.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This 4 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of PEGASYS given for 24 or 48 weeks,
      and at doses of 90 or 180 micrograms weekly, in the treatment of HBeAg positive patients with
      chronic hepatitis B. Patients will be randomized to one of 4 treatment groups: a)PEGASYS 90
      micrograms subcutaneous (sc) weekly for 24 weeks, b)PEGASYS 180 micrograms sc weekly for 24
      weeks, c)PEGASYS 90 micrograms sc weekly for 48 weeks or d)PEGASYS 180 micrograms sc weekly
      for 48 weeks. Following treatment there will be a 24 week period of treatment-free follow-up
      in all treatment groups for the primary endpoint. The anticipated time on study treatment is
      3-12 months, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.</summary>
