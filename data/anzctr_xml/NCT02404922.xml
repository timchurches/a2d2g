    <summary>This study will assess in healthy male and female subjects the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of Immediate Release CTP-730 at steady state following 7 days
      of dosing. Three doses of Immediate Release (IR) CTP-730 capsules will be studied.</summary>
