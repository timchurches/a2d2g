  <interventions>
    <interventions>To support schools implement scheduled physical activity across the school week a 12 month (4 school term) multi-component implementation support strategy will be offered to schools. Baseline measurements will occur prior to the intervention beginning in Term 4. The intervention will consist of the following;

1. 1 x 5hr face to face training delivered by trained PE teachers for primary school stage coordinators to help with the scheduling of PE, sport and other physical activity will occur at the start of the intervention (i.e. Term 4) to align with schools' planning phase for the following year; 
2. 1 x 2hr face to face professional development for all teachers to increase the quality and activity of PE and sport will occur at the beginning of the school year (i.e. Term 1); 
3. Resources including example schedules, policy, manuals that support the teaching of PE that are existing resources of the Department of Education or developed specificially for the trial and pedometers for teachers to use with students to increase activity in PE and sport; 
4. On-going support via telephone and email and an on-line portal to support the implementation of the policy.

They will be offered the intervention after the 18 month follow up assessments have occurred. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The mean minutes of physical activity scheduled by primary school teachers across the school week measured via teachers class timetable.  Teachers will provide their weekly class schedule reporting the minutes of physical activity  scheduled</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The mean minutes of class physical activity across the school week where &gt;50% of students within classes are engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity. Total minutes of physical activity will be measured objectively using an accelerometer, worn by students in grade 2-3.

      <timepoint>Baseline and 12 months post-baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Students physical activity- mean physical activity counts per minute will be measured objectively using wrist-worn accelerometers, by students in grade 2-3 at all schools for 5 consecutive school days. Data will be analysed for whole school day as well as segmented.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 12 months post baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Teacher physical activity - teachers mean physical activity counts per minute  will be measured objectively using wrist-worn accelerometers, for 5 consecutive days and complete selected items from the NSW Adult Population Health Survey (NSW Centre for Epidemiology and Evidence 2015). Data will be analysed for whole school day as well as segmented</outcome>

      <outcome>Teacher wellbeing - teachers complete the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen 1983).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 12 months post-baseline</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Students on-task behaviour- teachers will complete selected items from the Teaching and Learning International Survey (OECD 2010)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 12 months post-baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost-effectiveness- Cost effectiveness will be calculated from the perspective of the NSW government. Compared to usual practice, the incremental costs associated with the development and implementation of the implementation support strategies will be calculated. Resource use categories will include personnel costs, materials and printing. Personnel costs included opportunity costs for the delivery of support strategies. Project records relating to intervention delivery, including costs, will be kept throughout the trial. Cost effectiveness will be reported as the mean incremental cost per compliant school. Uncertainty intervals will be calculated reflecting variation in cost and outcome at the school level. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this randomised control trial is to assist teachers to increase the amount of scheduled physical activity time they provide across a school week. Schools will be provided professional development, resources, time and access to a support officer to make these changes. Sixty primary schools in HNE and Mid north coast LHDs will be randomly allocated to either an intervention group or a control group. The final trial endpoint is 18 months. </summary>
