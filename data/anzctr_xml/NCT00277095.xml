  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a minimally invasive
      surgical procedure in up to 109 male patients. The ProACT device is designed to treat men who
      have stress urinary incontinence arising from intrinsic sphincter deficiency following an
      operation performed on the prostate for cancer or for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Two
      adjustable balloons (one on each side of the urethra) are implanted to treat urinary stress
      incontinence.

      The results will be analyzed to demonstrate the effects of the device as well as its
      associated risks. Therapeutic success will be based on whether patients demonstrate at least
      a 50% reduction in pad weight at 18 months follow-up compared to the pad weight results at
      baseline.</summary>
