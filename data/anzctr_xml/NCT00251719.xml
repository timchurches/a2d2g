  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With Complete Healing of Erosive Esophagitis by Week 8 as Assessed by Endoscopy - Crude Rate Analysis. - Percentage of subjects with complete healing of EE as assessed by endoscopy. Change in LA Esophagitis Classification grades A, B, C, D to healed was measured. Healed is defined as anything that is less than the criterion for Grade A (greater than or equal to 1 mucosal break and less than 5 mm). If it doesn't meet the A criterion, it's counted as healed.</outcome>
