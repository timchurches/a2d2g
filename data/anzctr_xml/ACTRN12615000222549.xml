  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will each consume six diets in random order, with at least two days between diets. The diets will be:
1. Glucose (reference) 40 g dissolved in water,
2. Weet Bix (amount providing 40 g available carbohydrate)
3. Gold kiwifruit (200 g, containing about 20 g cabohydrate)
4. Green kiwifruit (200 g, containing about 20 g cabohydrate)
5. Weet-Bix substituted on an equal glycaemic carbohydrate basis by 200 g Hayward kiwifruit (Total carbohydrate intake 40 g; Kiwifruit 200 g, Weet-Bix 30.9 g, water 120 ml)
6. Weet-Bix substituted on an equal glycaemic carbohydrate basis by 200 g Sungold kiwifruit (Total carbohydrate intake 40 g; Kiwifruit 200 g, Weet-Bix 27.06 g, water 120 ml).

Subjects will be asked to consume diets after an overnight fast and the blood glucose response to the diets will be measured as changes from baseline in blood glucose concentrations measured by finger-prick capillary blood glucose analysis. The procedure is standard in measurement of the glycaemic index of foods. The subjects will consume two diets per week over a period of three weeks.

    <concealment>Subjects will be recruited by email and flyer, followed by an interview and explanation of the study. They will be provided with the information sheet to read. Those who would like to take part in the study will be asked to sign the informed consent form and then further screened for immediate glucose tolerance by response to an oral glucose dose, and evidence of long term glucose intolerance by measurement of HbA1c levels. 
The subjects will be assigned an identification number, including those who fail the screening procedure.
Subjects who pass the screening procedure will be allocated numbers.

Each subject received all treatments in random order. The recruiter was unaware of the treatment order for each individual at time of recruiting.
</concealment>
    <sequence>The order of the diets for each subject (n=15-20) will be determined by 15-20 computer randomisations of the numbers 1-6.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Groups will be compared in terms of response amplitude, time to baseline and incremental area under the blood glucose response curve by comparison of treatments. A registered statistician at Plant &amp; Food Research will conduct the statistical analysis.
Subject numbers were based on the number specified in the standard protocol for GI determination and on a recent trial of the effects of kiwifruit on blood glucose in which n = 20 was enough to detect significant differences between diets.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomised repeated measures trial in which the interventions are a glucose reference, Hayward and Sungold kiwifruit, WeetBix breakfast cereal, and the breakfast cereal partially substituted by kiwifruit. The subjects (n = 15-20) will each receive all treatments with at least two days between treatments. They will be asked to consume each diet after an overnight fast and capillary blood glucose samples will be taken at intervals over a three hour period to allow a blood glucose response curve to be established, from which several characteristics of the response will be determined.</summary>
