  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>OBJECTIVE: Compare the effect of the use of two types of arch supports (customized and prefabricated) on the behavior of plantar weight load and osteomuscular symptoms in assembly line workers. METHODS: A randomized trial was carried out with 27 female workers who worked in an orthostatic position, with a mean age of 30.3 ± 7.09 years and weight of 64.85 ± 13.65 Kg, and had osteomuscular symptoms. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was administered and plantar pressure was determined using a computerized baropodometric system (FootWork). The sample was then divided into control group, which wore pre-fabricated arch supports, and intervention group, with wore ethylvinylacetate arch supports during eight weeks. Baropodometric data were collected and the questionnaire was administered again.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the comparison between groups and baropodometric data. However, a change was noted in the behavior of the load variables between evaluations, with an increase in mean load pressure and maximal plantar pressure (p&lt;0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between groups for any anatomical site in the different evaluations. Within each group, there was a reduction in foot pain and back pain between evaluations (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Both types of arch support reduced pain symptoms in the lumbar region and feet. After eight weeks of use, there was an increase in maximal and mean plantar pressure and a reduction in plantar surface area with both types of arch support.</summary>
