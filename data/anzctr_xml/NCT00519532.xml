  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in UPDRS III Score at Week 13 (End of Maintenance) - The Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale Part III is an accepted and validated scale for the assessment of motor function in Parkinson´s disease. Each of the elements in the UPDRS III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities.
Baseline is defined as first titration visit (T1) of SP915.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (baseline SP915) and week 13 (End of maintenance)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) at Week 13 (End of Maintenance) - The Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) is a questionnaire with 15 questions to assess sleep and nocturnal disability in Parkinson´s disease. The item- scores range between 0= never and 4= very often.
Baseline is defined as Visit 2 of previous double- blind trial SP889.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (baseline SP889 NCT00474058) and week 13 (End of maintenance)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Nocturnal Akinesia, Dystonia, and Cramps Score (NADCS) at Week 13 (End of Maintenance) - Subjects were asked to assess nocturnal akinesia, dystonia and cramps, using an ordinal severity scale. While a score of 0= normal and 4= maximal severity, subjects could also rate their symptoms with values of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5. The nocturnal akinesia score was used to evaluate motor performance while the dystonia and cramps scores were used to evaluate sleep.
Baseline is defined as Visit 2 of previous double- blind trial SP889.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (baseline SP889 NCT00474058) and week 13 (End of maintenance)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Number of Nocturias at Week 13 (End of Maintenance) - The change in number of nocturias was used to evaluate improvements in sleep disorders.
Baseline is defined as Visit 2 of previous double- blind trial SP889.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (baseline SP889 NCT00474058) and week 13 (End of maintenance)</timepoint>

    <summary>The objective of this open-label extension is to assess the long-term effect of the 24-hour
      transdermal delivery of rotigotine on motor function, sleep quality, and nocturnal and
      non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The long-term safety and tolerability of the
      rotigotine transdermal patch will also be evaluated.</summary>
