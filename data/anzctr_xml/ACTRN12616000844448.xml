  <interventions>
    <interventions>The electromechanical gait trainer (GT) is a gait training machine which uses 2 driven footplates to simulate the phases of gait. Participants would be put into this GT by two therapy assistants. 
The GT group received 45 minutes of physiotherapy 6 times per week for 8 weeks, comprising 20 minutes of GT training, 5 minutes of stance/gait training, 10 minutes of standing and 10 minutes of cycling. 
10 minutes of standing and 10 minutes of cycling were assisted by two TAs with the help of an alarm clock. 
Each stance and gait training session was structured to be 5 minutes. It was delivered face-to-face individually by an experienced physiotherapist with at least 5 years of working experience in the neurological field. A progression of task difficulty in terms walking and dynamic standing balance was tailored to suit participants' capability.
There were no intervention adherence assessments by external parties.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost effectiveness
Relative cost effectiveness of one treatment over the other was assessed as the difference in costs between treatments divided by the difference in health status outcomes between treatments.
Given the equivalence of clinical effectiveness, a cost-minimisation analysis was conducted to determine the most cost-effective option.
The cost of each treatment was calculated by identifying and estimating the staff and equipment costs required to undertake each procedure.

      <outcome>Functional ambulatory Categories.
This is a measure of gait ability. It is graded from 0 (non-ambulant) to 5 (independent ambulation). The participants walked a 15-m distance. If appropriate they will negotiate a short staircase with a rail.</outcome>

      <outcome>Modified Barthel Index
This measures general independence in activity of daily function consisting of 10 items such as transfers, ambulation and stair climbing. It has a minimum score of 0 (completely dependent) to 100 (completely independent)</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomization to the 2 parallel groups ( GT and conventional physiotherapy) was performed in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated sequence of random numbers. An independent department generated the random group allocation sequence and transferred the sequence to a series of serially numbered opaque envelopes, which were not opened and revealed until after acceptance into the study and the baseline tests, therefore ensuring allocation concealment</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A Generalised Linear Model (Generalised Estimating Equations) analysis was carried out. 
The study was powered for the primary outcome measure in the clinical effectiveness study (Chua et al. 2016): the proportions of patients in each group attaining a Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) &gt;4, which represents independent ambulation with or without aids. Using an alpha of 0.05, a beta of 0.2 and data derived from Pohl et al (2007) on the FAC, a power analysis suggested a sample size of 42 in each group.  Allowing for 20% drop-out, the target size for each group was 53 patients. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is some evidence that electromechanical gait trainers (GT) combined with conventional physiotherapy may have equivalent or better efficacy than conventional physiotherapy alone when retraining ambulation in sub-acute stroke patients. However, no studies have measured effects on quality of life or health status, nor have they evaluated cost effectiveness
This study thus aimed to compare the efficacy and cost effectiveness of electromechanical gait trainers (GT) combined with conventional physiotherapy than conventional physiotherapy alone when retraining ambulation in sub-acute stroke patients. </summary>
