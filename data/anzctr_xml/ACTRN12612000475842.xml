  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 12 week home-based unsupervised progressive resistance exercise program that requires no additional equipment for participants. The exercise intervention will be administered by telephone calls from the principal researcher at 4 timepoints (Week 1, 3, 6 and 9) over the duration of the intervention.

Participants have the program individually tailored to suit the strength and endurance of their calf muscle in consultation with the principal researcher who is a RN and Accredited Exercise Physiologist.

The exercise protocol is split into 3 stages
1. Seated heel raises
2. Standing heel raises (both legs)
3. Standing heel raise (one leg)

The participants progress through each stage by the various 4 levels
1. 10 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day
2. 15 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day
3. 20 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day
4. 25 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day

Participants move on to the next level or stage the once they have comfortably completed the current level for at least 3 days or until ready to progress based on their feedback and in consultation with the principal researcher.

The exercise program is in addition to usual care (compression bandaging and wound care) 

Particpipants will also be encouraged to walk at least three times per week for 30 minutes if possible (can be broken into 10 minutes three times) in conjunction with the resistance program outlined above. Walking recommendations will be progressive and individualised.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care - compression bandaging and wound care dressed by the clinical wound nurse in wound clinic at the participating hospital and general exercise advice given from the wound nurses in the clinic. The participants in the usual care group will receive a brochure about the importance of exercise for adults with venous leg ulcers and a pedometer so that they can observe the amount to steps they take on a daily basis.</comparator>
