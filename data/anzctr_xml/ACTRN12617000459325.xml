  <interventions>
    <interventions>This 12-month randomised controlled trial is designed to determine if the addition of telephone and text message support to a community based obesity management program improves lifestyle intervention adherence and clinical outcomes when compared to standard care. The additional support will be grounded in behaviour change theory, with a range of behavioural treatment strategies targeted, including: goal setting, self-monitoring, motivational interviewing, problem solving, relapse prevention, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring and self-reinforcement. This study will be conducted within the ACT Health Obesity Management Service (OMS). Participants will receive standard OMS care (control group) or standard OMS care plus six-months of additional telephone and text message support (tech-support). Telephone calls will be provided monthly throughout the six-month intervention period (maximum of six calls). A range of behavioural treatment strategies will be targeted within these calls, and participants will be guided to set two-three S.M.A.R.T goals to work toward over the following month. Potential strategies to achieve these goals will be discussed, including problem solving and self-monitoring. The information gathered within these telephone calls will be used to tailor and individualise the subsequent month of text messages. Three text messages will be sent each week, aimed to remind or prompt participants to strive toward their goals, as well as foster a sense of support and accountability. Wording of text messages will be tailored to individuals based on their chosen goals, identified barriers and strategies to overcome them, preparatory behaviours to achieve their goals and self-monitoring strategies. The primary investigator (Accredited Practicing Dietitian and Accredited Exercise Physiologist) will conduct all telephone calls at a time mutually convenient to both parties. Telephone calls will be roughly 15-20 minutes in duration. Text messages will be manually written every month following the participants telephone call and sent on an automated timer using a software program. A research assistant may be employed to assist with the intervention, pending the speed of rolling recruitment. If this does occur, fidelity checklists will be prepared for telephone calls, text messages and face-to-face assessment appointments. Checklists for each session will specify (a) prescribed/ scripted session content and (b) proscribed session content. All research assistants will be thoroughly orientated to the requirements. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive standard OMS care. The OMS is a referral-based service that aims to support adults with Class III obesity (BMI &gt;40kg/m2) to improve their health and wellbeing. The OMS is run by a multidisciplinary team, including medical officers, registered nurses, dietitians and a psychologist and exercise physiologist. The holistic weight management program includes group and individualised support, including a 4-session education group, allied health consultations, medical follow-up and a 12-week exercise program where appropriate. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dietary adherence - measured using changes in dietary habits via the Fat and Fibre Behaviour Questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses eating habits over the previous month. Eleven items relate to consumption of high fat or fibre foods, and the remaining nine items ask about behaviours related to cooking, eating or choice of foods. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical activity adherence - measured by change in total minutes of physical activity per week and/or change in total steps per week using accelerometers worn for seven consecutive days, accompanied by a seven-day physical activity diary. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 months and 12 months </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Program attendance/attrition - obtained using the ACT patient administration system (ACTPAS), as well as clarification with the patients obesity management service case manager. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight - measured without shoes using a digital scale accurate to 0.1kg. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Eating self-efficacy - measured using the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire  Short Form (WEL-SF), an eight item self-report measure used to assess changes in weight management self-efficacy, with high scores reflecting self-confidence for controlling eating behaviour in particular situations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Motivational readiness - measured using stage of change for dietary behaviours and physical activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exercise self-efficacy - measured using the Physical Activity Assessment Inventory (PAAI). The PAAI is a 13-item scale that asks respondents to rate how confident they are that they can perform their usual physical activity in a variety of circumstances.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reducing the prevalence of obesity remains a major public health challenge, demanding effective, broad-scale interventions to support weight management and health behaviour change. The intensive approach seen within academic lifestyle intervention programs is effective, but requires considerable resources, including time, money and the availability of multiple health professionals with expertise in the behavioural treatment of obesity. It may therefore be considered too burdensome and expensive to be sustainable in a community environment. In order to translate the success of academic lifestyle interventions into community settings, we must explore innovative ways to adapt these approaches, while still maintaining the key features that led to their success. Offering patient-provider support via mobile technology offers a potential way to reduce face-to-face contact, thereby lowering the cost, time and burden of obesity management programs. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of providing technology-delivered extended contact interventions to support weight maintenance after the completion of a lifestyle intervention program. However to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to explore the use of technology as an adjunctive tool to support a community-based obesity management program. This 12-month randomised controlled trial is designed to determine if the addition of telephone and text message support to a community based obesity management program improves lifestyle intervention adherence and clinical outcomes when compared to standard care. Participants within the intervention group will receive monthly telephone calls and individualised text message support for a period of six months in addition to standard care within a community based obesity management program. The additional support will be grounded in behaviour change theory, with a range of behavioural treatment strategies targeted, including: goal setting, self-monitoring, motivational interviewing, problem solving, relapse prevention, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring and self-reinforcement. Outcome measures include diet and physical activity adherence, program attendance/attrition, weight loss, diet and physical activity self-efficacy and motivational readiness. </summary>
