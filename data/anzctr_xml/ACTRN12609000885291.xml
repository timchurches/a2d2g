  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive 'one on one' standard smoking cessation advice by a pharmacist.  This will comprise of them receiving a Pharmacy Self Care card on Smoking (a health information card from the Pharmacy Self Care Program of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia) and verbal counselling from the pharmacist.  They will be asked to complete a Baseline questionnaire.  Then they will also be photographed and their images digitally aged, as a smoker and non-smoker, using APRIL Age software and invited to view the age-processed images. (They will receive a copy of their digitally aged photos to keep).  All of this will be done once only (baseline) and will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The broad aim of this study is to deliver a personalised smoking cessation intervention within a community pharmacy setting.  The specific aims are to test the efficacy of an intervention based on personalised, vivid illustrations of 'smoker's face' on quitting, quit attempts or 'state of change' progression attitudes among young smokers (18-30 years old).
The study hypothesis:
If quit attempts or state of change progression attitudes are related to personalised smoking photo-ageing pictures, then exposing young smokers (18-30 years old) to their smoking photo aged picture in community pharmacies will result in higher rates of quit attempts or state of change progression attitudes.</summary>
