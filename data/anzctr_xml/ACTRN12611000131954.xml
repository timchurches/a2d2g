  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eleven healthy elderly individuals (both genders, 70+/-5 years) performed a exercise program twice a week for 12 weeks. Each 60 minutes session included 20 minutes of walking at 50-70% of maximal heart rate followed by resistive exercises for lower body muscle groups with level set at 65% of 10 repetition maximum (10-RM) for the first four weeks, 70% for the next four weeks and 75% for the last four weeks. The sessions were administred to 10-15 people group by a physiotherapist and 2 students from the course in physical therapy. The variables were measured before, each 4 weeks during training and 4 weeks after training by 6 minute walk test, blood pressure and heart rate before, immediately after, 5 and 10 minutes after the test.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: Evaluate the effects of the association of resistive and aerobic exercises training on cardiovascular responses in elderly. Methods: Eleven subjects (both genders, 70Â±5 years) performed twice a week walking and resistive exercises for lower body muscle groups for twelve weeks. The variables were measured before; each four weeks during training and four weeks detraining by six minute walk test, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) before, immediately after, five and 10 minutes after the test.</summary>
