    <interventions>Behavioural parent training: 1-2-3 Magic: Effective Discipline for Children 2-12 Program.
Parents attended three intervention sessions over subsequent weeks (2 hours per session) and a booster session (one and a half hours) four weeks later.  The three intervention sessions involved watching the 1-2-3 Magic DVD's, therapist input and group discussions.  The booster session was a group discussion. 

The intervention  sessions coverered selected segments from the two 1-2-3 Magic DVD's, 1-2-3 Magic: Managing Difficult Behavior in Children 2-12 and More 1-2-3 Magic: Encouraging Good Behavior, Independence and Self-Esteem.

Both DVD's included explanations of the parenting training techniques and their application in various home and public settings.  Both DVDs featured role-play vignettes showing maladaptive parent-child interactions followed by vignettes demonstrating the corrective, more adaptive style of parent-child interaction. Total time viewing the DVDs across the three intervention sessions was 163 minutes.

Throughout the three intervention sessions the therapist explained and revised the salient concepts shown in the 1-2-3 Magic DVD's and answered participants' questions.  

The booster session provided participants with an opportiunity to have any queries they had about the program answered.  It also provided participants with an opportunity to share their experiences in implementing the 1-2-3 Magic Program.  Participation in the group discussion was a free choice.  Group size - maximum 29.  </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The 123-Magic parenting program provides strategies for parents with children aged 2-12 to reduce children's undesirable behaviours, such as temper tantrums. The program is taught to parents by a number of social services and practitioners but has not yet been formally evaluated in Australia for use with children diagnosed with ADHD.  

Aim:
Evaluation of the original 1-2-3 Magic DVD-based program for use with children diagnosed with ADHD, in comparison to a control group.

Significance:
The 1-2-3 Magic program has been taught to parents throughout Australia; however, the effectiveness of the program for use with children diagnosed with ADHD has not been evlauated in Australia.   

Expected reaserch outcome:
It is expected that the techniques shown in the 1-2-3 Magic DVD will be of benefit to parents in reducing children's undesirable behaviours (i.e., children diagnosed with ADHD).
