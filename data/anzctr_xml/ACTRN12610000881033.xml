    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and he/she or a parent/guardian (in case of children) consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and chloroquine for plasmodium vivax in Kyaing Tone (Eastern Shan State).
Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in Myanmar to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and chloroquine for the treatment of  Plasmodium vivax.

The participants will be febrile people above 13 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum. Patients will be treated with artemether-lumefantrine twice a day over 3 days or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over 3 days or chloroquine over 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Myanmar in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum and vivax malaria.</summary>
