  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will investigate whether the ABCD Parenting Young Adolescents Program assists parents to promote a range of factors known to protect adolescents from experiencing poor health outcomes and that delay or reduce their involvement in dangerous risk taking activities such as alcohol and other drugs. Specifically, the project will investigate whether participation in ABCD results in: improvements in parent-adolescent relationships; reductions in parent-adolescent conflicts; improvements in adolescent behaviour and improvements in parental confidence and wellbeing.</summary>
