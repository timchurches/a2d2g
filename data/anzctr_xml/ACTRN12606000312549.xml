  <interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A computer generated table of random numbers will be used. Even numbers will denote allocation to the control group and odd numbers to the intervention group. Allocations to either group based on the table of random numbers will be written on a piece of paper and sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelop by an individual with no connection to the trial. As families are enrolled in the trial, the research assistant will obtain information on allocation from the envelopes in sequential order.</concealment>
