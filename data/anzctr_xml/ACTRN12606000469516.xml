  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be randomly assigned to a placebo or intervention group.                                                                                                                                                                                 Subjects will take flaxseed lignan orally 100mg/day for a period of 12 weeks.
The lignan supplement contains 48% Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (lignan precursors), 27% calcium hydrogen phosphate, 19% microcrystalline cellulose, 0.5% hydrogenated vegetable oil, 0.5% stearic acid, 1%magnesium stearate, 2% crospovidone, 2% colloidal silica anhydrous.  All tablets are coated in opadry clear PI4029. The only active ingredient in the lignan supplement is Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.</interventions>
    <comparator>Orally placebo for a period of 12 weeks. The placebo tablets contain the same ingredients as the lignan supplements without the Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Data suggests that foods high in lignan precursors are plausibly associated with a lower risk of sex-hormone-related cancers; however the human evidence for this is not strong. Currently, no direct assessment of dietary consumption of lignans and breast cancer risk is available.

The objectives of the proposed research are:

	To directly assess dietary consumption of flaxseed lignans and breast cancer risk.
	To assess urinary lignan concentration and correlate with sex hormone binding globulin concentration and concentration of free estradiol.
	To examine the effects of flaxseed lignans as a dietary constituent on hormonal status in vivo.
	To control flaxseed lignan dietary intake and measure levels enterolactone from matairesinol and enterodiol from secoisolariciresinol in urine to improve understanding for use in epidemiological studies where they may be used as biomarkers of cancer risk.

Research Questions

This research will attempt to answer the following questions:
1.	What effects does controlled dietary consumption of lignans have on hormonal status?
2.	What effect does controlled lignan dietary consumption have on enterolactone from matairesinol and enterodiol from secoisolariciresinol in urine?
3.	What effect does controlled lignan dietary consumption have on hormonal breast cancer risk markers?
4.	How long does it take for dietary consumption of lignans to have an effect on hormonal status?</summary>
