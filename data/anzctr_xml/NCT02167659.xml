    <interventions>Treatment: devices - 23-32 mmHg compression sleeve with gauntlet

Experimental: BIS Assessment - Patients will undergo measurements by trained staff. Measurements will be performed pre-op and at 3, 6, 12, 15*, 18, 21*, 24, and 36 months post-op. Measures include L-Dex, skin assessment and self-report forms. Patients with &lt; 6.5 L-Dex units change will continue follow-up for 36 months. Patients with an L-Dex value change = 6.5 will undergo circumference measurement and begin treatment for 4 weeks with a 23-32 mmHg compression sleeve with gauntlet. At the end of 4 weeks patients will have their arms measured. Those demonstrating improvement will continue with follow up. Those not demonstrating improvement will be removed from the study and their medical oncologist or surgeon will be notified.

Active Comparator: Tape Measure - Patients will undergo measurements by trained staff. Measurements will be performed pre-op and at 3, 6, 12, 15*, 18, 21*, 24, and 36 months post-op. Measures include arm volume (tape measure), skin assessment and self-report forms. Patients with no volume increase will continue follow-up for 36 months. Patients with a volume change of between = 5% and &lt; 10% in the at-risk limb will undergo L-Dex testing and begin treatment for 4 weeks with a 23-32 mmHg compression sleeve with gauntlet. At the end of 4 weeks patients will have their arms measured. Those demonstrating improvement will continue with follow up. Those not demonstrating improvement will be removed from the study and their medical oncologist or surgeon will be notified.

Treatment: devices: 23-32 mmHg compression sleeve with gauntlet
A compression intervention consisting of a sleeve and gauntlet with 23-32mm of tension worn for four weeks that is initiated based on a BIS L-Dex change that is =6.5 units higher than pre-surgical baseline measure, or a tape measurement guided volume change in the affected arm that is between =5% and &lt;10% above pre-surgical baseline.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Based upon the current state of science, the investigators are proposing to conduct a
      randomized clinical trial in which participants are randomized post-surgery to either BIS or
      circumferential (tape) measurements for follow-up arm measurements. When patients in the BIS
      group have an L-Dex change that is =6.5 units higher than the pre-surgical baseline measure,
      and when patients in the tape measurement group have a volume change in the at-risk arm that
      is between = 5% and &lt;10% above pre-surgical baselines (without similar change in non-at-risk
      arm), both will receive four weeks of 23-32 mm compression sleeve and gauntlet therapy.</summary>
