    <interventions>Drinking milk containing added casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) at concentrations of: 0.2% weight per volume (w/v) and 0.3% (w/v) once a day for 15 consecutive weekdays each.

    <concealment>The institution will be provided with the products in coded packages. Participants will be enrolled after they have fulfilled inclusion criiteria and do not have any of the medical or dental conditions that would exclude them from the study. They will sign a written consent form before participating. Allocation of products to participants will be random. Each participant will be given a coded plastic bag each day containing fresh refigerated milk allocated to them. The code and, therefore, the sequence of treatments will be unknown to researchers and participants. In the case of a medical emergency, the code can be accessed for a single participant without breaking the blinding for other participants.
participants will drink one of the milks for 15 days then rest from the study for one week before repeating the exercise drinking another randomly allocated milk. This will again be repeated a third time until each participant has consumed all three milks for 15 days each with two one-week washout periods between.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare the  repair of early tooth decay after drinking with three milks, each containing different amounts of added casein, (which is a major component of milk), once a day for 15 days. Subjects will wear a custom-made removable plastic denture-like appliance  that will each hold four pieces of pre-sterilized human tooth enamel containing early decay that has been artificially-created in the laboratory. On each of 15 consecutive weekdays, subjects will be given a coded bag containing their allocated milk to use that day by the research team. They will be instructed to pour out 100 mL of the milk from the bag into a plastic measuring cup (supplied). They will then rinse their mouths with tap water and rinse their appliance with distilled filtered water (supplied). They will then insert their appliance and drink all 100 mL of the milk by taking 5-8 sips over 30 seconds. They will then continue to wear their appliance for a total of 40 minutes. After the 40 minutes they will remove their appliance, rinse it with distilled filtered water and clean it, avoiding the enamel pieces as instructed, with a fluoride free denture paste (supplied). They will again rinse the appliance with distilled filtered water and store it in a humid container (supplied) at room temperature until required again. After 15 days' drinking one of the milks, subjects will rest from the study for a week before repeating the exercise with another milk as before. Subjects will repeat this again until they have consumed all three milks.
All milk will be stored at 4 degrees Celsius in a secure refigerator in the research department and milk will not be consumed if it has been stored for more than 60 days after its manufacture date. Subjects will also be instructed to consume their milk within 30 minutes of it being removed from the refrigerator and given to them by the research team. 
Subjects will brush their teeth with a fluoride toothpaste at least one hour before first inserting their appliance each day and also once at night. When wearing their appliance, subjects will not eat or drink anything other than drink their allocated milk. Otherwise, subjects will maintain their normal oral hygiene and dietary habits throughout the study.
The hypotheses for this study are:  
1) drinking milk containing added casein results in significantly greater repair of decay than drinking milk without added casein;
2) repair of decay after drinking milk with the highest amount of added casein is significantly greater than repair of decay after drinking with milk containing the lower amount of added casein.</summary>
