  <interventions>
    <interventions>The contact lenses being studied are prototype soft contact lenses made from Etafilcon A material. The lenses differ only in their power profile - all are made from the same material. The contact lens powers will range from +3.00 to -6.00D in 0.25 steps for non presbyopes and for presbyopes from +3.00 to -6.00D in 0.25 steps for low, mid and high adds (range from +0.75 to +2.50D).

Participants will test 1 pair of prototype soft contact lenses. Lenses will be inserted bilaterally on the participant by the investigating optometrist, and worn for a maximum of 1 hour. A minimum of an overnight wash out period will be required between the lens visits.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will test one commercially available contact lens as a control. The control lens is Acuvue Oasys for Presbyopia for the presbyopic group and 1-Day Acuvue Moist for the non-presbyopic group. Lenses will be inserted bilaterally on the participant by the investigating optometrist, and worn for a maximum of 1 hour. A minimum of an overnight wash out period will be required between the lens visits.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the visual performance of the prototype contact lens designs compared to the commercial equivalent.

Visual acuity will be assessed at distance and near with a computerised LogMAR chart and an ETDRS 2000 series logarithmic visual acuity chart respectively.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 1 hour of inserting each lens design. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective ratings of vision of participants while wearing the contact lenses using a 1-10 scale questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 1 hour of inserting each lens design. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent.
Be at least 7 years old, male or female.
Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator.
Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses.
Correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better with both eyes with contact lenses.
Be suitable and willing to wear contact lenses.

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjögrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. 
NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Contraindications to contact lens wear.
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The planned number of participants is 30 per group, which will be recruited by enrolling a minimum of 30 participants in each group.  Enrolment will take place over 1 month.

Participants will be screened for general clinical trial suitability by way of a routine eye examination which includes refraction, visual acuity and general eye health.  Informed consent will be obtained prior to any clinical trial procedures. Both experienced CL wearers and neophytes (participants with no prior lens wear experience) will be enrolled into lens wear. 

Participants will be allocated to a group depending on whether they are a presbyope or non-presbyope. Participants will then be allocated contact lenses based on their refractive error. The order of the contact lens wear will be randomised. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation plan will be generated from http://www.randomization.com/. The website's second random generator will be usd to create a random permutation of all lens types for each participant. A randomisation list will be generated by the biostatistician and applied through the Clinic Data Management system.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Approximately 30 participants per strata are required in order to demonstrate a statistically significant paired difference in the primary objective of 0.1±0.15 LogMAR VA between test and control lens types at the 5% level of significance with 90% power. This sample of 30 will also have 80% power to demonstrate a statistically significant paired difference in the secondary objective of 1±1.8 in subjective vision ratings between test and control lens types at the 5% level of significance. The sample size is adjusted for a 10% drop out rate. </statisticalmethods>
