  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, bilateral, open-label, randomised clinical trial with participants wearing one of 4 commercially available contact lenses (AIR OPTIX [Trade mark] Aqua, NIGHT &amp; DAY [Registered trade mark], ACUVUE OASYS [Trade mark], PureVision [Trade mark]) in conjunction with an investigational contact lens care solution over a 3 month period on a daily wear basis. 
Participants will be randomised to wear one of 4 commercially available contact lenses. There are visits at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months from initial lens fitting. Contact lens cases will be collected at the 1 month and 3 months visits for analysis.
each contact lens group will have a minimum of 40 participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control for the outcomes of ocular comfort and ocular response will be standard care, while historical data will be used for the contact lens contamination outcome</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective ocular comfort with various lenses and investigational contact lens care solution. Subjective ocular comfort will be measured via questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months of contact lens wear</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ocular response with various lenses and investigational contact lens care solution. Ocular response will be measured using a slit-lamp biomicroscope.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months of contact lens wear</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Contamination rate of contact lens cases used with investigational solution compared to historical data. The historical data consists of data collected from previous clinical trials run at the Institute for Eye Research from 2005-2009</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month and 3 months of contact lens wear</timepoint>

-Is correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses;
-May be experienced or inexperienced at wearing contact lenses</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
-Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
-Use of, or a need for, concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the study;
-Use of, or a need for, any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse manner or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the study; 
N.B. Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used -prophylactically during the trial
-Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
-Previous corneal refractive surgery;
-Contraindications to contact lens wear;
-Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the study products;
-Currently enrolled in another clinical trial;
-Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for dispensing studies and 48 hours -between in-house studies;
Pregnancy*; 

The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, exclude anyone who they believe may not be able to fulfil the study requirements, or if it is believed to be in the participants best interests.

*Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient</exclusivecriteria>
