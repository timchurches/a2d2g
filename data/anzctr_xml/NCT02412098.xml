  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All participants:

          -  Be a nonsmoker or consume &lt; 20 cigarettes per day

          -  Have a calculated body mass index (BMI) from 18 to 36 kg/m^2, inclusive, at study
             screening

          -  Have a creatinine clearance (CrCl) = 60 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault method)
             based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at screening

          -  Have either a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or one with abnormalities that
             are considered clinically insignificant by the investigator

          -  Screening labs within defined thresholds

        Participants with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment must also meet the following
        additional inclusion criteria:

          -  Must have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), stable hepatic impairment with no
             clinically significant changes within 3 months (90 days) prior to study drug
             administration (Day 1)

          -  Individuals with severe hepatic impairment must have a score on the
             Child-Pugh-Turcotte scale of 10-15 at screening. If an individual's score changes
             during the course of the study, the score at screening will be used for
             classification.

          -  Individuals with moderate hepatic impairment must have a score on the
             Child-Pugh-Turcotte scale of 7-9 at screening. If an individual's score changes during
             the course of the study, the score at Screening will be used for classification.

          -  Individuals with mild hepatic impairment must have a score on the Child-Pugh-Turcotte
             scale of 5-6 at screening. If an individual's score changes during the course of the
             study, the score at screening will be used for classification.</inclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of a single oral
      dose of eleclazine in participants with normal and impaired hepatic function. Participants in
      the healthy control group will be matched to participants with impaired hepatic function by
      age (± 5 years), gender, and body mass index (± 10%).</summary>
