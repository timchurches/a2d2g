  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the antiviral efficacy of triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) therapy (ie. amantadine and ribavirin and oseltamivir) compared to oseltamivir in immunocompromised subjects diagnosed with Influenza A.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects who enter with mild to moderate influenza and progress to severe influenza during randomized study treatment. Severe influenza as defined by the following.
Oxygen saturation less than or equal to 92% on room air or
Severe Tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than or equal to 30 for all ages greater than or equal to 12 years)
New Infiltrate on chest X-ray (or any infiltrate if no prior chest X-ray or not known)</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects with a treatment-sensitive influenza A strain at baseline who develop a resistant strain during treatment, as measured by in vitro and genotypic assays.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 2, Day 4, Day 6, Day 8, Day 10, Day 15, Day 20.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability (adverse events (AEs), AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation, and Serious AEs) as measured through study physical assessment and laboratory analyses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 2, Day 4, Day 6, Day 8, Day 10, Day 15, Day 20, Day 38.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effect of triple combination anti viral drug (TCAD) in influenza infection in immunocompromised subjects. TCAD may potentially produce a greater reduction in viral load in these subjects and potentially block drug resistance therefore reducing morbidity in influenza A infection in immunocompromised subjects.</summary>
