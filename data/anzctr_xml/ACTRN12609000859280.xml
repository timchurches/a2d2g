  <interventions>
    <interventions>Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) relaxes vascular smooth muscle by activating guanyl cyclase and leading to the production of cyclic GMP (guanosine monophosphate).

Infants received multiple randomized doses of iNO from 5 to 80 ppm until weaned if effective. Maximum treatment days ranged from  3 days to 24 days. Frequencies and duration of doses varied between the 11 trials.</interventions>
    <comparator>Most studies used inhaled  oxygen or nitrogen gas or ventilatory support without iNO as the placebo gas. Maximum treatment days ranged from  3 days to 24 days. Frequencies and duration of doses varied between the 11 trials.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Several randomized controlled trials have been conducted in preterm infants to determine whether inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) reduces the rates of death and/or chronic lung disease. The results of these studies appear contradictory.  Some studies have shown a reduction in lung injury, one has shown a reduction in cerebral injury, and several others have shown no effect.  The different patient characteristics and different trial characteristics within these trials may explain this difference. 

The purpose of this systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis is to determine whether inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants receiving assisted ventilation improves survival without morbidity, specifically without chronic lung disease (CLD), cerebral injury, retinal injury, and improves survival without long-term disability.

Secondly to determine whether the effects of inhaled nitric oxide differ according to the risk profile of the patient in terms of gestational age at birth, severity of illness, antenatal steroid use, postnatal age at the time of randomization, ventilation mode at randomization, administration of exogenous surfactant, inhaled nitric dosage and duration of nitric oxide administration.</summary>
