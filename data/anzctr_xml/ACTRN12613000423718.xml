  <interventions>
    <interventions>Chemotherapy Days 1-28:
Cyclophosphamide once per day orally according to allocated dose level as per dose levels below.
Rapamycin orally at an initial dosage of 0.8mg/m2/dose twice per day. Dosing will be pharmacologically adjusted on a weekly basis to maintain a trough Rapamycin level between 10 and 15 ng/ml. 
Days 1,8,15: vinorelbine intravenously at allocated dose level as per dose levels below.
Repeat cycle every 28 days.

Dose Level 0 = 20 mg/m2/day of cyclophosphamide and 20 mg/m2/week days 1,8,15 of vinorelbine.

Dose Level 1 = 25 mg/m2/day of cyclophosphamide and 20 mg/m2/week days 1,8,15 of vinorelbine.

Dose Level 2 = 25 mg/m2/day of cyclophosphamide and 25 mg/m2/week days 1,8,15 of vinorelbine.

Dose Level -1 (if the first dose level "Dose Level 0" is not tolerated) = 15 mg/m2/day of cyclophosphamide and 10 mg/m2/week days 1,8,15 of vinorelbine.

Each cycle will be considered to be 28 days.  Proceed to 2nd and subsequent cycles if platelet counts are acceptable, all toxicities from previous treatment cycles have been resolved and there is no evidence of disease progression.  In the absence of tumour progression and/or unacceptable toxicities, the treatment cycles can continue at the treating doctors discretion. 

Sirolimus levels will be measured by blood tests. A take home medication diary will be used to record any take home tablets. 

Participants remain on the same allocated dose level throughout treatment. There is no dose escalation for individual patients. </interventions>

    <concealment>At study entry, all participants will be stratified according to their treatment history. Stratum 1 participants are those that are heavily pre-treated(have received chemotherapy within six months of study entry; have received prior nitrosourea or have received prior craniospinal radiation). Stratum 2 patients are those that are less heavily pre-treated (i.e. do not meet the afore-mentioned criteria for heavily treated. The treatment plan for both strata is identical, although outcome measures will be analysed separately for the two strata.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>The Rolling Six phase 1 trial design will be used for the conduct of this study. Two to six patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability data pending at the current dose level. Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The maximim tolerated dose will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycles 1-2 of therapy. In the event that two DLTs observed in 6 evaluable patients within a dose level are considered different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), expansion of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered if all of the following conditions are met: One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose-related, the Adverse Effects are readily reversible.
If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose-limiting toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.

All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment. Any patient who experiences DLT at any time during protocol therapy is considered evaluable for Adverse Events. Patients without DLT who receive at least 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol guidelines during Cycles 1 and 2 are also considered evaluable for Adverse Events. Patients who are not evaluable for Adverse Events during Cycle 1 and 2 will be replaced.
The Rolling Six phase 1 trial design will be used for the conduct of this study. Two to six patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the
number of patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability data pending at the current dose level. Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.

Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at risk for
developing a DLT (i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable for toxicity). For example, when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data is available for all three when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and the fourth participant is enrolled to the subsequent dose level. If data is not yet available for one or more of the first three participants and no DLT has been observed, or if one DLT has been observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if two or more DLTs have been observed, the dose level is de-escalated. This process is repeated for participants five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three participants, accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de-escalation rules have not been fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled onto the study.
Overall, a minimum of 12 (6 in each stratum) and a maximum of 48 (24 in each stratum) patients will be enrolled on this study. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of combining the 3 drugs, vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide, and Rapamycin, in children with recurrent/refractory malignant disease. Who is it for? You (or your child) may be eligible to join this study if you/they are aged less than 22 years of age and have been diagnosed with any of the following solid tumours/malignancies: all brain tumours, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Soft tissue sarcomas, Osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, Neuroblastoma, Wilms tumour. The disease must have either relapsed or not responded to initial therapy. Trial details All participants in this trial will undergo treatment with a combination of the three drugs vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide, and rapamycin. Cyclophosphamide is administered one per day orally, rapamycin is administered twice per day orally, and vinorelbine will be administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle intravenously (i.e. into the vein). This cycle will be repeated every 28 days. If the initial dose level is tolerated by patients, then it will be increased for the next patient group in order to determine the optimum dose combination for both heavily pre-treated and less heavily pre-treated participants. In addition to evaluating the toxicity of this drug regimen and determining a dosage range, the potential efficacy of the regimen will be assessed. All participants will be regularly monitored and assessed for a period of up to 5 years in order to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this treatment.
