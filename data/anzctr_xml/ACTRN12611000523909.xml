    <concealment>Before offering the treatment, the child will undergo a full physical examination (as is currently practised for Propranolol). An ECG and echocardiogram will be performed to exclude underlying left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (aortic stenosis and coartation of aorta). A blood sample is taken to exclude underlying renal failure.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Strawberry birthmark (haemangioma) grows rapidly during infancy before gradually shrinking in later childhood.  Rapidly growing haemangiomas can cause significant disfigurement and functional problems including threatened vision and life.  The child affected by problematic growing haemangioma is considered for this study because we believe that Captopril, given in small doses could dramatically shrink the birthmark such that surgery and/or laser therapy would not be needed later on. Captopril has been used in infants and children with high blood pressure for many years.  Our research suggests that Capopril will specifically target a particular type of cells in the haemangioma that are responsible for its rapid growth. In this study, we would start the child on small doses of Captopril, given by mouth. The medication is maintained until the birthmark is fully regressed or until 12 months of age</summary>
