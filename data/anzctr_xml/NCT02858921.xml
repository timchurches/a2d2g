    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Dabrafenib
Treatment: drugs - Trametinib
Treatment: drugs - Pembrolizumab

Experimental: Sequential D + T, THEN Pembrolizumab - Dabrafenib 150mg orally twice a day + Trametinib 2mg orally once a day for 2 weeks, then followed by treatment with Pembrolizumab 2mg/kg delivered intravenously at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 9, then once every 3 weeks from week 12 for 50 weeks.

Experimental: Concurrent D + T AND Pembrolizumab - Dabrafenib 150mg orally twice a day + Trametinib 2mg orally once a day + Pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for 52 weeks

Experimental: Pembrolizumab ONLY - Pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously once every 3 weeks alone for 52 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Dabrafenib
Dabrafenib, a 4-(3-aminosulfonylphenyl)-5-(pyrimidine-3-yl) thiazole, is a potent and selective inhibitor of B-RAF kinase activity with a mode of action consistent with adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibition, and is approved as monotherapy in BRAF V600E-mutant advanced/metastatic melanoma.

Treatment: drugs: Trametinib
Trametinib, a pyrido - pyrimidine derivative, is a potent and highly selective allosteric non-competitive inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2 activation and kinase activity has been approved as monotherapy in BRAF (V600E)-mutant and BRAF (V600K)-mutant melanoma.

Treatment: drugs: Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Histologically confirmed, resectable American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage
             IIIB, IIIC or IV (Tx, T0, T1-4, N1b, N2b, N2c, N3, M0) cutaneous melanoma or unknown
             primary melanoma with sufficient cutaneous, nodal or in-transit disease to enable
             multiple excisional or core biopsies (at baseline, week 1 and week 4). 'Resectable'
             tumours are defined as having no significant vascular, central nervous system or bony
             involvement. Only cases where a complete surgical resection with tumour-free margins
             can safely be achieved are defined as resectable. Patients who may not have sufficient
             disease to enable multiple biopsies at weeks 1 and 4 will not be excluded, however the
             intention of the study is that at least one biopsy at these time points is required.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria (= 10mm longest diameter
             for non-nodal lesions and / or = 15mm in shortest diameter for lymph nodes) within 4
             weeks of randomisation. 'Measurable' disease may be ascertained by CT or for cutaneous
             and superficial lesions, by caliper measurement with digital photography. CT preferred
             for all lesions where possible. PET imaging will be performed, but not used for the
             primary purpose of measuring response.

          -  BRAF V600 mutation positive on immunohistochemistry or a local molecular test (e.g.
             Oncofocus): a. A positive V600E immunohistochemistry stain at study entry should be
             formally quantified with a local molecular test following study entry (e.g.
             Oncofocus); b. Molecular BRAF mutation status should preferentially be confirmed using
             tissue taken from the presenting stage III / IV disease. Alternatively, archival
             primary tissue is also acceptable to confirm BRAF mutation status.
