  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Exercise training (ET) group will undergo a twice-weekly exercise training program a for a period of 8 weeks. The ET will be conducted in a group setting and will be individually prescribed, monitored and progressed by an experienced exercise physiologist or physiotherapist according to the protocol. The exercise training will consist of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at each session, comprising of 15 minutes each of stationary cycling and walking, either on the treadmill or along a corridor depending of the capability of the individual. The initial walking intensity will be set a speed that is 80% of the peak walking speed (km/hr) achieved on the 6minute walk test. The stationary cycling will be set at an intensity that will elicit a 3-4 on the BORG modified scale (0-10). Upper and lower limb resistance training (RT) exercises using dumbbell hand weights will also be included. Heart rate, SpO2 and shortness of breath will be monitored during each session. All exercise modalities will be progressed each week with the goal of achieving dyspnoea score of 3-4 on each occasion. Supplemental oxygen will be provided during training to maintain SpO2&gt;85%.

Once the subject is safely established on a supervised exercise regimen, an unsupervised home exercise program will be prescribed to achieve two additional home-based sessions per week. Home exercise will be monitored using an exercise diary and reviewed weekly by the supervising clinician. At the conclusion of the 8-week program, subjects will be encouraged to continue with an unsupervised home exercise program at least three times per week.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will not undergo any exercise training but will be contacted weekly by telephone to provide general support for the duration of the intervention period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are characterised by shortness of breath, progressive deterioration in exercise tolerance, poor quality of life and reduced life expectancy. To date there are few treatments which have demonstrated improvements in this patient group. Exercise training (ET) is one of few treatments to improve symptoms and QoL in ILD. However the response to ET is variable and dependent on disease type and severity. The aim of this study is to establish the effect of ET in ILD and to identify whether there is optimal timing for maximal benefit to be obtained. improvements in this patient group.</summary>
