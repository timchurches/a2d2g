  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to investigate the potential use of specific metrics in assessing
      the quality and optimising an individual's cochlear implant fitting. Assessment of the
      sensitivity and specificity of specific metrics that are potential predictors of inaccurate
      T-levels and C-levels is important to determining best methods for streamlined high quality
      fitting, providing the potential for feedback to the individual and clinic, as well as
      automated adjustments for optimisation. Ultimately the objective is to increase clinical
      capacity for managing both the installed base and new candidates for cochlear implantation.</summary>
