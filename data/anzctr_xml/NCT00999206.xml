          3. Able to adhere to visit schedules and all protocol required study procedures.

          4. Being in good health as determined by medical history, physical examination and
             clinical judgment of the investigator (subjects may have underlying illnesses such as
             hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease or hypothyroidism, as long as the
             disease is well controlled. If on medication for a condition, the medication dose must
             have been stable for at least 3 months preceding study vaccination).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion Criteria

          1. Influenza vaccination or laboratory confirmed influenza infection within six months
             preceding the date of study vaccination or planning an influenza vaccination during
             the three weeks after study vaccination (i.e. between study Day 1 and study Day 22).

          2. Presence of any significant condition that may prohibit inclusion as determined by the

    <summary>A phase 3 study to obtain additional safety and immunogenicity data on Solvay's cell-derived
      seasonal trivalent subunit influenza vaccine in adult and elderly subjects without
      significant illnesses and to demonstrate consistency of the immunogenicity of the three lots
      of the same vaccine, comparison of cell-derived vaccine to Solvay's egg-derived vaccine
      including assessment of non-inferior immunogenicity</summary>
