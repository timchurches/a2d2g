  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pediatric acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in
      critically ill patients. Currently, understanding of the epidemiology and diagnosis of AKI in
      children is limited by single center retrospective data and inconsistent diagnostic and
      stratification criteria. The hypotheses of the AWARE study is that 1) renal angina, a
      composite of early injury signs and risk of disease, will predict severe subsequent AKI in
      critically ill children and 2) the incorporation of urinary biomarkers into the renal angina
      scoring system will improve the prediction of the severe injury. The AWARE study is conducted
      to describe AKI epidemiology in a heterogeneous multinational cohort of critically ill
      children, characterize AKI risk factors and associated morbidity, and validate the KDIGO AKI
      criteria as a predictor of pediatric AKI outcomes. The multi-center, multi-national registry
      will create the largest ever repository of information available on AKI in children.</summary>
