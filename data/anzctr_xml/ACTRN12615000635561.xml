    <concealment>A randomization table was constructed by an independent statistician who supplied the randomization table to the Prince of Wales Hospital (POWH) Pharmacy Clinical trials Unit which is offsite to Neuroscience Research Australia. The POWH Pharmacy Clinical Trials Unit will maintain the double blind nature of the trial and assign a patient number and distribute the injection in a blinded manner to the nurse physician administering the injection. Upon disbursement of the (active or placebo) treatment, the Pharmacy will reconstitute the injection or placebo and provide the tape concealed and numbered vial to the investigators for injection.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>At present, there have been no studies of canakinumab in people with schizophrenia, thus a direct power analysis in relation to the effects of canakinumab on symptoms reduction and cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia is not available. However, we can use the effect sizes from studies of anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2, inhibitors) as an estimate of the effect size of canakinumab treatment on symptoms of schizophrenia. There are two published studies (Akhondzadeh S., et al. 2007, Schizophr Res 90:179-185; Muller N., et al. 2010, Schizophr Res 121:118-124) using COX-2 inhibitors to treat symptoms of schizophrenia that have reported effects on the total PANSS score and provide the relevant information (means and standard deviations) from which effect sizes can be calculated. The mean effect size on PANSS total scores from these two COX-2 inhibitor studies in schizophrenia was 1.07. Thus, we have determined that 30 individuals (15 per group) are necessary and sufficient to detect significant effects of canakinumab treatment on PANSS total scores based on our sample size analysis that shows 13.7 participants per group (27.4 total sample size) for a two-tailed significance test with an a level set at .05, d of 2.80, and an effect size of 1.07 for PANSS total score (Akhondzadeh S., et al. 2007; Muller N., et al. 2010) will be required to attain a power value of .80.

In determining the extent to which canakinumab improves psychotic symptoms and cognition, separate ANOVAs or ANCOVAs will be used for PANSS positive symptom score, PANSS negative symptom score, PANSS total score, and COWAT verbal (letter) fluency score to compare conditions (canakinumab versus placebo and/or baseline) with respect to treatment effects. The level of significance for this study will be set at p &lt; .05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study will use medication to try to improve language, memory, and symptoms in schizophrenia. This medication (called canakinumab) is used to reduce harmful by-products of infection. We hope to learn how this medication in addition to antipsychotic medication can improve thinking and reduce symptoms in people with schizophrenia and to determine if this medication can be used as a new treatment for thinking problems and symptoms in people with schizophrenia.</summary>
