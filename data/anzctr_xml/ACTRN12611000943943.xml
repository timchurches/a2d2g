  <interventions>
    <interventions>Many community rehabilitation programs manage access by placing patients on waiting lists, with clinicians taking on new pateints as appointments become available.  Triage categories are often assigned to guide clinicians as to who should be seen first.
This trial aims to evaluate an alternative model, in which all patients receive a face to face assessment within a few days of referral, through the use of protected assessment appointments.  Clinicians then take responsibility for triaging patient needs within their own clinical caseload.  The new model will be trialled for all new referrals received over a 6 month period.</interventions>

    <concealment>Very similar Community Rehabilitation Programs are in operation at two sites within Eastern Health.  The new model of care is being trialled at one (the Peter James Centre), with the Wantirna Health site continuing to provide care via the usual model.  Both also operate two teams, one for orthopaedic patients and one for neurology patients.
Patients referred to the orthopaedic team at the Peter James Centre are therefore in the intervention group, and those in the neurology team at Peter James or referred to Wantirna are in the control group.  Comparisons will also be made with baseline data from both sites collected in a previous observational study in 2010.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients referred to the community rehabilitation programs (CRPs) at the Peter James Centre (PJC) and Wantirna Health (WH) have traditionally been placed on a waiting list and given a triage category, which guides clinicians as to who should be seen first when demand exceeds supply.  This study is trialling an alternative model of triage within the orthopaedic team at the PJC CRP in which all patients are seen for a face to face assessment soon after referral, with a subsequent decision on priority and patient management made by the treating clinician.  The aim of the trial is to compare the outcomes with the traditional model at WH, and determine whether the new model improves waiting times without negatively impacting on the quality of service received, patient outcomes or staff and patient satisfaction</summary>
