  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prevalence of obesity is increasing. Contrary to popular belief, literature has shown that overweight and mildly obese have infact been shown to have increased survival benefit compared to normal weight in non-cardiac and cardiac conditions. All the studies that have reported this paradoxical relationship were based on BMI; BMI is not a measure of body fat. This study is to investigate the association between obesity and postoperative in-hospital adverse outcomes following elective cardiac surgery. Several measures of obesity will be compared including BMI, WC, HC, NC and WHR . We will also be measuring body frailty and its association with adverse outcomes. The patients will be followed up until 2 years through phone contact and registries.
