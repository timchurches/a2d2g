10. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks;
11. Study treatment both planned and able to start within 14 days of randomisation;
12. Willing and able to comply with all study requirements, including treatment, timing and/or nature of required assessments;

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Prior treatment with cetuximab or other drugs targeting the EGFR pathway, such as panitumumab, gefitinib , erlotinib; 2. Severe restrictive lung disease or radiological pulmonary findings of interstitial lung disease on the baseline chest CT which, in the opinion of the investigator, represents significant pathology; 3. Brain metastases that are either untreated, symptomatic, or which have not been stable for at least one month after treatment; 4. History of other malignancies except where treated with curative intent AND with no current evidence of disease AND considered not to be at risk of future recurrence; 5. Concurrent illness, including severe infection that may jeopardize the ability of the patient to undergo the procedures outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety; 6. Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule, including alcohol dependence or drug abuse; 7. Pregnancy, lactation, or inadequate contraception. Women must be post menopausal, infertile, or use a reliable means of contraception. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to registration. Men must have been surgically sterilised or use a (double if required) barrier method of contraception. </exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>The study population will consist of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with either KRAS WT or KRAS G13D mutation. Once a patient completed all screening procedures and is confirmed eligible the will be randomised to either cetuximab monptherapy ( Arm A) or cetuximab in combination with irinotecan ( Arm B) . Randomisation will either be done via the electronic case report form ( INFORM) or via telephone randomisation with the NHMRC clinical trials centre.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have metastatic colorectal cancer and have either a KRAS wild type or KRAS G13D mutation

Trial details: 
Patients that pass all screening assessments, including CT scan and blood test will randomly divided into two groups. One group wiil receive cetuximab alone ( Arm A) and the other group will receive cetuximab in combination with irinotecan ( Arm B). In both groups, the chemotherapy is given intravenously. Cetuximab is administered weekly to both groups and patients in Arm B will receive irinotecan every 14 days. The study aims to evaluate the response to the different therapy regimens, by  looking at the response on CT scans, survival rates and quality of life.</summary>
