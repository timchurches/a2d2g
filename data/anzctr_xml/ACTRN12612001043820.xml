  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.Healthy, non-smoking, males and females aged 18-40.
2.Are comfortable with computers, EEG (not photosensitive or sensitive to flashing lights) and fMRI and willing and able to participate in all scheduled visits, treatment plan, tests and other trial procedures according to the protocol.
3.Provide a personally signed and dated informed consent indicating that the participant has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.
4.For participants in the fMRI condition, only right handed participants will be recruited
5.Female subjects of childbearing age using an acceptable form of contraception
6.Fluent in spoken and written English</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. History of or currently suffering from anxiety, depression, psychiatric disorders.
2. History of / currently suffering from heart disease, high blood pressure or diabetes
3. Taking any medication, herbal extracts, vitamin supplements or illicit drugs within 4 weeks prior to (and duration of) study (except for routine medications to treat benign conditions, such as antibiotics to treat acne), or excessive consumption of caffeine or alcohol in this period,  4. Health conditions that would affect food metabolism including the following: food allergies, kidney disease, liver disease and/or gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. Irritable bowel syndrome, coeliac disease, peptic ulcers)
5. Epilepsy/Photosensitive or unable to look at flashing lights
6. Renal function problems, Hypercalcaemia; Hypermagnesemia, Severe hypercalciuria, phenylketonuria (autosomal metabolic disorder)  
7. Currently pregnant or lactating
8. Left handed participants (for fMRI component only). This is for ease of analysis looking at the fMRI. There are hemispheric differences in terms of structure between right and left handed individuals that prove to be problematic when analysing the output. Given that this investigation will employ a method where participants need to press buttons as a response (in turn involving the motor cortex), it is wise to use an all right handed population.
9. People with metal implants (for fMRI component only)
10. Vital signs out of the normal range (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature)
11. History of head trauma
12. Hypersensitivity to the investigational product or any of the active/inactive ingredients 
13. Participation in another trial within 30 days prior to the start of the study.
14. Any condition which may interfere with the subjects ability to perform assessments (e.g. claustrophobia for the fMRI arm, dyslexia, limb deformity).</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>A unique screening number will identify all subjects screened for study participation. Screening numbers will be assigned in ascending numerical order as each subject signs their consent form. Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised according to the randomisation schedule. 

A disinterested third party will generate the randomisation sequence using a computerised sequence generator

Randomisation numbers will be assigned in ascending numerical order according to appearance at the study site on the day subjects are randomised.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be generated using computer software and will also be stratified for subjects performing the fMRI: The two strata will be : i)	Subjects undergoing fMRI ii)	Subjects NOT undergoing fMRI. A randomisation schedule will be prepared for each strata
The study was extended to include an additional 16 participants who completed just the fMRI competent of the study. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this pilot, exploratory study is to investigate the effects of 4 weeks supplementation with a multivitamin/mineral preparation on brain activity and nutritional status assessed via established functional imaging techniques and blood biomarkers of health in healthy volunteers.

Participants will attend two testing sessions, one baseline and one after 4-weeks supplementation.  During testing sessions participants will complete a series of common assessments including nutritional status and mood assessment.  They will all undergo SST and a sub sample will go on to complete fMRI. 

Following baseline participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatments:

1) Berocca Performance 
2)Placebo (matched for appearance, taste and smell)

Following 4-week daily supplementation with allocated treatment participants will return for their second testing day.</summary>
