    <interventions>Multi national, multi centred observational trial studying the effectiveness of maternal influenza immunisation in infants up to 6 months of age. The aim is to recruit about 420 women in Australia in each site each year so that, after 4 years, we expect to have just over 10,000 women and their babies who are part of the study. There are six sites: Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.
Recruitment will be through ante-natal care providers, maternity units within participating hospitals or through clinics providing routine postnatal services at 6 weeks post delivery in Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. 
The study will be explained to potential participants utilising a Plain Language Statement approved by the relevant Human Research Committee (HREC). 
The study is aimed at mothers immunised against Influenza in the 12 months prior to the birth of their infant. The vaccine must not have been given =&lt;14 days prior to the birth of the infant.A minimal dataset summarising the outcomes from those approached for the Plain Language Statement will be recorded through a Screening Log.
Informed consent will be sought from each potential participant in accordance with HREC approval.	 Participant Workbook approved by the HREC will be used to document an entry questionnaire. 
Brief maternal questionnaire administered at enrolment (maximum 55 days post delivery). Information sought will be limited to self-reported influenza vaccination status, information relating to the barriers/influences of influenza vaccination, contact details for the participants usual medical practitioner, self reported maternal medical/obstetric history, and some socio-demographic indicators. 
The workbook is structured so that the component conducted at entry into the study can be completed over two separate sessions should the participant so choose. 
The workbook also includes a telephone follow-up once the child reaches 6 months of age where parent reported episodes are sought for medically diagnosed influenza in the infant. 
In addition to the informed consent process, the participant must also be considered to have sufficient verbal English to permit questionnaire completion at study entry and at 6-month follow-up.
Each participants usual medical practitioner/vaccine provider will be contacted to confirm the date of vaccination: (a) when a participant self reports receipt of influenza or pertussis vaccination but is unable to cite the date given from a written record; or (b) where the participant is unsure of her vaccination history. Participants who state that they have not been vaccinated will be considered unvaccinated to validate self-report of exposure status as vaccinated or unvaccinated. 
Brief maternal telephone questionnaire at participant exit will be conducted once the child reaches 6 months of age, includes parent reported episodes of medically diagnosed influenza in the infant. 
Data linkage to influenza and / or any other vaccine preventable diseases recorded on the notifiable diseases database within each State/Territory for the infant (6 months post delivery) and for maternal influenza from 12 months prior to delivery  6 months post delivery will be undertaken.
Parent reported episodes of medically diagnosed influenza where a specimen was collected from the mother or the infant that were identified but not confirmed will be followed-up with the treating physician to establish if they were laboratory confirmed and had not been notified to the relevant public health authority.</interventions>

      <outcome>Determine influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy at each of six sentinel research centres (Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth) during each of four consecutive years (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015).
This will be assessed by having each participant?s usual medical practitioner/vaccine provider contacted to confirm the date of vaccination: (a) when a participant self reports receipt of influenza or pertussis vaccination but is unable to cite the date given from a written record; or (b) where the participant is unsure of her vaccination history. Participants who state that they have not been vaccinated will be considered unvaccinated.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Delivery of a live-birth infant/s within 8 weeks of enrolment, ie maximum 55 days old at enrolment.
For non-Darwin sites, the infant/s must be delivered between 1 February and 30 September inclusive. 
Restriction of recruitment on the aforementioned basis in temperate climates is expected to provide a median of 4 (range 2-6) months exposure to circulating influenza per infant during the first 6 months of life. A design efficiency, critical to the sample size calculation.
The maternal study participant must: 
Be aged 18 years or more at the time written informed consent is obtained;
Be willing and able to adhere to all protocol requirements;
Have sufficient verbal English to permit questionnaire completion at study entry and at 6-month follow-up.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>"FluMum is a study about flu vaccination in pregnancy. We want to find out whether or not you had a flu vaccine in the 12 months before your baby was born and then whether that helps to protect your baby from getting influenza during the first 6 months of infancy. 
We ask questions and ask for permission to obtain information that may be kept in Government Health Departments. We dont do any blood tests, give any injections or take any specimens. You dont even have to have had the influenza vaccine to be in the study. 
In Australia, flu vaccination is recommended for all pregnant women who will be in their second or third trimester during the flu season. The reason that the vaccine is recommended is to prevent illness during pregnancy, however, there is some evidence that giving the flu vaccine during pregnancy (and potentially in the 12 months prior to a baby being born) may be of benefit in protecting the baby from the flu during the first few months of life. 
The study is being conducted in Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. We will look at flu vaccine uptake pregnancy in the 12 months prior to the baby being born and the reasons why women do or dont get vaccinated. Then we will find out whether babies of women vaccinated in the 12 months prior to a baby being born are less likely to get flu in the first few months of life than the babies of women who were not vaccinated.</summary>
