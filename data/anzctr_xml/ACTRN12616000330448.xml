  <interventions>
    <interventions>Open label study of deferasirox.
1 intervention arm - everyone will receive DFS. 
This will start at 5mg/kg/day and increase monthly in 5mg/kg/day steps until efficacy, side effects or significantly decreased iron levels. Patients will only increase the dose if there is no efficacy, no significant side-effects and iron studies do not indicate lower overall iron status. The dose may be decreased if their are side effects, including down to 2.5mg/kg/day.
Maximum dose 20mg/kg. Maximum duration 6 months.
Each person will (as above) go up in 5mg/kg steps.
DFS is administered as an oral tablet. Adherence strategies include tablet counts of returned medication and lab tests for iron studies.</interventions>

Body weight &gt;120kg.
Elevated serum creatinine outside the normal range or eGFR &lt;60ml/min

Low serum ferritin (&lt;150ng/ml for men or &lt;100ng/ml for women)
Any grade of known diabetic retinopathy above mild non-proliferative changes 
Because of the reported low incidence of cataracts, all patients must have a diabetic eye screen within the preceding year and patients with cataracts will be excluded
Microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria (confirmed on repeat testing), excluded due to the reported rare side effect of Fanconi syndrome
Significant proteinuria (confirmed on repeat testing). Defined as a urinary protein:creatinine ratio of &gt;1mg/mg in a mid-stream sample
Unstable angina, congestive cardiac failure, stable angina with onset &lt;500m of walking or claudication with onset distance &lt;500m, all due to the small risk of inducing anaemia
Pregnancy, breast-feeding or lack of reliable contraception in women of child-bearing age
Known malignancy
Liver function tests &gt;twice the upper limit of the normal reference range 
Inability to give informed consent
Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease or any concurrent condition which in the Investigators opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study, or which would jeopardise compliance with the protocol.
Medical co-morbidities that have the potential to be exacerbated by or contra-indicate treatment with deferasirox</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Open label study.
For each cohort, up to 6 patients will be enrolled. Each cohort will consist of newly enrolled patients. Once each patient has received treatment for 28 days the decision of which deferasirox dose for each patient will be evaluated. The dose will be increased by 5mg/kg/day if patients have not achieved efficacy, significant side effects or decrease in iron status towards the lower limits of normal.
The deferasirox doses to be investigated will be 5mg/kg/day and 10mg/kg/day. Potentially, 15mg/kg/day and 20mg/kg/day doses may be explored if the smaller doses do not lower serum ferritin and do not cause DLT and after consultation and approval from Novartis for the dose change. Depending on the side effect profile, 2.5mg/kg/day may be evaluated.</concealment>

Paired testing versus baseline values and comparison of endpoint results in people on differing study medications at the end of the study.
This is a dose finding study, we are interested in determining what doses are tolerated and either affect weight/ diabetes or cause altered iron status but have no effect on weight / diabetes. In mice 4 mice is enough to achieve statistical significance. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-defining study of daily deferasirox in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study is designed to assess the feasibility (safety and tolerability) of deferasirox administered daily, based on the rate of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), i.e. pre-defined adverse events. A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value occurring at any time which is assessed as clinically relevant which is considered to be related to the study treatment, unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications, and warrants stopping or reducing the medication. Toxicities will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE, version 3.0.</summary>
