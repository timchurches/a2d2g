  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Respiratory conditions are a common cause for hospital admission in the paediatric population, however little is known about paediatric respiratory function during regular breathing in these patients. The aim of this study is to determine the peak inspiratory flow rates, of both healthy and lung sick infants. It is hoped that this study will increase understanding of paediatric respiratory physiology during respiratory illness.
The study will be a prospective, observational, unblinded study on infants with both normal and impaired respiratory function. The primary outcome will be Peak inspiratory flow  the maximum flow rate (LPM) recorded throughout the inspiration phase, during regular breathing.
Once consent has been granted, the researcher will attach the flow sensor either via a face mask or if the infant is intubated via the endotrachela tube. 
Participants will be infants between 0 month and 2 years, recruited from Starship Childrens hospital, after obtained informed consent from parents/caregivers. It is approximated that 30 patients will be required in both groups.</summary>
