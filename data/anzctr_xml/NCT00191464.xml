  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to show that a prandial insulin regimen, consisting of
      premeal insulin lispro "mid mixture" (or a combined regimen of insulin lispro "mid mixture"
      and insulin lispro "low mixture") plus metformin will result in significantly better overall
      glycemic control (lower HbA1c) at endpoint than once-daily insulin glargine plus metformin.
      Insulin lispro "mid mixture" consists of 50% insulin lispro and 50% NPL. Insulin lispro "low
      mixture" consists of 25% insulin lispro and 75% NPL.

      In a substudy of approximately 60 patients, additional data will be collected on markers
      associated with risk of atherosclerosis or cardiovascular disease in the context of a
      controlled, outpatient, high-fat test meal.</summary>
