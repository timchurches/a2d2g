  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Since laparoscopic inguinal hernia was introduced in 1990, it has now become the most
      commonly performed hernia repair in NSW. Traditionally this is done with 3 small incisions: a
      2 cm incision under the navel for insertion of the camera and two 1 cm incisions below the
      navel for insertion of trocars into which dissecting instruments are inserted to perform the
      repair. Although this method has been shown to be relatively safe and efficient there are
      reports of bowel and vascular injuries from the insertion of the smaller trocars which are
      usually sharp. These can cause serious injuries.

      Since 2009, a newer method of performing the key hole repair has been developed. This
      involves placing a special single port under the navel via a 2-2.5cm incision and into which
      3 blunt trocars are inserted. This negates the risks of injuries from sharp trocars. In
      addition the fact that only a single incision is used this could potentially result in less
      pain, reduced incidence of wound complications including infection and improved cosmetic
      results.

      However these potential advantages have not been proven in rigorous clinical studies as the
      single port technique is still relatively new. It is hoped that this study will prove that
      the single port technique is at least as effective and efficient as the conventional
      technique in the cure of hernias and may have additional benefits as enumerated above.

      Neither you nor your surgeon will know which procedure (three port or single port hernia
      repair) until you are already asleep in the operating room and a random number selecting
      process will automatically assign you to one procedure or the other. Sometimes it is not
      possible to perform the single port safely in which case your procedure will be converted to
      a three ports procedure.

      All patients having surgical treatment of groin hernia at Holroyd Private Hospital are
      subject to very careful assessment and study. All patients are requested to report
      immediately if there are any problems. Any problems would normally be reported to your
      treating surgeon who has primary responsibility for your care. Problems can be reported
      directly to Holroyd Private Hospital. Any information in your medical records is subject to
      stringent confidentiality requirements. The hospital is bound by the Australian Privacy
      Council Charter as regards confidentiality and privacy.</summary>
