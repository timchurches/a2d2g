    <interventions>Randomised cross-over comparison of low-chemical (low salicylates, amines, glutamates, additives) with a low FODMAP (low fermentable oligo, di, mono-saccharides and polyols) diets.  Each diet will run for 3 weeks and be administered by a dietitian.  No washout period is required.  Improvement in symptoms would be expected to some extent after 3 weeks and participants will be allowed time at the end of the second diet (where they will maintain a low chemical diet (and low FODMAP if indicated).   If no improvement after 6 weeks, participants will be returned to a normal diet.    Food diaries will be utilised throughout the protocol to monitor adherence and nutritional adequacy.  As part of the study, participants would consult the dietitian at randomisation, and prior to cross-over (each 30-60min).  Email and phone access to the dietitian is provided ongoing.</interventions>

      <outcome>Symptom control. Questionnaires will be administered before commencing the trial, at the end of the interventions.  A standard daily symptom diary will be used in conjunction with the dietary intake diary. These questionnaires are 'Patient information forms' developed by the RPAH Allergy Unit for use with all patients.

      <timepoint>Symptom type, severity and frequency will be assessed by questionnaire at baseline and on completion of each intervention (weeks 3 and 6). Symptoms occurrence and severity is also recorded on a daily basis via symptom diary. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to compare the effectiveness of two widely used diets: (1) the RPAH low chemical elimination diet, and (2) the low FODMAP diet.  Patients will be randomly allocated to a 3-week period on one of these diets, after which they will cross-over for a further 3 weeks on the other diet. 
The main outcome measure will be symptom response. In addition to keeping a standard daily food &amp; symptom diary, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires before, during and after the intervention period to assess impact on quality of life. Their dietary intake will also be analysed by a dietitian to ensure ongoing nutritional adequacy.
