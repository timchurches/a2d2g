  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will be immobilised in a shoulder external rotation brace and will be advised to wear the brace continuously for three weeks, except during showering. Participants randomised to this group will receive a supervised physiotherapy program consisting of graduated shoulder range of motion and strengthening exercises. The physiotherapy sessions will be approximately 30 minutes in duration. Participants will receive physiotherapy one week and 3 weeks post initial examination and then every week until 6 weeks post dislocation. They will then receive physiotherapy every 2 weeks until 3 months post dislocation. Therefore, they will receive a total of nine physiotherapy sessions over a 12 week period.</interventions>

Participants randomised to this group will receive a supervised physiotherapy program consisting of graduated range of motion exercises, pulsed ultrasound (US) and massage. The physiotherapy sessions will be approximately 30 minutes in duration. Participants will receive physiotherapy one week and 3 weeks post initial examination and then every week until 6 weeks post dislocation. They will then receive physiotherapy every 2 weeks until 3 months post dislocation. Therefore, they will receive a total of seven physiotherapy sessions over a 12 week period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will be the first high quality clinical trial comparing two conservative physiotherapy management approaches for anterior shoulder dislocations (ASDs) using reliable measures of shoulder function and re-dislocation as outcomes. This project will also contribute to the research in immobilisation positioning for patients with ASD and will provide further direction on the implications of conservative management versus surgical intervention for this population. 
The incidence of ASD has been estimated at approximately 1.7% of the population and the consequences of traumatic shoulder dislocation and re-dislocation include loss of work productivity, ongoing loss and limitation of shoulder function and sporting activities, and degenerative arthropathy, all contributing to great cost for the patient and community.
The findings of this project will benefit patients, orthopaedic specialists, emergency department specialists, general practitioners and allied health personnel who deal with this frequently seen condition and consequently reduce the significant costs associated.</summary>
