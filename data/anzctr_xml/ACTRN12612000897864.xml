  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study consisted of two, 2-day trials (exercise and control). Each trial involved two, nine hour days in a laboratory (8:00 am to 5:00 pm). Participants performed a one-hour treadmill run at approximately 70% of maximum oxygen uptake on day 1 of the exercise trial. All exercise sessions were supervised on a one to one basis by an exercise physiologist. Participants rested on day 1 of the control trial. During day 2 of both trials participants ate standardised meals for breakfast (8:00 am) and lunch (12:00 pm). These meals consisted of white bread, butter, cheese, mayonnaise, crisps, chocolate milk shake powder and high fat milk. The macronutrient content of these meals was 57% fat, 32% carbohydrate and 11% protein and each meal provided 60 kJ (14.3 kcal) per kg body mass for a 70 kg participant. Fourteen, 9 mL venous blood samples were collected during day 2 of each trial via a cannula. Participants were assigned to the trials in a random order and trials were separated by at least one week.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>South Asians have a higher than average risk of coronary heart disease. The reasons for this are unclear but physical inactivity and/or poor responsiveness to exercise may play a role. The proposed study compared the prior effect of a single bout of running on CHD risk markers in South Asian and European men.</summary>
