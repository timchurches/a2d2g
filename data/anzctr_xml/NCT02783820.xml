    <inclusivecriteria>1. Completion of the written informed consent process.

          2. Men or WNCBP age 18 to 55 years, in good health as determined by past medical history,
             physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at
             screening.

          3. Male subjects agree to use acceptable methods of contraception if the male subject's
             partner could become pregnant from the time of the first administration of study
             medication until 130 (90+40) days following administration of the investigational
             medicinal product. One of the following acceptable methods of contraception must be
             utilized:

               -  Condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)

               -  Surgical sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) and a
                  barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps].

               -  The subject's female partner uses oral contraceptives (combination
                  estrogen/progesterone pills), injectable progesterone or subdermal implants and a
                  barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps].

               -  The subject's female partner uses medically prescribed topically-applied
                  transdermal contraceptive patch and a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap

                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception. Abstinent subjects have to agree to use 1 of the above-mentioned
                  contraceptive methods, if they start sexual relationships during the study and

                  12 months without an alternative medical cause with a screening follicle
                  stimulating hormone level consistent with local laboratory levels for
                  post-menopause.

             hepatic transaminase enzymes (AST ALT), and total bilirubin (unless the subject has
             documented Gilbert syndrome) should not exceed the upper laboratory norm and
             haemoglobin must be equal to or higher than the lower limit of the normal range.

          5. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject
