  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will complete 5 lessons of an iCBT treatment, the SCI Pain Course (see Dear et al., 2013) focusing on the management of pain, anxiety, depression and disability. All 5 Lessons will be administered via the internet and one lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with chronic pain, taking a further 20 minutes per summary. All participants will also receive automatic email and weekly reminder phone calls by a clinical psychologist. The duration of the reminder emails and phone calls is expected to be 5-10 minutes per week. The duration of the program is 8 weeks. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-treatment, post-treatment and then 3-months post-treatment. These questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to complete.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be carried out using conservative intention-to-treat principles and using mixed-linear models analyses to handle missing data. Mixed-models are a robust statistical approach for analysing clinical trial data and these analyses will employ an appropriate covariance structure and maximum likelihood estimation, which provides unbiased estimates in the case of missing data; under the assumption that data is missing at random.

Sample size: With an alpha at 0.05 and power set at 0.80, 27 participants are needed to detect an effect size improvement in symptoms of .50. However, to hedge against attrition 30 participants will be recruited. The effect size of 0.50 is also conservative estimate with larger effect sizes having been observed in previous trials (e.g., see Dear et al., 2013; Pain).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed project seeks to examine the acceptability, efficacy and feasibility of low-intensity CBT-based self-management program, the SCI Pain Course, in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression and disability among adults with spinal cord injuries. The SCI Pain Course is based on the already established and efficacious Pain Course but has undergone minor modification to make it optimally suitable for people with SCI.
