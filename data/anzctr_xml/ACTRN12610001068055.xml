  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, single group, daily wear (DW) study where 40 participants will wear PureVision[Registered trade mark] study lenses bilaterally on a daily wear (DW) basis in conjunction with Biotrue [Trade mark] solution for 3 months. There will be a minimum of 5 scheduled visits: baseline, 2 hour visit, 2 week visit, 1 month visit and 3 month visit. These visits will involve assessment of visual acuity, examination with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (a specialised microscope for viewing the eye) and assessment of ocular comfort using questionnaires employing a 1-10 numeric rating scale. Lenses will be worn a minimum of 5 days per week, and 6 hours on the day lenses are worn.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control for the outcomes of ocular surface effect, and contact lens contamination will be historical data  ( Study ACTRN12610000348055). The method of analysis of contact lens cases will be as per historical control</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>-Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
-Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
-Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the study;
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the study;
N.B.: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before study product is used;
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
-Previous corneal refractive surgery;
-Contraindications to contact lens wear;
-Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the study products;
-Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
-Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for dispensing studies and 48 hours between in-house studies;
-Pregnancy*; 

The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, exclude anyone who they believe may not be able to fulfil the study requirements, or if it is believed to be in the participants best interests.
*Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient.</exclusivecriteria>
