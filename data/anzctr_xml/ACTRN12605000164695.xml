Participants are also called yearly for the next 4 years following the 12 month assessment to ascertain functional and residency status.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group is assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 months and a letter sent to their general practitioner (GP) at each time point identifying any abnormalities in vision, vitamin D, depression, or cognition. No recommendations for specific treatment made.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many patients with hip fracture end up disabled or in nursing homes in the year following fracture. Current treatment protocols do not systematically address risk factors for disability. We will recruit 600 patients who have fractured their hip. Subjects will be randomized to receive usual care or the HIPFIT intervention, which includes targeted treatments for depression, muscle weakness, poor gait and balance, malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency, poor vision, environmental hazards in the home, social isolation, and low self-efficacy, as needed. The two groups will be followed for 12 months to determine differences in disability and need for residential care.</summary>
