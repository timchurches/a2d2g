  <interventions>
    <interventions>25 male patients with clinically localized prostatic carcinoma underwent prostatectomy by robot-assisted approach by a single surgeon(using the da Vinci Surgical System). The estimated operative time is around 3-4hours.The surgical technique are transperitoneally,antegrade, energy-free (use of surgical suture needle to control the prostatic
vascular structure with no use of thermocoagulation,
either mono or bipolar at the lateral
aspect of the prostate)
Participants will be monitored for 1 year post surgery</interventions>
    <comparator>25 male patients with clinically localized prostatic carcinoma underwent prostatectomy by laparoscopic approach by a single surgeon. The estimated operative time is around 4-5 hours. The surgical technique are the same with Robot-assisted.
Participants will be monitored for 1 year post surgery</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Continence</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continence was defined as no leakage or as no
need of use of any protective pad.Continence were
assessed by telephone interview at 1, 3, 6, and 12
months after surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Potency</outcome>
      <timepoint>Potency was defined both as capability of intercourse
(with or without phosphodiesterase type 5 [PDE5] inhibitors).Capability of intercourse were
assessed by telephone interview at 1, 3, 6, and 12
months after surgery. Capability of intercourse
was assessed through the questions (Were you able to insert
your penis into your partner's vagina? Did your
erection last long enough to have successful intercourse?).
If the patient affirmed that he was able to
get an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse,
he was further asked about the use or not of PDE5
inhibitors and the frequency of this use.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>postoperative positive margin</outcome>
      <timepoint>Positive surgical margin (PSM) was considered
when cancer cells were found in contact with
the ink-marked resection margin.A PSM &lt; 1 mm
was defined focal. The TNM 2002 classification
was used for the staging.The PSM will be assessed by postoperative pathological report. The report were reviewed 1 week after surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>blood loss(ml)</outcome>
      <timepoint>blood loss will be assessed  by vacuum extractor .And the amount of bleeding were recorded in the operative records. The records were reviewed 1 day after surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total operative  time</outcome>
      <timepoint>Total operative time was regarded as the time between initiation of the skin incision and end of wound closure according to operative records. The operative records were reviewed 1 week after surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We assessed the learning curve for an experienced laparoscopic surgeon during the transition for laparoscopic  surgery to the robot-assisted operations.So we conducted the RCT and compared the perioperative outcomes of the 2 groups.One group   were 25 cases of laparoscopicradical prostatectomy and another were 25 cases of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostate cancer</summary>
