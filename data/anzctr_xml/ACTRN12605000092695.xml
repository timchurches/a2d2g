  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed research project will investigate whether high-intensity, community-based exercise programs performed once a week are sufficient to maintain or improve a variety of subjective and objective outcomes including the physical function, balance, independence and program adherence of older adults post-discharge from a Day Rehabilitation Centre (DRC). The Ã¢Â¿Â¿once a weekÃ¢Â¿Â¿ exercise intervention will be directly compared with Ã¢Â¿Â¿twice a weekÃ¢Â¿Â¿ exercise, and with usual care for a period of 12 weeks post discharge. Participants will be followed up at the end of the intervention period and at 12 months post discharge from the DRC. The cost effectiveness of the interventions will also be determined.</summary>
