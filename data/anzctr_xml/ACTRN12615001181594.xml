    <statisticalmethods>Baseline characteristics will be summarised using descriptive statistics including counts and percentages for categorical variables and mean, standard deviation (SD), median and range for continuous variables.
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the overall survival, freedom from local progression and freedom from distant progression. Annual estimates will be provided alongside with 95% confidence intervals. 
Cumulative incidence curves for cancer related death and for severe toxicity will be provided assuming competing risks with death as a competing event. Annual estimates will be provided alongside with 95% confidence intervals estimated using bootstrap. 
No imputation of missing values and no adjustments for multiplicity are intended. All confidence intervals provided will be 2-sided with alpha=0.05.

With a sample size of 70, alpha of 0.05, the 95% confidence interval width of freedom from local progression of 90% is 80-90%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating the activity and efficacy of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) for the treatment of kidney cancers. 

Who is it for? 

Age &gt; 18 years old 
All patients must have a biopsy confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with a single lesion within a kidney 

1. ECOGperformance of 0-2 inclusive. 
2. Life expectancy &gt; 9 months
3. Either medically inoperable, technically high risk for surgery or decline surgery.
4. Multidisciplinary decision for active treatment 

Study Details:
Definitive external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is often used to treat medically inoperable patients with cancers in many different organs, including the kidneys.  However, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is conventionally considered radioresistant to fully fractionated EBRT. In an effort to overcome the perceived radioresistance of RCC, severely hypofractionated EBRT in the form of stereotactic radiotherapy has renewed interest in the management of renal cell carcinoma with radiotherapy. 
Participants in this study will be allocated to receive either multi-fraction SABR (3 fractions over 2 weeks) or single fraction SABR (1 fraction only). 

All participants will be assessed at regular intervals post treatment in order to  estimate the activity and efficacy of the technique,  evaluate tolerability, estimate survival, estimate distant failure rate, and renal function change after SABR. 

The follow-up visits occur at 4 weeks and every 3 months in the  1st year post treatment, then every 6 months in the second year and then yearly until study closure (2 years after the last participant finishes study treatment).
