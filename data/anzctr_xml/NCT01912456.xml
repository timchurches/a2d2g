  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of C1-esterase inhibitor in preventing
      hereditary angioedema attacks when it is administered under the skin of subjects with
      hereditary angioedema. The safety of C1-esterase inhibitor will also be assessed. Each
      subject will enter a run-in period of up to 8-weeks. Subjects who complete the run-in period
      and who are eligible will then enter the treatment phase which comprises two sequential
      treatment periods. In the treatment phase, subjects will be randomized to one of four arms
      consisting of treatment with low- or higher-volume C1-esterase inhibitor in one treatment
      period and treatment with low- or higher-volume placebo in the other treatment period. The
      study will measure the number of hereditary angioedema attacks that subjects experience while
      receiving each treatment.</summary>
