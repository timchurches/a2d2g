  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Who Maintained Complete Healing of Erosive Esophagitis as Assessed by Endoscopy - Crude Rate Analysis. - Crude rates analyzed maintenance of healed EE from baseline of this study and considered prematurely discontinued subjects as relapsed.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Who Maintained Complete Healing of Erosive Esophagitis as Assessed by Endoscopy - Life Table Method - Percentage of subjects who maintained complete healing of erosive esophagitis as assessed by endoscopy. In the life table method, subjects without post-baseline endoscopy were included as censored; subjects who did not have a recurrence of EE and did not complete the study were also considered censored.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Days Without Daytime or Nighttime Heartburn as Assessed by Daily Diary-Median. - The percentage was calculated as the days that were heartburn-free out of the total number of days for which either a daytime or nighttime result was reported.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects must have successfully completed the Phase 3 Study T-EE04-084 (NCT00251693)
             or T-EE04-085 (NCT00251719); and have healed esophageal erosions proven by endoscopy.
             Complete healing was assessed for change in LA Esophagitis Classification grades A, B,
             C, or D to healed (defined as anything less than the criterion for Grade A). The
             subject was counted as healed if endoscopy findings did not meet the Grade A
             criterion.</inclusivecriteria>

          -  Need for continuous anticoagulant therapy.

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled systemic disease.

          -  Subjects who have participated in either maintenance study (T-EE04-086 [NCT00255164]
             or T-EE04-087 [NCT00255151]).
