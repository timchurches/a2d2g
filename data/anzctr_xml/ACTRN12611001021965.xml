  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Circulating levels of interleukin-1 (used as an indicative inflammatory cytokine) compared to baseline level before fluid bolus. 3.5 mL serum tubes are collected from the patients at the requisite timepoints, allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to clot then centrifuged at 800g for 10 minutes at 4 deg C. Serum and plasma samples are aliquotted, stored immediately at -80 deg C and subsequently analysed using ELISA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1, 3 and 24 hours after fluid bolus</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Inflammatory gene activation and expression measured using qPCR compared to baseline level before fluid bolus. At the requisite timepoints 2.5mL PAXGene tubes are collected. The PAXgene tube is placed immediately at 4 deg C before being transferred to -20 deg C with 72 hours, and then transferred to -80 deg C for long-term storage and subsequent qPCR analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1, 3 and 24 hours after fluid bolus</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bacterial load compared to baseline level before fluid bolus. Bacterial load is measured from PAXGene tubes as above.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1, 3 and 24 hours after fluid bolus</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Haemodynamic parameters (e.g. mean arterial pressure, systolic pressure, heart rate measured non-invasively using standard equipment) compared to baseline level before fluid bolus</outcome>
      <timepoint>1, 3 and 24 hours after fluid bolus</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mortality measured by review of medical records and, where necessary, telephone follow up</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with sepsis have the potential to become very unwell in a rapid period. The progression from being moderately unwell to severely unwell may be due to the bodys immune system responding to the infection, rather than the infection itself.
A fundamental and accepted practice in the management of patients with suspected sepsis is the administration of intravenous fluids. There is no consensus that any particular fluid is better than the other. In particular, we do not know whether any time of fluid has a beneficial effect on this immune response to infection.
Hypertonic saline fluid has been shown in some animal and human studies to influence the immune response to infection. In this pilot study we will assess whether hypertonic saline has an advantage over normal saline in producing beneficial immunomodulation. If this can be shown, it will inform the design of a larger multicentre trial with clinical endpoints.</summary>
