  <interventions>
    <interventions>Healthy overnight (10 hour) fasted adults will be given a test meal of white bread containing 50g of available carbohydrate. The protocol for GI testing of a food product will be followed, with capillary blood samples take at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes post meal ingestion to observe changes in blood glucose levels over this time. These data points will be used to determine each participants (n=90) incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of blood glucose as a response to meal ingestion.

This process will be repeated for each participant as part of a crossover design with a two week washout, with one arm a control in which participants remain sedentary for 2h after eating. For the other study arm participants will use a seated exercycle at low RPM and low resistance for ten minutes after 5 or 30 minute after finishing eating.  (n=90 control, N=45 cycle at 5mins, n=45 cycle at 30mins). the process will be randomized by both order of intervention and timing of exercise.

A secondary element to this study will compare baseline fasted blood glucose capillary measures (captured as part of the iAUC process) with glycated albumin (GA), a mid-term marker for glycaemic control. A possible correlation between fasted blood glucose, postprandial glucose (sedentary condition)  and GA will be reviewed. GA assessment will be undertaken on frozen samples of participant blood (taken by capillary as part of the iAUC process) after the intervention has occurred. Participants will have access to their own data, investigators will de-identify and use pooled data for group analysis.</interventions>
    <comparator>Crossover study, the control arm of this study will be to remain seated (sedentary) for the 2h post test meal ingestion.

      <timepoint>Capillary blood samples will be taken at baseline (before exposure to the test meal) for assessing both fasting blood glucose and glycated albumin.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be university students enrolled at the University of Otago, New Zealand. Participation is optional, with no negative repercussions if students decide not to participate. Once consent is gained, each participant is centrally randomized by computerl to order of intervention and timing of physical activity. Allocation is concealed. As a crossover study, each participant will undergo both arms of the intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation occurred independently of class enrollment or any participant details, using a computer generated process to randomise both order of intervention and timing of the physical activity undertaken (at 5 or 30 minutes post meal ingestion).</sequence>

    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>All elements of the study are to be standardised within our ability to isolate variables being compared. Only de-identified pooled data will be used in statistical analysis to minimise discrepancies in individual results. the fasting period will be specified with each participant asked to standardise their meals for carbohydrate load and physical activity level for the 24hours preceding the test meal. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Pooled iAUC values will be compared between controlled and intervention arms. mean and standard deviation will be compared, as will the probability of variance between intervention arms. Log transformation may occur if the data is percieved to be skewed (although the randomisation of trial order and exercise timing should minimise the possibility of this). A sample of 35 will have 90% power to detect a clinically relevant 20% difference in iAUC with an alpha of 0.05.

A correlation coefficient will be used to examine any possible relationship between fasting blood glucose and glycated albumin. A sample of 31 will be sufficient to detect a correlation coefficient of 0.5 or better with power of 90% and an alpha of 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of very low intensity physical activity on blood sugar levels in healthy adults, after eating. It is a commonly controlled for belief in studys on glycaemia that very light activities such as standing and walking after eating may impact the blood sugar response to a meal. We aim to test this by comparing group data of a sedentary control against very light physical activity at 5 and 30 minutes after eating. We will be examining the 2 hours directly after the consumption of 2 serves of bread.
 
A secondary aim is to evaluate the potential of a relationship in fasting blood glucose and the level of glycated albumin, a blood protein, in healthy adults. Fasting blood glucose is marker of short term glycaemic control, where glycated albumin is an emerging mid-term marker of glycaemic control. A positive correlation or relationship between the two markers will further affirm the credibility of glycated albumin for use in glycaemic monitoring and surveillance.</summary>
