    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Distribution of ALT Levels Through 72 Weeks: Overall - ALT is an enzyme present in serum and various tissues of the body, associated commonly with the liver. Elevated levels of ALT often suggests existence of medical problems which includes viral hepatitis. Normal range varies from laboratory to laboratory. Values of 5-60 U/L is usually considered normal. ALT abnormality = &gt;1.25 x ULN (upper limit of normal).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With HBeAg Seroconversion at Week 72 (for HBeAg-positive Participants) - HBeAg is a hepatitis B viral protein. HBeAg Seroconversion = HBeAg Loss and Presence of Hepatitis B e Antibody (HBeAb).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With HBsAg Loss at Week 72 - HBsAg = a part of the hepatitis B virus that, when in the blood, is an early marker of infection. HBsAg loss = HBsAg-negative at the specified analysis week.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With HBsAg Seroconversion at Week 72 - HBsAg = a part of the hepatitis B virus that, when in the blood, is an early marker of infection. HBs seroconversion is defined as HBsAg loss with positive HBsAb.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At week 72</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With HBsAg Recurrence At Week 72 - HBsAg = a part of the hepatitis B virus that, when in the blood, is an early marker of infection. HBsAg recurrence is defined as having detectable HBsAg among participants who have already experienced loss of HBsAg on-treatment. HBsAg recurrence = HBsAg-positive at the specified analysis week.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At week 72</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total Bilirubin at Week 72 - Bilirubin measures are used to diagnose or monitor liver functioning or diseases that include hepatitis. Viral hepatitis is one of the condition in which bilirubin levels are elevated. Normal range varies from laboratory to laboratory. Bilirubin abnormality : =&gt; 1.1 x ULN mg/dL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At week 72</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prothrombin Time (PT) at Week 72 - Prothrombin, a liver protein, plays an important role in the extrinsic pathway of clotting. Increased prothrombin time indicates abnormal liver functioning. Normal prothrombin time varies from laboratory to laboratory. Generally, normal prothrombin time varies between 10 to 13.2 seconds.
