  <interventions>
    <interventions>150 Patients were randomized at the beginning of each cycle by sealed opaque envelopes containing random generated numbers into three groups. All patients received clomiphene citrate (clomid global Napi , 6th October Egypt) 50 mg orally every 8 hours started from cycle day 3 for 5 days. Group 1 (50 patients) received no further treatment. Group 2 (50 patients) received estradiol valerate 2mg (cycloprogynova white tablets schering AG, Germany) from cycle day 7 to day 11. Group 3 (50 patients) received phytoestrogen (Klimadynon, Bionorica, Neumarkt i.d.OBf., Germany) (20mg of cimifuga racemosa from day 1to12). drug tablet return was used to  monitor adherence to the intervention</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. All participants had the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) based on presence of at least two of the following diagnostic criteria should be met: oligo/anovulation; clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (e.g., hirsutism and acne) and/or biochemical measurements; or enhanced polycystic ovaries and/or multiple discrete follicles in diameter in one ovary as detected by ultrasonography. The criteria fulfilling sufficient specificity and sensitivity to define PCO are the following: `presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2-9 mm in diameter, and/or increased ovarian volume (&gt;10 cm3) 

2. Women with both 1ry and 2ry infertility were included.

    <summary>Objective: to study the effect of phytoestrogens as an alternative to estradiol in reversing the antiestrogenic effect of clomid in cases of PCOS
Methods: Prospective study conducted on 150 women with PCOS were randomly divided into 3 groups: group I (50 women) received CC only50 mg orally every 8 hours started from cycle day 3 for 5 days, group II (50 women) received 2mg estradiol valerate daily from cycle day 7 - 11 in addition to CC and group III (50 women) received phytoestrogen (20mg of cimifuga racemosa from day 1- 12) in addition to CC
