  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pulsed electro magnetic resonance therapy applied daily. Also known as pulsed magnetic field therapy. Asthma and overall health will be measured over a period of 12 weeks during use of pharmaceutical medication therapy and this will be the control group. Following this 12 weeks,  pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PERT) will be applied daily for a minimum of 4 hours and this will form the study intervention group ie test group.

There is no wash out period. There is no requirement to cease pharmaceutical medications unless and until the action of PERT has decreased asthma symptoms to the point that medication is no longer required. Pilot studies indicate in children that this occurs within days of commencing PERT therapy. The reason for this point of view is that we do no harm with our trials and by not asking participants to cease medications they have access to their existing treatment until no longer required.

Participants will receive PERT on a daily basis for 12 weeks for 4 hours daily. And this will form stage 1 of the trial. This is the primary outcome period of this trial.

We have found in pilot studies that ongoing use of PERT is likely to cause permanent changes to the point that the use of PERT is no longer required and asthma does not return. 

Therefore participants will be asked to continue using 4 hours daily for a further 24 weeks after the initial 12 week period and then will be asked to cease all therapy for 12 weeks to see if the symptoms of asthma return or become worse.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose is to test the hypothesis that  pulsed electromagnetic resonance therapy (PERT) otherwise known as pulsed magnetic field therapy when applied regularly to children with chronic asthma can provide an outcome best described as a drug free cure which means that 95% of children in the trial will be free of the symptoms of asthma and the need for pharmaceutical intervention after 12 weeks of therapy and a further hypothesis is that the overall health of the group treated with PERT will be improved also as a result of PERT therapy and the reduction in side effects as a result of not requiring pharmaceutical medication.</summary>
