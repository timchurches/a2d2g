Experimental: NOX66 + Radiation treatment (combined) in cohort 4 - NOX66 administered on Days 1-16 and radiation treatment given on Day 2 to 9 of 2-week cycle.
NOX66 dose will be either one of 3 doses 400mg, 800mg and 1200 mg based on interim analyses of safety data and tumour response at WEEK 6 of 3 dose cohorts of 12 total patients. The SSC will inform on dose for cohort expansion.
Radiation treatment of 20Gy given over 5 daily fractions to selected target lesion/s for all cohorts.


Treatment: drugs: NOX66

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change of incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events including SAEs [Safety and Tolerability] of NOX66 combined with radiation therapy between multiple timepoints - Safety will be assessed through reported incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs), including SAEs, dose limiting toxicities, AEs leading to withdrawal, events of at least CTCAE Version 4.03 Grade 2 in severity.

    <summary>The study is intended as a Proof of Concept and dose confirmation study. The primary
      objective of this study is to observe safety and tolerability of idronoxil (NOX66) in
      combination with radiotherapy (at palliative doses) in patients with metastatic
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and to confirm dose in order to progress to Phase
      2/3.</summary>
