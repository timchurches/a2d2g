    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - S64315

Experimental: S64315 (also referred as MIK665) - 


Treatment: drugs: S64315
S64315 will be administered via i.v. infusion over 30 minutes once every week (21- day cycle), the starting dose is 50 mg. As data emerge during the study, the infusion duration and alternative dosing regimen may be changed.
