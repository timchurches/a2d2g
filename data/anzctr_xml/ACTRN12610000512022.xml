  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oral probiotic therapy of two capsules daily for six months. Each capsule will contain either 1) Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 (GR1-RC14) (2.7 × 10^9 colony forming units (cfu)) OR 2) Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and bifidobacterium (BB-12) (3.5 × 10^9 cfu of each culture)</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo - two capsules daily for six months. 
Placebo capsules are identical in size, shape, colour and taste to the active capsule. The capsule is made of Hypromellose, titanium dioxide. The capsule contains all of the same powder constituents (maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate) as the active capsule except for the active cultures.</comparator>
