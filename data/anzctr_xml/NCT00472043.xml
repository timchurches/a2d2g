  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the selective destruction of abnormal cells through light
      activation of a photosensitiser in the presence of oxygen. These cells accumulate more
      photosensitiser than normal cells. The photosensitiser generates reactive oxygen species upon
      illumination.

      For skin diseases, there has been an increasing interest in using precursors of the
      endogenous photosensitiser protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The most commonly used precursors have
      been 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its derivatives. The present test drug, Metvix®,
      contains the methyl ester of ALA, which penetrates the lesions well and shows high lesion
      selectivity .

      In vitro studies of animal and human tissues have shown significant intracellular formation
      of photoactive porphyrins after addition of Metvix®. The increased levels of photoactive
      porphyrins induced cytotoxic effects in tumour cells after photoactivation.

      The primary objective is to compare PDT with Metvix® cream to PDT with placebo cream in terms
      of patient complete response rates based on histologically verified disappearance of the
      lesions at 6 months after last treatment cycle.

      Secondary objectives are to compare the two treatments in terms of histological and clinical
      mean patient response weighted by the number of lesions within a patient, lesion response
      rates across patients, clinical complete patient response, cosmetic outcome and adverse
      events.</summary>
