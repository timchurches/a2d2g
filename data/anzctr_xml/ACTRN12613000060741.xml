  <interventions>
    <interventions>General Practitioners (GPs) in the intervention arm will utilise an online computerised antithrombotic risk assessment tool (CARAT) during routine clinical practice to support their decision-making processes in selecting and/or reviewing antithrombotic (anti-clotting) therapy in their elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. Administration of CARAT will take 15-20 minutes. The intervention will be trialled by GPs over 12 months. CARAT will be applied at 0 and 12 months, and involves a combination of questions that assess stroke risk, bleeding risk and medication safety issues. CARAT will then quantify the patients estimated risk of stroke versus bleeding, flag pertinent medication management issues, and generate a recommendation for therapy (warfarin, aspirin, none, other).The GP will consider the CARAT output and make a final treatment decision to initiate, cease, or maintain current therapy. Where the GP may disagree with CARAT, the rationale for the decision will be documented in the data collection process. Reviewed patients will be followed-up for up to 12 months (0, 1, 6, 12 months) to document key clinical outcomes (i.e., strokes, bleeds).</interventions>
    <comparator>GPs in the control arm will follow their usual care practices, i.e., they will review and select antithrombotic therapy using their own clinical judgement, processes and resources.</comparator>

    <concealment>GPs will be recruited via invitational letters, flyers inside newsletters, and presentations during education events, coordinated by the Divisions of General Practice. Patients will be recruited by their GPs during routine care (consecutive consults over 3 months). Participants will be required to provide informed written consent. 
Randomisation will be coordinated centrally by a Chief Investigator independent of GP recruitment, intervention implementation, or data collection, and who will conceal the initial allocation process from Research Assistants (e.g., allocation numbers will be placed in sealed, serially coded envelopes, and housed in a locked cabinet in Chief Investigators office). </concealment>
    <sequence>Once recruited, GPs will be randomly allocated to a study arm using computer-generated random allocation number sequences. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Computerised data analysis will employ SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). ANOVA will test for differences in continuous variables. The Chi-square test will examine differences in independent proportions. Kappa analysis will detect the level of agreement between prescribers clinical judgement and the CARAT output. Logistic regression analysis will identify predictors of clinical events (clotting versus bleeding), and selection of antithrombotic therapy, accounting for the use of the CARAT. Survival analysis will assess mortality rates in both arms. All analyses will be adjusted for the effects of clustering, and set at a significance (p) level of 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The burden of stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF; a common irregular heart rhythm) is high, especially in older persons in whom AF is most common. To prevent stroke in this high-risk population antithrombotic (anti-clotting) medicines must be used. Warfarin is currently the recommended therapy, however, it requires careful monitoring &amp; management to avoid side-effects (eg bleeding), leading some clinicians to choose less effective therapies (aspirin) for their patients. This clinical trial will test the use of a novel computerised clinical tool (CARAT) to assist GPs in assessing their patients risk of stroke versus side-effects from treatment, and recommended treatment based on risk assessment.</summary>
