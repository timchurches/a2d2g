  <interventions>
    <interventions>Medical treatment will be given to all the participants. Basic drugs for the treatment are aspirin and clopidogrel. The aspirin and clopidogrel will be given orally at a dose of 100mg and 75mg per day respectively for 3 months. Patients in the PTAS group will receive the same dose of the aspirin and clopidogrel 5 days before operation, and continue for 3 months after the operation. When an emergency stenting operation is needed, a loading dose of 300 mg clopidogrel will be given. Additional medical treatment will be given to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of &lt;140mmHg; hemoglobin A1c of &lt;6.5% (in diabetes patients); low density lipoprotein of &lt;2.58mmol/L. Interventions lowering the cardiovascular risk will also be used, such as lifestyle modification and smoking cessation. Participants who are allocated to PTAS will receive angioplasty and stenting within 5 days after randomization. A standard protocol of the PTAS procedure will be developed. The procedure will be performed by a cardiovascular surgeon. The participants will receive balloon-angioplasty with a balloon catheter, followed by stenting using the Wingspan stent system (manufactured by Stryker Neurovascular).</interventions>
    <comparator>Agressive medical treatment (AMT) will be given to all the participants, both in the RCT and cohort. The basic drugs for AMT are aspirin and clopidogrel. The aspirin and clopidogrel will be given orally at a dose of 100mg and 75mg per day respectively for 3 months. </comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size is estimated on the following considerations. Among the ICAS patients with symptomatic severe stenosis (70%99%), one-year risk in medication arm is 18% for WASID study and one-year risk in stent arm is 6%. That produces a 12% difference between the two arms. Power calculation (80%) for sample size was performed based on a two-sided test at the 5% level of significance. The sample size per group is estimated to be 90. If the rate of lost follow-up or early withdrawal is set at 10%, a total of 198 participants will be needed in the RCT. The preference will not be applied sample size limitations, we include as many participants as possible. In the primary analysis, we used propensity score adjustment to control for potential selection bias due to nonrandom treatment assignment in the preference cohort. The propensity-score derivation model was constructed with the use of multivariable logistic regression, with the primary outcome as the dependent variable. We made an a priori decision to include the baseline parameters along with a variable indicating whether the patient had undergone randomization. Additional variables, with no missing values, that will be unbalanced between the study groups at a significance level of 0.05 will also be considered for inclusion. The treatment effect is defined as the odds of the primary outcome as a function of the treatment received, with adjustment for the duration of follow-up and quintiles of the propensity score.
The log-rank test will be used to compare the treatment groups for the primary and secondary endpoints. Cumulative probabilities based on estimates of the primary endpoint from the Kaplan-Meier curves at specific time points (years 1 and 2) will be compared between the treatment groups with a Z test. We will investigate longitudinal differences in risk factors between the treatment groups using generalized estimating equation regression models with an exchangeable correlation structure. Subgroup analyses for pre-specified baseline factors will be done by fitting a Cox proportional hazards regression model that included treatment, a treatment by time interaction (because the proportional hazards assumption for the treatment was not met), the factor, and the treatment by factor interaction (the p value for which is reported in this paper). All analyses will be performed by intention to treat. All reported p values are two-sided without adjustment for multiple testing.
Three pre-specified sensitivity analyses will be used to generate data for patients withdrawing or becoming lost to follow-up. First, all patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn will be considered to have had a primary endpoint at last contact. Second, only patients in the PTAS group will be considered to have had a primary endpoint at last contact. Third, only patients in the medical group will be considered to have had a primary endpoint at last contact. Additionally, we will use a simulation approach in which a hazard rate per month for the primary endpoint is estimated for each treatment group from available data for all patients with patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn censored at their last study visit. For each patient lost to follow-up or withdrawn, we will randomly determine whether a primary endpoint occur for each study month according to the hazard rate. If a simulated primary endpoint does occur in any month, the patient is censored at the longest possible follow-up time. The simulated data for patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn will be combined with the actual data for the remaining patients and the p value for the log-rank test comparing the treatment groups and the probabilities of a primary endpoint by 2 years were computed. We will used SPSS (version 20.0) and R project (version3.1.0) for all statistical analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: Recent studies indicated that endovascular stenting is inferior to aggressive medication for reducing cerebrovascular events in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis(ICAS). However, a high rate of postprocedure complications and a biased selection of patients raised concerns about the accuracy and stability of the results. Hence, we designed a randomized controlled trial and a preference cohort to examine the effectiveness and safety of an improved protocol of angioplasty and stenting for patients with ICAS.
Methods and analysis: This study will be performed in 2 parts, a randomized controlled trial and a preference cohort. In the randomized controlled trial, ICAS patients will be randomized assigned to an angioplasty and stenting group (PTAS) and an aggressive medical treatment group (AMT), after screened by a strict selection criteria. The ICAS patients who are ineligible to the trial will be suggested for a preference to PTAS or AMT, and therefore be included in a preference cohort study. The PTAS will be performed in 3 to 5 days after enrolment, while the AMT will be initiated at the enrolment day. The primary outcome of this study is events of stroke or death within 30 days after enrolment. The secondary outcomes included the incidence of recurrent ischaemic stroke in the territory of the stenosis arteries between 30 days and 2 years postoperatively, the restenosis rate and health-related quality of life during the 2-years follow-up period.
Ethics and dissemination: The protocol of this study is approved by the institutional review boards of the participating centers. The results will be disseminated to patients, clinical practitioners and policymakers through publications in journals or conference papers. It is anticipated that the results will improve current PTAS quality and guide clinical decisions for choosing treatments for ICAS patients. </summary>
