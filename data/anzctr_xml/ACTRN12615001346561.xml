  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will occur over a duration of 10 months. 

a. Training GPs:  GPs in the intervention arm will complete a 6 hour interactive online training program about delivering structured contraceptive counselling with an emphasis on the effectiveness of LARCs. The training is an Australian adaption of materials from the 'LARC first' online training site of the successful US Contraceptive CHOICE study. Modules within the training program include: 
* The problem of unintended pregnancies
* What are long-acting reversible contraceptives?
* Learn the advantages and disadvantages of available birth control options
* Learn how to expedite access to chosen contraceptive
* Long-acting reversible contraceptive insertion and removal
* Addressing patient and GP concerns
* Scenarios depicting the delivery of structured contraceptive counselling 

The online training module will be available to GPs from March 2016 until December 2016. While it is recommended that GPs complete the training in one session.  If required, GPs may pause their training and return to continue the program at a later time.  
When a GP in the intervention group completes the online training he or she will receive face-to-face training from a project coordinator regarding enrolling patient participants in the study. Additional practice visits, email and telephone support will be available to GPs in the intervention arm, as requested by the GP.
To ensure fidelity of the counselling, random visits to GPs in the intervention arm will be conducted and all GPs will be asked to complete a checklist of items related to the counselling they have provided to participating women. 

b. Facilitating rapid referral to LARC insertion: Rapid referral pathways to study specific LARC insertion clinics will be established for GPs in the intervention arm who do not undertake LARC insertions in their own rooms.  
GPs will book online appointments for women to have a LARC insertion at a study-specific LARC insertion clinic provided in the rooms of local gynaecologists.
Women seeking contraception, or a change in contraceptive method, will be recruited to each arm  they will all be able to choose their preferred method of contraception.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Individual GPs will be the unit of randomisation. 

After recruitment each GP will be randomly allocated to one of two arms: (1) intervention arm and be trained to deliver ‘LARC First’ structured contraceptive counselling and have access to rapid referral pathways, or (2) control arm and deliver usual contraceptive care.

A statistician not directly involved with the recruiting process, and blinded to the identity of the GPs, will generate and hold a randomization list. As each GP is recruited, the statistician will be notified and they will allocate the GP to the intervention or control arm according to the next spot on the randomization list.

Women who are patients of participating GPs, and who visit the participating GP during the study enrolment period, will be recruited for each arm.
</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization sequence will be generated using permuted blocks stratified by whether or not the GP inserts LARCs (IUDs or implants). The computer program Rand.exe (ref: S Piantadosi. Clinical Trials: A Methodologic Perspective) will be used to generate the randomization sequence.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The trial requires 24 GPs and 24 women per GP in each of the two study arms (intervention and control) to detect a change in the LARC insertion rate from 10% to 20%, with 80% power and a significance level of 5%. This will allow for the stratification by whether or not the GP inserts LARCs (IUD or Implants) and a clustering effect (intra-cluster correlation (ICC)) of 0.05. Accordingly, the study will recruit 27 GPs and 27 women per GP in each of the two study arms to allow for up to a 10% drop-out among GPs (based on researcher experience) and a 5% drop-out among women. A low drop-out rate among the women has been assumed because the primary outcome (i.e. LARC insertion) will be scheduled soon after the consultation, and the data for this outcome will be derived from GP and clinic records rather than through participant follow up.
The Chi-square test adjusted for clustering will be used for the primary analysis (to compare the proportion of women who have had a LARC inserted) and the binary secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses of possible mediating variables will be carried out using binary regression models with generalised estimating equations and robust standard errors to account for clustering.
The costs and outcomes of the intervention and control will be compared in a cost-effectiveness analysis. The economic evaluation will utilise a trial-based analysis followed by the construction of a decision model to extrapolate future costs and benefits beyond the completion of the trial.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adapted from the successful US Contraceptive CHOICE study, ACCORd is a cluster randomised control trial of a complex intervention that involves training GPs to provide Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) First structured contraceptive counselling to women seeking contraception and implementing rapid referral pathways to LARC insertion. Participating GPs will be randomly allocated to either the intervention (online LARC First training and rapid referral pathways) or control arm (usual care). Participants (women) will be recruited from each arm.

We hypothesise that:
1. Women who receive 'LARC First' structured contraceptive counselling are more likely to choose LARCs as their contraceptive method;
2. Improved referral pathways for LARC insertion will facilitate LARC uptake amongst Australian women.</summary>

There is no minimum or maximum age restrictions for GPs, however, women need to be aged between 16 - 45 years to be eligible to participate.

Target Sample Size
Sample comprises 54 GPs and 1458 women giving a total of 1,512 participants.
