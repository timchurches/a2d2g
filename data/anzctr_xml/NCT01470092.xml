  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Longitudinal epidemiological studies have shown that many women experience significant
      physical and psychological changes as they approach menopause and for a long time following.
      Vasomotor symptoms (such as hot flushes, night sweats), sleep disturbances and changes in
      libido are common, and impact significantly on the quality of life, social and personal
      well-being. However, the major reason that many women seek help from menopause clinics or
      their doctors, is for depression and anxiety symptoms. As such, treatment commonly draws on
      traditional approaches for the management of major depression including the use of
      antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or Selective
      Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) as the first line response. However, standard
      treatment of menopausal depression using antidepressants has only shown small improvements at
      best and at worst, is associated with severe side effects. Some SSRIs have been shown to be
      less effective in postmenopausal women compared to child bearing age women.

      Newer therapies directly targeting the disrupted hormonal systems (in particular estrogen)
      through the administration of such compounds as tibolone, have shown significant potential to
      treat depression with the added benefit of fewer adverse side effects. With growing evidence
      supporting the use of tibolone as a viable and improved treatment for menopausal depression,
      the investigators propose to investigate the potential of tibolone, a selective Hormone
      Replacement Therapy (HRT), to ameliorate de-novo or first onset depression occurring in the
      menopausal period.</summary>
