  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of four weeks of bright light exposure with light-emitting glasses (blue-green 500 nm dominant wavelength; 506 Lux lm/m^2) upon awakening and progressive shift to earlier wake-up times. 

Participants are encouraged to complete the light exposure sessions for 60 minutes each day, but are asked to engage in these sessions even if they do have to interrupt them earlier. Participants are also instructed to progressively shift their schedule 15 minutes earlier every day. This shift continues until the end of the four weeks of the intervention, or stops if the target wake-up time of 7.30am is reached (in which case, participants are instructed to keep a stable wake-up and light session schedule at 7.30am for the remainder of the intervention). If participants already wake-up before 7.30am at study entry, they are instructed to keep their wake-up times stable and do the light exposure sessions upon awakening across the four weeks of the intervention.

During the intervention, participants are asked to note down the start and stop times of each bright light exposure session in a daily diary.  Adherence is also monitored and promoted through weekly phone calls.

    <statisticalmethods>The core analyses will consist of:
a) Assessment of changes in level of depression (QIDS)

b) Correlations between changes in sleep-phase actigraphy variables (i.e. sleep onset, sleep offset, acrophase; i.e. baseline measure minus week-4 measure) and changes in QIDS scores (i.e. baseline measure minus week-4 measure)

c) Correlations between initial sleep-phase actigraphy variables (i.e. sleep onset, sleep offset, acrophase at baseline) and changes in self-reported depressive symptoms (i.e. baseline measure minus week-4 measure) 

d) Correlations between changes in subjective sleep and fatigue (i.e. Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire  score
 and Fatigue Severity Scale score) (i.e. baseline measure minus week-4 measure) and changes in self-reported depressive symptoms (i.e. baseline measure minus week-4 measure) 

e) Repeated measures ANOVAs comparing QIDS scores, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire scores  and Fatigue Severity Scale scores at baseline and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.
 
Power calculations based on reported correlations between circadian realignment and antidepressant response after morning bright light exposure (Terman, 2001) suggest that a sample size of 38 participants would be required to detect a correlation at a = .05 with a power of 0.80.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bright light therapy is an established treatment pathway for sleep and circadian disorders and evidence suggests that it has antidepressant effects. The underlying mechanisms of these antidepressant effects are not fully understood and results from previous studies are somewhat variable. One of the important limitations of previous depression studies has been the heterogeneity of samples in which bright light therapy has been administered.

The main aim of this study is to evaluate whether the antidepressant effects of phototherapy in young persons with depression are modulated by changes in the sleep-wake cycle. We hypothesize that more pronounce initial sleep-phase delay will predict better antidepressant response to phototherapy and that the magnitude of changes in depressive symptoms across the course of the intervention will correlate with changes in the sleep-wake cycle.
