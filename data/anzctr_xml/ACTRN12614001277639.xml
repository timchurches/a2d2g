  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Group which comprises of modules on: a) Mindfulness; b) Interpersonal Effectiveness; c) Emotion Regulation; and d)Distress Tolerance. 

The skills group will be delivered in the form of weekly workshops lead by a face-to-face by a external clinical psychologist facilitator. The workshops will be 1 hour in duration and go for a period of 10 weeks.

The sessions will be audio recorded and verified for treatment fidelity by an independent research, not connected to the trial.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The expected sample will comprise of approximately 100 participants. This sized sample was selected as it represents the largest sample manageable to present the workshops to as an entire group. The study is a feasibility study and so the main objective is to evaluate the ease with which this material can be presented to this population and observe some trends on the outcome measures. As such no power analysis was used.

The principle analysis will be a between factors, repeated measures MANOVA statistical analysis. This will be used to determine if self-report mental health changes between the different time points (pre- and post-intervention, 6-month, and 12-month) are significantly different between the control and experimental conditions. Baseline psychopathology will be controlled for to separate the participants who are unwell at the start of treatment from those who are healthy, allowing efficacy of the program to reduce existing symptoms to be established in addition to its ability to prevent the occurrence of future episodes. Prevention of mental health disorders will be assessed using the symptom cut-off of relevant measures. A second set of analysis will use MANOVAs to examine improvements on wellbeing using the Flourishing Scale. A final analysis employing Thematic Analysis will examine the qualitative data to explore reported improvements in functioning and satisfaction with the program. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>High school students from a Sydney school will be recruited to participate in the study. Students will be randomly allocated to either control or intervention condition. The intervention group will receive 10 hours of the intervention over a school term. The intervention is a Dialectical Behaviour Skills Group, which includes training of skills in 4 domains: Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotion Regulation, and Distress Tolerance. A large volume of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of these skills in improving emotion regulation, interpersonal relationships, and wellbeing. It is expected that this evaluation will demonstrate an improvement of wellbeing and decrease in psychopathology symptoms in the intervention group compared to control participants.</summary>
