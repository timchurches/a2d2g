  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Employment status, work hours and self-reported disability/limitations affecting ability to work.  The outcomes are assessed via telephone and postal questionnaires using validated data items from Australian government surveys (e.g. ABS Labour Force Survey, ABS 1999 Survey of Living Standards) and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Factors affecting work participation and time to work re-entry assessed with validated tools during telephone and postal questionnaires.  The tools include the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale and items on work circumstances using Australian government surveys (e.g. ABS Labour Force Survey, ABS 1999 Survey of Living Standards) along with standard questions on socio-demographic information.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cancer affects 1 in 6 Australian adults of working age yet we know very little about the impact of a cancer diagnosis on their future working life. It has been estimated that up to 60% of workers diagnosed with cancer will not return to work and, while many people do successfully resume their work activities after cancer, many experience delayed and difficult work re-entry, forced retirement, workplace discrimination and impaired ability to work. Loss of skilled people from the workforce is an important issue not only for individuals and families dealing with cancer but also for Australias future productivity.  This research addresses the work experiences of a large group of middle-aged individuals who are in the labour force when they are diagnosed with colorectal cancer compared to a matched, general-population reference group.</summary>
