  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participant intervention: Participants will receive two assessment sessions.  Depending on which group (intervention or active control) they will receive one of the two following sessions.  They will have a one-week washout period, and then return for the remaining session
Intervention session: Participants will receive a chiropractic assessment and spinal manipulation where deemed appropriate.  Assessment includes; orthopedic testing, neurological testing, manual palpation of the spine and range of motion of the spine.  The spinal manipulation involves a high speed, very low amplitude manual force to be applied to a specific spinal joint.  Specific spinal joints are manipulated on the basis of aberrant findings from the assessment
Active control session: where the body is moved through various positions to provide motion and vestibular input, but no chiropractic manipulation/adjustment input
Attending Chiropractor: Registered chiropractor with at least 10yrs experience and postgraduate training in pediatrics.
Session duration: approximately 60minutes
Strategies for adherence: The study will be discussed at the weekly meeting of the executive team at the Centre for Chiropractic Research. Any issue with adherence will be discussed at, or between, these meetings so appropriate action can be taken.  If action needs to be taken the co-investigator with attempt to contact the participant/guardian by their preferred contact modality.</interventions>
    <comparator>Children will undergo a series of passive and active movements of the head, spine, and body carried out by the same chiropractor that assesses the experimental intervention group. This control intervention involves the participants being moved into the manipulation setup positions but without delivering an adjustment/manipulation thrust into any spinal joints. No spinal manipulation will be performed during any control. This control intervention is not intended to act as a sham manipulation but to act as a physiological control for possible changes occurring due to the cutaneous, muscular or vestibular input that will occur with the passive and active movements involved in preparing a participant for a manipulation. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Efficacy of a single chiropractic session on the control of eye movement in children aged 8-15 years with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
This study seeks to investigate whether a single session of chiropractic can alter eye-tracking ability in children with ADHD.  Children with ADHD have poor eye-tracking ability (they can't move their eyes smoothly and easily), resulting in difficulties with reading tasks.  This may be associated with their poorer educational, vocational and quality of life gains.
We hypothesise that a single session of chiropractic spinal manipulation will improve eye-tracking ability in children with ADHD.  We intend to assess eye tracking before and after a chiropractic session or control (no chiropractic intervention) using a computerised eye tracking system while children are performing a simple reading task.  This study will use a cross-over design, which means participants will have one session of having their eyes tested before and after a chiropractic session, will wait a week, then have another session where they have their eyes tested before and after a control (just movements, no chiropractic) session.</summary>
