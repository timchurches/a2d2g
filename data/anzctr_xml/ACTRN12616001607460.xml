    <interventions>Intervention Group: Proactive engagement group
Survivor-support person dyads allocated to proactive engagement group will receive the materials including: Stroke Foundations My Stroke Journey workbook, a follow-up phone call from the Stoke Foundation from the Stroke Connect Service at 6 weeks post discharge from hospital and access to enableme web portal. The intervention group will receive individual, face to face education regarding use of the web portal at the time of allocation by identified clinic staff (for example the Stroke Coordinator) at participating centres (Approx 15mins). In addition the proactive engagement group will be shown a short informational clips introducing the web portal and its functionality (10 mins). Participants will access the web portal online as required for the duration of the intervention period (12 months). The website includes information about stroke, treatments, forums for communications with others, and goal setting functions. Proactive strategies will be used throughout the intervention period to encourage use of the web portal. Proactive engagement strategies include: a letter from their stroke physicians, short message service (SMS) or email reminders to access the portal if usage is low, and letter which provides feedback regarding their use of the portal at 3, 6 and 9 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Group: Usual care group
Survivor-support person dyads allocated to the usual care group will receive usual care plus the Stroke Foundations My Stroke Journey workbook. Usual care may include referral to rehabilitation services. education and provision about Stroke Foundation resources. The enableme portal is publicly available, access will not be restricted. However, participants in usual care group will not receive prompts regarding access.

    <statisticalmethods>Age, type of stroke and stroke severity will be compared between consenters and non-consenters using a t-test (or a non-parametric equivalent) for continuous variables and the chi-square test (or fishers exact test) for categorical variables. 
Characteristics of the stroke survivors and SPs will be compared between experimental groups using means, standard deviations, medians and interquartile intervals for continuous variables and by percentages for categorical variables.
Between-group differences in the proportion of depressed participants will be assessed at all post baseline study time points using separate logistic regressions for survivors and SPs.
Differences in quality of life at each post-randomisation period will be assessed using a linear regression model.
Multivariable linear mixed effects regression models will be used to identify whether use of Enable Me and/or patient demographic and diagnosis factors are associated with scores on the PHQ-9, or the SF-12. 
The Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) will model costs and outcomes for the duration of the trial and for a 10-year period, discounting future costs and health outcomes at a rate of 3% per year. The costs and health outcomes will be summed to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), in dollars per QALY gained. Monte Carlo analysis will be used to derive 95% uncertainty intervals for all outcomes and to determine the probability of intervention cost-effectiveness against a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 per QALY. ICER results are displayed on a cost-effectiveness plane with affordability issues addressed in an acceptability curve. The results of the CEA will be considered in the context of: strength of evidence; capacity of the intervention to reduce inequity; acceptability to stakeholders; feasibility; and sustainability.
Sample size: Using a conservative estimate (i.e. 70% of eligible survivor-patient dyads will consent), 850 dyads will be approached in order to recruit 600 dyads (300 dyads per group) at baseline. Allowing for 20% attrition by 3 months follow up, 30% by 6 months and 40% by 12 months due to death, loss to follow up and study withdrawal, a sample of 240 per group at 3 month follow up, 210 per group at 6 months follow up and 180 per group at 12 months follow up will be available. For depression, assuming a baseline prevalence of 30%, we will have 80% power to detect a prevalence difference of 10% at 3 months for survivors and less than 10% for SPs (assuming lower prevalence of depression in SPs) at the 2.5% significance level.  For survivors and SPs we will have 80% power to detect differences between groups of 0.3 SD in QOL at 3 months; 0.33 SD at 6 months, and 0.35 SD at 12 months at a 2.5% significance level. Consent rates between 70% and 90% have been reported in previous studies in this population.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine whether using an intervention that aims to increase optimal discharge support for stroke survivors and their support person (SP) impacts positively on depression, anxiety, quality of life and costeffectiveness. Optimal care includes the use of the  Stroke Foundation My Stroke Journey workbook whilst an inpatient, use of the  Enable Me portal after discharge, and receipt of a followup phone call 6 weeks after hospital discharge.

Stroke survivorSP pairs will be recruited prior to survivor discharge from stroke units. Pairs will be randomised to receive usual care or the intervention. Participants in the intervention group will receive clinician facilitated use of the My Stroke Journey workbook. Intervention participants will also receive facilitated access to Enable Me and proactive strategies to encourage use, including: a personalised letter from their stroke physician, short message service or email reminders to access the portal and letters which provide feedback to survivors and SPs on their usage of the portal. The wording used within the proactive strategies will be developed in conjunction with stroke clinicians and the Stroke Foundation. Lastly, intervention participants will receive a followup phone call from the  Stroke Foundation to ensure survivors and their SPs are connected with the appropriate resources and support. The control group will receive usual care including provision of the my Stroke Journey Workbook and the 6 week phone call. Survivors and their SPs will complete an iPad facilitated webbased survey at baseline (whilst an inpatient) and followup webbased, phone or pen and paper surveys at 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline. Quality of life, depression, anxiety and health care utilisation costs among stroke survivors and their SPs will be compared at 3, 6 and 12 months postbaseline. The outcomes of this study may inform strategies to encourage uptake of the portal in stroke units Australiawide.
