  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group A [test] received topical test treatment with kunzea oil (twice daily), and group B [control] applied control medication, amorolfine lacquer (weekly) for 40+/-2 weeks.


Neat kunzea oil (100%; steam distilled and commercially produced in Tasmania from the bush plant Kunzea ambigua), patients were given instructions to apply the oil twice daily (morning and evening) for 40+/- 2 weeks.


Compliance:Furthermore, compliance to the treatment protocol was encouraged by bi-monthly telephone calls and letters. Furthermore, the research assistant reminded the subjects of the importance of adhering to the treatment protocol at each of their follow-up visits to the podiatry clinic.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients were given instructions to apply the Loceryl Nail Lacquer (containing 5% amorolfine), once weekly  following nail filing for 40+/- 2 weeks.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary efficacy variable was mycological cure (negative mycology) at week 40'+/-'2 weeks.

The primary outcome was assessed by culturing the nail clippings (by following the standard microbiology procedure at Royal Hobart Hospital) collected from patients' target toenails before commencing the therapy and after 40'+/-'2 weeks. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Time-point: at baseline  and 40'+/-' 2 weeks after randomisation </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical severity score.

Clinical signs were graded on a visual analogue scale (0 4).
This was based on a Visual analogue scale (VAS) previously used in a clinical trial as a secondary outcome. The VAS used is a 10 cm long straight line, marked at each end with labels which anchor the scale.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in healthy nail (clear) area.

 The unaffected (clear) toenail area was measured using standardised digital photographs, because not all of the tracings included the clear nail area.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>changes in symptomatic nail (diseased) area 

An adhesive sterile transparent film (OpSite Flexifix) was placed over the infected nail surface and the perimeter was traced. The areas of the tracings were determined by the cut-and-weigh technique.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients with onychomycosis who were willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol were recruited into the study following a local newspaper advertisement. Of the 130 subjects who gave consent and provided a nail specimen for mycological screening, 93 subjects had mycological confirmation of onychomycosis and were randomly assigned to the trial medications. 
Test formulations were prepared in the compounding pharmaceutical laboratory in the School of Pharmacy, University of Tasmania, under the supervision of a registered pharmacist. The control formulations (Loceryl 'Registered Trademark') were obtained from the commercial supplier (Galderma Pty Ltd, Belrose, NSW, Australia). The study medications were packed in identical containers and the code was kept secure by a staff member (based at University of Tasmania) who was not part of the research team. When patients entered into the trial (after eligibility assessment and wash-out period), the clinical investigatorâ€™s office contacted the university staff to send the medications (via express registered post) directly to the patients. The same method was followed for the additional supply of medications to study subjects. This enabled the clinical investigator (performing assessments) and other study personnel to be blinded throughout the study period.

    <sequence>Once informed written consent had been obtained, the inclusion/exclusion criteria and baseline assessments have been satisfied /completed, the participants were randomly allocated into one of two groups (test or control) using a computer-generated randomisation schedule.

Randomisation was provided by the study Sponsor, using an independent statistician.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Onychomycosis is a common nail infection. Current topical therapies are largely ineffective, systemic drugs have significant safety risks, and are limited in broader range of patients. A safe, relatively inexpensive, alternative topical treatment is required to minimise treatment failures and relapses, and also as an adjuvant treatment to improve cure rates. The present study compared the efficacy and safety of topical kunzea oil (twice daily) with amorolfine (once weekly) for the management onychomycosis (study duration 40' +/-' 2 weeks). The study recruited patients from single site (Royal Hobart Podiatry). </summary>
