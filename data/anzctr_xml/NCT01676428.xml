Experimental: Radiotherapy - The interventional treatment will be prescribed as a 2-tiered dose scheduled dependant of target size.
For lesions &lt;5cm, a single fraction of 26 Gy will be prescribed. For lesions =5cm a fractionated course of 15Gy by 3 fractions will be prescribed, delivered at least 48 hours apart.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of patients who complete prescribed treatment. - This is defined as patients who successfully receive the treatment plan as prescribed, achieving all nominated dose constraints, and are able to tolerate the treatment(s)</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 24 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity of SBRT in study patients measured using CTCAE V4.0 - Specific toxicities will include, but are not limited to;
Gastrointestinal (Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, acute ulceration)
Pulmonary (atelectasis, cough, dyspnoea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, fibrosis)
Skin/chest wall (radiation dermatitis, rib fracture)
Kidney (acute renal dysfunction) Freedom from severe toxicity will be reported asn defined as: time from treatment delivery until first recorded grade 4, or 5 toxicity as measured by CTCAE V4.0.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between 2-4 weeks after radiotherapy and 3 monthly for 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery - Effective SBRT is defined as a treatment which results in local control at 1 year after treatment. Local control is defined as lack of progression of the target lesion as measured by RECIST criteria. RECIST criteria are a CT evaluation of change in tumour size.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year after treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of using Diffusion weighted-MRI for response assessment. - Feasibility will be measured by the quality of image of the diffusion weighted-MRI recorded by the investigating radiologists.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Baseline, 14 days (+/-3 days) and at the definitive response assessment (70days +/-10days)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a "proof of concept" study, to assess the feasibility of introducing a novel
      high-precision radiotherapy technique called "stereotactic radiosurgery" (SRS) or
      "stereotactic body radiotherapy" (SBRT) for the treatment of kidney cancers in Australia.
      This study aims to invite 20 patients with renal cell carcinoma and 10 patients with isolated
      adrenal metastases from non-small cell carcinoma who are either medically inoperable, high
      risk for surgery, or decline surgery to participate. In cohort of patients with renal cell
      carcinoma, both patients with primary disease only, and those patients who have limited
      metastases (=5) will be eligible. Besides technical feasibility of delivering this treatment,
      this study will be to assess efficacy, toxicity and tumour response using a novel imaging
      biomarker called diffusion weighted-MRI.</summary>
