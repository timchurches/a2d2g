  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: contra-lateral use of a cane to unload the affected medial knee compartment. Participants will be instructed to use the cane daily whenever walking for 3 months. Cane use and possible adverse events will be monitored in self-reported log books. Participants will receive reminders during the intervention to maximize adherence to cane use.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Intervention:no use of any gait aids. Participants allocated to the control group will be instructed to maintain their normal lives and to not use any gait devices or gait aids for 3 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major and costly cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain and disability in Australia. Patient self-management strategies are urgently needed. In knee OA, increased joint loading (forces acting across the joint) leads to worse knee pain and progressive structural joint deterioration. This project will investigate the impact of daily cane use, an easy and inexpensive self-help tool known to unload the knee, applied for 3 months on bone marrow lesion size on MRI in people with medial knee OA. </summary>
