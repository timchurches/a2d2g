    <studytitle>An investigation of the clinical utility of the electronic toilet top bidet for use with Australian nursing home residents and staff.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>For nursing home residents, does consistent use of the electronic wash and dry toilet top bidet clean more effectively after voiding bladder or bowels and reduce bacteriurea, incontinence associated dermatitis and cost of incontinence products than usual toileting care?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The electronic, wash-and-dry toilet top bidet will be used by nursing home staff after each toileting episode for residents. The bidet used in this investigation is a toilet seat replacement that provides a heated seat; two retractable, self cleaning nozzles that provide a thermostatically controlled warm water wash of the perineum or perianal area after voiding bladder or bowels; and a warm air blower to dry the user after washing. The bidet is operated by a remote control unit. The bidet to be used is the Coway BA-08.  Effects of use of the bidet on cleanliness, bacteriurea, incontinence-associated dermatitis and other effects will be observed over a 12-week intervention period. </interventions>
    <comparator>No bidet, usual toileting care which consists of wiping with toilet paper, washing the perineum with damp face washers/proprietary wipes and/or application of topical emollients where indicated.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This proposed investigation will build upon a previous feasibility study to explore acceptance, use, clinical utility (including effects of bidet use on asymptomatic bacteria in urine) and associated costs of the electronic toilet top wash-and-dry bidet by residents and staff of Australian residential aged care facilities, as a method of improving the toileting experience for older, frail and/or cognitively impaired residents of aged care facilities and staff.
