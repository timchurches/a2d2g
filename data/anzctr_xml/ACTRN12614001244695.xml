  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Problem Management Plus. Arm 2: Enhanced Treatment as Usual. Therapy is administered once-weekly over
5 weeks on an individual 90 minute basis. Problem Management Plus includes skills in identifying emotional and practical problems that can be managed and strategies to reduce and cope with these problems. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after immediate post-trial follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 1.5 months.  Therapy is provided by local health workers.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Enhanced Treatment as Usual comprises normal treatment provided by local physicians who will receive a single 2-day refresher training workshop on identification and management of mental disorders.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after post-trial follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 1.5 months.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be adults attend primary health care centers and indicating moderate distress &amp; impaired functioning.

    <sequence>Participants will be randomized by an independent research assistant, not involved in the assessments. There is no stratification in this pilot trial. Randomisation will occur by a randomisation table created by a computerised sequence. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT of a low intensity intervention to reduce mental health problems in people in low-resources settings.  This study compares the relative efficacy of (a) Problem Management Plus, and (b) Enhanced Treatment as Usual.  It is hypothesised that Problem Management Plus will lead to greater symptom reduction than Enhanced Treatment as Usual.</summary>
