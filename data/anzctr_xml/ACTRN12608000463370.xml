  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a two-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of zoledronate for erosive gout.  The study will include 100 participants with tophaceous gout; 50 randomly assigned to annual administration of iv zoledronate 5mg, and 50 assigned to annual administration of placebo (0.9%NaCl).  Participants will undergo clinical assessment, laboratory testing and radiographic assessment of bone erosion (by CT and plain radiography) at baseline, and after 1 and 2 years.  
Zoledronate (5mg) or placebo (0.9% NaCl) will be administered intravenously over 15 minutes during the baseline and year 1 visits. The study duration is 2 years. The primary endpoint will be the change from baseline in total CT erosion score, in the zoledronate group compared to the control group.</summary>
