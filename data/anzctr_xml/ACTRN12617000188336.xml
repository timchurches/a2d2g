  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patient keeps sitted. The osteopath will contact with his hands over the esophagogastric junction (on the abdomen) sliding it down. The aim of these technique is to improve distensibility and range of motion. The patient is required to take deep breaths during the intervention
The technique will be applied 10 motion repeated, during 5 minutes in two sessions. 
Second session will take place one week later. Patients are expected to adhere the study over those two sessions. If any of them leave the study, without appearing to any of the sessions in the time agreed, they will be excluded. 
There won´t be any strategies in order to maintain fidelity. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to verify the positive effect of one osteopathic technique in patients suffering from Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. 
The technique consists on deep breathings of the patient while the osteopath with his fingers slides down the esophagogastric junction. The patient keeps sitted during the process. 
In order to measure and evaluate the evolution: 
- patients will answer the GERDQ(gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire), 
- algometer will evaluate pain threshold in external auditory canal, dorsal vertebras and upper trapezious muscle. 
- goniometer will study neck mobility 
These measurements will take place before and after the first treatment session. This will be repeated one week later in the second session. The GERDq will be answered in each session. 
At least 40 patients will be recruited. Then statistic analysis will be developed in order to confirm or refuse the technique utility. </summary>
