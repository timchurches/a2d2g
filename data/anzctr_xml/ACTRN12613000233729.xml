  <interventions>
    <interventions>supervised core strengthening program run by an exercise scientist twice per week for 8 weeks
versus
home based intervention consisting of one initial instruction session and written instructions for a home based program of 2 sessions per week for 8 weeks

The instruction session for the home-based group took place in the first week of the intervention and consisted of verbal instructions and demonstrations of the exercises in the program, including feedback on exercise execution. They were also shown how to record the exercises executed during their training sessions in their exercise journal.

The core strengthening programs for the supervised group and the home based group are identical (except for the supervision vs written instructions) and consist of:
Warm up; cat/camel and abdominal contractions (supine, quadruped and side bridge on knees)
The exercises consisted of Dead bug, side bridging, bird-dog, hip abduction in side lying, lunges and stability ball exercises. The number of sets and duration of contractions were gradually increased throughout the 8 week program, as was the complexity of the exercises. 

All exercise sessions were designed to take approximately 25 minutes to complete, so total training time was 2 x 25 minutes per week for 8 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Poor core stability is associated with dysfunction and weakness of muscles of the trunk, pelvis and hip (core muscles) and the development of lower limb pathology and low back pain. Core strengthening programs aim to prevent injury and  increase stability through improved strength and co-ordination of core muscle activity (Faries &amp; Greenwood, 2007). However, the delivery method of training programs is highly variable and despite widespread use, the evidence for injury treatment and prevention with core strengthening programs is inconclusive. This may be due to the heterogeneity of delivery methods of programs used as the intervention. Investigation of the most effective delivery method of core strengthening programs is required to enable accurate evaluation of efficacy core strengthening interventions. The aim of this project is to compare the effect of supervised core strengthening classes, a home-based core strengthening program and no intervention on specific measures of core stability. It is hypothesised that supervised classes will 1) result in a greater improvement in performance in tests assessing core strength, and  2) increased transversus abdominus (TrA) hypertrophy when compared to a home-based program and no intervention.
