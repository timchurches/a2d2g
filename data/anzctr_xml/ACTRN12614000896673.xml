    <comparator>"Learning and Success in Health Faculties"program was developed during the preparation for this study only. The program was only offered to those in the control group for the purposes of this study and it is not part of the University curriculum. It aims to provide information about learning in health faculties and the factors leading to success according to a scientific literature review. It also gives a brief on scientific research in public health field. All the information that is provided in the LSHF are scientifically validated materials that are taken from academic articles or academic books. The program is delivered as live course in a large lecture theatre at students free time where participants are supplied by each program's booklet and the program's audio CD.
Program modules are: (1) blooms' Taxonomy, (2) scientific data about variables association with success in health faculties such as the language, income, etc., with no practical points, (3) active learning potential use in health faculties, and (4) the importance of scientific research. CD contents are: 24 audio files resembling the content of the program. Program's conduction way is as the normal and standard university way of presenting a lecture that allow for short question to be answered be answered alone or in groups. The program is conducted in one day for 4 hours.

    <concealment>The study was advertised via large roll up posters and students were recruited at the first term via invitationâ€™s envelopes that contained coloured flyer about the programs, study information sheet and the consent form. After receiving participants signed consent, participated were randomly allocated into interventional group (IG) and control group (CG) by the principle investigator. 
When the principle investigator received students consent forms, participants listed were exactly as they were received without any manipulation or rearrangement to their IDs or for any reasons. After that,  the principle investigator generated a random numbers list (using excel commands) and put it in front of participants ID. It was determined before that each participant that got an odd number (from the random list) will be allocated to the study group, and each even number was allocated to the control group. This step was not influence any point in this process by any way, by rearranging or choosing specific list.

The students and research assistants who managed the study protocol and data collection were blinded. The intervention was conducted at the first week of the second term. Students knew their assigned group before the conducting both programs by one week. </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants were stratified into medical and dental strata, then randomised into interventional and control group using computer generated random number tables done by the principle investigator using Excel software. 
These numbers were random by chance. It was not based on students birthday, or their ID in the university or any other factor. After that, we put students list into the tables. Participants with odd number were allocated to the interventional group, with the participants with even number were allocated to the control group. 
Every student has a chance of 50% to be at either group. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>It should be note that the principle investigator who ran the intervention by himself was not blinded. However, the research assistants who advertised the study, helped in conducting the intervention, and collected the data, were blinded. 

Also, the students know their assigned group: Program A/ Program B, however, non of them know that "program A" was the main intervention. All students were invited to participate in this study that offered a chance to be on either groups on random bases. Each student who agreed to participate was informed with his program before a week of both program, so they would attend the program on the sepceific day and time. However, no student knew that this was that program A was the self-development program that we aimed to study. Students on both groups thought that researchers wanted to assess the effectivness of both groups. </designfeatures>

A sample size of 130 (65 at each group) participants was needed. A study power of 90 (B=0.1), alpha=0.05, minimal clinical difference of 4 points in any of the psychological health means, and an average standard deviation of 7 derived from a recent well-designed coaching RCT which used DASS-21. 130 was multiplied by 1.5 for the design effect (multiple follow-up).  This number was again multiplied by 1.5 for the estimated non-response rate (50%) and multiplied by 1.2 for estimated drop-out during the follow-up (20%), with the result that 351 students.</statisticalmethods>
