  <interventions>
    <interventions> The intervention will be Montelukast  given at a dose  of 20mg  or 40mg per day  orally with Gemfibrozil 600mg twice daily orally. The dose of Montelukast will start at 20mg and increase to 40mg if there is no toxicity at the 7 day review. The increased dose will be given until seven days after all subsequent chemotherapy cycles are administered. The study drugs will be given daily without interruption until seven days after the last chemotherapy agent is administered.. The dose can be reduced back to 20 mg a day if any significant side effects are observed.
Chemotherapy (CyBorD.) Montelukast and Gemfibrozil is given from day 1 until  day 28 of each cycle and 7 days after all chemotherapy planned is administered. The dose is increased from 20mg to 40mg if there is no toxicity at 7 days. It can be reduced back to 20mg if any subsequent toxicity is observed.
28 day cycle in all patients.
Bortezomib 1.3mg^m2 subcutaneous injection  on day 1,7,15,21 of each 21 day cycle. for two cycles
Cyclophosphamide 100mg given orally daily throughout treatment period for two cycles

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study aims to test whether Montelukast  and Gemfibrozil when added to  CyBorD chemotherapy (Bortezomib Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone  28 day cycle) induces responses in patients not responding to this chemotherapy. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18-80 years with progressive multiple myeloma after at least 8 weeks (two cycles) of treatment with a standard Bortezomib/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone chemotherapy. 

Study details
A total of 6 patients will be enrolled prior to a decision to expand or shut down the trial, depending on toxicity and response. Participants will receive further two cycles of CyBorD chemotherapy regimen with the addition of Montelukast. and Gemfibrozil..

Patients will be able to continue Montelukast and Gemfibrozil following completion if a response is observed depending on side effects

The hypothesis is that Montelukast which is an extremely well tolerated medication used to treat Asthma in all age groups, will sensitize patients tumour to chemotherapy which was previously shown to be resistant to the same therapy.</summary>
