    <studytitle>Is telephone consultation a safe, satisfactory and cost-effective alternative to outpatient review for follow up post emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy and cholecystectomy?  </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients who have received emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy or cholecystectomy, is telephone consultation at 10-14 days after operation more effective than outpatient clinic review in terms of patient satisfaction level, follow-up attendance rate, complication rate and cost?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Post-operative review by telephone consultation at day 10-14 after operation. Telephone consultation will be performed by surgical registrars or interns within a duration of 15 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>follow-up attendance rate. In outpatient review group, attendance will be defined by completion of post-operative review in clinic. In telephone consultation group, attendance will be defined by answering the follow-up telephone call and completing the review questionnaire. </outcome>
      <timepoint>10-14 days post operation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction. 

The outcome will be assessed in a "yes" or "no" manner. The percentage of patients who are satisfied with the review method will then be compared between the two groups. </outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks after initial follow-up at day 10-14 after operation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complication rate

The major theoretical concern with telephone review includes missing significant post-operative complications and poor communication. Although neither of these has been reported in the literature, they can potentially happen. 

In order to assess this, the patients will be asked about their progress 4 weeks after their initial follow-up. Any ongoing operation related issue or contact with medical service will be noted. In addition, patient will be asked about any concerns of communication during this survey. 

A non-validated satisfaction survey was designed specifically for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks after Initial follow-up at day 10-14 after operation
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>GP satisfaction rate

Again, the outcome will be assessed in a "yes" or "no" manner. The percentage of general practitioner who are satisfied with the review method will then be compared between the two groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at the end of trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>cost of consultation

Estimated cost of single session of outpatient clinic review can be obtained from Finance department of Monash Health. Cost of telephone consultation can be calculated from the hourly salary of registrar or intern and the duration of telephone contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>10-14 days post-operation</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients will be identified by surgical registrars on ASU. Once participants agree to participate in the trial, informed consent will be obtained and participant will be allocated to either telephone consultation or outpatient review.

Allocation concealment is achieved by the use of sealed opaque envelopes, which contains the participant's allocation number and follow-up method. Once participant is recruited into the study, the surgical registrar will open one of the envelops and inform the participant about their allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>On discharge of the participant from inpatient service, the patient will receive an envelope with their allocation detail. The ward clerk will book the patient for relevant review based on the allocation.

Sequence was generated randomly using a randomisation table created by computer software (computerised sequence generation).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Likely single-variance analysis as no obvious confounder can be identified

A sample size of 220 has been calculated based on the assumption of a 50% reduction in "Do Not Attend" rate for participants at post-operative review. This will produce a power of 88%.   </statisticalmethods>
