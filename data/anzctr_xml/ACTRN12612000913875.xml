  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients were implanted with an aspheric intraocular lens (IOL) Rayner 920H in one eye and a spherical IOL Rayner 620H in the fellow eye. These lenses are intraocular, so participants will be wearing the lenses for wholelife. IOL implantation is a single session going for 30 minutes. The eye implanted with the aspheric IOL was chosen at random for each patient. Rayner IOLs are single piece lenses composed of foldable hydrophilic acrylic material (refractive index, 1.46) with an overall length of 12.5 mm and optic diameter of 6.25 mm.

Recruitment period of the study is 1 year.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of cataract surgery is no longer limited to the restoration of good visual acuity; most surgeons now aim to provide their patients with the best visual quality possible. The maximization of visual quality  objectively assessed via contrast sensitivity measurement or wavefront aberrometry  is a key focus of new aspheric intraocular lens designs. Aspheric IOLs produce fewer positive spherical corneal aberrations than conventional spherical IOLs, and as such, produce better contrast sensitivity and visual acuity.

In this study we aimed to compare the levels of ocular aberrations and contrast sensitivity achieved with implantation of the Rayner 920H aspheric aberration-neutral IOL and the Rayner 620H spherical acrylic IOL in patients undergoing bilateral cataract surgery.</summary>
