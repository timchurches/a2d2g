             medical or surgical intervention during the 24-month study period to prevent or treat
             visual loss that might result from that condition, or (2) If allowed to progress
             untreated, could likely contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation
             of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk for treatment
             complications
