  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from Extension Study Baseline in Composite Score of a Broad Cognitive Test Battery - Composite scores will be derived from the test battery. Only the domains of episodic memory, executive function, language, attention and visuospatial will be used for the composite score. To form the composite, z-scores will be calculated for each test, each z-score for the domain will be averaged, and then all relevant domains will be averaged to form the composite.</outcome>
