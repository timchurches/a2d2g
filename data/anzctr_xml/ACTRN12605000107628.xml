  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overweight people are at risk of developing heart disease due to their predisposition of also having high blood pressure, high blood fats and high blood sugar levels. This project examines the role of certain fatty acid metabolites called cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid (CYP-450AA) in conditions associated with being overweight.  These fatty acid metabolites act on blood vessels causing them to constrict or dilate. In doing this they affect blood pressure regulation.  Being overweight or obese makes people vulnerable to developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study will examine CYP-450AA in overweight men and women before and after weight reduction compared with overweight volunteers who maintain their weight over the same time period. This will enable us to see if the levels of fatty acid metabolites that constrict blood vessels are altered and related to a fall in blood pressure after weight reduction. This project will help scientists decide how important these metabolites are for blood pressure regulation in overweight people.</summary>
