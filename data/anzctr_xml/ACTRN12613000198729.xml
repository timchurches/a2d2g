    <interventions>Patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma, positive for V600E or V600K BRAF mutation will have archived melanoma tissue tested for GD2 status. If the GD2 status is positive, a blood sample taken before treatment with vemurafenib tablets will be used to generate the T-cell product from the patients blood. During the 4-6 week period in which the GD2-specific T-cell product is being produced, the patient will be given vemurafenib orally at a dose of 960 mg twice daily (b.d.). Once prepared, the T-cell product will be administered at a dose appropriate for the cohort the patient has been assigned to.
Since this is a dose escalation study, patients are assigned to consecutive cohorts, each receiving a given dose level of  genetically modified GD2-specific T cells:
Cohort 1: Dose Level 1 - 1 x10^7 cells/m2
Cohort 1: Dose Level 2 - 2 x10^7 cells/m2
Cohort 1: Dose Level 3 - 1 x 10^8 cells/m2

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of this Phase I study is to assess the safety and immune effects of using autologous peripheral blood T cells in GD2 positive patients being treated with vemurafenib. Oral kinase inhibitors are proving to be effective in the up to 60% of malignant melanomas that are found to have a BRAF mutation. However, drug resistance is emerging and many patients relapse affirming the need for further treatment development.

Who is this study for and who is it open to?
This study is for patients with metastatic melanoma who are BRAF V600E or V600K positive and who are eligible to receive vemurafenib. Patients who consent to the study will be asked permission  to test their archived melanoma tissue for GD2 expression. If this test returns a positive result, the patient may then continue with the trial.

What will the patients receive?
Patients will receive vemurafenib at a dose of 960mg twice daily (b.d.) during the 4 to 6 week period in which the T-cell product is being prepared. Once produced, the T-cell product will be given as a single intravenous infusion at a dose relevant to the cohort that the patient has been assigned to. The patient will then be monitored as per the follow up schedule specified by the study protocol.</summary>
