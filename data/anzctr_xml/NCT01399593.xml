  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Eculizumab

Experimental: Eculizumab - Patients were to receive eculizumab 1200 mg prior to allograft transplantation (Day 0, starting approximately one hour prior to kidney allograft reperfusion), eculizumab 900 mg (Days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28), and eculizumab 1200 mg (Weeks 5, 7 and 9). All doses of eculizumab were administered intravenously: the median infusion time was 39 minutes.

No Intervention: Standard of Care - Patients received standard of care (SOC) prophylactic therapy for acute AMR according to the SOC choice at each participating investigative site, which could have included any combination of plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Patients randomized to SOC who were diagnosed with AMR could have received eculizumab for the treatment of AMR after initially receiving PP and/or IVIg.

      <outcome>Treatment Failure Rate - The primary efficacy variable was a binary outcome variable where patients meeting the composite endpoint of the occurrence of 1) biopsy-proven acute AMR, 2) graft loss, 3) patient death, or 4) loss to follow-up definition at Week 9 post-transplantation were considered treatment failures and all others were considered treatment successes.</outcome>
