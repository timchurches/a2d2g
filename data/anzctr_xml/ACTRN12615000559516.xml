  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study participants will be randomly allocated to these treatment arms for 3 months 
Arm 1 : Placebo: 4 capsules/day (2 each for curcumin and fish oil placebos)
Arm 2 :  Curcumin (2 Tab @500 mg each) providing 180 mg curcumin plus 2 placebo capsules/day 
Arm 3: n-3PUFA (2 cap @1000mg each) providing 1.2g EPA/DHA plus 2 placebo capsules/day
Arm 4: Curcumin (2 Tab @500 mg each providing a total of 180 mg curcumin) and n-3PUFA (2 cap @1000mg each providing a total of 1.2g EPA/DHA) per day

To monitor adherence to intervention, 
1. Capsule intake by participants will be measured on 6th and 12th week
2. Compliance to the omega 3 fatty acids will be monitored by measuring  participant's erythrocyte fatty acid content  
3. Adherence to curcumin will be monitored by measuring curucmin content in the participant blood sample by using HPLC method.

    <statisticalmethods>With a mean deviation of 0.5 units in HbA1c,  a sample size of seventeen participants in each treatment group will give 80% power to detect a 0.5 units drop in HbA1c at type 1 error (alpha)= 0.05. To allow for dropouts we will recruit 4x20 = 80 participants according to the inclusion criteria. Data obtained from all participants will be analysed according to the intention to treat theory. Normality of baseline data will be examined using histograms with a normal distribution curve overlayed and Shapiro Wilks test. Based on the distribution of data, the outcome measures will be analysed using ANOVA (normal distribution) or wilcoxon signed rank test (non-parametric data). Two-way ANOVA with post hoc comparisons will be used to determine the effect of intervention on different variables and also to determine synergistic or complimentary effects of two interventions (curcumin and LCn-3PUFA). ANCOVA will be used to assess the effects of confounding factors on treatment that include age, gender, BMI physical activity levels and dietary intake. Significance will be set at P-value &lt;0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed using GraphPad Prism version 6 and IBM SPSS 22 software. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes is a chronic non-communicable and slowly progressing metabolic disease often involving multiple pathological mechanisms. Multiple mechanisms underlie the pathogenesis of diabetes including subclinical inflammation, glucotoxicity and  lipotoxicity. Elevated levels of inflammation, particularly in the adipose tissue, is believed to be the primary trigger preceded by all of the above mentioned pathological mechanisms. Recent scientific literature established a strong link between inflammation and diabetes highlighting the role of inflammation as a primary pathological trigger for development of diabetes and its complications. Current therapies in the diabetes are unidimensional, targeted only to ameliorate the hyperglycaemic conditions. To date little or no attention has been paid to design pharmaceutical strategies to delay or modulate inflammatory pathways involved in reducing insulin secretion and/or action. Moreover current anti-diabetic medications have persistent side effects, such as body weight gain and hypoglycaemia in patients on sulphonylureas and insulin; gastrointestinal problems with metformin and acarbose; weight gain and bone fractures with thiazolidinediones; genital or urinary tract infections predominantly in females with sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors.  In the light of increasing prevalence and health costs associated with diabetes and its complications, there is a necessity for development of easy to comply strategies to modulate multiple metabolic targets with excellent long-term safety profile. In search of these agents, some bioactive compounds (nutraceuticals) aiming at prevention of diabetes through anti-inflammatory mechanisms have shown promising results. Extensive research has been carried out on anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperglycaemic potential of curcumin. Also the long chain n-3PUFA have been shown to possess lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties by modulating multiple metabolic targets. We propose to evaluate the complimentary and/or synergistic effects of curcumin and/or n-3PUFA on pro-inflammatory mediators and insulin sensitivity in people with pre-diabetes. This is a 2x2 factorial, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Eligible participants will be asked to consume 4 caps daily; placebo, curucmin plus placebo, omega 3 fatty acids plus placebo, curucmin and omega 3 fatty acids combination, for 12 weeks. Participants will be donating blood on the first day and post intervention along with information on 3 day food consumption, physical activity and other medications.
