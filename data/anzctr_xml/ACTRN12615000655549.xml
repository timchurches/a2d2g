  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with a BMI above 30kg/m2 who had attended the Royal Melbourne Hospital Obesity Clinic are observed for weight, quality of life and metabolic profile changes. Involving 1month, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month consultation with an endocrinologist and dietitian. Patients were excluded if they were referred to a different clinic at first visit or if they were determined unsuitable by wanting bariatric surgery prior to clinic attendance. Time period was January 2012  June 2015.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to determine: 1. Weight loss profiles for patients attend the Royal Melbourne Hospital Obesity clinic. 2. The impact of this weight loss of metabolic parameters such as lipid profile and liver function tests. 3. To determine the impact of this weight loss on Quality of Life Survey results 4. To find factors that predict the occurrence of weight loss in people with obesity who attended the Obesity Clinic. 
Hypothesis: Weight loss will be comparable to published data on lifestyle interventions at an average of 5% body weight loss. This weight loss will be variable depending on baseline characteristics such as family history, concurrent mental health issues and low starting motivation being negative predictors for weight loss. Patients who lose weight will show improvement in the metabolic profiles and Quality of Life survey results when compared to those who do not lose weight. </summary>
