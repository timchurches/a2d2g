    <studytitle>A randomised controlled trial of light versus deep sedation for elective outpatient colonoscopy: recall, procedural conditions and recovery</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients booked for elective, outpatient colonoscopy under sedation are those who are lightly sedated, compared to those deeply sedated, equally likely to have recall of the procedure.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sedation will be with an intravenous infusion of propofol (a IV anaesthetic agent) using TCI effect site steered dosing with a start point of 1.5mcg/ml. This will be titrated by the anaesthetist to achieve the target BIS with no maximum dose. A bolus dose of fentanyl (an opioid) of 0.7mcg/kg to a maximum of 100mcg will be given for those under 70 years, and for those over 70 years this will be 0.5mcg/kg to a maximum of 75mcg.  The sedation will continue for the duration of the colonoscopy (usual duration 20-30 mins).
  
The bispectral index (BIS) is a modified EEG signal which is a validated measure for the depth of anaesthesia which generates a number from 0 (no cortical activity) to 100 (awake).   Measurement is made by the placement of a measurement strip on the patient's forehead.  

In this study the intervention is "light sedation" in which the BIS target will be 70-80.  The propofol infusion will be increased or decreased to remain in this range.</interventions>
    <comparator>The same sedation regime will be used in the "deep sedation" group but the BIS target will be less than 60.  The same medications in the same doses will be used in the deep sedation group but titrated to a different endpoint.  The eventual propofol effect site target required would be expected to be higher in the deep sedation group.  Again, there is no maximum dose specified.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients booked for elective outpatient colonoscopy will be approached in preadmission clinic or on the day of surgery, given trial information, and asked for consent to participate.  

Basic demographic information will be collected and the medical record reviewed to confirm eligibility.  

In consenting, eligible participants randomisation to light or deep sedation will occur prior to commencement of clinical care.  This will be by the treating anaesthetist opening an opaque envelope labelled with a unique study number.  The anaesthetist's cannot be blinded to group allocation as they have to administer the appropriate sedation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this trial, patients undergoing elective colonoscopy under sedation will be randomised to BIS-guided sedation targeting either light or deep sedation.  Sedation will be achieved with a standardised regimen of target-controlled infusion of propofol and fentanyl bolus.  The primary end point will be the incidence of procedure recall in each group.  The procedural conditions, cardio-respiratory complications and recovery including cognitive function will be assessed.  The patient satisfaction with anaesthesia care will be recorded.</summary>
