  <interventions>
    <interventions>A CD of guided mindfulness practice to be performed each day for 8 weeks at home. The duration of the daily practice is 30 minutes and participants are required to fill in a daily practice record. The intervention CD consists of a fully guided mindfulness session  about the process of placing your attention on your breath.  It is the same each day.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group receive the standard usual care they would normally receive from the diabetes education clinics. The dummy CD simply contains an empty CD case with a label indicating they are allocated to the control group.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Multivariable analysis will be used to account for correlated readings within each individual over time and examine the association between each outcome and study arm. Baseline values will be treated as covariates rather than a response variable in the model. Thus, we will test whether outcome measures at 8 and 16 weeks differ between conditions controlling for baseline scores and other covariates that are identified as influencing the outcome.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mindfulness-based intervention programs are a promising intervention in the treatment of psychological distress in a range of clinical populations including pain disorders, cancer and other medical problems. There is, however a paucity of studies that have examined mindfulness in people with diabetes. The few studies that have been undertaken have shown the intervention to result in improvements in emotional well-being (anxiety and depression), improved self-care behaviours and decreased HbA1c values.                                   

This study will assess the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention undertaken and self-directed in people with diabetes at home over an eight-week period. 

This study will seek to determine whether a mindfulness-intervention undertaken in the patients home can:
Reduce anxiety and depression 
Reduce perceived diabetes specific stress
Improve diabetes self-care and management 
Improve glycemic control (HbA1c)
Increase mindfulness strategies (acceptance and action) in relation to diabetes
