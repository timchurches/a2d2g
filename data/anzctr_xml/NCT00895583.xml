    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus
Treatment: drugs - Sirolimus
Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus

Experimental: Group I - Planned transition to sirolimus from tacrolimus - 

Active Comparator: Group II - Continuation of tacrolimus - 


Treatment: drugs: Tacrolimus
During the screening phase, tacrolimus is provided by the investigator (not the Sponsor) and is dosed to achieve a target trough level determined by the investigator. Therefore, the dosage form, dosage, and frequency are determined by the investigator. Duration of treatment is from transplantation until randomization (from 90 to 150 days).

Treatment: drugs: Sirolimus
Following randomization, sirolimus is provided by the Sponsor in 1 and 2 mg oral tablets. Sirolimus is dosed once daily to achieve a target trough level of 7 to 15 ng/mL in the 1st year post-transplant and 5 - 15 ng/mL in the 2nd year post-transplant. Duration of treatment is from randomization through 2 years post-transplant (19 to 21 months).
