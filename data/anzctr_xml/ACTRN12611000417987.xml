  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: The research assistant provides the patients contact information to the research nurse. The research nurse contacts the patients two and a half weeks before the operation by telephone and agrees the education time. The education session is two weeks before the admission to the hospital. 

The Intervention (Knowledge Feedback Intervention, KFI) will be based on the feedback of the Knowledge Test for Spinal Surgical Patients (KTSSP) . 
The KTSSP consists of 27 true-false-don't know statements abouts empowering knowledge related to spinal disorders and their the surgical care. The statements are dived into six dimensions of empowering knowledge: bio-physiological, functional, financial, ethical, experimental and social. The knowledge test will be administered at the outpatients department after the decision of the operation. It takes on average 15 minutes to complete the knowledge test.


The intervention group will get a feedback from the knowledge test (1/2 h). The in-tervention will be conducted by telephone, because the participants live all over the Finland. The content of the education will be the result of knowledge test and correct answers with reasoning. The telephone conversation is constructed according to empowering discourse ) in order to help patient to gain deeper knowledge his or her disease and the surgical care.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: In order to blind the patients the patients of control group have a telephone conversation with the research nurse. The control group also undertakes the knowledge test at the outpatient department anthe the decision of the spinal operation but their education session will consist of patients health status.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The empowering patient education (EPE) has been found to be efficient in the studies with different patient groups. The care of spinal surgical patients (SSP) is complex and requires much knowledge of the patient. The assumption is that the sufficient knowledge promotes the recovery of the SSP and, testing patients knowledge is a successful method to identify patient's resources. 

The purpose is to produce a new EPE method for SSPs which will pay attention to patients individual empowering resources.

The research questions are as follows:

1.	What is the impact of empowering patient education session (the Knowledge Feedback Intervention, KFI) on patients knowledge level and anxiety?	

2.	What is the impact of patient empowering knowledge on HRQoL, anxiety, pain, functional status, and health service use?

The following hypotheses will be tested:

1.	The empowering patient education increases patients knowledge level and decreases patients anxiety.

2.	The empowering knowledge improves patients HRQoL, decreases anxiety, improves in pain management, improves to get better functional status and decreases the use of health services.</summary>
