    <interventions>The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  trial to demonstrate the impact of spatial repellents against the malaria attack rates in human population in Southwest Sumba and to prove the impact associated with the entomological correlates.
45 adult men subjects in each of the four study clusters will be recruited and enrolled as the cohort. Subjects will be asked to complete a supervised malaria radical cure (regardless of blood film status at enrolment) consisting of 40mg dihydroartemisinin- 320mg piperaquine and 15mg primaquine prior to the intervention. DHA-PP is administered based on body weight (BW) targeting a total dose of 6.4 and 51.2 mg/kg BW of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine, respectively, given in three equally divided daily doses. Doses are rounded up to the nearest half-tablet and administered orally. Primaquine is administered 30mg daily per oral for 28 days.
Intervention:
Four adjacent clusters in two villages in Southwest Sumba have been selected on the basis of demonstrated relatively high malaria prevalence and relative abundance of a dominant species of anopheline vector. Each of the study areas (cluster) where all these adult men subjects live will be randomly assigned to receive either active repellent (i.e. 0.0097% Metofluthrin) or a placebo in a standard mosquito coil (both manufactured to burn for 12 hours) for six months. Four coils will be placed in each house, and burned for 12 hours (commencing at 6PM each evening).
Within each cluster, one of 10 randomly placed homes will be assigned to receive the opposite treatment as the community assignment to active repellent or placebo. Effects among these homes would provide some assurance of relatively uniform risk of infection and mosquito behaviours among the four sites. These embedded controls will also provide analytical leverage for discerning household- versus community-level protective effects. In other words, if placebo homes within active repellent communities enjoy substantial protection from risk, one may reasonably conclude that community coverage may be an important determinant of protective effects. Likewise, we would anticipate modest protective effects among households with active repellent in placebo communities. On the other hand, poor protection among placebo households in active repellent communities (and good protection among active coil homes in placebo communities) would point to house-specific effects and little importance of coverage in any given community.
Arm 1.  90 subjects in two cluster will be given active coils.
Arm 2. 90 subjects in two clusters will be given placebo coils. 
We reason that the difference in the sporozoite attack rate between cohorts living in areas (cluster) receiving active mosquito coils should reflect the impact of that active ingredient upon real risk of infection by biting anophelines in their natural habitats.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Malaria attacks rates among the volunteers in each intervention arm. The malaria attack in each subject  will be checked weekly by performing blood smear. Subjects found malaria positive will be dropped from the study</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every week during the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Malaria vector abundance, human blood indices, parity rates, sporozoites rate and spatial repellent action. This entomologic parameter will be monitored by Human landing Catch (HLC), larval collection, blood meal, and resting collection.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 2nd week during the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Malaria baseline prevalence.
The outcome was assessed by conducting mass blood screening for malaria. Malaria smear slides taken by finger prick technique were read by microscopists.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the enrollment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The baseline of Malaria vector abundance by location, distance and time (method: human landing capture and larval collection), human blood indices (method: resting collections/ELISA/PCR), parity rates (method: ovarian dissections), and sporozoites rate (method: ELISA/PCR).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the enrollment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The infections risk among the study villages, i.e. the number of microscopically confirmed cases of malaria recorded in each study village from the non-recruited cohort. The study clinic and laboratory is open to all members of the village and free treatment of confirmed malaria will be offered. Hence, it is expected that most cases of symptomatic malaria in the whole village can be captured and calculated. This PASSIVE CASE DETECTION provides a separate (less precise due to interference from chronic parasitemias and hypnozoites present before coils were deployed) of infection risk among the study villages.</outcome>

    <concealment>This study initially indentify suitable study sites by employing criteria such as:  villages with population over thoushands people, stable malaria prevalence and known malaria vectors. Through this criteria, we selected 4 population clusters (each consists of around 100 houses) in two adjacent villages in Southwest Sumba with two household clusters. Recruitment of subjects will be by summoning demographically eligible men, identified from census data, to the study centre. The study will again be explained to them in their own language (using a local Health Worker) and they will be asked to sign a consent form. The study site physician will conduct a routine physical examination and make a determination as to the physical fitness of the volunteer to serve as a subject of this research. None of study team members, including the people who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial, was aware to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation is concealed by numbered mosquitoe coil containers, and it is done by personnel not involved in the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>The households in each cluster will be arranged sequentially and the adult men inhabitant will be listed and selected on a ballot system.</sequence>

Each of the study areas (cluster)  will be randomly assigned to be given either  active or placebo coils. The team will distribute mosquito coils to each household in the study areas and ensures that each household will receive the same coil and lid the coil every night.
