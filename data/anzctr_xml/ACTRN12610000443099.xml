    <interventions>Intervention:  Fortifying human milk based on the macronutrient composition of milk, measured using mid-infrared technology.  
Milk is fortified using human milk fortifier (HMF), a whey protein supplement and a carbohydrate and fat (energy) supplement.  The amount of fortifier added to milk feeds depends on the macronutrient composition of the milk and targets recommended protein and energy intakes (Tsang et al. 2005).  The intervention is administered throughout the period of time an infant receives fortified feeds.  Fortified milk feeds commence at the discretion of the neonatologist, according to the Unit's standard enteral feeding practice, and continue until discharge, unless clinically contraindicated.  
Standard enteral feeding practice incorporates 3 stages and two levels of feeds:
Stage 1.  Unfortified milk is fed until infants tolerate between 100 and 150 mL/kg/d.
Stage 2. Milk is fortified to Level 1 - this level targets recommended protein and energy intakes within volumes of 160-180 mL/kg/d.  
Stage 3.  (only for fluid restricted infants who are tolerating Level 1, who receive less than or equal to 150 mL/kg/d and who demonstrate poor growth).  Milk is fortified to Level 2 - this level targets recommended protein and energy intakes within volumes of 130-150 mL/kg/d.

    <comparator>There is one control arm in this trial.  The control group receives routine fortification according to standard enteral feeding practice, based on assumed milk composition, within the same time-frame as the intervention.  

Routine fortification is as follows:

Level 1 fortification: 2 sachets of HMF are added per 100 mL of milk to provide an additional 1.0 g protein. 

Level 2 fortification - As per Level 1, with an additional 0.5 g of a whey protein supplement and 2.5 g of an energy supplement per 100 mL of milk.</comparator>

    <concealment>Informed consent will be obtained from the primary carer at birth.  After obtaining informed parenteral consent, the eligible infants will be allocated to the intervention or control using coded, sealed, opaque and serially numbered envelopes.  Allocation concealment will be optimised by entering the basic demographic data before opening the envelope to determine the type of intervention assignment for each infant.</concealment>

    <summary>Preterm infants &lt; 30 weeks gestation will be randomised to either receive targeted fortification of human milk based on measured macronutrient composition or routine fortification of human milk based on assumed macronutrient composition.  Nutrition intakes, growth and body composition will be the outcome measures.</summary>
