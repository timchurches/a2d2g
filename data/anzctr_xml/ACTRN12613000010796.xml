  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group A participants attended an intensive instructor-led tai chi/qigong exercise group-based training (3 sessions per week) during the first 6 months of intervention, followed by a less intensive training (1 session per week) during the following 6 months. Group B participants were placed on a waiting list during the first 6 months, followed by intensive instructor-led group tai chi/qigong training (3 sessions per week) during the second 6 months. All participants continued their treatment as usual during the study. 

The exercise was adapted from the KaiMai tai chi style. Each group session lasted 1 to 1.5 hours with 10 minutes warm up, 45 minutes practice, and 10 to 25 minutes cooling down. The intensity of the exercise during each session varied among participants according to individual health and fitness levels.  

The treatment as usual refers to that study participants continued to receive usual medical care from their doctors during the study period.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Leg strength, assessed using a chair-stand test (number of stands completed in 30 seconds) modified from the US Senior Fitness Test (after the fasting blood measures test).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at induction screening, randomization baseline, and then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Body mass index, calculated using the formula: Body mass index = weight (kg) / height (m)2.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Waist circumference. The assessor stood in front of the participant Wo correctly locate the narrowing of the waist.  The measurement was taken with an anthropometry measurement tape at the level of the narrowest point over the naked skin between the lower costal (rib) border and the iliac crest.  Waist circumference was measured three times for each participant and results were recorded.  The mean of the three measurements was taken as the final result.  </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure, each participant rested for at least 5 minutes prior to measurement, in a chair with their back supported.  The left arm was bared and supported at heart level.  The cuff was firmly wrapped around the left upper arm (or around the right upper arm if the first blood collection was conducted on the right arm) at heart level,  measured three times for each participant and results were recorded.  The mean of the three measurements was taken as the final result.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at induction screening, randomization baseline, and then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.</timepoint>
