  <interventions>
    <interventions>Needles inserted into lower limbs under sterile technique.  Usually two needles in each affected limb according to where the lymphoedema is causing the most problems ie. if scrotal we place the needles higher on the leg.  The palliative medicine specialist inserts the needles into the subcutaneous layer according to the protocol.  The average duration of drainage is 5 days as an inpatient, and the needles stay in the entire time unless drainage stops or it becomes uncomfortable.  The maximum duration for the needles remaining in situ is 6 days.  The average length of the drainage was determined by the pilot study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the effect of subcutaneous needle drainage of lymphoedema on quality of life in patients with advanced cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have a palliative diagnosis of cancer, and have lymphoedema which is deemed suitable for lymphoedema drainage. 
Study details All participants in this study will undergo subcutaneous needle drainage of lymphoedema. This involves the placement of small needles into the layer under the skin.  They are attached to a special bag to capture the fluid. They will be in place for a number of days if still draining. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire before and twice after the procedure in order to determine any changes in quality of life. Participants will also be monitored for the occurrence of any complications. Sometimes, it is limited what can be offered to treat lymphoedema in late stages of cancer.  This procedure provides relief for some patients.</summary>
