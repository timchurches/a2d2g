    <interventions>Nexagon (registered trademark) - a topical preparation of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) oligonucleotide molecule that blocks specifically the translation of connexin 43, of which is the building block of one type of gap junctions (cell to cell communication channel).

We will be conducting the trial with a topical agent in a gel formulation. Upon entry in to the main part of the study, all patients will be assessed for severity of their ocular injury to determine the standard of care treatment regimen that will be initiated prior to the first addition of the study treatment  either Nexagon(registered trademark) or Nexagon (registered trademark) vehicle as placebo. This will be double-masked to both the patient and the treating clinicians. 
Treatments: Study treatment is given in two parts over Day 1 and Day 2. Part one involves application of study treatment in a 14mm carrier soft (silicon hydrogel) contact lens with a standard dose of 10micrograms/50microlitres of Nexagon (registered trademark) or Nexagon (registered trademark) vehicle. This will stay in for the duration one hour, and then removed. Study treatment is applied again as 6micrograms/100microlitres Nexagon (registered trademark) or Nexagon (registered trademark) vehicle in divided doses over the upper and lower fornices of the affected eye. If the participants fall in the moderate/severe group, they will have again received the standard treatment prior to the second application of Nexagon (registered trademark) or Nexagon (registered trademark) vehicle. Application of the study treatment occurs again on day 2, where the same steps are repeated. If clinically indicated, the severely injured eyes may require amniotic membrane transplant. These patients will then receive a third dose (10micrograms/50microlitres) of study treatment under the transplanted amnion.

Other wise, no further application of the trial treatment will be given.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control of this study is the vehicle medium of Nexagon (registered trademark). It is a gelling agent called Poloxamer 407, and is a common ingredient in pharmaceutical and many other products. Poloxamer 407 is a hydrophilic non-ionic surfactant of the more general class of copolymers known as poloxamers. Poloxamer 407 is a triblock copolymer consisting of a central hydrophobic block of polypropylene glycol flanked by two hydrophilic blocks of polyethylene glycol. 
Application of the control group will not be any different to the treatment group.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients will be recruited from Greenlane Clinical Centre, through the Ophthalmology Acute Eye Clinic. Those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, who agree to take part in the study, and who have read, understood and signed the patient consent form, will be invited to take part in this study.

Allocation of the treatment/placebo groups are done by double-blinded randomisation. The treating clinician will receive treatment containers separated into 2 main groups mild and moderate/severe; severity stratified. These containers will be labeled with sequential numbers and will contain 50% of Nexagon (registered trademark) and 50% Nexagon vehicle. The content will not be identifiable to the treating clinician and he or she will just follow the sequential number in the severity group that the participants fall in. An independent person from the manufacturer and the statistician will hold the allocation code. 

We aim to treat up to 66 patients. 
We set out to start with a safety sub-study. The first 6 participants recruited will be involved in a small, open-labeled study where all participants in addition to standard of care treatment determined by the severity of their ocular injury will receive Nexagon (registered trademark) at the dose proposed for the subsequent double-masked phase of the study.
The recruitment of the remaining 60 participants will be severity stratified and we aim to have 30 participants in the mild group and 30 in the moderate/severe group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Method of randomisation for this study will be stratified block randomisation with a 1:1 ratio Nexagon (registered trademark) : Nexagon Vehicle.

There will only be one stratification factor used in the randomisation which will be severity score (mild, moderate, and severe).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chemical injury to the ocular surface has long been recognised to extend over the first 24~48 hours from the initial exposure. This is in part due to transmission of inflammatory signals to the neighbouring cells via the cell-cell connections, called the gap junctions, resulting in inflammatory recruitment and subsequent cell death of the surrounding healthy tissues. Connexin is the building block of these cell junctions; by down-regulating this protein production, we can expect to limit the spread of injury from the initial chemical assault and thereby improve epithelial proliferation and accelerate wound closure. The study aims to assess the efficacy of Nexagon (registered trademark) in the treatment of chemical injuries to the ocular surface. A total of 66 participants will be enrolled. This will include an initial safety study where 6 participants will be enrolled in an open treatment trial, where all participants will receive active treatment to ensure that the Nexagon (registered trademark) dose proposed for the subsequent double-masked phase is safe and well tolerated for human ocular surface injury. Once the safety status is established, recruitment of 60 participants for the double-masked phase of the study will begin. Enrolment of participants will be stratified by severity so that 30 participants of mild severity and 30 participants of moderate / severe severity will be enrolled in total. Within each severity arm, participants will be randomised in 1:1 ratio. Scheduled regular clinical visits will take place to assess progression of the recovery and to monitor safety over the course of the study.</summary>
