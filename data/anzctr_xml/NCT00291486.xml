  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Capecitabine
Treatment: drugs - 131I-huA33 (131-Iodine on humanised monoclonal antibody A33)

Experimental: Assigned Dose Level - 


Treatment: drugs: Capecitabine
Capecitabine will be administered at doses between 1000 and 1250 mg/m2/day depending on assigned dose level for 14 days per 21 day cycle. Daily doses may be rounded to the nearest 150mg.

Treatment: drugs: 131I-huA33 (131-Iodine on humanised monoclonal antibody A33)
All patients will receive a scout dose of 5 mg huA33 conjugated to 5-8 mCi 131I. The therapy dose of 131I-huA33 will comprise a constant protein dose of 10 mg/m2 huA33 regardless of dose level. The 131I therapy dose will be determined by the assigned dose level (i.e. 20, 30 or 40 mCi/m2 131I).
