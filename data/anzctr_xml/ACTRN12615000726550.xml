  <interventions>
    <interventions>The KIM trial investigates the feasibility of providing a direct measure of lung tumour motion during radiotherapy treatment, using existing standard treatment equipment. It requires that radiographic markers are implanted into and around lung tumours via Endoscopic Bronchial Ultrasound (EBUS). The procedure has a duration of about 45 minutes. Then patients wait 2 weeks before continuing to routine radiotherapy simulation and planning. Treatment planning typically takes 2-3 weeks and then treatment will commence. The inserted markers are visualised and tracked using x-ray images, during the radiotherapy treatment sessions, once a week
Tracking will be performed using the Kilovoltage Intra-fraction Monitoring (KIM) software in an off-line retrospective manner.
KIM images will be collected 7 times during 30-33 fractions of radiotherapy, specifically at sessions 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 and 30. Overall duration of the intervention is 6 weeks.
The intervention during radiotherapy treatment is administered as x-ray imaging.
Radiation Therapists administer the KIM imaging.</interventions>

    <summary>This study is investigating the feasibility of providing a direct measure of lung tumour motion during radiotherapy treatment, using existing standard treatment equipment.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with lung cancer and are a Patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
 
Study details
All patients in this study undergoing radiotherapy will have markers implanted into and around lung tumours using an airway ultrasound technique known as Endoscopic Bronchial Ultrasound (EBUS). The procedure has a duration of about 45 minutes. Then patients wait 2 weeks before continuing to routine radiotherapy simulation and planning. Treatment planning typically takes 2-3 weeks and then treatment will commence.  The inserted markers are visualised and tracked using x-ray images, during the radiotherapy treatment sessions, once a week. 
This study aims to validate a method to record real-time tumour motion due to respiration, during lung cancer radiotherapy treatment. Identifying the motion in real-time will help to implement treatments that can track tumours, resulting in safer and more effective treatments.
