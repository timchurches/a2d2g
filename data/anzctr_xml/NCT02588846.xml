Experimental: Stage 1: Optimise nodal treatment margin - During Stage 1: Optimise nodal treatment margin, Combined real-time use of 'Multi-Leaf Collimator Adaptation' and 'kV Intrafraction Monitoring' will be used to reshape the radiation beam in real-time. The nodal target position stability will be evaluated by the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging before and after each treatment session for the first 10 patients.

Experimental: Stage 2: Use treatment margin - During Stage 2: Use treatment margin, Combined real-time use of 'Multi-Leaf Collimator Adaptation' and 'kV Intrafraction Monitoring' will be used to reshape the radiation beam in real-time. At the same time, multi-leaf collimator (MLC) tracking will be used to reshape the radiation beam in real-time using the margin size determined in Stage 1.


Treatment: devices: Combined real-time use of 'Multi-Leaf Collimator Adaptation' and 'kV Intrafraction Monitoring'
This intervention uses the simultaneous combined use of two technologies: 'Multi-Leaf Collimator Adaptation' and 'kV Intrafraction Monitoring'. kV Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM) measures the motion of tissues targeted for radiotherapy in real time using kV imaging.The multi-leaf collimator (MLC) reshapes the radiation beam to maximise dose to the target tissue and minimise dose to the surrounding healthy tissue. Combining KIM and MLC allows the shaped radiation beam to follow the moving target (the prostate) while remaining fixed on a stationary target (lymph nodes) that are also being treated at the same time.

    <summary>Assessing the feasibility of implementing real-time multi-leaf collimator (MLC) tracking to
      account for the relative motion of the moving prostate tumour target and the static pelvic
      nodal target for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The capability of tracking for the
      relative motion of multiple targets will ensure that all the treatment targets receive
      correct dose as prescribed by the doctor and minimise side effects to the critical organs.</summary>
