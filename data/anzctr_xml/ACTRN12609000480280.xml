  <interventions>
    <interventions>66 volunteers were treated with cervical pain, stimuation in trapezius muscles, by electroacupunture divided into 5 groups. Each group was treated with different frequencies stimulatory (2, 100, 1000, 2500 Hz and a group only with acupuncture). 66 volunteers received only one session by 20 minutes each. The electroacupuncture is a electrical 
stimulation in the needles acupuncture. The eletroacupuncture was administred to the trapezius muscles in the acupoint denomination tianliao and jianjing.</interventions>
    <comparator>One group with acupuncture, without electrical stimulation in the same points (trapezius muscles). Received only one session by 20 minutes each.</comparator>

    <concealment>Have been pre-selected volunteers with cervical tension in accordance with inclusion criteria. The  Stimulatory frequency tested (2, 100, 1000, 2500 Hz) or only with acupuncture was choose by drawn randomly tested with numberes containers.  The evaluation of clinical response (analgesia) was performed by an external evaluator.</concealment>
    <sequence>Method of distribution of volunteers in the groups was distributed systematically by simple randomisation. There was a draw of groups (2, 100, 1000, 2500 Hz and only acupuncture) and its correlation with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. As the volunteers went to the treatment session take in a box drawn one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. An external evaluator conducted the sweepstakes, and adjusted the stimulatory frequencies without the researcher knew which was being used at that time. The correspondence group with the results appeared only after the statistical treatment. Don't was selection of groups by age or gender.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of this research is the avaluation of the influence of the electrical stimulation frequency on the induced analgesia for tensional cervical pain. For the development of the experimental protocol, a micropocessed electrical stimulation system yielding a non-symmetrical. balanced, rectangular pulse. The tested frequency was 2, 100, 1000, 2500 hz. and one group only by acupuncture. The instruments for avaluation and comparison were applied: pressure algometry, analog visual scale and cardiac frequency.</summary>
