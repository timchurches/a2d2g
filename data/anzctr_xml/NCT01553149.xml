  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective response - best response - The response rate will be calculated as the ratio of the number of patients who demonstrate response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) divided by the number of patients evaluable for response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of toxic events defined as one in which a patient has two dose reductions and then experiences another significant toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 - Estimates will be obtained using life-table methods, with an event defined as the first occurrence of a primary toxicity. The rates of individual toxicities in each course of treatment, the number of patients who require a dose reduction and number of patients who come off protocol therapy due to toxicity will be summarized using standard descriptive statistical methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Magnetic resonance imaging sequence - Response categories (complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progression) will be determined from the following three standard magnetic resonance sequences, T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, T1-weighted post-contrast. Percent agreement between the sequences will be estimated as the number of follow-up scans in which the corresponding sequence agreed divided by the total number of follow-up scans. Standard error will be estimated by use of the bootstrap method to account for the correlated dependent response data, and these values will be used to estimate the 95</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic parameters of lenalidomide - Correlation of lenalidomide concentration obtained from the steady-state sample and the number of cycles received prior to the occurrence of disease progression will be performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Cox regression analysis will be used to assess the association between outcome and steady state levels at a particular cycle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between days 5-21 of course 1 and each dose reduction</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to death (overall survival [OS]) - Standard survival methods will be used for analysis of OS. Analyses include log rank tests and the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimate for estimation of OS probability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from study enrollment to death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to treatment failure (event-free survival [EFS]) - Standard survival methods will be used for analysis of EFS. Analyses include log rank tests and the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimate for estimation of EFS probability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from study enrollment to tumor progression, tumor recurrence, death from any cause, or occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm, assessed up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well low-dose lenalidomide works compared with
      high-dose lenalidomide in treating younger patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or
      optic nerve pathway gliomas that have come back (recurrent), have not responded to treatment
      (refractory), or are growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressive). Lenalidomide may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known
      whether low-dose lenalidomide is more or less effective than high-dose lenalidomide in
      treating patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or optic nerve pathway gliomas.</summary>
