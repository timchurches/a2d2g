  <interventions>
    <interventions>There is increasing evidence that nutrient stimuli in the gut, especially in the small intestine, induce changes in gut motor and hormonal functions that play a central role in the control of energy intake and blood glucose. In particular high-protein diets have been found to be very effective for weight loss and for improving blood glucose in obese with and without type 2 diabetes. This study aims to investigate the effects of the amino acid, L-phenylalanine on gut motility, gut hormone release, blood glucose control and energy intake in humans. We hypothesise that L-phenylalanine, as building block of proteins, may substantially contribute to the beneficial effects of whole protein on gut functions and energy intake regulation. A total of 20 Caucasian male and female (BMI 18-25 kg/m2) subjects, aged between 18 - 50 years, will be included in the study. Each subject will be studied on three occasions. On each occasion, they will receive, in randomized, double-blind fashion, a 90-min intraduodenal infusion of (i) L-phenylalanine at 0.2 kcal/min (4.4 g/90 min), (ii), L-phenylalanine at 0.4 kcal/min (8.8 g/90 min) or (iii) saline (negative control). Gut motility, blood glucose, gut hormones release, insulin concentrations, appetite perceptions and energy intake during a buffet meal, as well as vital signs, will be measured. The buffet meal will be provided at the end of the infusion and the participant has 30 minutes to eat until comfortably full. The buffet meal consists of 300ml orange juice, 600ml water, 375ml iced coffee, 4 slices white bread, 4 slices brown bread, 100g deli leg ham, 100g virginian chicken, 4 slices cheese, 100g tomato, 100g cucumber, 100g lettuce, 2 portions manyonnaise, 2 portions margarine, 1 medium apple, 1 medium banana, 200g chocolate custard, 150g fruit salad, 200g strawberry yoghurt, and 14g milky way chocolate bar. Each volunteer will receive one of each infusion solutions on each of the 3 study days. Each study visit will be separated by no less than 3 days.</interventions>

      <timepoint>VAS questionnaires are taken at t -10, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 &amp; 120 minutes for all three infusion sessions. The buffet meal will be presented at 90 minutes when the infusion ends and the subject will be allowed to freely consume food until comfortably full for 30 minutes (until t 120 minutes).</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>Male and female (BMI 18 to 25 kg/m2) subjects, aged between 18 to 50 years, will be included in the study.

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a 30 minute screening visit. A questionnaire is answered by the volunteer, based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria and eligibility is determined. A signed informed consent is obtained and study dates are established. Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised into a treatment for each study visit, using a randomisation table which was created on an excel spreadsheet. Randomisation involved contacting the holder (study assistant) of the randomisation table to inform them of the next subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocating a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution on each study day.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Regulation of the factors that control food intake, the function of the stomach and small intestine and release of gut hormones is complex, and our understanding of this field is far from complete. There is increasing evidence that nutrient stimuli in the gut, especially in the small intestine, induce changes in gut motor and hormonal functions that play a central role in the control of energy intake and blood glucose. In particular high-protein diets have been found to be very effective for weight loss and for improving blood glucose in obese with and without type 2 diabetes. This study aims to investigate the effects of the amino acid, L-phenylalanine, on gut motility, gut hormone release, blood glucose control and energy intake in humans. We hypothesise that L-phenylalanine as building block of proteins, may substantially contribute to the beneficial effects of whole protein on gut functions and energy intake regulation. This has not been evaluated in detail and will be important in order to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of dietary protein on eating control.</summary>
