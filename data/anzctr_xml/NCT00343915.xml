    <summary>To evaluate the persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B at 30, 42, 54 and 66 months
      after the first dose of the hepatitis B primary vaccination course.

      Subjects were aged 11 to 15 years at the time of the primary vaccination course.

      At the time of enrollment in the present long-term follow-up study subjects were aged 13 to
      18 years.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
