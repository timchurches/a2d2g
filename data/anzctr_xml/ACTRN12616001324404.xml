    <interventions>Part 1  Night 1
Assessment of nasal obstruction using rhinomanometry followed by observational level 1 diagnostic sleep study without oral appliance to evaluate relationship between breathing route and Apnoea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), Pharyngeal pressures measured throughout will also be used to evaluate site of upper airway collapse.
Participants with supine AHI &lt;15 and &gt;60 or unable to demonstrate ability to sleep in the supine position or sleep with the required instrumentation, will not go on to participate in Part 2 of the study.

Part 2  Night 2 and 3
Device - The O2Vent T is a customized oral appliance similar in appearance to a mouth guard. to treat snoring and sleep apnoea. The main structure which forms the breathing port at the front leading to the airways on each side to the rear of the appliance, is made from polished medical grade titanium customized to the maxillary arch. The "landing" area or inserts for the top and lower teeth is customized to the patient's dentition and are made from dual laminate material. The upper insert is fixed to the titanium arch whilst the lower insert is positioned in an advanced position to bring the jaw forward. Further titration is possible with a screw mechanism.

Night 2  Interventional study with O2Vent T and titration as per titration protocol to optimize level of advancement. Prior to titration, the study dentist will define the limits of advancement for the titration night so that it does not exceed 100%.
1.	The titration will commence at the Zero position which will be set at 50% of maximum protrusion
2.	The Zero position will be held to the end of the first REM period
3.	At the conclusion of the first REM period, titration will commence in 1 mm increments in response to AHI greater than 10 or &lt;50% reduction in the preceding 15 minutes of sleep
4.	At least 15 minutes of consistent sleep (not interrupted by periods of wakefulness) should be observed prior to further advancement.
5.	Advancement to occur until any of the following conditions are met:
a.	limits of advancement as defined by dentist
b.	the lower of AHI &lt;10 reached or &gt;50% reduction
c.	Limit of device i.e. +7mm reached
6.	Advancement to occur in sleep only. No advancement to occur during wakefulness or Stage 1 sleep.

Night 3  Interventional study with the device airway being opened and closed alternating every 30 minutes. The level of advancement throughout will be the optimal advancement determined on night 2. Pharyngeal pressures measured throughout. Whilst the device airway is closed, breathing is possible through the nose. Whilst the device airway is open, breathing is possible through the nose and the device.

Night 2 will occur approximately 2 months after Night 1 to allow for manufacture of device and acclimatization. Night 3 will occur up to 2 weeks after night Night 2. 

Monitoring of adherence is not applicable.
</interventions>
    <comparator>From Night 1 - between subject comparisons of nasal obstruction, breathing route and AHI. 
From Night 2 - within subject comparison of breathing route, AHI and Oximterer Dip Rate (ODI) at each level of advancement with minimum data set at 50% and optimal advancement, also compared to Night 1 baseline.
From Night 3 - within subject comparisons of AHI, ODI, Arousal Index, fraction of nasal-oral/device airflow as well as pharyngeal pressures:
- at optimal advancement with O2Vent airway open
- at optimal advancement with O2Vent airway closed
Within subject differences will be compared to the degree of nasal obstruction obtained during awake seated and supine conditions.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size is calculated based on AHI obtained from matched pairs of study subjects i.e. subjects act as their own controls with AHI obtained from a) diagnostic and b) optimal level of advancement.  Prior data from a pilot study using a similar device, indicate that the difference in the response of matched pairs was 24.7+/-16.8. However, this pilot study did not have an upper limit on the inclusion criteria for AHI so we expect a smaller mean difference in this study. With a true difference in the mean response of matched pairs of 15+/-17, we will need to study 22 subjects to complete Night 1 and 2 of the study to be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power) 0.9.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.01.
We expect that up to 25% of subjects completing Night 1 will not go onto Night 2. Therefore, we will need 30 subjects to commence the study.

Preliminary data from Night 3 will be analyzed after 50% of participants have completed the 3-night protocol to determine if there is adequate sample size to reach statistical significance when comparing AHI and pressures between Airway Open and Closed conditions. With 22 subjects, the detectable difference is -6.3 or 6.3 with probability (power) 0.8 and Type I error probability of 0.05 (assuming standard deviation 10). However, there is no preliminary data to indicate the impact of the oral appliance airway on AHI or pharyngeal pressure and therefore preliminary data will be examined. The sponsor shall review the data and decide if a protocol amendment is required to increase total number of participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The O2Vent T is a mouth splint with an enclosed airway that allows airflow through the device. Like all mouth splints for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), the lower jaw is brought forward to bring the tongue forward and stabilize the upper airway. However, unlike other devices, patients are able to breathe through the device airway with the jaw position stabilized. At present, there is very little data on the complex relationship between nasal obstruction, route of breathing and the collapsibility of the upper airway during sleep and the impact of the device airway is unknown. 

The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism of action of an oral appliance with a built in airway in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea. 
The objectives are to:
1.	Determine the relationship between nasal obstruction, Apnoea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and breathing route in patients with OSA.
2.	Evaluate the effect of mandibular advancement on the breathing route and its relationship to the AHI.
3.	Evaluate the impact of the oral appliance airway on OSA treatment
