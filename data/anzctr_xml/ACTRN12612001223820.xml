  <interventions>
    <interventions>Resistance Exercises: Leg abduction, plantar flexion, dorsi flexion, straight-leg/bent-knee raise, knee extension and knee flexion. All resistance exercises will be done in a seated position while still receiving dialysis treatment. The exercises will be done during the first hour of dialysis treatment. When participants are able to perform two sets of 15-20 repetitions for each exercise, the resistance exercises will be made progressively harder using different colour-graded elastic bands and tubings. Participants will also be encouraged to perform each exercise (lifting phase - concentric contraction) as rapidly as possible to optimise movement speed and muscle power. The sessions will last between 30 and 60 minutes and performed 3 times a week to coincide with patients' existing dialysis treatment schedule. The stepwedged design will provide the intervention for 3, 6 or 9 months depending on the randomly allocated group. This will mean that all groups will receive at least 3 months of the intrevention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Care. The standard care comparitor will consist of no, or minimal, exercises on dialysis. Exercises are rarely performed on dialysis as standard care but if they are the exercises will be up to the participant themselves. Given that they will be performed on dialysis they will be supervised by nursing staff.</comparator>

In this study Group 1 (5 clinics, n=60) receive 9 months of exercise intervention, Group 2 (5 clinics, n=60) will receive 6 months and Group 3 (5 clinics, n=60) receive 3 months. Baseline data will be collected 3 months prior to the commencement of the intervention (Time 1). Group 1 will commence exercise intervention at Time 2 (3 months), Group 2 at will commence at Time 3 (6 months) and Group 3 will commence at Time 4 (9 months). Data will be collected for all participants at each time point, with the final data collected 3 months after Group 3 commences the exercise intervention (i.e., Time 5, 12 months).</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will measure the direct impact of an exercise program on the health outcomes of people with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.  The health outcomes that will be measured include: physical function, quality of life, uptake of community exercise programs, self-reported falls, and biochemical markers. This work is significant given the effects of end stage kidney disease on musculoskeletal health in this group. There is a current absence of exercise programs in haemodialysis clinics globally, leading to a decline in dialysis patients physical function and increased costs to health services.
Study Hypothesis: Accredited exercise physiologists providing a resistance exercise program will improve the physical function of people with chronic kidney disease receiving haemodialysis.</summary>
