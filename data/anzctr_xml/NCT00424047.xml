    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - CC-5013 plus dexamethasone
Treatment: drugs - Dexamethasone plus Placebo

Experimental: CC-5013 plus dexamethasone - Arm A: Oral CC-5013 is initiated on Day 1 of Cycle 1 at a dose of 25 mg daily for 21 days every 28 days. Therefore, the subject will take a placebo identical in appearance to the CC-5013 capsule for week 4 of every 28 days. Oral pulse dexamethasone is administered at a dose of 40mg daily on Days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 of each 28 day cycle for Cycles 1 through 4. Beginning with Cycle 5, the oral dexamethasone dosing schedule will be reduced to 40mg daily for Days 1-4 every 28 days. In addition, oral CC-5013 placebo capsules will be administered for 28 days of every cycle.

Experimental: Dexamethasone plus placebo - Arm B: Oral pulse dexamethasone is administered at a dose of 40mg daily on Days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 of each 28 day cycle for Cycles 1 through 4. Beginning with Cycle 5, the oral dexamethasone dosing schedule will be reduced to 40mg daily for Days 1-4 every 28 days. In addition, oral placebo capsules will be administered for 28 days of every cycle.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Time to Tumor Progression (TTP) - Time to progression was calculated as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by a detailed review of all the myeloma response assessment data using the Bladé criteria (Bladé, 1998). Disease progression was also based on bone marrow findings, worsening lytic bone disease, progressively enlarging extramedullary plasmacytomas, or hypercalcemia.</outcome>

      <outcome>Summary of Myeloma Response Rates Based on Best Response Assessment - Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of monoclonal paraprotein and maintained for = 6 weeks . Remission Response (RR):75-99% reduction in the level of the serum monoclonal paraprotein compared to baseline; 90-99% reduction in 24-hr urinary light chain excretion. Partial Response (PR): 50-74% reduction in the level of monoclonal paraprotein compared to baseline; 50-89% reduction in 24-hr urinary light chain excretion. Stable Disease (SD): Criteria for PR or PD have not been met. Plateau Phase: If PR, stable monoclonal paraprotein values (within 25% above or below nadir)/stable soft tissue plasmacytomas maintained for at least 3 months. Progressive Disease (PD): Reappearance of serum or urinary monoclonal paraprotein on immunofixation or electrophoresis on two consecutive occasions at least one week apart. Increase of percentage of plasma cells in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy to = 5%. Development of at least one new lytic bone lesion or soft tissue plasmacytoma.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) - An AE is any sign, symptom, illness, or diagnosis that appears or worsens during the course of the study. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of the study drug and within 30 days after the last cycle end date of study drug. A serious AE = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event.
The severity of AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE, Version 2.0): Grade 1 = Mild (no limitation in activity or intervention required); Grade 2 = Moderate (some limitation in activity; no/minimal medical intervention required); Grade 3 = Severe (marked limitation in activity; medical intervention required, hospitalization possible); Grade 4 = Life-threatening; Grade 5 = Death.</outcome>
