  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigators will test the value of an internet self-help package (E-Couch) for
      alleviating sub-clinical social anxiety symptoms in the general population. This is not a
      treatment trial for social anxiety disorder (these people will be directed to seek other help
      and excluded from this study). The investigators will undertake a randomised controlled trial
      involving approximately 2000 people with symptoms of shyness and sub-clinical social anxiety.
      The investigators will compare the effect of the E-Couch intervention compared to a wait-list
      control condition. Over a period of 12 months the investigators will measure the effect of
      using E-Couch self-help on social anxiety symptoms, as well as on mental wellbeing, and other
      secondary outcomes including quality of life, depression and general anxiety, and their use
      of other sources of help.</summary>
