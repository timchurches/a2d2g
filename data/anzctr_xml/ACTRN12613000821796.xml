  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current treatments for male and female pattern hair loss are not infrequently inadequately effective or are poorly tolerated. New treatments modalities are eagerly anticipated by both hair loss sufferers and those that care for them.

A case series of 50 patients treated with 150 units of botulinum toxin twice in six months demonstrated a response rate of 75% and an average hair count increase of 18% at 12 months. The financial burden of this dose of toxin limits the number of patients that could benefit from this treatment.

Further study of the anatomy of the scalp generates the hypothesis that 20 units of botulinum toxin may be enough to deliver the same benefits. Toxin will also be administered in a more conventional three monthly dosing schedule.
