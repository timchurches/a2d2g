  <interventions>
    <interventions>The COPE-A program consists of 16 weekly 60-90minute individual psychotherapy sessions and is designed for adolescent males or females who use any substances and have experienced any form of trauma. The COPE-A program comprises components of the gold standard treatments for adolescent PTSD and SUD including: i) trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and CBT for substance use; ii) establishing a trusting therapeutic relationship; iii) psychoeducation for PTSD and substance use; iv) enhancing stress management and problem solving skills; v) recognising and challenging unhelpful cognitions; and vi) exposure therapy for PTSD. COPE-A also includes three optional caregiver sessions that provide psychoeducation about substance use and trauma responses and a rationale for the adolescent program. A session is offered at the end-of-treatment to discuss PTSD and substance use relapse prevention strategies and aftercare.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD) are chronic, debilitating disorders that frequently co-occur. There is a critical need to intervene early to prevent the long-term problems associated with this comorbidity. However, there are currently no empirically validated treatments available for adolescents. This pilot study aims to examine an innovative exposure-based treatment for traumatic stress and substance use among
adolescents (COPE-A). Ten adolescents (aged 12-17yrs) with comorbid traumatic stress and substance use (and their primary caregivers) will be recruited and offered the 16-session COPE-A intervention. Participants will undergo interviews at baseline and post-treatment. Measures of therapeutic compliance, treatment acceptability and feasibility, and treatment outcome will be analysed.</summary>
