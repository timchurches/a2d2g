  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children in the intervention group took part in daily swimming classes (45 minutes) in a saltwater pool over 4 school weeks. Children swam without ear protection (cap or earplugs) and went frequently underwater. </interventions>
    <comparator>Children in the control group were restricted from swimming in the pool for the 4 weeks of the intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of children with an active tympanic membrane perforation. Ear examinations were conducted using tympanometry, pneumatic otoscopy and digital video otoscopy. </outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of children with; 1) S.pneumoniae, 2) H. influenzae, 3) M. catarrhalis, 4) Any respiratory pathogen (S. Pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis), 5) S. aureus and 6) Gp A Streptococcus in the nasophayrnx. This secondary outcome was to assess the presence of respiratory bacteria in the nasopharynx

Swabs were taken from the nasopharynx. All swabs were cultured on selective media for respiratory bacteria. Swabs were kept in STGGB, Skin Milk Tryptone Glucose Glycerl Broth (WHO recommended OBrien 2003) thawed and mixed. 10 microlitres aliquots were cultured on the following plates (Oxoid Australia): full Chocolate agar, 5% horse blood agar containing colisten and nalidixic acid (C.N.A), and chocolate agar with bacitracin, vancomycin, and clindamycin (BVCCA). Bacterial isolates were identified according to standard laboratory procedures.  </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of children with; 1) S. pneumoniae, 2) H. influenzae, 3) M. catarrhalis, 4) Any respiratory pathogen. This is a compound outcome to assess the presence of repiratory bacteria in the ears.

Swabs were taken from the middle ear. All swabs were cultured on selective media for respiratory bacteria. Swabs were kept in STGGB, Skin Milk Tryptone Glucose Glycerl Broth (WHO recommended OBrien 2003) thawed and mixed. 10 microlitres aliquots were cultured on the following plates (Oxoid Australia): full Chocolate agar, 5% horse blood agar containing colisten and nalidixic acid (C.N.A), and chocolate agar with bacitracin, vancomycin, and clindamycin (BVCCA).

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of children whose diagnosis (by child's worst ear) had improved. This included cases that had gone from:  dry to closed, wet to closed, wet to dry.  

This was a composite secondary outcome. </outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks after randomisation </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of children whose diagnosis (by child's worst ear) had stayed the same over the intervention. This included cases that had gone from: dry to dry and wet to wet.

      <outcome>The proportion of children whose diagnosis (by child's worst ear) had got worse. This included cases that had gone from dry to wet perforation. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of children with 1) Gp A Streptococcus, 2) S. aureus, 3) P. aeruginosa and 4) Proteus in the middle ear. 

Swabs were taken from the middle ear. Swabs of ear discharge were plated onto blood plates and MacConkey agar.  Blood plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO² and MacConkey plates at 35°C in air.  Bacterial isolates were identified according to standard laboratory procedures.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. Groups were stratified by age to: children under the age of 8 on January 1, 2009 and children above the age of 8 on January 1, 2009. All clinical and laboratory assessors were blinded to the allocation sequence and what intervention participants received. </concealment>
    <sequence>The random sequence was generated on Stata Version 8.0 by the IT Division at the Menzies School of Health Research. Permuted block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes has been used to minimise any imbalances in the allocation.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>All participants randomised in the study contributed an outcome for clinical analysis.  Children lost to followup were assumed to not have changed from their diagnosis at baseline but were excluded from assessments of microbiolgical outcomes.  Risk differences between study groups were calculated with a 95% confidence interval.  Semi quantitative measures for bacterial load were categorised as low density (&lt;100) and high density (&gt;100).  Change in the density of all respiratory bacteria in the nasopharynx was calculated based on the new ordinal scale of low and high density. 

It was hypothesised that 90% of children not swimming would have ear discharge at 28 days and that swimming could reduce this proportion. We specified that a 25% difference between the two groups would be clinically important. Our aim was to recruit a sample of 100 children to provide 80% power to detect a difference of 25% between the two groups. </statisticalmethods>
