  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single transcutaneous ultrasound (US) scan of the abdomen will be performed to assess the presence or absence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A blood sample will also be taken for analysis of genetic and biomarkers associated with AAA and other cardiovascular disease. This is a single consultation of approximately 20 minutes duration.</interventions>
    <comparator>Local historical AAA rates (~2% in healthy elderly (mean age 69) males (from the Dunedin based Vascular Assessment Laboratory (University of Otago), 2002-2011)  In addition, this rate will be compared with New Zealand incidence data from 2000-2008 (Sandiford etal. British Journal of Surgery 2011; 98: 645651) and the United Kingdom 2009-2010 data (Conway etal.  British Journal of Surgery 2012; 99: 7377)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: to determine the prevalence of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a screening population based on Cardiovascular disease risk.  Test used: Transcutaneous ultrasound measured infra-renal abdominal aortic maximum diameter greater than or equal to 3cm</outcome>
      <timepoint>at time of screening</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2: to describe an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm risk algorithm to optimise screening.  Test used: Multiple logistic regression modeling to identify the most at risk subgroups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>post-screening (within 6 months of completing study recruitment)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 3: to test the feasibility of implementing Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm screening through primary and secondary care Cardiovascular disease healthcare providers.  Test used: a statistical comparison of the historical age and gender based AAA rate with the two proposed screening models</outcome>
      <timepoint>post-screening (within 6 months of completing study recruitment)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify genetic and biomarkers of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm risk susceptibility</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>While NZ does not currently have an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) screening programme, internationally ultrasound screening programmes are generally offered to males aged 65 or greater. This excludes women and those who develop AAA at a younger age and have more to gain from early detection. Our previous studies have identified that people with a history of arterial disease have a significantly greater risk of developing AAA.  This trial will prospectively screen individuals with arterial disease or elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk to validate these findings.  Recruitment and screening will be undertaken through existing primary and secondary CVD healthcare providers to assess whether or not such a targeted approach delivered through existing services could be a viable screening strategy for NZ</summary>
