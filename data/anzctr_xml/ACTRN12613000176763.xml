    <summary>Objective: To assess the optical aberration results of hydrophobic acrylic AMO Sensar AR40E and hydrophobic acrylic Alcon AcrySof SA60AT intraocular lenses after implantation in cases with bilateral cataract.
Material and Method: Cases diagnosed as bilateral cataract were included to the study and preoperative aberration measurements were recorded by using Nidek OPD SCAN-ARK 1000. Groups were created by implanting AMO Sensar AR40E to one eye of the patients, while Alcon AcrySof SA60AT into the other in a prospective and randomized manner. On the month 1 and 2 after surgery, aberration measurements were recorded by using Nidek OPD SCAN-ARK 1000.
Findings: Overall, 40 eyes in 20 patients (11 women and 9 men) were included to the study. All patients underwent bilateral phacoemulsification surgery due to cataract. There were 20 eyes in both groups. Mean age was 62.4 (range: 31-82) years. There was no significant difference in aberrations recorded before surgery and on the month 1 and 2 after surgery between groups (p&lt;0.05). 
Conclusion: It was seen that there was no difference among spherical intraocular lenses used in this study.
Keywords: cataract, intraocular lenses, optical aberration
