  <interventions>
    <interventions>The computer-based patient education (CBPE) programme is interactive and tailored to gender and broadly to age.  It consists of shoulder anatomy, shoulder exercises, adherence enhancing strategies, advice on functional activities and quizzes. Participants will be directed by the researcher to the relevant content for their disorder. The programme will be available to the participants for 8 weeks, during which time they can access it at any time. They will record their exercise adherence  in a self-report diary.  Participants in the intervention group will make action and coping plans with the researcher at the beginning of the study.  Over the 8 weeks study period all participants will continue receiving standard physiotherapy treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>General information about shoulder structure and function, shoulder injuries and the costs they incur.  This information will be available on a DVD that participants in the control group will be issued with at baseline and which they will be able to access in their own time over the 8 weeks study period.  All participants will receive standard physiotherapy treatment over this  time.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional outcomes of the shoulder.  This variable will be assessed using the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) and the P4 pain scale (Spadoni, Stratford, Solomon, &amp; Wishart, 2004).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at 8 weeks (time 2)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence to home-based physiotherapy rehabilitation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily self-report for 8 weeks of the home-based programme</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-efficacy with the physiotherapy programme will be measured by action self-efficacy, maintenance self-efficacy and recovery self-efficacy self report questionnaires.  These validated questionnaires have been adapted from the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model (Scholz, U., Sniehotta, F., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2005).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Action, maintenance and recovery self-efficacy will be measured at baseline and time 2 (8 weeks later).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Behavioural intentions will measured by a self-report questionnaire about the participants intentions to follow the physiotherapy.  These validated questionnaires have been adapted from the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model (Scholz, U., Sniehotta, F., &amp; Schwarzer, R., 2005).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knowledge.  This will be measured by 10 multiple choice questions relating to shoulder structure and function,  and behavioural strategies.  Face and content validity were checked by a panel of experts that included patients, physiotherapists and educators</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline and at 8 weeks (time 2)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with CBPE programme.  It will be assessed by seven items adapted from the original 13 item Physiotherapy Patient Satisfaction Scale questionnaire (Bassett, S., Clark, C. H., McNair, P., &amp; Harman, B., 2010).  Participants will score each item using a 7 point Likert scale.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Prospective participants are referred from the treating physiotherapist who determines if the participants are eligible for inclusion in the trial.  The researcher fully informs prospective participants about the study and their role in it.  Those who wish to participate sign a consent form.  They are then randomly allocated to either the CBPE or information DVD group.  The method of randomisation is concealed from the treating physiotherapist who is unaware of the group allocation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CBPE will improve rehabilitation outcomes, adherence, self-efficacy and knowledge for participants. CBPE can be developed using sound educational principles to foster patient understanding (see Mayer, 2001) and can incorporate behaviour changing strategies to enhance adherence (see Conner &amp; Norman, 2005). Moreover, the facility for interactivity using computer programmes can increase patient involvement and allow programmes to be tailored to individual patients.  Inherent to CBPE programmes, information is consistent and repeatable with access being limited only by computer availability. Patients can also offer multiple pathways to progress through programmes thereby accommodating individual learning styles. Although CBPE has been successfully developed in other sectors of healthcare (Keulers, Welters, Spauwen, &amp; Houpt, 2007; Stinson et al., 2008; Stromberg, Ahlen, Fridlund, &amp; Dahlstrom, 2002; Wetstone, Sheehan, Votow, Peterson, &amp; Rothfield, 1985), there are no known programmes of this type for physiotherapy rehabilitation. Given the extent to which patient education is used in physiotherapy, the poor adherence to it and recent advances in technology, investigation into the effectiveness of CBPE is warranted.</summary>
