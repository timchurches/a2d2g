  <interventions>
    <interventions>Energy Monitor is a wearable device that is used to estimate the total energy expenditure of normal daily physical activity. It works similar to pedometer. However, instead of measuring the number of footsteps, it measures the three dimensional body acceleration, from which an accurate estimate of energy expenditure can be derived.
Using the provided software, participants will be able to download and view the energy levels data. 
Participation in this trial starts after the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (third trimester) and ends on the day of delivery.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gestational diabetes is a problem in pregnancy that can be diagnosed in up to 10% of pregnant women. The majority of patients are managed with dietary advice and lifestyle measures alone. Dietary advice consists of education and meal planning addressing issues of caloric intake, content (fat &amp; carbohydrate) and timing of meals. Lifestyle measures revolve around suitable exercise and energy expenditure. Gestational diabetics monitor their blood glucose levels (BGL). This project collects data on energy expenditure through daily physical activity from pregnant women wearing a portable Energy Monitor, developed in our research group. There is no radiation associated with this monitor. Together with a record of food intake this study seeks to evaluate whether it is possible to calculate a differential between energy intake and energy expenditure that correlates with measures of glycaemic control (average daily BGLs), infant weight and maternal weight gain.</summary>
