  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each infant who is born at 32 weeks gestation or less, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and enrolled in the study will have a feeding tube inserted (InnerSense oesophageal temperature probe and feeding tube).  InnerSense has a thermistor in the 2nd lumen, which will monitor the core temperature of the infant.  The infant will also have a thermistor probe attached to the sole of the foot, which will measure the peripheral temperature.  Each infant enrolled in the study will have the device in situ from birth to four weeks.  Temperature will be recorded from this device and from the thermistor on the foot,  on a continuous 24 hour basis, all data is fed through the the monitor at the infants bedside.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our primary outcome is to see if there is an association between an alteration in core temperature (an increase) and peripheral temperature (a decrease) and the diagnosis of infection.
Other tests which will be used are observations by the clinical nurse and blood tests, which include, FBC, CRP and blood culture.
A positive blood culture will be used as the gold standard for confirmation of infection in the premature infant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From birth to four weeks of age (this will cover early and late sepsis).  Temperature will be measured on a continuous 24 hour basis, therefore outcome will be measured continuously until the device is removed, after four weeks.</timepoint>

SPSS will be utilised of the analysis of data
Numerical data will be described using mean and SD or median inter-quartile range (IQR) depending on the distribution
To record the percentage of infants who have an alteration in the core-peripheral temperature gradient and proven sepsis, as per positive blood culture.
Other relevant methods to analyse data will be determined by the statistician.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diagnosing neonatal infection, whether early or late , can be challenging as there is no one gold standard  test (Srinivansan and Harris, 2012).  Failure to diagnose infection in the newborn infant in a timely manner can lead to higher death and illness rates (Carcillo, 2006).  
Continued surveillance to monitor changes in the infants condition is also paramount to distinguish between infants with an infection and non-infected infants.  One way, which may help in the diagnosis of infection in the newborn premature infant is by measuring the body temperature and the skin temperature of the foot, on a continuous basis.All babies who are born at or before 32 weeks gestation are eligible for the study.  If you have given consent for your baby to be part of this study your baby will have temperature measured by a small probe, which is placed on the sole of the foot, a small thermometer  which is incorporated into the gastric tube ( all infants born and admitted to the neonatal unit will have one of these placed).  This tube is mainly used for two things, to vent the stomach to prevent build up of gas and to feed baby when ready.  Your  baby will also have a temperature which is measured under the arm.  We will collect information from your babys notes and observation charts.  Information which will be recorded and used in the study will be gender, antenatal history, birth score , gestational age, birth weight, temperature, blood test results and type of environment your baby is nursed in.
