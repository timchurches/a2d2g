    <interventions>Intervention: 30 g Chilli paste once daily for 8 days mixed into daily meals

This study is designed to compare the effects of acute and regular intake of 30 g of chilli paste and low dose (100mg) aspirin on platelet aggregation and brachial and central blood pressure.
The study consists of two 8 day intervention periods (2hr test on day 1, 1hr test on day 8), with a washout of at least 14 days between intervention periods.
On test days, blood samples will be collected when fasting and at regular intervals postprandially for either 1 or 2 hours. Subjects will consume meals during the 4 test sessions that consist of a meat (or soy alternative) patty in a bread roll and water, and are consumed with either the chilli or aspirin interventions.
Measures of blood pressure and blood vessel function will be collected every fifteen minutes for either 1 or 2 hours postprandially.
Comparisons will be made between the comparator and intervention on their effects after acute and regular consumption (8 days).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in Australia. Increased blood pressure (hypertension) and hyper-activation, or clumping, of platelets are two of the major risk factors for CVD. Blood pressure increases with hardening and narrowing of the blood vessels. Platelets, small cells in the blood, normally form clumps to stop bleeding. In some conditions, however, this clumping action may lead to narrowing and hardening of the blood vessels and affects vascular function.
Aspirin is the gold standard medication to prevent platelet aggregation, but regular aspirin use can cause damage to the lining of the stomach, resulting in bleeding. Previous research has found that chilli, a commonly used spice, can help prevent platelet aggregation. 

The aim of this intervention study is to compare the effects of a single dose of aspirin/chilli and their regular intake, on platelet aggregation and various measures of vascular function.</summary>
