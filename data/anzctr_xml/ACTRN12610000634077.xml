  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will be offered one weekly lessons in the Alexander Technique on 12 consecutive weeks. The lessons are hands-on guided movement sessions aimed at improving proprioceptive acuity and  postural control in everyday activity. Lessons typically last 30-40 minutes as timing varies depending on individual ability and wellbeing.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will continue to receive usual care from Guide Dogs NSW/ACT during the 12 week intervention period of the study. Participants access services from Guide Dogs NSW/ACT on a needs driven basis, and are free to contact the organisation at any time for help with their orientation and mobility needs. Services include mobility training and hazard assessment on specific routes, public transport training and the  use of  canes, dogs and electronic aids.</comparator>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>120 participants will be recruited into the study in 4 blocks.  After informed consent is gained baseline data collection will be carried out by Orientation &amp; Mobility (O&amp;M) Instructors from Guide Dogs NSW/ACT, trained as research assistants by the study team.  These research assistants will be involved in later assessments and will remain masked to treatment allocation.

Participants will be sequentially allocated a study ID number by the study coordinator at Guide Dogs NSW/ACT as they are recruited. The  study coordinator will be unaware of the allocation schedule, which will be held by the research team at the George Institute. The study coordinator will communicate the ID number, minus any personal details, to the research team at the George Institute, who will refer to a randomisation list to determine allocation.

The Alexander instructor will not be masked to intervention group allocation as the intervention is a physical modality delivered in the participantâ€™s home. However, this individual will not be involved in outcome assessments.

As an additional precaution to reduce the possibility of unmasking of participants to the research assistants, any participants requiring regular services from Guide Dogs NSW/ACT (usual care) will be assigned to O&amp;M instructors other than those involved in the research project. This means that the research assistants will only interact with the participants at data collection points.

 The data assessment forms given to the study team will only have the participants initials, date of birth and study ID number , so that those entering the data from the assessment forms will be blinded to allocation status.</concealment>
    <sequence>The sequence will be generated using on-line software to randomly allocate the intervention balanced for each block of participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vision impairment is a growing public health problem in an ageing population, is an independent risk factor for falls, and compounds the effects of other risk factors by reducing mobility and physical fitness. This randomised controlled trial will investigate the effect of the Alexander Technique on balance and mobility in adults over 50 with vision impairments. 

120 people over 50 years of age with vision impairments will participate in the trial. Participants will be independently mobile, with conversational English and no marked cognitive impairment. The intervention group will receive 12 home based lessons in the Alexander Technique on a weekly basis, and the control group will receive usual care.
Outcome measures will be collected by assessors masked to group allocation at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure will be physical ability using the Short Physical Performance Battery. Secondary outcome measures will be mobility measured with actigraphy and falls measured with 12 monthly calendars. A smaller sub-study will investigate changes in gait patterns.  Mood, quality of life, fall-related self-efficacy and functional vision will be measured with a series of validated questionnaires. 

If proven effective, the Alexander Technique will provide an additional modality to improve mobility and reduce falls risk in vulnerable adults with vision impairment.</summary>
