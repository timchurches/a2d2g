    <interventions>Irradiation with low-level laser in healthy women after episiotomy feeling perineal pain. The irradiation were applied in one single session in the episiotomy in three different points during 10 seconds in each point, using the low level laser with different waves lengths and with the sames doses: 35mW and 8,8J/cm2.
Group one, using low-level laser with wave length infrared (780nm) and Group two using red light (660nm).</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the perineal pain before and after the irradiation with low-level laser. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was applied to assess the perineal pain.</outcome>

      <outcome>To evaluate if the pain in the episiotomy to interfere on the development of the daily activities. A questionnaire indicating if the woman felt pain of 20 until 48 hours  after the childbirth to sit, to walk, to evacuate, to urinate and to breastfeed was applied.</outcome>

The subjects was elegible for inclusion in the trial and was blinded. The allocation was done by sealed opaque envelopes before the irradiation. One person was responsible for application and another researcher (blinded) was responsible for the evaluation of perineal pain.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>The treatments were carried once after the episiotomy at three points within the injury area. The dose per point was 8,8J/cm2 in the red and infrared group. The perineal pain was evaluated using the numerical scale for the pain (0 of 10) before and immediatly after the irradiation, for a blinded researcher.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy for relieving perineal pain from episiotomy aafter the normal birth. Was included in this study healthy women that felt perineal pain greater than or equal 3 in the VAS. The women were randomly distribute into three differents groups: 1. laser with wave length infrared; 2. red laser and, 3. the 'sham' group. The irradiation was applied to three different points of the episiotomy during 10 seconds in each point in one single session. The perineal pain was asked before and immediatly after the irradiation.</summary>
