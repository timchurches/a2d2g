  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be randomly assigned to the intervention diet (fructose restricted diet) which they will consume for 6 weeks. Participants will consume less than 50 gram fructose per day.

At each visit, participants will receive a 30 - 45 minutes consultation with a qualified dietitian. There will be four visits. One at each of the following time points: Baseline, then weeks 6, 10 and 16.

Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the intervention diet (fructose restricted diet) or the control diet (usual diet), which they will consume for 6 weeks. After a 4 week washout period, they will then consume the alternate diet for 6 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Consumption of high fructose diets have been shown to contribute to the rising incidence of obesity worldwide. Increased fructose intake has been associated with many of the components of metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, elevated waist circumference, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension), a precursor for the development of diabetes and heart disease. It is hypothesized that restricting dietary fructose intake results in reduced circulating blood lipid levels, increased satiety hormones and reduced inflammatory mediators and improved overall cardio-metabolic health.</summary>
