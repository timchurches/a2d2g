    <scientifictitle>The prospective, descriptive ACE (Anaesthesia Cognitive Evaluation) Study will identify whether preoperative cognitive impairment (Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)) increases the risk of PostOperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery (elective Total Hip Replacement (THR)) compared to a concurrent control group of medically managed patients with osteoarthritis (OA).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>To test whether MCI increases the risk of POCD following THR and to compare the change in cognitive function in patients undergoing THR for OA with a control group of patients who have OA that is managed medically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Medical management will be the use of anti-inflammatory medications as clinically indicated and prescribed by the treating physician. Patients will complete a battery of conventional and computerised neuropsychological tests preoperatively, and at 6 days, 3 months and 12 months post-operatively. The conventional battery is a set of eight paper and pencil tests (eg. trail making tests A and B, digit symbol test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test) and the computerised battery is a version of CogstateÂ®.                                                                                                                 The tests take about 1 hours to complete. Quality of Life (QoL), mood characteristics, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) will be assessed preoperatively and 3 and 12 months post-operatively.</interventions>
