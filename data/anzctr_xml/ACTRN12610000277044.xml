  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, observational study. We will collect physiological and anaesthetic data prospectively for anaesthetics completed at Auckland City Hospital in the next two years. Electronic anaesthetic records will be collected and physiological data, patient demographics, and any other routinely collected information will be extracted. Data from all physiological monitoring will be directly downloaded during the procedure. Please note: this will not alter standard patient care. Use of all standard and additional monitoring will remain at the discretion of the anaesthetist. In addition, software designed to accurately read and log drug infusion rates from automated Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA) pumps will collect drug bolus and infusion rate data directly.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The data will be used to evaluate the current response surface models available in the literature, pertaining to drug effect as measured by Bispectral Index Monitoring (BIS). Drug administrations observed in the clinical data will be used as model inputs, and predicted BIS outputs calculated. Predicted BIS will be compared with observed BIS (from the clinical data). 
Measures of model performance will include predictive performance (BISobserved - BISpredicted)  x 100) , bias and inaccuracy. Diagnostic plots (including predicted and observed effects over time) will also be used to evaluate model performance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation of models will be performed upon completion of data collection from 160 anaesthetic cases at Auckland City Hospital. We expect this will be fully completed April 2012</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pharmacological models have a variety of applications, including automated drug infusion pumps and human patient simulators. These applications often extrapolate models beyond the datasets in which they were developed, and the uses for which they were designed. As such, models require validation in new datasets to ensure adequate performance. Collection of drug administration and effect data can be used to validate drug dose  effect models. We will prospectively collect data from surgical cases at Auckland City Hospital. This will allow construction of an observational dataset from which current pharmacological models can be validated in our patient population.</summary>
