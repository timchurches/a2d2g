      <outcome>Number of Participants in the Indicated Categories for Antiviral Therapy Dose Reductions in the DB Phase - Participants were assigned a score equal to the number of times their dose of antiviral therapy (peginterferon or ribavirin) was reduced (0=no dose reductions [DRs]; 1=one DR; 2=two DRs; 3=three DRs; &gt;3=more than three DRs). When possible, every effort was made to maintain the recommended dose of antiviral therapy for the treatment duration in the DB Phase. However, when dose modification of antiviral therapy was required due to safety concerns, it was performed by the Investigator as per the region-specific product labels of peginterferon and ribavirin.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With the Indicated Levels of Peginterferon Dose Reductions in the DB Phase - The assigned dose in the DB Phase of peginterferon alfa-2a was 180 micrograms (µg). For peginterferon dose modification, downward adjustments in one-level increments were considered. The lowest dose of peginterferon alfa-2a that was allowed to be administered was 45 µg. When dose adjustment was required for moderate to severe adverse reactions (clinical and/or laboratory), an initial dose reduction to 135 µg was generally adequate. In some cases, a dose reduction to 90 µg or 45 µg was necessary. Dose increases toward the original dose were considered when the adverse reaction was resolved.</outcome>

The planned duration of antiviral therapy was 48 weeks for participants with Non-Genotype 2/3 and 24 or 48 weeks for participants with Genotype 2/3.</outcome>

IL28B genotype distribution by response to antiviral therapy (SVR/RVR responders: those who achieved SVR/RVR; SVR/RVR non-responders: those who did not achieve SVR/RVR) was assessed. The effect of genotype was tested by comparing participants that carried 2 copies of the IL28B favorable response allele versus the others (recessive model). Genotypes at rs12979860 were coded as: CC=1, CT or TT=0; rs8099917 was coded as TT=1, GT or GG=0.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of eltrombopag to maintain a platelet
      count sufficient to facilitate initiation of antiviral therapy, to minimise antiviral therapy
      dose reductions and to avoid permanent discontinuation of antiviral therapy. The clinical
      benefit of eltrombopag will be measured by the proportion of subjects who are able to achieve
      a Sustained Virological Response (SVR).</summary>
