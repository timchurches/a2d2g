Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Aliskiren / amlodipine - Patients received an aliskiren 150 mg tablet plus an amlodipine 5 mg capsule for 4 weeks and then were force titrated up to aliskiren 300 mg plus amlodipine 10 mg for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. During the 8 weeks, patients also received a placebo tablet and a placebo capsule. Patients took a total of 4 pills each day orally with water in the morning at approximately 8:00 am, except on the morning of a study visit when they took their study medications after all visit procedures and assessments had been completed.

Experimental: Aliskiren / hydrochlorothiazide - Patients received an aliskiren 150 mg tablet plus a hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule for 4 weeks and then were force titrated up to aliskiren 300 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. During the 8 weeks, patients also received a placebo capsule and a placebo tablet. Patients took a total of 4 pills each day orally with water in the morning at approximately 8:00 am, except on the morning of a study visit when they took their study medications after all visit procedures and assessments had been completed.

Experimental: Amlodipine / hydrochlorothiazide - Patients received an amlodipine 5 mg capsule plus a hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule for 4 weeks and then were force titrated up to amlodipine 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. During the 8 weeks, patients also received 2 placebo tablets. Patients took a total of 4 pills each day orally with water in the morning at approximately 8:00 am, except on the morning of a study visit when they took their study medications after all visit procedures and assessments had been completed.

Experimental: Aliskiren / amlodipine / hydrochlorothiazide - Patients received an aliskiren 150 mg tablet, a HCTZ 12.5 mg capsule and a placebo capsule for the first 3 days of treatment. Amlodipine 5 mg was then added for the remainder of the first 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of 4 weeks, patients were force titrated up to aliskiren / amlodipine / hydrochlorothiazide 300/10/25 mg for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. During the 8 weeks, patients also received a placebo tablet. Patients took a total of 4 pills each day orally with water in the morning at approximately 8:00 am, except on the morning of a study visit when they took their study medications after all visit procedures and assessments had been completed.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8) - Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0.5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff. Means of the 3 measurements were calculated. A negative change indicates lowered BP.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8) - Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0.5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients Achieving Blood Pressure Control at the End of the Study (Week 8) - Blood pressure control was defined as a msSBP/msDBP &lt; 140/90 mmHg at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Mean 24-hour Ambulatory Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8) - Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed in a subset of patients twice during the study, once at baseline and again at Week 8. The ABPM device was placed on the non-dominant arm between 7:00 and 10:00 am and verification readings obtained. If they were successful, the investigator initiated the 24 hour reading and instructed the patient regarding ABPM procedures. On the next day, the ABPM device was removed if it had been worn for a minimum of 24 hours. The ABPM data were downloaded and evaluated on site.</outcome>
