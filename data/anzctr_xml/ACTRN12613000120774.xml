  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether ginger can reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more, and you are scheduled to undergo chemotherapy for the first time. Trial details Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will take 4 ginger capsules per day, commencing 1 hour before chemotherapy and then every 3-5 hours for 4 days directly after. This will be repeated for 3 chemotherapy cycles. Participants in the other group will take an identical-looking sham tablet, i.e. one that has no active ingredients. Participants will not know whether they are taking the ginger or sham tablets until the end of the trial. All participants will be assessed over the 4 days post each chemotherapy session in order to determine: 1) the effect of ginger on chemotherapy-induced nausea; 2) the tolerability of ginger to chemotherapy patients when used alongside standard anti-nausea medication; and 3) the feasibility of introducing it in our clinical setting.</summary>
