  <interventions>
    <interventions>One hundred subjects of both sexes will be selected and assigned into two groups. Each group will have fifty participants. fifty patient with chronic mechanical neck pain for at least three months and compare with fifty asymptomatic subjects. Cervical angles (C2-C7, Oc-C2, C1-C2,) and anterior head translation (AHT) will be measured by using lateral X rays. Anthropometric measures of head neck and shoulder will be measured for both groups ( head circumference by medical tape, head breadth by sliding caliper, head depth by sliding caliper, head length bysliding calipar, neck circumference by medical tape, neck length by sliding caliparr, neck girth by sliding calipar and biacromial breadth by sliding caliper) and by antroposterior and lateral X rays. Activity of upper trapezius, anterior scalenes, erector spinae and sternocleidomastoid during resting by using EMG for both groups. Time of testing will be one hour in single occasion.</interventions>
