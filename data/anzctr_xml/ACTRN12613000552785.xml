  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group: High-dose progressive resistance strength training
Type of intervention: Extending and flexing the foot with progressive loading of weight using an ankle cuff.
Frequency: 3 x 25 min sessions per week plus 30 minutes rest after each session
Mode: One supervised training session at hospital and five home-based training sessions with parental supervision per fortnight
Dose: 2-3 sets of 8 repetitions at 50-70% of 1RM for 24 weeks. 1RM is measured every fortnight to adjust the weight lifted.

Adherence is monitored by an exercise diary documenting the number of training sessions completed and the intensity experienced with the Borg scale. </interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention group: Low-dose progressive resistance strength training
Type of intervention: Extending and flexing the foot with progressive loading of weight using an ankle cuff
Frequency: 3 x 25 min sessions per week plus 30 minutes rest after each session
Mode: One supervised training session at hospital, five home-based training sessions with parental supervision per fortnight
Dose: 2-3 sets of 8 repetitions at 5% of 1RM for 24 weeks. 1RM is measured every fortnight to adjust the weight lifted.

Adherence is monitored by an exercise diary documenting the number of training sessions completed and the intensity experienced with the Borg scale. </comparator>

    <concealment>Recruitment will be through referral from a Paediatric Neurologist, or those already enrolled in the Australasian Paediatric CMT Registry. 

Allocation concealment procedures: Randomisation will occur using a computer-generated algorithm, maintained and assigned by our NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence phone-based system. All investigators will be concealed to the randomisation process and allocation sequence.</concealment>
    <sequence>The 1:1 randomisation sequence using random blocks will be determined by a computer-generated algorithm, maintained and assigned by our NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence phone-based system, with stratification according to age (6-11 years, 12-17 years)</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Treatment effect between groups will be determined at 6-months (efficacy and safety), 12-months (maintenance of effect and safety) and 24-months (safety).

Based on previous studies and our pilot data, we estimate that a sample of 60 participants (30 per group) will provide 80% power (alpha 5%) to detect a difference between group means of 14% in dorsiflexion strength (SD 17%). We
assume a 50% correlation between pre- and post-test scores, loss to follow-up of 5% and non-compliance of 20%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will conduct a 2-year randomised controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of progressive resistance strength training of the foot and ankle in 60 children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). 

We will test the hypothesis that progressive resistance strength training is a safe intervention that will improve strength, disability, gait and quality of life in children affected by CMT.</summary>
