  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interpersonal counseling (IPC) .IPC is a short-term highly-structured psychological intervention, derived from Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) and suitable for different medical contexts.IPC is a treatment of six thirty-minute sessions, with the initial session being longer (1 hour). IPC is self-dosing: the patient determines the length of treatment, many patients feel satisfied with fewer than six sessions.In our study IPC have been adapted to accommodate needs of patients with Major Depression. In the trial the recommended number of counseling sessions is six-eight thirty-minute sessions weekly. Therapist determines if there is need of one or two additional session  (6+1 or 6 + 2).IPC is delivered by residents in psychiatry, or in clinical psychology .They attended a 3-days seminar on interpersonal theorys foundations and IPC structure and techniques; clinical examples were also discussed. Subsequently, monthly supervisions were scheduled with an IPT supervisor in order to discuss cases and to warrant the interventions consistency. IPC sessions were videotaped, after a signed consent  was obtained from the patient, and discussed during supervisions.
Patients with a HDRS score &gt; or =13 at 2-months follow-up will receive a combined treatment including IPC and SSRI. In particular those in IPC arm begin the antidepressant therapy and will continue IPC for further 4-6 sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>SSRI Antidepressants.The study evaluates the antidepressant treatment for depression as it might be delivered routinely in a clinical practice. Thus two antidepressive agents  citalopram or sertraline are used starting at 10-20 mg for citalopram and 25-50 mg for sertraline ,orally one daily, and eventually increasing until 60 mg or 200 mg, respectively, if depressive symptomatology does not improve (consultant psychiatrist clinical evaluation). The pharmacological treatment is continued for at least 4-6 months after the individual had responded as suggested by international guideline . Consultant psychiatrist chooses between the two treatment options based on his/her personal preference and informs Primary Care Physician by letter about the suggested pharmacological treatment. Moreover he/she provided psycho-education about antidepressants and theirs side effects. Two or three subsequent visits were planned every 2-3 weeks, lasting around 15 minutes in order to evaluate patients compliance, clinical response and initial side effects; a specific form was used to assess adverse events. Concerning SSRI the only one modification allowed is the switch from sertraline to citalopram and vice versa.Patients with a HDRS score &gt; or =13 at 2-months follow-up will receive a combined treatment including IPC and SSRI. In particular those in SSRI arm begin a regular 6-sessions IPC.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The main outcome of the study is the remission of depressive symptomatology measured with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).  The HDRS is the most widely used outcome measure in trials on depression . In detail we define remission a HDRS score less than 8.</outcome>
      <timepoint>HDRS will be administered at 2,6 months and 1 year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measure is an improvement in subjective functioning measured with the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) .It is a self-report 5-item scale used to measure functional impairment attributable to an identified problem or disorder. WSAS items investigates ability to work, home management, social leisure, private leisure, and relationships.</outcome>
      <timepoint>WSAS will be administered at 2,6 months and 1 year.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The recurrence of depressive symptoms at 12-months follow up visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (MINI) Plus will be readministered at 12-months follow up visit.
The instrument allows making a diagnosis according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study aims to compare a brief structured psychological intervention (IPC) with the use of antidepressants (SSRI) for the treatment of  major depression in primary care.
The research will evaluate the efficacy of the IPC and antidepressant and it will also evaluate the efficacy of a combined therapy for non responder patients.
Finally it will be tested the hypothesis that this psychological approach can reduce relapses in one year compared with those related to the use of andepressants.</summary>
