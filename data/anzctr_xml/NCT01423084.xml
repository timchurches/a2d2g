  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Serogroup B meningococcal vaccine

Experimental: MenB Lot 1 - MenB vaccine Lot 1: 2 doses administered 1 month apart

Active Comparator: MenB Lot 2 - MenB vaccine Lot 2: 2 doses administered 1 month apart


Other interventions: Serogroup B meningococcal vaccine
All subjects will receive two rMenB+OMV NZ vaccinations one month apart and will be followed for a total of 2 months. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms to receive either two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine Lot 1 or two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ Lot 2.
A total of 2 blood samples will be collected (at the first vaccination and 1 month after the 2nd vaccination). An additional blood draw will be collected in a subset of approximately 160 subjects (approximately 80 subjects in Group 1 and approximately 80 subjects in Group 2) at 2 weeks after the second vaccination

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence of rMenB+OMV NZ lot 1
      to rMenB+OMV NZ lot 2 when administered to adolescents, as measured by human serum
      bactericidal activity (hSBA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup
      B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) and as measured by ELISA geometric mean
      concentrations (GMCs) against vaccine antigen 287-953, approximately 30 days after a primary
      vaccination course of two doses administered one month apart.</summary>
