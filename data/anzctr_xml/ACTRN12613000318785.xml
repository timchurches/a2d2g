  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study uses a prospective blind comparison to a gold standard study design. It will take place in the acute renal ward in Middlemore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. Consenting patients (n=229) admitted to the ward will be recruited over a period of eight weeks. The undernutrition risk of each renal inpatient identified by the newly developed nutrition screening tool will be compared with their nutrition status assessed using the subjective global assessment and hand grip strength for validity. In the ward setting, the number and accuracy of dietetic referrals will be measured before and after implementation of the proposed tool. The newly developed screening tool is divided into two parts with nine questions regarding to weight loss in the past 30 days, appetite, oral intake and biochemical markers. Part one contains five compulsory questions. If a patient scores three or more in part one, a dietetic referral is generated. This means that this patient may be at risk of undernutrition requiring dietetic interventions. If a patient scores less than three in part one, part two consisting of four additional questions should be completed. If the total score of both part one and part two is three or more, a referral will be generated. The gold standard is aimed at providing a full nutrition assessment, ideally requiring significant dietetic input. However, the proposed tool is designed to be quick and easy so that it can be administered and completed by the nursing staff in approximately five minutes within 48 hours of admission. </interventions>
    <comparator>This study is investigating the reliability and validity of a screening tool by assessing inter-rater reliability and construct validity. There is no undernutrition screening currently operating on the ward level. However, the current standard dietetic referral practices in the acute renal ward are self dietetic referrals by the patients, oral or written referrals by the ward nursing staff, or direct referrals by the ward dietitians. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>TThe effectiveness of this proposed nutrition screening tool in recognising renal inpatients at risk of undernutrition in comparison with undernutrition assessments. Subjective global assessment and hand grip results will be used as the gold standard for assessing the sensitivity and specificity of the screening tool. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value and their 95% confidence intervals will be summarised. Multiple logistic regression models will be used to correlate results from the screening tool against the gold standard results, adjusted by patients characteristics.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Undernutrition in patients with renal failure is associated with longer hospital stay, reduced quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality. However, undernutrition is a condition that can only be treated once it has been identified. There have been many nutritional screening tools that were developed in various care settings worldwide. However, the incidence of undernutrition in hospital and failure to recognise or to refer for further nutrition assessments remain high. Since renal patients are particularly vulnerable to undernutrition, the development of a rapid nutrition screening tool that could be easily administered by the renal nursing staff without the requirement of dietetic training would be valuable. Hence, patients who may be malnourished can be accurately identified and referred to the dietetic services. These timely referrals can avoid the deterioration of nutrition status and reduce hospital stay and further complications among them.
The aim of this study is to develop and validate a rapid nutrition screening tool that is specific and sensitive to recognise renal inpatients at risk of undernutrition. The study will monitor the accuracy of the normal ward referral practice in identifying patients at risk of undernutrition and explore the acceptability of this new screening tool by the renal nursing staff.</summary>
