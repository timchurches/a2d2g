  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Observational research of operating theatre teams supports the proposition that failures in teamwork and communication are common and lead directly to compromised patient care and reduced productivity. High fidelity, immersive patient simulation is an exciting new technology that provides both a test laboratory for the study of medical error and health care teams, and a powerful medium for implementing change in the way health care teams function. This study is focused on measuring the impact of a simulation-based course on teamwork in the operating room.</summary>
