             sexual intercourse with a woman who could become pregnant until discharge from the
             study

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 56 days or donation of blood in excess of
             250 mL within 7 days prior to dosing

          -  Full ADP- and/or collagen-induced aggregation (greater than and equal to 40%) at all
             three concentrations of one or both agonists, as assessed within 6 months prior to
             first dose and at Day -1 of each period

          -  No ADP- or collagen-induced aggregation (less than 40%) at the highest concentration
             of either agonist, as assessed within 6 months prior to first dose and at Day -1 of
