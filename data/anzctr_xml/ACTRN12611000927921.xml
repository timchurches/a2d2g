  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this open trial participants will receive access to an 8 week internet-based treatment program. All participants will have at least mild symptoms of depression(PHQ- 9 total score of &gt;9). All participants will complete 5 lessons of Internet based treatment about management of symptoms of depression. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, a secure online clinician-moderated forum, and will read anonymous stories about other people with depression, taking a further 20 minutes per week. All participants will also receive automatic emails and brief weekly (&lt;10minutes week) supportive telephone calls from a Registered Psychologist.

Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-months post-treatment. These will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. The treatment materials are based on the Wellbeing Course, which teaches evidence-based cognitive behavioural skills.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants apply online, and those who meet inclusion criteria are administered a telephone interview to identify psychiatric diagnoses using the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview Schedule (MINI 5.0.0). Participants are then randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Allocation concealment will occur by providing allocation details for each successive participant in a sealed envelope, which recruitment staff are required to open serially.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomized using a list generated prior to the study via a software program (www.random.org), at another site, in another country. The list will then be transcribed and details transferred to sealed envelopes.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to explore the efficacy of a clinician-guided treatment program for symptoms of depression in older adults (aged 60-75), administered over the internet in a Ramdomised Controlled Trial. A secondary purpose is to determine the acceptability of the treatment protocol and materials to older adults with symptoms of depression. A tertiary purpose of this project is to explore the efficacy of a self-guided version of the program, with participants from the Waitlist Control Group.</summary>
