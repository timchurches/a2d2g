    <interventions>Cognitive behaviour therapy with long prolonged exposure (CBT/Long)  involves 12 once-weekly 90-minute sessions of individual therapy over 12 weeks. The therapy includes 4 sessions of emotion regulation skills training, 6 sessions of cognitive reframing and reliving trauma memories (for 40 minutes duration) and reappraisal of beliefs about traumatic experiences, and 1 sessions of relapse prevention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Cognitive behaviour therapy with brief prolonged exposure (CBT/Brief)  involves 12 once-weekly 60-minute sessions of individual therapy over 12 weeks. The therapy includes 4 sessions of emotion regulation skills training, 6 sessions of cognitive reframing and reliving trauma memories (for 10 minutes duration) and reappraisal of beliefs about traumatic experiences, and 1 sessions of relapse prevention.

In addition, participants will be randomized to wait-list for a period of 3 months after which they will be randomized to either CBT/Long or CBT/Brief.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will focus primarily on intent-to-treat analysis. Using SPSS version 24, hierarchical linear mixed models (HLM) will be used to study differential effects of each treatment condition. HLM involves a multilevel organization that includes fixed and random intercepts and slopes. Linear time effects, treatment condition, and their interaction were in the autoregressive models, which provides an index of the relative effects of the treatments. Fixed effects parameters were tested with the Wald test (t-test, p &lt;.05, two-sided) and 95% confidence intervals. Analyses focus on the primary (CAPS) and secondary (BDI, WHOQOL, Audit, PTCI) outcomes, with the primary outcome point being the 6-month follow-up. Subsequent secondary outcome point will be a 2-year follow-up. The proportion of police who no longer met criteria for PTSD (on treatment completers) will also be calculated. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will randomly allocate participants with PTSD to either cognitive behaviour therapy with long prolonged exposure (CBT/Long)  or cognitive behaviour therapy with brief exposure (CBT/Brief) or Wait-List. After the Wait-List participants were assessed after 3 months, they were randomly assessed to either CBT/Long or CBT/Brief.</summary>
