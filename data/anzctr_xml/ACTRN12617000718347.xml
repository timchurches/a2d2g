  <interventions>
    <interventions>Within a retrospective cohort design, exposure to antibiotics during pregnancy and the first 3 years of life were evaluated with respect to the frequency of exposure, gestational and postnatal age at exposure, antibiotic class, and type. The participants have already been followed up for at least 10 years. Data will be collected from medical records, hospital discharge abstracts and drug  information network.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group consists of all children who have not been exposed to any antibiotics during fetal period and after birth.   

The sources of data for this cohort study will come from the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository which is a comprehensive collection of data related to patterns of heath care and profiles of heath and illness for Manitoba residents. We focus on data collected from April1, 1995  to May 31, 2014.
Data on primary outcome measures from birth between January  1995  and December 2014 will be included in the analyses. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> While mental illness affects 20% of Canadians of all ages, youth and children are at greater risk with a total number of staggering 3.2 million children at risk of developing depression. Seventy percent of mental health problems have their onset during childhood or adolescence. According to the Manitoba Center for Health Policy (MCHP), 11 % of children in Manitoba is prescribed at least one antidepressant over the course of a year.The rate of anxiolytic, antipsychotic and psychostimulant prescriptions in Manitobas children has been increasing over the last decades, and the prevalence of pervasive development disorders doubled during a ten-year study period. While a complex interplay of genetic, biological, personality and environmental factors have been identified for the etiology, the role of gut-brain axis and microbiota composition in psychiatric pathology is remarkable. Animal models show the effect of gut microbiota on brain function through neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. Several factors including antibiotics can alter gut microbiota (dysbiosis) starting from very early life including fetal period and delivery. Childbirth exposes the human gut to a complex microflora, but the initial microbiome has a maternal signature. The linkage between dysbiosis and abnormal behavior has been documented in animal models, but limited studies in humans have supported this idea. A large Canadian cohort showed long lasting dysbiosis in infants born to mothers who received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. This idea was supported in a European cohort of infants who were exposed to antibiotics perinatally. A large provincial study also revealed that 37 % of children in Manitoba were exposed to antibiotics during the prenatal period indicating that these children might be at risk of developing psychiatric diseases.To date, no animal or human study has been conducted to assess the effect of early life exposure to antibiotics on mental health despite the evidence that early life period is a key time window in the establishment of the initial microbiome. To bridge the gap in the literature, our study is aimed to provide insight into the role of antibiotics in the development of psychiatric and behavioral disorders in later childhood. Proving a clear association between the use of antibiotics in pregnant women and their offsprings, and development of psychological and behavioral disorders later in life will send a paradigm-shifting message to mothers and physicians to be cautious about prescribing and using antibiotics in pregnancy and early childhood.
