  <interventions>
    <interventions>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced technique of therapeutic endoscopy for superficial gastrointestinal neoplasms. Three steps characterize it:injecting fluid (several fluids such as saline, glycerol and hyaluronic acid are usually combined with diluted epinephrine) into the submucosa to elevate the lesion,cutting the surrounding mucosa of the lesion, and dissecting the submucosa beneath the lesion.
    The amout of fluid varies according to the size of cancer and the amount is appropriate when the fluid injected can make the cancer safe enough for endoscopists to cut it off.
    This is a one-off treatment and the duration of ESD itself often varies from one hour to 3 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Laparotomy: subtotal gastrectomy.
Laparotomy means a cut in the abdomen in order to perform an operation or an examination. 
Gastrectomy means the surgical removal of all or part of the stomach.
Subtotal gastrectomy means the surgical removal of  part of the stomach.
This is a one-off treatment and the  duration of Laparotomy itself is often varies from 2 hours to 3 hours.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many articles have suggested that ESD is a safe and effective alternative treatment for early gastric cancer. But there is still no one,which is prospective randomised controlled ,  to compare ESD and laparotomy for early gastric cancer .
So our purpose is to compare esd and laparotomy for early gastric cancer in a prospective randomised controlled way.</summary>
