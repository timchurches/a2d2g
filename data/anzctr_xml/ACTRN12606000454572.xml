  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention arm will receive 

· Standard exercise instruction includes a discussion of basic anatomy and verbal explanation of the exercise
· Demonstration of the exercise by the physiotherapist 
· Physiotherapist give verbal feedback and correction of technique
· Child and parent view the multimedia package (CD containing animation of the exercises) with physiotherapist.
· The child will be expected to perform the exercise twice a day at home (This amount was decided by the physiotherapists involve in this study. It is based upon the usual amount they prescribe to children requiring this exercise). 
· Exercise diary will be provided to be taken home and filled out by the children for the next four weeks.


Patient will be asked to come for review in 4 weeks time. At the review appointment, the child will be asked to hand in the diary and perform the exercise whilst it is recorded by 2 video cameras.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study seeks to evaluate whether a multimedia approach improves performance and adherence of children to a home based exercise program prescribed by physiotherapist. This study will compare the usual current practice of providing verbal instructions and information leaflet to the new approach of providing a multimedia package in addition to verbal instructions.The hypotheses of this study is that a multimedia approach will improve the childs motivation to perform exercises and therefore increase their adherence to the prescribed program. We also hypothesised that providing an audio-visual reference for children will aid learning and increase their technical proficiency in performing the exercises. This trial will involve patients ranging between 6-18 years recruited from orthopaedic outpatients clinic (RCH), who require stretching exercises for either their calf or thigh muscles as part of their treatment. Patients will be divided randomly into two groups. Each group will receive either an instructional leaflet or a multimedia CD containing the exercise program to be taken home. They will also receive a diary to record their adherence to exercise.   Patients will be asked to return to the clinic 4 weeks after the initial consultation, and their exercise technique will be recorded on video and later evaluated by blinded expert panel.This information will then be analysed to see whether there is any improvement in the frequency (adherence) and the quality (performance) of the exercises.</summary>
