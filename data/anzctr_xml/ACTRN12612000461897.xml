  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children receive a minimum of 20 hours a week of intervention using the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) in a group setting. They also receive 1 hour a week of individual ESDM therapy. The ESDM will be administered for the duration of the children's attendance at the childcare centre. Children will complete assessments on entry to the childcare centre, and then on exit from the centre or at twelve months after entry, whichever occurs first.

The assessments administered at both timepoints will be the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. In addition, parents will be asked to complete a battery of self-report scales: the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS), the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Parent Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC), the Quality of Life in Autism Spectrum Disorders Questionnaire (QoLA). These measures are further detailed in the outcome fields of this form. 

The ESDM uses teaching strategies that involve interpersonal exchange and positive affect, shared engagement with real-life materials and activities, adult responsivity and sensitivity to child cues, and focus on verbal and nonverbal communication, based on a developmentally informed curriculum that addresses multiple developmental domains, namely Receptive Language, Expressive Language, Social Interaction, Fine/Gross Motor Skills, Imitation, Cognition, Play Skills, and Adaptive Behaviour/Personal Independence.

All therapists are trained on the administration and scoring of the ESDM and must demonstrate and maintain fidelity.</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be two comparator/control groups:
Typically Developing Control Group: Forty typically developing children attending a mainstream preschool will be recruited and complete the same battery of clinical assessments as the intervention group at baseline and after 12 months.
Treatment as Usual Group: Forty children currently diagnosed with ASD from the community will be recruited and complete the same battery of clinical assessments as the intervention group at baseline and after 12 months.

The assessments administered with the comparator/control groups will be the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. In addition, parents will be asked to complete a battery of self-report scales: the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS), the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Parent Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC), the Quality of Life in Autism Spectrum Disorders Questionnaire (QoLA). These measures are further detailed in the outcome fields of this form. While the comparator/control groups will receive the battery of baseline and 12-month assessments, they will not receive the ESDM intervention.

Treatment as usual group will not receive ESDM intervention, but will receive whatever interventions the children and family access of their own accord. We will gather this information about any other treatments received during the study period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are defined in terms of social and communicative impairment co-occurring with repetitive behaviours and restricted interests. The most severely affected individuals fail to develop functional language and show little ability or desire for social interaction. The causes of Autism are not known, although the high concordance rate found in twin studies suggests a strong genetic component. Studies of head circumference and imaging studies of brain morphometry have found evidence of increased brain growth beginning within the first year of life, while functional brain imaging in older children and adults has shown abnormal patterns of interactions between brain regions, possibly related to aberrant connections being laid down during earlier stages of development. 

One model relating these early abnormalities in brain development to the characteristic socio-communicative impairments has hypothesised that early low-level deficits in recognition and orientation towards social stimuli leads to lack of social engagement with primary caregivers during infancy, resulting in decreased exposure to the reciprocal social interactions critical for healthy development of brain circuits responsible for normal social behaviour (Dawson 2008). This model implies that intervention should occur as early as possible to normalize the developmental trajectory and avoid downstream effects, and that a key component of intervention may be to compensate for early deficits in social attention by providing interventions with emphasis on social interaction. Early intervention may also be important in order to take advantage of the increased plasticity present in the first few years of life (Dawson 2008). One such early intervention program consistent with these aims is the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), a comprehensive early behavioural intervention for infants to preschool-aged children with Autism that integrates applied behaviour analysis with developmental and relationship-based approaches (Rogers et al 2009). A recent randomised control trial in the United States demonstrated significant improvements in clinical outcomes for children receiving ESDM (Dawson et al 2010). After the first 12 months, 18- to 30-month-olds with Autism who received the program showed significant gains in visual processing and improvements in language abilities with subsequent gains in IQ and adaptive behaviour as well as being more likely to receive a less severe diagnosis upon re-assessment.

This study seeks to replicate and extend upon the recent positive international findings regarding the benefits of the ESDM model to children with ASD in an Australian context.
