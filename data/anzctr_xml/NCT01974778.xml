  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Brown adipose (fat) tissue (BAT) is a type of fat tissue found in certain small rodents and
      human babies that is capable of extremely high rates of energy burning. We now know that in
      adult humans it is present and also able to burn energy.

      In addition to increased energy expenditure during cold exposure, energy burning is also
      increased after consuming a meal. Animal studies have shown that part of this additional
      energy consumption is contributed by BAT. In the present study we will aim to examine whether
      BAT activity is increased after a meal.</summary>
