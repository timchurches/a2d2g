    <interventions>Purpose of this study is to analyse the reliability and validity of the Mshorts (a wearable EMG) in individuals with patellofemoral pain syndrome and those with no knee pain. Therefore, volunteers will wear a pair of shorts with sensors that measure muscle contraction (the Mshorts) and they will perform three tasks, including 10 repetitions of each: (1) full squat test, (2) stair climbing and (3) single leg squat test. Muscle activation of the quadriceps and hamstrings will be analyzed. The participants will perform trials in the same manner on two different days for reliability analysis, with an interval of 2 to 7 days between the 2 collection dates. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sixty individuals will be recruited. This sample size was calculated from two previous studies, in which the purpose was to analyse EMG changes of the EMG signal in patients with PFPS and between the two types of squat. Based on previous research we performed on EMG differences between people with and without PFPS (Ferrari 2014) we used an effect size of 0.75. Results with the greatest standard deviation and greatest detected difference were used for sample calculation, with a test power of 80% (1-beta=0.80) and a=0.05, two tail.
The descriptive values (means +/- SDs) will be obtained using SPSS software version 18. The data will be analyzed for normality of distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk W test. Independent t tests and analyses of variance will be used to identify the differences between groups. For a relative measure of reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the kappa statistic  will be used (Weir 2005). ICC values in the .00 to .25 range indicate little, if any, reliability; the .26 to .49 range indicate poor reliability; the .50 to .69 range indicate moderate reliability; the .70 to .89 range indicate high reliability; and the .90 to 1.0 range indicated very high reliability (Mathur et al. 2005; Kellis and Katis 2008). The standard error of measurement (SEM) will be used to express the reliability in absolute values (Weir 2005), indicating the precision of the measurement (Denegar and Ball 1993). A low SEM indicates better reliability of the measurement (Kellis and Katis 2008). After calculating the reliability of the EMG parameters, the diagnostic accuracy will be determined. The term accuracy refers to the amount of agreement between the information from the reference standard and the index test (Bossuyt et al. 2004). To examine the diagnostic accuracy value of the index test, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) will be calculated (Jaeschke et al. 1994; Fritz and Wainner 2001).
Noteworthy, reference standard is defined as the best-available method to determine the absence or presence of the condition of interest (Bossuyt et al. 2004). In this study, the reference standard will be the diagnostic criteria listed earlier (inclusion criteria). The index test, which is the test under evaluation (Bossuyt et al. 2004), will be the EMG signal obtained from Mshorts during tasks such as full squat test, step up test and single leg squat test. EMG parameters should be reliable, precise, and able to differentiate participants with PFPS and pain-free participants. The time interval between the assessments by the reference standard and the index test is up to 1 week.
