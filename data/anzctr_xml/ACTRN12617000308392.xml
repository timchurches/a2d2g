    <interventions>The study aims to develop a questionnaire - the EORTC QLQ-MEL-38 - measuring the quality of life (QOL) for patients with melanoma.  EORTC stands for the 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer' and the melanoma questionnaire is being studied by the quality of life working group. The QLQ_C30 has been adapted for many specific cancer types. The objective of the study is to better understand and evaluate the experience of people diagnosed and treated for melanoma and its impact on their life. 

Patients with melanoma will be asked to complete a data collection pack containing some questionnaires whilst they are waiting to be seen at an outpatient appointment. A member of the research team will complete a form by asking the patient some socio-demographic information including: age, gender, initials, date of birth, indigenous status, country of birth, level of education attained, living circumstances and employment status..The study team member will then ask about the treatment and investigations for melanoma the patient has had and how long they have been attending the clinic.

Patients are then asked to complete 2 standard questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and HADS), followed by a questionnaire that is the new research tool being tested. The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a tool to asses the quality of life in patients with any form of cancer. It includes questions about the patient's rating of his/her physical and mental health. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).questionnaire is used to assess the levels of anxiety and depression that a patient may be experiencing.

After completing the questionnaires, patients are asked to complete a survey asking what they thought of the questionnaires and if they required help in answering them.

The entire process should take approximately 40 minutes. Patients may have any stage of melanoma which has been diagnosed in the past 5 years and they may be at any point in their treatment journey. Patients who complete the above data collection pack and who are in routine follow up care will be invited to re-take the same questionnaires a second time at 2 weeks from the first completion. This is to examine the reliability and validity of the melanoma questionnaire.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Standard statistical tests will be performed using SPSS, all hypothesis testing will be two-sided and considered significant if p&lt;0.05. Data distributions (item responses) will be examined by descriptive statistics and item analysis performed to identify outliers and any items with restriction in range (e.g. floor or ceiling effects). For the QLQ-C30, missing values will be treated in accordance with existing guidelines. For items in the Melanoma Module, missing values analysis and estimation/imputation of missing values may be performed if less than 10% of data are missing.

2. Factor structure: Preliminary psychometric testing, conducted at the end of Phase 3 has already identified a set of hypothesised scales for the Melanoma Module. These Phase 4 data will be used to re-confirm whether the factor structure still holds via Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with Oblimin rotation. Items with a factor loading coefficient greater or equal to 0.4 will be retained in each subscale. Scores for items with negative loadings will be reversed and scales calculated in the normal way by simple addition of the scores for each item within each factor, as recommended by Gorsuch. Rasch analysis using RUMM 2030 will be carried out to assess consistency of item functioning across the sample.

3. Reliability: Item reliabilities will be examined using Cronbach Alpha coefficients with alpha = 0.70 considered to reflect an optimal internal consistency. 

4. Face and Content Validity: This will be assessed by selecting subsets of patients, with lowest and highest scoring questionnaires and reviewing the clinical pathways and current outcomes for these patients. 

5. Convergent and Discriminant Validity: Multi-trait scaling analysis will be employed to examine whether the individual items in the module can be aggregated into hypothesised multi-item scales. Evidence of item convergent validity is defined as correlation of 0.40 or greater between an item and its own scale (corrected for overlap). Means, standard deviations, medians and 95% confidence intervals around the median will be calculated using Confidence Interval Analysis. Test retest correlations will be calculated using an Intra Class Correlation developed by Shrout and Fleiss..  

6. Construct validity: Each of the scales will be examined by performing a range of significance tests. Based on the findings from the literature review and interview data, various hypotheses will be generated and tested using individual scale and total scores. Using the demographic characteristics to form distinct groups from within the whole sample, non-parametric statistical methods will be used to identify and measure differences between extreme groups, as recommended by Siegel. Group comparisons will include local disease group versus metastatic groups, male versus female, current treatment group versus follow up group and change in ECOG status

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate a new questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-MEL-38, in comparison to two existing questionnaires assessing quality of life in participants with melanoma, to ensure that the questions accurately capture how a patient with melanoma feels when they are going through treatment and follow-up care, and how this affects mood, relationships, daily living activities, work life and the experience of being a patient in hospital.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this study if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with melanoma within the previous 5 years.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this study will be asked to complete a brief survey which includes personal information such as living circumstances, work status and information relating to their melanoma and treatment. They will then complete five paper-based questionnaires which ask questions about quality of life, one of which is the new questionnaire being evaluated. Participants will also be asked for feedback on the new questionnaire. This whole process should take about 40 minutes and can be completed during the time spent in the clinic.

It is hoped that the findings from this study will lead to validation of the new questionnaire as an accurate quality of life assessment specific to patients with melanoma.</summary>
