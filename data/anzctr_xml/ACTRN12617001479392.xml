  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mindful Self-Care and Resiliency Intervention is a brief psychosocial intervention that integrates key principles and practices of mindfulness-based therapy with compassion fatigue prevention education. The program was developed by researchers from Curtin University based on principles from Gentry and colleagues (1998) and Segal and colleagues (2002). The MSCR intervention consists of a full-day educational workshop divided into four sessions of about 1.5 hours each. This is followed by three sessions (one session per week) over the next 3-week period.  These sessions will be 1.5 hours in duration and provided in-person. All intervention groups will be facilitated by a clinical psychologist with extensive experience in running the intervention. A train-the-trainer model will be utilised whereby the facilitator will then provide a training session to the designated trainer who will then sit in on an entire intervention group. A central aim of the five mindfulness sessions (Session themes: Autopilot, Staying Present; Allowing / Letting Be; Thoughts as Thoughts; Review) is to learn mindfulness-based skills and practices to support Compassion Fatigue resiliency. Mindfulness sessions are adapted from an abbreviated protocol described by MacKenzie et al. (2006), based on Segal et al. (2002). Both formal (e.g., body and breath; body scan; mindful movement and stretching; sitting with the breath, body and thoughts) and informal practices (e.g., breathing space, mindful eating) as described by Williams and Penman (2011) will be included (about 10 to 25 minutes duration), and assigned as home-based practice exercises using a CD where applicable. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Burnout. Burnout will be assessed using the Short Burnout Measure (2005) - a short ten-item version of the widely used 21 item scale. Data from 2 national samples (Israeli Jewish and Arab) and 3 occupational samples attest to the validity and reliability of the BMS. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre, post (primary timepoint), one-month, six month and 12 month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stress. Stress will be measured using the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). This measure is widely used and well validated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre, post (primary timepoint), one-month, six month and 12 month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resilience. Resilience will be measured he Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale [CD-RISC10] short form of the original 25-item tool developed as a survey based measure of stress, coping ability or resilience. A 5-point response scale asks participants to rate how much they feel a series of statements applied to them over the previous month. Higher scores reflect greater resilience.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre, post (primary timepoint), one-month, six month and 12 month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compassion satisfaction will be measured using the Compassion satisfaction sub-scale of the The Professional Quality of Life Scale version 5 [ProQol5] </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre, post, one-month, six-month and 12 month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Well-being will be measured using the WHO (Five) Well-being Index - a short instrument measuring subjective quality of life based on positive mood, vitality and general interest.  </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research trial is to investigate whether the Mindful Selfcare and Resiliency intervention is effective in reducing burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and symptoms of general psychological distress in nurses working in an Australian tertiary hospital. Secondary aims are to determine whether the intervention increases protective factors for occupational stress, including compassion satisfaction, self-compassion and resilience. 
Our primary hypothesis is that nurses completing the MSCR intervention will show significant reductions in symptoms of burnout, secondary traumatic stress and general psychological distress from pre to post intervention and from pre intervention to follow-up. A secondary hypothesis is that nurses completing the MSCR intervention would show significant improvements in compassion satisfaction, self-compassion and resilience from pre-post intervention and from pre-intervention to follow-up.
