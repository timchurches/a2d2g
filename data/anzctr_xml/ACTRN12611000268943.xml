    <concealment>Families will be approached early in their baby's stay by the medical or nursing staff in the unit, the study discussed and consent obtained.
When a painful procedure is carried out, a nurse not involved in the care of the child will retrieve a sealed envelope from the drug room to allocate the baby to either breast milk or sucrose.  They will then administer the solution without other staff or family being aware of the solution used.
The babies themselves are not blinded because of the difference in taste between sucrose solution and breast milk.</concealment>
    <sequence>Envelopes will be assigned a random number associated with breast milk or sucrose solution via a spreadsheet.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Giving babies either a sugar solution or breast milk into their mouth is well known to reduce pain during blood tests or other painful procedures.
No studies have compared the effectiveness of these two methods in the premature babies of a neonatal unit, who unfortunately often have to undergo a number of painful procedures during their stay.  Currently in our unit we use both solutions, and this study aims to formally record which babies are receiving which solution and score their pain using monitoring of heart rate, oxygen levels, and facial expressions.  Each baby will be randomly assigned one of the two solutions, and a nurse who does not know which solution has been given will calculate the pain score during the procedure.
We hope to provide good evidence for both our own and other neonatal units so that we can give the safest, most effective pain relief to our premature babies.</summary>
