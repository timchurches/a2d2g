  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nurse-initiated pain protocol in emergency department - involved the administration of various oral analgesic medications (type of drug and dose specified) depending on the patient's pain score (0-10).  For example, 2 x paracetamol 500mg oral (or 2 x Ibuprofen 200mg ) for mild pain (pain score 1-3); 2 x paracetamol 500mg with codeine 30mg (or 3 x Ibuprofen 200mg/Codeine 12.8mg) for moderate pain (pain score 4-6), and oxycodone 5mg for severe pain (pain score 7+).  The nurse-initiated analgesia protocol could only be used once for each patient without further consultation with a medical officer, ie the duration was for initial pain relief in the Emergency Department only.  The nurse-initiated protocol was trialled between 4 April 2009 and 25 June 2009.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We sought to introduce and evaluate the practice of nurse-initiated analgesia in the emergency department of a busy tertiary hospital in Western Australia, whereby the ED triage nurse (or other specifically trained ED nurse) administered analgesic medications according to a pre-defined protocol, without the patient being first assessed by a medical officer.</summary>
