  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm1.  Intravenous infusion of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) at a dose of 0.9 pmol/kg/min.  The GLP-1 will be obtained from Bachem AG in sealed vials (Clinalfa). The  GLP-1 will be infused  for 240 min into fasted individuals in the early morning. Plasma concentrations of GLP-1 will be measured.
Arm2. Infusion of 0.9% saline as a control. There will be a 3 week washout period between treatments in an individual to prevent carryover from one treatment to the next. </interventions>
    <comparator>An infusion of sterile, 0.9% saline at the same rate as the infusion of GLP-1 will serve as a control. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculation: A previous study (Regulatory Peptides 2013; 183: 54-61) has reported that a significant 2h decrease of 0.5 ng/l  (42%) in plasma IL-6 concentrations during a GLP-1 infusion in 6 obese, diabetic subjects. Using the SD (0.55 ng/l) for the 60 min change in plasma IL-6 concentration during oral glucose ingestion in our previous study (PLoS One 8(6): e66395. Doi:10.1371/journal.pone.006395.), we calculate (using interactive website Statistical Considerations for Clinical Trials and Scientific Experiments hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/sample_size.html) that a difference of 0.5 ng/l in plasma IL-6 between GLP-1 and placebo treatments could be detected in 12 individuals in a crossover study at 80% power and P=0.05.
Statistical analysis: Change in outcome variables during the infusions will be dependent variables in linear mixed models analysis with fixed effects of treatment, order of treatments, period, baseline value (covariate) and gender and a random variable for participants. For plasma markers of inflammation measured at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min, linear mixed models with treatment, order of treatments, period, time, treatment x time, baseline values and gender as fixed effects and a variable for participants as a random effect, will also be tested. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the risk factors for developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease (heart attacks and stroke) is obesity. We think that one of the reasons that obesity increases this risk is because there is increased production of inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-a, in fat (adipose) tissue. These inflammatory molecules may damage blood vessels and reduce the effectiveness of the bodys glucose regulating hormone called insulin.  A hormone called glucogon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is released from the gut early after intake of food, is thought to decrease inflammation.  However, there is little known about the effect of GLP-1 on inflammation in adipose tissue.  Our previous research has shown that levels of IL-6 in the blood decrease early after ingestion of food. This decrease in IL-6 levels might be due to an increase in GLP-1 levels in the blood after a meal.  The aim of our study is to determine the effect of GLP-1 infusion on adipose tissue inflammation and plasma concentrations of IL-6 and other inflammatory molecules in obese people.</summary>
