  <interventions>
    <interventions>Our study compares the application of oxygen via nasal prongs to nasopharyngeal cannula during the period of apnoea, prior to intubation. 
 Nasal prongs are a non-invasive means of delivering oxygen. They are comprised of a lightweight tube with two small prongs, each of which enters the nostrils, through which a mixture of oxygen and air is delivered. It is connected to an Oxygen supply.
Nasopharyngeal cannula is a longer, flexible tube which is passed through a single nostril, further into the upper airway until the tip comes to rest at the oropharyngeal inlet. This is also non-invasive and is connected to an oxygen supply so that air and oxygen can be delivered through it. 
We will apply the chosen device to our patients before anaesthetic induction and provide normal pre-oxygenation. Oxygen will then run through the devices at 15Litres/minute. This will flow for three minutes, after the patient stops breathing and before intubation is attempted. 
Normally, no devices are applied to the patient during this period. 
The concentration of oxygen (Fi02) at the pharyngeal inlet is measured just prior to intubation. We will compare these values. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our primary outcome is fraction of inspired Oxygen (Fi02) at the pharyngeal inlet after three minutes of apnoeic oxygenation. We consider a difference of 5% to be clinically significant between the two groups. That is, between the nasal prongs cohort and the nasopharyngeal cohort. 
 This will be measured from a gas sampling line which will be placed at the pharyngeal inlet after the onset of apnoea. Measurements of Fi02 will be recorded after two minutes and three, but our primary outcome measurement will be that at three minutes. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Fi02 levels after three minutes of apnoea. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our secondary outcomes will include difference in Fi02 levels after two minutes of apnoea, measured at the pharyngeal inlet by a gas sampling line. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Fi02 levels after two minutes of apnoea.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our secondary outcomes will include a drop in oxygen saturations to &lt;94% as measured by peripheral oximetry. If, at any point before the three minuted of apnoea has elapsed, the oxygen saturation falls below this level, the patient will be hand ventilated and efforts made to increase saturations or secure an definitive airway early. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Oxygen saturations falling at any point in the study  to &lt; 94% durng the three minutes prior to intubation. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis has been performed. We will compare FiO2 between the intervention groups with a t-test. We consider a difference of 5% or more in FiO2 between nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal cannula to be clinically significant. So to look for a difference of 5%, with an estimated standard deviation of 5% in each group, and an alpha = 0.05 (two-sided) and 90% power we will need 22 patients in each intervention group. This gives a total recruitment of 44 patients.
 We will perform a students t-test to compare the two groups and determine any clinical statistical significance. </statisticalmethods>

Update

The research project is comparing different devices for giving oxygen during the start of an anaesthetic. The different devices are called nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal cannula. Nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal cannula are already approved in Australia to supply Oxygen to patients in hospital.

All participants will receive Oxygen through a face mask before they are put to sleep for an operation. In addition, participants may receive additional Oxygen through nasal prongs or nasopharyngeal cannula. You will then be given anaesthetic medication and will go to sleep as normal. In this study, we would like to see how patients Oxygen levels in their throat change once they are asleep, enabling us to compare the different devices in terms of their effectiveness and the extent to which they can increase oxygen levels. 
Our hypothesis is that each of the devices will increase Oxygen levels and we aim to determine if there is any difference between these two devices with respect which may be more effective at delivering Oxygen for this purpose. </summary>
