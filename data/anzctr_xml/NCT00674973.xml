  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Erlotinib
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Erlotinib - Participants with advanced pancreatic carcinoma with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score of 0 to 2, who had failed 1 prior regimen of chemotherapy or who were considered unsuitable for chemotherapy, received erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or death.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants with advanced pancreatic carcinoma with ECOG PS score of 0 to 2, who had failed 1 prior regimen of chemotherapy or who were considered unsuitable for chemotherapy, received placebo matching to erlotinib 150 mg tablet orally once daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or death.


Treatment: drugs: Erlotinib
Participants received erlotinib 150 mg tablet orally once daily.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Participants received placebo matching to erlotinib 150 mg tablet orally once daily.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first occurrence of PD or death whichever occurred first. Participants without event were censored at the date of last tumor assessment where non-progression was documented. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the time of randomization until progression of disease or death (up to 30 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response Rate - Response rate was defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 criteria, for at least 4 weeks at any time during randomized treatment (confirmed response). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the time of randomization until progression of disease or death (up to 30 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control Rate (DCR) - Disease control rates (DCR) were measured according to RECIST Version 1.0 criteria. Disease control was defined as being a responder or as having stable disease for at least 6 weeks post-randomization. Stable disease was defined as having neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization to Clinical Cutoff: 20 December 2010 (up to 30 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the time of randomization until or death (up to 30 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who was administered a study treatment, regardless of whether or not the event had a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, could be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study treatment, whether or not related to the treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 28 days after discontinuation of study drug (up to 30 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to identify biomarkers which may predict improvement in progression
      free survival from treatment with Tarceva, in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who
      failed one prior regimen of standard chemotherapy or who are deemed unsuitable for
      chemotherapy. It will also assess the efficacy and safety of Tarceva in this patient
      population. Patients will be randomized to receive either Tarceva 150mg/day po, or placebo po
      daily. Tumor tissue will be used for biomarker analysis. The anticipated time on study
      treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</summary>
