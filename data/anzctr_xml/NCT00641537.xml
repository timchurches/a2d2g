  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 Lymphocyte Toxicity - Lymphocyte toxicity was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). CTCAE grade for absolute lymphocyte counts included: Grade 1 = less than lower limit of normal; Grade 2 = less than 800 per cubic millimeter (/mm^3); Grade 3 = less than 500/mm^3; Grade 4 = less than 200/mm^3.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 120</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, or diseases that emerges or worsens relative to baseline during a clinical study with an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), regardless of causal relationship and even if no IMP has been administered. SAE: Any AE that resulted in death; was life threatening; resulted in persistent/significant disability/incapacity; resulted in/prolonged an existing in-patient hospitalization; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or was a medically important condition.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to week 120</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Median Time to Recovery From Grade 3 or 4 Lymphocyte Toxicity - Lymphocyte toxicity was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). CTCAE grade for absolute lymphocyte counts included: Grade 1 = less than lower limit of normal; Grade 2 = less than 800 per cubic millimeter (/mm^3); Grade 3 = less than 500/mm^3; Grade 4 = less than 200/mm^3. Recovery from a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity is defined as a return to a Grade 0 or 1 during the CLARITY Extension Study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 120</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Who Developed Herpes Zoster Infections and Malignancies - Herpes zoster infection is defined as having at least one adverse event coded to medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) preferred terms herpes zoster, herpes zoster iridocyclitis, herpes zoster ophthalmic, herpes zoster multi-dermatomal, herpes zoster infection neurological, herpes zoster oticus. Malignancy is defined as having at least one adverse event coded to MedDRA preferred terms under the pre_specified grouping Malignant and unspecified tumors.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 120</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annualized Qualifying Relapse Rate - A qualifying relapse was defined as an increase of 2 points in at least one functional system of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) or an increase of 1 point in at least two functional systems (excluding changes in bowel or bladder function or cognition) in the absence of fever, lasting for at least 24 hours and to have been preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability or improvement. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]) was calculated. The annualized relapse rate for each treatment group was calculated as the total number of confirmed relapses divided by the total number of days on study multiplied by 365.25.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Number of Combined Unique (CU) Lesions - Mean Number of CU lesions were measured by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Disability Progression (Confirmed After 3 Months) - Time to disability progression was defined as the time to a sustained increase in EDSS score of at least 1 point if baseline EDSS score between 0.5 and 4.5 inclusively, or at least 1.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was 0, or at least 0.5 point if the baseline EDSS score was at least 5, over a period of at least three months. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) was calculated. As few participants have reached EDSS progression, fourth Percentile of time to sustained increase in EDSS score was reported using Kaplan-Meier survival curve.</outcome>
