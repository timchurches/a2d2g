  <interventions>
    <interventions>It is a three week randomised crossover study investigating if consumption of cow milk improves the capacity of human cells to maintain integrity of their genetic material.
The study will involve three interventions (each drink once only) comparing the effect of 500ml reduced fat milk (2% fat) with that of 500ml orange juice and 500ml water.
Participant will be fasting overnight. The next morning they will donate first blood sample. Ten minutes later they will ingest 500ml of the assigned drink, which must be consumed within 5 minutes. More blood will be collected 1.5 hours, 3.0 hours and 4.5 hours after consumption of the drinks. There is 1-week wash-out period between each intervention.</interventions>
