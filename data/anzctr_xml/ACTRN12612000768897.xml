  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Surgical site infection.
Using the standard follow-up tool to our department - the "Lead Maternit Carer" (LMC) reviews the patient regularily once discharged over the 6 weeks post-partum. Any surgical site infection is reported back at 6 weeks.
The surgical site infection is defines as:
Superficial and Deep Surgical Site Infection:  Infection within 30 days of operation.
Superficial - involves skin/sub-cut tissue of incision only and one of; purulent discharge, organisms isolated from aseptically obtained culture, pain or tenderness, localised swelling, redness, heat, superficial incision opened by surgeon unless culture negative, diagnosis of infection by attending physician/surgeon.
Deep - involves deep soft tissue and one of; purulant discharge, spontaneous dehiscence or deliberately opened in the presence of temp &gt;38C or pain/tenderness unless culture negative, abscess found on examination during surgery, radiology or histopathology, diagnosis of deep infection by attending physician/surgeon.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Wound infection within 30 days post-caesarean section reported back at 6 weeks post-partum by the LMC.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Wound/fascial dehiscence.
In event of suspected wound dehiscence the patient will be reviewed at Dunedin Hospital, Queen Mary Maternity Services and fascial dehiscence will be diagnosed by medical staff (independant medical examination).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 30 days post-caesarean section.</timepoint>

Envelope method with variable block size â€“ chosen to reduce any perceived complication of randomisation (especially in the case of Emergency Caesareans performed at night) and increase uptake.
Randomised by the circulating midwife, prepared by the scrub midwife and then blinded to the surgeon, woman undergoing caesarean and LMC.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is hoping to find out if a new type of antibacterial-coated stitch will help to reduce the risk of infection in the wound after Caesarean Section delivery.  At the time of Caesarean Section we will pick, by chance, half of the women in the study to receive the coated stitch in place of the routine non-antibacterial stitch when closing the skin and deeper layers but not the uterus (womb).  All other aspects of the care relating to the Caesarean Section will remain unchanged.  The follow-up and post-operative care will remain as standard.  30 days after the operation we will collect information from the patients midwife/LMC about whether she has had any signs or symptoms that might suggest infection in the wound.  Treatment of any infection will not be altered or delayed because of the trial.
We will use this information to find out if the antibacterial stitch reduces the risk of infection for women after Caesarean Section.
We hypothosise that the antibacterial stitch will reduce the occurance of wound infection.</summary>
