  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic Rhinosinusitis is a chronic condition of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Patients suffering from chronic sinusitis complain of headaches, nasal congestion and thick nasal discharge. The burden of chronic sinusitis on our society is high. It causes increased cost to health care system and decreased productivity with loss of work days. No single treatment was found to control the symptoms of chronic sinusitis. It was found that dry mannitol delivered to the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis makes the secretions less thick, easier to clear and symptoms better controlled. We believe these effects are transferrable to chronic sinusitis patients. We believe that mannitol will help loosen their nasal discharge, making it easier to clear and eventually control their symptoms better</summary>
