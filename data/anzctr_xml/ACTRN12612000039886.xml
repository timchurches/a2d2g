  <interventions>
    <interventions>Test group will receive one (1) topical application of capsaicin (Zostrix, 0.075%) to the L1-L5 dermatomes bilaterally.  The capsaicin applied to each subject will not be standardized since we are not investigating dose responses; a thin layer of capsaicin will be applied to cover the dorsal skin areas bounded anatomically by the 12 rib line (superiorly), the lateral border of the trunk (laterally) and a transverse line through the posterior superior iliac spine (inferiorly).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will receive one (1) topical non-sensitizing cream (Biotone) with similar colour and texture to Zostrix.  The cream will be applied to the L1-L5 dermatomes bilaterally.The total amount of cream will not be standardized since we are not investigating dose responses; a thin layer of cream will be applied to cover the dorsal skin areas bounded anatomically by the 12 rib line (superiorly), the lateral border of the trunk (laterally) and a transverse line through the posterior superior iliac spine (inferiorly).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of central sensitization (increased excitability of the central nervous system) on the recruitment and perceived effort of low back muscles during static low back stabilizing exercise.  We will compare the activation patterns and subjective measures of perceived contraction intensity before and after the experimental induction of central sensitization.  This data important to the understanding of the mechanisms of low back injury and will provide insight into therapeutic strategies for low back injury prevention.</summary>
