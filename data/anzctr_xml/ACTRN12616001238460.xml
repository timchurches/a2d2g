  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be recruited from independent clinical trials that involve induced blood stage malaria challenge. As part of these independent clinics trials participants are inoculated with a low dose of malaria which is subsequently closely monitored in the community for 8 to 10 days prior to treatment. Based on the level of malaria detected in these trials participants are then admitted to the trial unit (confinement period) for administration of an anti-malarial agent to treat the induced infection and determine the efficacy of this agent. If participants are recruited into this study they will have an observational PET/MRI scan. The timing of this scan will work in accordance to the malaria inoculation schedule of the independent clinical trial. Participants will receive a whole body PET/MRI scan and dedicated brain MRI within approximately one week prior to inoculation and on one to two days prior to confinement with peak parasitaemia post inoculation. Scans will be performed on the Biograph mMR PET/MRI system after the intravenous infusion of the standard radiotracer 2-(18F) fluor-deoxy-D-glucose(FDG) (18F FDG) and MAGNETOM Prisma 3T MRI system. Collected images will be reviewed and reported by experienced radiologists specialising in MRI and nuclear medicine reporting. Quantification of 18F FDG uptake measurements will be established for intra-individual scans using Patlak model analysis and semi quantitative SUV measurement with reference to an 18F FDG external control </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the study is to assess the application of whole body 18F FDG-PET/MRI in describing the parasite biodistribution and biomass in subpatent malaria. This is a hypothesis pilot investigation expected to have predominately descriptive outcomes. 

Primary Outcome 1: Intra-individual PET tracer uptake changes in regions of interest post malaria inoculation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcome 1 Timepoint: baseline and estimated 7-9 days following low dose malaria inoculation.

Review of the peak parasitaemia data from previous blood stage malaria challenge studies has found that P. falciparum challenge study participants undergo confinement on Day 8 after inoculation, and P. vivax challenge study participants undergo confinement on Day 10 after inoculation. This is related to the size of the inoculum and characteristics of the malaria species itself. As a result, in order to perform the PET/MRI imaging at close to peak parasitaemia, it is expected that this imaging will take place on Day 7 after inoculation for P. falciparum and Day 9 after inoculation for P. vivax. Exact day numbers have not been provided to accommodate for the possibility of biological variability in infection (although this has not occurred historically.)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 1: Intra-individual differences in PET tracer uptake and MRI imaging changes in regions of interest to describe the relative burden of organ specific sequestration

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary Outcome 1 Timepoint: estimated 7-9 days following low dose malaria inoculation.
The intraindividual differences will be derived from comparing pre and post inoculation imaging in participants. That is, imaging before inoculation, and at estimated 7-9 days following low dose malaria inoculation.

</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 2: Inter-individual differences in PET tracer uptake and MRI imaging changes in regions of interest with respect to Plasmodium species challenge and parasite load

</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 3: The impact of early malaria infection on glucose metabolism will be evaluated in assessing each of the above outcomes. 
18F FDG is essentially glucose that can be tracked through the body following administration using PET imaging. Therefore the PET/MRI imaging itself will provide the information about glucose metabolism. Finger prick blood glucose monitoring will be used prior to imaging to determine the baseline blood glucose, and all participants are required to have a normal fasted blood glucose measurement (as per inclusion criteria.)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Functional nuclear medicine imaging techniques such as PET/MRI imaging are commonly used in fields such as oncology to look at the bioactivity and biodistribution of disease. These techniques have previously been applied to infectious diseases, although data is limited. We propose a pilot study to investigate the use of 18F FDG PET/MRI imaging in malaria infection. Participants taking part in malaria challenge studies will be invited to undergo whole body PET/MRI imaging before and after malaria inoculation. </summary>
