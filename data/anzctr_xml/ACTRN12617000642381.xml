    <interventions>BTX1503 5% Solution, applied topically to the face using a supplied swab.
Participants will receive a 1mL dose either once (QD) or twice daily (BD) on Day 1.
Following a washout period, participants will receive a further 14 days of treatment starting on Day 8. Doses will be escalated for each subsequent cohort enrolled with the following doses:
Cohort 1: 1 mL of BTX1503 5% Solution QD
Cohort 2: 1 mL of BTX1503 5% Solution BID (12 hours apart)
Cohort 3: 3 mL of BTX1503 5% Solution QD
Cohort 4: 3 mL of BTX1503 5% Solution BID (12 hours apart)

For participants receiving QD dosing, dosing will occur each day at the clinical site at
the same time (+/-1 hour) in the morning (applied by clinical site staff). Participants receiving BID dosing will be instructed in how to apply study drug when not at the clinical site. For participants receiving BID dosing, the first application of study drug will occur at the study site on Day 8 in the morning and the second application will be self-administered by the participant 12
hours (+/-1 hour) later. Participants will come to the study site for their morning application of study drug and their evening application will be self-administered.

For participants doing a self-administered application of study drug, a diary will be maintained documenting compliance with application of the self-administered application. Each dose of study drug will be applied to the entire face. Participants will be asked to apply the total amount of study drug per application evenly, as best as possible, to cover all the face. In addition, participants will be required to return all used and unused study drug at each visit where the study site will assess compliance.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety of BTX1503 administered as a single dose either once (QD) or twice (BID) on Day 1 followed by a washout period, then starting on Day 8, either once (QD) or twice daily (BID) for 14 days. 

Assessed by: Safety will be assessed through collection of vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and pulse), adverse events, cutaneous tolerability assessments, and laboratory findings (blood counts, chemistry, and urinalysis).  Urine drug tests will be conducted for drugs of abuse, including the presence of tetrahydrocannibidiol (THC).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Adverse events will be monitored from time of consent through the end of study (day 23).  Vital signs will be taken prior to and 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after the first study drug application on Day 1 and prior to study drug application on Days 8, 15, and 21. Blood samples for blood counts and chemistry and urine for urinalysis will be obtained prior to and 12 hours after the first dose application and prior to study drug application on Days 8, 15, and 21. Urine testing for drugs of abuse, including THC, will be conducted prior to and 12 and 24 hours after the morning application on Day 1 and Day 21. Cutaneous tolerability assessments will be done prior to study drug application on Day 1 and Days 8 through 21.  On Days 1, 8, 15 and 21 cutaneous tolerability will also be assessed 1 hour after the morning study drug application.  On Days 1 and 21, additional assessments will be done 12 and 24 hours after the morning application and 48 hours after the morning application on Day 21.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BTX1503 with QD or BID dosing will be established in healthy volunteers.
Assessed by: collecting blood samples for analysis.  PK parameters include  Cmax, Tmax, AUC</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Blood samples will be collected within 15 minutes prior to the initial study drug application and at 30, 60 and 90 minutes and 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours, and 24 hours after the first single dose. For participants receiving BID dosing, samples will also be taken at 30, 60 and 90 minutes and 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the second application on Day 1.
During the multiple dose (14-day) period, trough levels will be obtained before the daily application on Day 15.  On Day 21, blood samples will be taken for PK assessments at pre-application (15 minutes before dosing), 30, 60 and 90 minutes and 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after the first application.  For participants receiving BID dosing, samples will also be taken at 30, 60 and 90 minutes and 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the second application on Day 21.

Healthy volunteers will receive a single dose (QD or BID) of the study drug (BTX1503) on Day 1 followed by a washout period.  If the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not observed after the single dose, participants will begin a 14-day treatment period with BTX1503 and the second dose cohort will begin.  A total of four escalating dose cohorts will be evaluated sequentially.  Up to 24 healthy volunteers (minimum 20; 5 per cohort) will be enrolled. 
Participants will be enrolled sequentially and will be aware of the cohort to which they are being enrolled.  There will be no attempts in this study to blind the dosing that participants will receive.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose
The purpose of this study is to investigate how safe and tolerable single and repeat doses of BTX1503 solution are in healthy volunteers. The study will look at whether the body adsorbs cannabidiol (CBD). by analysing the levels of CBD in blood at various times after drug administration. The application site will also be monitored for reactions and irritation. 
Study participants
Healthy adults, aged between 18 and 65 years, inclusive, will participate.
Experimental Treatment
The study will investigate single and multiple doses of BTX1503 solution applied to the face. The components of BTX1503 have all been used in products that are applied to the skin.  There will be four (4) different treatment cohorts with up to six (6) participants in each cohort.  
Cohort 1: 1 mL of BTX1503 5% Solution will be applied as a single dose in the first part of the study and then, after washout period, a single application will occur each day in the clinic for 14 days during the second part of the study.
Cohort 2: 1 mL of BTX1503 5% Solution will be applied twice on Day 1 (12 hours apart) in the first part of the study and then, after washout period,  twice daily applications will occur (one in the clinic and one self-applied) for 14 days during the second part of the study.
Cohort 3: 3 mL of BTX1503 5% Solution will be applied as a single dose in the first part of the study and then after washout period, a single application will occur each day in the clinic for 14 days during the second part of the study.
Cohort 4: 3 mL of BTX1503 5% Solution will be applied twice on Day 1 (12 hours apart) in the first part of the study and then after washout period twice daily applications will occur (one in the clinic and one self-applied) for 14 days during the second part of the study. 
The study consists of a Screening Visit (up to 14 days before receiving the study treatment), a confinement visit starting on the morning of Day 1 and lasting approximately 24 hours, daily applications at the clinic on Day 8 through Day 20, a second confinement on Day 21 lasting 24 hours and 1 follow up visit on Day 23. 
The maximum study duration for any participant from screening visit to last clinic visit is 37 days. 
Tests and procedures which are conducted at some, or all visits during the study include: a brief review of your body systems, vital signs measured, blood and urine sampling. </summary>
