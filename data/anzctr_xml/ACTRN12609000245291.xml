  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fluid resuscitation is widely used in the management of critically ill patients.  There are a variety of different fluids available to doctors but there is little evidence regarding how effective they are which means that doctors often have little information on which to base their decisions regarding what fluid to choose.  One of the most commonly used fluids in the world, a hydroxyethyl starch was recently approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for use in Australia.  This project aims to compare how effective and safe this fluid is compared to another widely used fluid, saline, for resuscitation of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units.</summary>
