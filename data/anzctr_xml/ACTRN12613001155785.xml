  <interventions>
    <interventions>Movable/recycled materials with no fixed purpose were introduced to a grass field in a brand new Catholic primary school from the end of term 1 to the middle of term 2 (after 7-weeks: post-test) and continued to be introduced until the end of term 2 during Autumn and Winter in 2010. The movable/recycled materials introduced to the playground by the researchers were items generally not considered to be typical play materials for children within schools, with the exception of play balls, hoops and skipping ropes. The materials included milk crates, swimming noodles, buckets, cardboard boxes, tyre tubes, pipes, vacuum/pool hoses, plastic walls and sheets, hessian bags, buckets, water/sand shells, tractor/motorbike and bicycle tyres, swimming boards, exercise mats, buckets and hay bales. 

 All students (5-12-year-olds) had access to the playground simultaneously.  The provision of small pieces of portable sports equipment was made available by the school such as footballs, bats and balls as per usual practice in primary schools. Two teachers were rostered on school playground supervision (yard duty) during school breaks as was usual practice, one teacher was allocated to supervise the grass field and the other to supervise the bitumen car park area. The principal briefed the teachers prior to students commencing the intervention, explaining that the items were to encourage children to create their own play and not to intervene unless childrens safety was at risk.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Control School did not have access to the movable/recycled materials used with the intervention school and consisted of a morning break of 15 minutes and a lunchtime break of 45 minutes. Children had access to sports equipment as is usual practice in many primary schools to use on the hard-surfaced area at the front of the school and on the grass field during break periods. 

Two teachers supervised the playground during lunchtime at all times (one supervisor was allocated to the fixed playground area at the front of the school, the other teacher supervised the grass field and basketball court areas at the bottom of the school).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome variable of the LEAP intervention was physical activity, individually and objectively measured by pedometers in children aged 5-12-years-old. In addition, the System of Observing Play and Leisure Activities in Youth (SOPLAY), an area-level direct observation instrument was used to provide contextual information on the childrens physical activity within the school playground.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This matched controlled trial, the LEAP intervention study, was uniquely tailored to compare the intervention and control schools at baseline (March/April, 2010), post-testing (after 7-weeks; April-June, 2010) and at a follow-up (after 8-months; November, 2010) </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was used to determine childrens general enjoyment of physical activity in children aged 8-12-years-old. The PACES consists of a 16 statement scale starting with the question stem When I am physically active with a 5-point likert scale (1=disagree a lot; 2=disagree; 3=no opinion; 4=agree; 5=agree a lot).  A score was computed by calculating the mean of the 16 items.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Lunchtime Enjoyment of Activity and Play (LEAP) Questionnaire was used to measure enjoyment of school play activities in children aged 8-12-years-old. All enjoyment items were rated on a five-point likert scale (1=very unhappy; 2=unhappy; 3=not sure; 4=happy; 5=very happy). A score was computed by calculating the average of each social-ecological model component.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL 4.0), a 23-item validated questionnaire was used to measure the quality of life in children aged 8-12-years-old. The PedsQL 4.0 instrument measured quality of life in three scales; psychosocial, physical and total quality of life. The questionnaire was scored using a five-point likert scale (0=never; 1=almost never; 2=sometimes; 3=almost always; 4=always), with items then converted to a score out of 100 (0=100; 1=75; 2=50; 3=25; 4=0). A mean score was calculated for the psychosocial and physical quality of life scales. The scales were averaged to obtain a total quality of life score. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The study was based on a matched control trial, comparing the pedometer steps and distance between intervention and control schools at baseline, 7-week post-testing and an 8-month follow-up.  Although there were self-reported outcome measures, the sample size calculation was based on participants steps and distance. For baseline, post-test and follow-up, the steps and distance were measured for intervention and control schools. From a previous pilot study, we hypothesised that the estimated mean difference would be 5 steps/minute (intervention school: 60 steps/minute; control school: 55 steps/minute) or 5 metres distance (intervention school: 40 metres;  control school: 35 metres) with equal standard deviations (SD=15 steps/minute or SD=15 meters) for both schools. A correlation between baseline and follow-up was set to 0.45 from the previous pilot study. The above information was analysed by comparing each child s difference between the mean of post intervention treatment measurements and the mean of baseline measurements, that is, the change method of sampsi command under STATA software. Group sample sizes of 117 children in the intervention school and 117 children in the control school achieved 80% power to detect a difference between the school differences of 5 with equal variation (SD=15). The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.05 (two-sided). The statistical procedure for repeated measurements includes the specified parameters used to estimate the sample sizes or power, the relative efficiency of the design and the adjustment to the standard deviation. Allowing for an attrition rate of 10%, we therefore aimed to recruit 129 children in the intervention school and 129 children in the control school. 

An independent sample t-test and chi-square test were used to determine significant differences between the intervention and control schools for demographic characteristics and baseline objective measurements between the intervention and control schools (p&lt;0.05 was significant).  

A non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test were used to determine the significant difference between ranks of each observation for each self-reported measure between the intervention and control schools (p&lt;0.05 was significant). 

A multilevel mixed effect linear regression model was applied using STATA (version 12.0) using the xtmixed command to fit linear mixed models for pedometer steps and distance per minute, enjoyment of physical activity, enjoyment of lunchtime play activities and quality of life. The model was used to determine the treatment effects (adjusted mean change in the intervention school compared to the control school at each time point) and interaction effects (overall effects on the intervention school compared to the control school for all three time points: pre, post and follow-up). Models will be adjusted for covariates. A chi-square test was used to compare the direct observation proportions in each physical activity intensity and activity type between intervention and control schools.  Missing data for a time point (e.g. missing questionnaire responses) were excluded pairwise from the analyses.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects the LEAP (Lunchtime Enjoyment Activity and Play) school playground intervention had on childrens quality of life, enjoyment and participation in physical activity during school lunch breaks.  This study consisted of a movable/recycled materials intervention underpinned by a social-ecological theoretical framework that included baseline, a seven-week post-test and an eight-month follow-up data collection phase. Children within an intervention school and a matched control school aged 5-to-12-years-old were recruited for the study.
