    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GC4711 Oral Capsule
Other interventions - Placebo oral capsule
Treatment: drugs - IV GC4419
Other interventions - Fasting Condition
Other interventions - Fed Condition
Treatment: drugs - GC4711 Oral Capsule

Active Comparator: Dose Escalation: IV GC4419 + GC4711/Placebo Oral Capsule - Part 1

Experimental: Food Effect Study: IV GC4419 + GC4711 Oral Capsule - Part 2


Treatment: drugs: GC4711 Oral Capsule
Part 1: Planned dose levels of the GC4711 Oral Capsule include 82 mg (1 capsule), 164 mg (2 capsules), 246 mg (3 capsules), 328 mg (4 capsules), and 410 mg (5 capsules).

Other interventions: Placebo oral capsule
Part 1: Placebo Oral Capsule to mimic appearance of active GC4711 Oral Capsule

Treatment: drugs: IV GC4419
GC4419 will be infused IV as a single dose of 27 mg in 247 mL normal saline, totaling 250 mL, over a 60-minute period using a programmable pump.

Other interventions: Fasting Condition
For the fasting condition, GC4711 will be administered following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, with 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. No food will be allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. Water will be allowed as desired except for one hour before and after drug administration.

Other interventions: Fed Condition
Subjects assigned to the fed condition will receive a standard meal per U.S. FDA guidelines consisting of high calorie/high fat meal prior to dosing consisting of total calories of 800-1000 of which 150, 250 and 500-600 calories are from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. Subjects will start the standard meal 30 minutes prior to administration of GC4711, and will be instructed to eat the meal in 30 minutes or less; however, the GC4711 will be administered 30 minutes after the start of the meal, with 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water.

Treatment: drugs: GC4711 Oral Capsule
Part 2: After completion of the single-ascending dose portion of the study, a separate cohort of subjects will receive a single dose of GC4711 (at a dose no higher than previously found to have an acceptable safety profile), under fasted or fed conditions, followed, after a 7-day washout period, of a second single dose of oral GC4711, at the same dose as before, under the opposite condition (fed or fasting)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the phase 1, GTO-003 clinical study is to determine the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of a new drug called GC4711 when given as an oral
      tablet. This study will compare capsules containing a liquid suspension of GC4711 when given
      orally to a similar drug called GC4419 which will be given as an intravenous infusion. This
      study will also assess the effect of food on GC4711.</summary>
