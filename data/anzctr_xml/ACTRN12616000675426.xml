  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1 (Pharmacokinetic sub-study): Patients on haemodialysis (n=5) will receive 500 mg of metformin hydrochloride (oral tablet, immediate release formulation) after each dialysis session (3 dialysis sessions per week, 1500 mg/ week) for 12 weeks.

Arm 2 and 3 ( Extended Pharmacokinetic study and Safety study): Patients on haemodialysis (n=10, n=50) will receive 250 mg of metformin hydrochloride (oral tablet, immediate release formulation) after each dialysis session (3 dialysis sessions per week, 750 mg/ week) for 24 weeks. These two arms differ only in the timings of blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis at each study visit. 

Patients will take their doses within 30 minutes of dialysis ending along with their normal medication. Nursing staff take record of all the doses administered, this is be used to determine compliance.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish the safety of metformin in patients undergoing haemodialysis. 


At each study visit, all patients will have their health status assessed, including any significant changes in their blood results (lactate, biocarbonate and/or anion gap). They will be asked about the occurrence of any severe gastrointestinal events (vomiting and/or diarrhoea) which may indicate lactic acidosis.  If lactic acidosis is suspected (symptoms of lactic acidosis in association with low bicarbonate and high anion gap concentrations), arterial pH will be measured.

In addition, the safety of metformin will also be judged by the plasma concentrations of lactate (upper limit 5 mmol/L) and metformin (upper limit 5 mg/L). For Arms 2 and 3 if plasma lactate or metformin concentrations are above their respective limits, metformin will be either ceased or the dosage reduced, based on the treating clinician's judgment. Should a patients metformin dose require adjustment during the study, the patient will be monitored more closely again, as from the beginning of the protocol.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Arm 1: 12 weeks after the commencement of metformin therapy.

Arm 2 &amp; 3: 24 weeks after the commencement of metformin therapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe the pharmacokinetics of metformin in patients on haemodialysis. 

This will be achieved by collected a number of blood samples for the quantification of metformin. Dialyzer clearance, fraction of dose extracted, Cmax, AUC and time to steady state will be calculated for both plasma and blood.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Arm 1: Serial arterial (blood going into the dialyzer) and venous (blood going out of the dialyzer) samples will be collected throughout the dialysis session at the end of weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12. In addition after the first dose, at the end of week 1 and 8 bloods will be collected at 4, 24 and 42 (pre-dialysis) hours post dose. The serial samples taken throughout the dialysis session will be used to determine the rate and extent of metformin removal through the dialyzer. The samples taken post-dose will be used to determine the stability of metformin concentrations between dialysis sessions.

Arm 2: Arterial and venous samples will be collected at the start and end of dialysis on weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 of metformin therapy. The purpose of this study is to provide more information on the rate and extent of metformin removal through the dialysis machine and determine the time to steady state.  

Arm 3: A single venous sample will be collected at the start of the dialysis session on weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 of metformin therapy.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Lactate concentrations will be analysed using a repeat-meansures ANOVA to determine any trends. A 20% increase in lactate concentrations from baseline will be considered clinically significant. 

To calculate the sample size we took the average plasma lactate concentration to be 1.8 mmol/L with a standard deviation, 0.8 mmol/L (taken from a previous study Duong et al., 2013. Clin Pharmacokinect. 52(5): 373-384). The number of patients required to demonstrate a clinically significant change (20%) from baseline is n= 80 (type 1 error rate - 5%, study power - 0.8). 

Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using standard equations.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The risk of cardiovascular complications is high in diabetic dialysed patients. Metformin has been shown to reduce these complications. However, it is not used in these patients due to the risk (very low) of acidosis.
 
To address this urgent health problem, we aim to investigate the safety of low dose metformin in these patients. 

This study will consist of 3 arms, the pharmacokinetics arm, the extended pharmacokinetics arm and the safety arm. 

In the first arm patients (n=5) will receive 500 mg of metformin after dialysis  for 12 weeks. 

In the second (n=10) and thrid arm (n=50) patients  will receive 250 mg of metformin after dialysis (3 dialysis session per week) for 24 weeks. 

We hypothesis that low dose metformin can be safely given to dialysis patients.
