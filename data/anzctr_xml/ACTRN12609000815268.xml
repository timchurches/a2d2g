  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently, melanoma is the fifth most common cancer diagnosed in men and the seventh most common cancer diagnosed in women.Advanced melanoma has a very poor prognosis.For a vast majority of subjects with malignant melanoma, there are no effective therapies.Therefore, the development of effective therapies for this subject population remains a priority in oncology.In a limited study in melanomas, increased cyclin D1 protein expression, as was observed in 33% cases.P276-00 is a novel potent small molecule flavone derived Cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) Cdk 4-D1, Cdk1-B and Cdk9-T inhibitor.P276-00 demonstrated significant and selective antiproliferative effect against melanoma cell lines.</summary>
