  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will seek two groups of women to parctipate in the research, women using acupuncture and a group not receiving acupuncture. 
The acupuncture group will require women to attend for acupuncture on the day of an embryo transfer (ET).  Two acupuncture treatments will be administered for 25 minutes on the day of ET, immediately before and after ET.  The acupuncture is based on the Paulus protocol and include an initial set of ten acupuncture points, and four auricular points.  

The control group receives standard care only.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is promising evidence that acupuncture improves pregnancy and live birth rates for women when administered as an adjunct to IVF on the day of ET. 

The aim of this study is to build a research framework to further investigate the evidence for acupuncture administered within an integrated care setting in reproductive health care. The integrative care proposal is a partnership between IVF Australia, The Acupuncture IVF Support Clinic and The University of Western Sydney. 

We will conduct early phase research to examine a potential mechanism for acupuncture when administered as an adjunct to IVF.</summary>
