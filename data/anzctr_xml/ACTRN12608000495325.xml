  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Phase 3

This international trial investigates the use of multi-agent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in children with relapsed or resistant lymphoblastic leukaemia, based on early response as measured by minimal residual disease (MRD) levels, in order to improve treatment.  

 

Who is it for?

You can join this study if you are aged 118 years and have been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia which has relapsed or does not respond to first-line treatment.

Trial details

Participants are treated with multi-agent chemotherapy and radiotherapy based on early response as measured by minimal residual disease (MRD) levels.  (These are the low levels of cancer cells that remain in the body after treatment.) Regular sensitive testing is carried out on the bone marrow to measure how quickly the leukaemia is responding to treatment, and this information is used to help determine whether a transplant or more chemotherapy is a better option for each patient. For those children who show a particularly slow response to chemotherapy, extra intensive chemotherapy is used before transplant to try to improve the control of the leukaemia and improve the chance of cure. Any disease progression is monitored.</summary>
