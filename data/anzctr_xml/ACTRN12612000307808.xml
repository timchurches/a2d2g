  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are three arms to this trial. Arm 1: CBT. Arm 2: Emotion Regulaton/CBT. Arm 3: Wait-List. Therapy is administered once-weekly over 10 weeks on an individual 90 minute basis. CBT includes 4 sessions of supportive counsellng, followed by 6 sessions of education about Prolonged Grief, cognitive restructuring of erroneous beliefs about the  loss , and exposure to memories of the death and to avoided situations. Emotion Regulation/CBT involves 4 sessions of learning skills on identifying and managing distress through distraction, mindfulness, and labelling emotions, followed by 6 sessions of of education about Prolonged Grief, cognitive restructuring of erroneous beliefs about the  loss , and exposure to memories of the death and to avoided situations.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 9 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the Wait-List will receive the pretreatment assessment, wait 10 weeks, receive another assessment, and then be randomized to either CBT or Emotion Regulation/CBT.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the study is to evaluate the role of emotion regulation training in enhancing the effectiveness of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in reducing the symptoms of prolonged grief. This study compares the relative effectiveness of (a) Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, (b) Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Combined with Emotion Regulation training, and (c) Wait-list (until posttreatment) in reducing prolonged grief symptoms. It is hypothesised that whereas both CBT and CBT/Emotion Regulation training will lead to more grief symptom reduction than Wait-List at posttreament.  It is also expected that CBT/Emotin Regulation training will lead to more symptom reduction than CBT alone at follow-up.</summary>
