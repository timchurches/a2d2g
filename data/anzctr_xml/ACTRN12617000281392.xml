    <interventions>Following consent from clinicians and patients, melanoma specialists will audio record the interactions during the initial consultation with new patients. Just the initial consultation will be recorded. Patients will be grouped by socioeconomic status, based on their occupation and level of education. 

The recordings will be transcribed and analysed, with the focus on meaning rather than on accent, grammar or vocabulary.  Features such as the phrasing of questions, control of turn-taking, clinicians responses to patient responses, expressions of degrees of probability and obligation (might, must, possibly, definitely, have to, I think ), and the coding of logical relations (such as causality, consequence, conditionality) through conjunctions, abstract nouns and even verbs will also be analysed. These factors influence discussions of treatment outcome and prognosis and may be a frequent source of confusion for patients and families.</interventions>
    <comparator>All patients will be grouped by socioeconomic (SES) status, based on their occupation, marital status, post code and level of education. The grouping will be undertaken after the clinic appointment that is recorded. To form contrasted SES groups, we are using the criterion of relative autonomy in an occupation to make decisions affecting others in the workplace plus level of formal education.  The  relative autonomy criterion has been used successfully in previous linguistic studies of SES-associated variation in the exchange of meanings, e.g. Ruqaiya Hasans research (Hasan, R. Semantic variation (Equinox)) and research by the co-PI, Geoff Williams (Joint book reading and literacy pedagogy: A socio-semantic examination. PhD, Macquarie University, 1995).   Because the degree of autonomy is relative and the range of occupations is enormous we do not use formalised cut-offs but instead attempt to maximise the contrast within the group of consenting patients within a reasonable time frame (approximately two months).  For example, we would include a lawyer but not a law clerk in the higher-SES group, and similarly a shop assistant but not a shop owner in the lower-SES group.  Level of formal education is used to check that there has been no voluntary take-up of an occupation for which a person is over-qualified, such as a person with a law degree working as a council gardener.  Only patients with education up to the end of secondary school are included in the lower-SES group, and only patients with tertiary education (from diploma up) are included in the higher-SES group.Patients will also be grouped within the SES by gender.

Comparative analyses will be performed between upper and lower SES groups and between male and female patients within each SES group.

No validated tools will be used but the analytic framework is derived from systemic functional linguistics (Halliday, 1978; Halliday and Matthiessen, 2013), which is an approach that is widely used internationally for discourse analysis in institutional contexts, including in healthcare contexts such as interaction in accident and emergency departments and during patient handover (Eggins and Slade, 2013; Slade et al., 2008).  It has also been used for research into the type of language variation that is comparable to this project, i.e. variation concerned with the exchange of meaning and associated with speakers social background (e.g. Cloran, 1989; Hasan, 2009; Williams, 2005). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Variation in linguistic communication between clinicians and patients by SES status and gender, Including the phrasing of questions, the control of 'turn taking' and expression of degrees of probability.

Audiorecordings will be checked for audibility, and an initial description of the main phases of the interaction will be produced.  Once it has been established that recordings are audible and comprehensive (i.e. the full clinical session has been recorded), they will be transcribed literally in preparation for linguistic analysis.

Once transcribed, the clinical interaction will be analysed in two ways.  The first involves description of the typical staging of the consultation (stages such as the introduction, taking of the patients history, physical examination, explanations, and so on). This step will enable us to identify any major, systematic variation in the structure of consultations between specialisations, and within specialisations, between the SES and gender sub-groups.  The second involves analysis of relevant features of the language itself (such as the types of questions, the linguistic patterning of medical explanations, and so on.  These will be described using an explicit linguistic methodology, semantic network analysis, which describes features of the language at the clause level through each consultation.   The explicitness of the methodology displaces any need for impressionistic coding, so blinding is not required.

For this project a key advantage of the framework is that the analyses will yield data across multiple domains of meaning such as topic introduction, maintenance and change; construction of clinician and patient agency; strategies for logical development of the information; and interpersonal meanings such as foci of clinician and patient questions, the nature and extent of patient narration, clinicians expressions of empathy and the pacing of interaction.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to analyse the differences in language used by clinicians and melanoma patients of different socioeconomic statuses (SES) and between male and female patients.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to take part in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with melanoma for which you are scheduled to attend your first consultation at one of the study sites.

All participants enrolled in this study will have a single consultation with their clinician (surgeon/oncologist/nurse, etc.) audio recorded. This audio recording will then be analysed for different types of language used, including phrasing of questions, the control of 'turn taking' and expression of degrees of probability. Researchers will then look for patterns between patients of low and high SES, and between males and females.

It is hoped that the findings from this study will provide information on the communication used by clinicians with melanoma patients, and how this communication differs between people with different SES statuses, and between men and women.</summary>
