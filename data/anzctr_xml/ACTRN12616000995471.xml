  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is being conducted to look at the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK, how the human body processes a substance) of a ETX2514 when given to healthy volunteers intravenously as a single dose, and when given as multiple intravenous doses for up to 8 consecutive days.
As it is anticipated that ETX2514 could be used as a treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii (a type of bacteria) infections, this project will also look at whether ETX2514 will interact with the current treatments for these infections when they are administered at the same time.</summary>
