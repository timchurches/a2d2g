  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be individually randomised to an intervention group (exercise and standard care) or a control group (standard care alone) in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer generated randomisation procedure performed by a third party

Intervention arms: exercise and standard care/ standard care alone
Standard care will involve general lifestyle education for prostate cancer and encouragement to be physically active, in accordance with Australias Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines These include written recommendation to participate in 150-300 mins of moderate activity per week and strength training twice per week (available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines)..  Those in the intervention arm will, in addition, be provided with an individualised, home-based functional lower limb-strengthening program.  

This individualised exercise program will be developed at study entry in the department of physiotherapy at Austin Health. This initial visit will take 90 min. Individualised means that exercise will be tailored to each individual. It is difficult to describe this im detail but in principle, the physiotherapist will assess which muscles are the weakest and provide the participant with a written exercise program accordingly, with clear instructions.  

The program will focus on muscles utilised in walking and balance, specifically hip flexors, extensors and abductors, knee extensors and plantarflexors.  Exercises will replicate the way muscles are used during walking, with respect to joint position, type of contraction and speed of movement. For example, hip flexors will be strengthened with the hip in an extended position with an emphasis on a fast concentric contraction.  Simple equipment such as theraband and cuff weights will be used in conjunction with body weight to provide resistance.  Participants will be instructed to perform one to two sets of each exercise, with each set comprising 10  15 repetitions at 50  70% of 1RM (Repetition Maximum). 

This exercise program will be performed twice a week and duration is 30 min. The exercise physiologist will monitor compliance during 5 face to face sessions in the participants place of residence (weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39) and 5 phone sessions (weeks 2, 9, 19, 32). The sessions at home will take 45 min and the phone sessions 10 min per session. The intervention period will be 12 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the effects of a targeted exercise program on muscle function in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 50-80 years with non-localised non-metastatic prostate cancer, and are about to commence androgen deprivation therapy. Study details Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive routine recommendations for healthy lifestyle. Participants in the other group will undertake an exercise program which will be home-based and administered by an exercise physiologist The exercise physiologist will design a program tailored to each participant to strengthen lower limb muscles.. After 12 months all participants will undertake physical testing to evaluate any effects of the exercise program. They will also be asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating quality of life. It is hoped that the exercise program will help to prevent muscle loss, which is a major adverse effect of ADT.</summary>
