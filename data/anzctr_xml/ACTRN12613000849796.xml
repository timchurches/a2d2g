    <interventions>The current study aims to test the effectiveness of a newly developed, technology-assisted, motivational intervention in a sample of consumers with early psychosis (within first 3 episodes and first 3 years) and co-occuring cannabis use. The study objectives are to:

1. Deliver the Functional Imagery Training (FIT) intervention to 20 young adults aged 16-25 years who are experiencing early episode psychosis and using cannabis;
2. Qualitatively explore participants' experiences of the treatment and solicit suggestions for enhancement of the intervention.

Functional Imagery Training (FIT) implements theoretical and empirical advances in our understanding of motivation, and how it is maintained. It retains the spirit and typical elements of motivational interviewing, but employs imagery throughout face-to-face sessions, and uses a smartphone to cue both functional motivations and related behaviours in the natural environment. Personal pictorial libraries are stored on the phone to cue imagery and functional motivations ('What will get better'), plans for risk situations ('What I'll do') and personal achievements ('My successes'). Expected benefits of control focus on proximal, probable and highly valued outcomes - features that maximise impact and are easily imagined. Plans for risky situations include fun activities that are inconsistent with cannabis use, and activities that demand concentration (to reduce craving imagery). Consumers nominate risky times when they want to receive self-generated messages or pictorial icons to help maintain control. Ideas of the personal libraries at the initial session may not match what actually occurs, so consumers add images and short videos to remind them of actual positive changes, effective plans and relevant successes. Daily personal experiences are captured and tagged for use in the libraries. Consumers augment the affective impact of experienced benefits by projecting them into the future and develop alternate imaginal 'TV adds' to keep them fresh. 

The FIT intervention comprises two face-to-face treatment sessions of 1 hour duration, held one week apart. Sessions combine motivational interviewing with use of imagery to identify reasons for cannabis reduction, possible goals and strategies, and build confidence. Imagery involves creation of multisensory mental pictures relating to the goal, reasons for change and success with similar goals in the past. Session 2 concludes with instruction in how their smartphone can be used to assist them to use the intervention techniques in their everyday life. Treatment support phone calls of 10-15 minutes occur in weeks 3, 4, 8 and 12. In view of difficulties with appointment-keeping in this group, after initial sessions, FIT is delivered by phone. Support calls reinforce goal comittment and problem-solve difficulties. 

It is hypothesised that participants will report significantly fewer occcassions of cannabis use in the 3 months following treatment compared to the 3 months before treatment, as well as a reduction in psychotic symptom severity and improvement in overall quality of life.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Significantly fewer occassions of cannabis use in the 3 months following treatment compared to the 3 months before treatment, as measured by a Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB). This is the most widely used calendar-based method for collecting estimates of drug use.  The TLFB uses a calendar and other memory aids (e.g., birthdays, holidays, special events) to gather retrospective estimates of an individual's daily substance use over a specified period of time.    </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline assessment, 13 weeks after baseline.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Significantly lower score on the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). The SDS is a 5-item questionnaire that provides a total score indicating the severity of dependence on a particular substance.  The higher the score, the higher the level of dependence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline assessment, 13 weeks after baseline.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Significantly lower score on the DrugCheck Problem List. The DrugCheck Problem List is a 12-item screening instrument for substance-related comorbidity and impact of substance use on functioning (e.g., physical, psychosocial). The higher the score, the greater the level of dysfunction caused by the substance. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline assessment, 13 weeks after baseline. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduced score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Persons having or suspected of having schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders manifest the disorder in multiple ways. The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucination, and grandiosity. It is particularly useful in gauging the efficacy of treatment in consumers who have moderate to severe psychoses. It is based on the clinician's interview with the consumer and observations of the consumer's behaviour. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline assessment, 13 weeks after baseline.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Higher score on the Assessment of Quality of Life - 8 Dimensions (AQoL-8D). The AQoL-8D consists of 8 separately scored dimensions that assess health-related quality of life. The AQoL-8D provides a global 'utility' score, and the higher the score the greater the quality of life. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline assessment, 13 weeks after baseline.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Higher score on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). The GAF is a numeric scale (0 through 100) used by mental health clinicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational and physiological functioning of adults. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline assessment, 13 weeks after baseline.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Higher score on the Goal Motivation Scale (GMS). The GMS is designed to assess a person's level of motivation towards achieving a particular goal. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline assessment, 4 weeks after baseline.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A lifetime diagnosis of substance use disorder is seen in 40% of Australians with psychosis, and has substantial symptomatic and functional impacts. Both problems have detrimental effects on motivation, hindering treatment gains. A newly developed intervention, Functional Imagery Training (FIT), uses individually tailored imagery (multisensory mental 'pictures') to consolidate motivation, rehearse coping strategies and enhance confidence. Personal smartphones are used to assist in use of imagery and to set reminders, while the OnTrack Get Real Internet program supports self-management of psychotic symptoms. The current study aims to:

1. Examine the effectiveness of FIT with 20 young adults aged 16-25 years who are experiencing early episode psychosis and using cannabis;
2. Qualitatively explore participants' experiences of the treatment and solicit suggestions for enhancement of the intervention.

Participants are recruited from the Early Psychosis Team, Princess Alexandra Hospital. Case managers obtain verbal consent from the consumer to pass on their details to the research team. If the consumer is less than 18 years of age and has a parent/guardian involved in their care, staff also obtain consent from the parent/guardian. The research team contact the consumer to provide more information about the study, and to make an appointment for the baseline assessment.

The baseline assessment lasts up to 60 minutes and includes questions about cannabise use, psychiatric history and symptoms, and quality of life. The FIT intervention commences one week later and comprises two face-to-face treatment sessions of 1 hour duration, held one week apart. Sessions combine motivational interviewing with the use of imagery to identify reasons for cannabis reduction, possible goals and strategies, and to build confidence. Imagery involves creation of multisensory mental pictures relating to the goal, reasons for change and success with similar goals in the past. Session 2 concludes with instruction in how their smartphone can be used to assist them to use the intervention techniques in their everyday life. Treatment support phone calls of 10-15 minutes occur in weeks 3, 4, 8 and 12 after baseline. Support calls reinforce goal committment and problem-solve difficulties. Cannabis use and goal motivation are also assessed in the 4 week call. A follow-up interview of 60 minutes duration occurs 13 weeks post-baseline and assesses cannabis use, psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and experiences of the treatment.

Throughout FIT, participants remain engaged with routine care and are encouraged to use the OnTrack Get Real Internet program for assistance with their psychiatric symptoms.</summary>
