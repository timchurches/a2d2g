  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether calcium supplements acutely influence blood pressure and blood coagulation. This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Participants will be 40 healthy postmenopausal women. Participants will attend two visits at our research clinic where they will receive 1 g of calcium as citrate or a placebo containing no calcium. Visits will be separated by at least 6 days. Blood will be sampled and blood pressure measured prior to, and 2, 4 and 6 hours after each intervention is ingested. Blood coagulation will be measured at each time-point by thromboelastography. </summary>
