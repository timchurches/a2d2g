  <interventions>
    <interventions>- Stage 1: ketamine 1mg/kg single dose, open label. Patients who show a response to ketamine in Stage 1 are eligible to enter Stage 2.
- Stage 2: ketamine 1mg/kg multiple doses repeated at approximately weekly intervals, open label. Patients may continue to receive ketamine as long as beneficial effects on mood persist
- After completion of Stage 1, enrollment in Stage 3 will commence. Patients who have participated in Stages 1/2 are not eligible to enter Stage 3.
- Stage 3: patients will be randomized to one of 3 ketamine dose arms (0.1mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg IM), single dose, double blind</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).  Analysis will be on mean MADRS scores at each time point; change from baseline in MADRS; proportion of subjects showing response (&gt;50% reduction at each timepoint) and remission (MADRS &lt;7) at each timepoint). Relapse post-injection is a MADRS score &gt;20.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 1, 2, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 168h post  injection</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low dose ketamine has been shown to produce rapid (within hours) improvements in mood in patients with major depression. We plan to test ketamine in depressed patients with advanced cancer, for whom rapid improvement in mood may be particularly important in the context of limited life expectancy. The study has 3 stages: Stage 1: showing that ketamine improves mood; Stage 2: showing this effect can be maintained after repeated (weekly) dosing); and Stage 3: exploring the relationship between dose and improvement in mood.</summary>
