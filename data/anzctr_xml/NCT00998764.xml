    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Base Study Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assesment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog/11) at Weeks 13, 26, 39, 52 and 78 - The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4)constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8 remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension.This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced. The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Base Study Baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) Score at Weeks 13, 26, 39, 52 and 78. - The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in AD participants. The DAD is administered to the participant's caregiver in the form of an interview. The performance of basic activities of daily living is evaluated in 10 aspects including hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. The caregiver answers 40 questions as yes, no, or not applicable. A one-point score was assigned to each question if the answer is "yes" and a zero score was assigned if the answer is "no". For questions answered as "not applicable", no score will be assigned. The DAD total score was calculated as the total number of questions answered as "yes" divided by the total number of questions answered as "yes" or "no", times 100. The DAD score can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function. A positive change indicates improvement from baseline.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Base Study Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score at Weeks 26, 52 and 78. - NPI:12-domain caregiver assessment of behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/ aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/ indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, appetite/eating, nighttime behavior. Severity(1=Mild to 3=Severe),frequency (1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) scales recorded for each domain; frequency*severity=each domain score(range 0-12).
