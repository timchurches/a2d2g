    <interventions>The overall objective of this project is to complete a Type 2 translation research trial to demonstrate the long-term population-level health, social and economic benefits of a community delivered adolescent alcohol use prevention intervention. 

The current study will build and extend the 2010-2014 trial (see Rowland, 2012 ACTRN12612000384853). The previous trial used a repeat cross-sectional parallel group clustered RCT. The current study will extend this intervention by offering the intervention communities assistance through the remaining 5 Phases of the Communities That
Care process:

I. Getting started; Communities get ready to introduce CTC.  This involves assessing community readiness to implement a public health prevention framework, linking with champions to auspice the process
 
II. Getting organised; Communities form a new coalition or work with an existing coalition to develop a governance structure, comprising of Key Leaders and a Community Board, representing all stakeholders in the community.

III. Developing a profile: The community conducts an assessment of longitudinal risk and protective factors, together with health and behaviour outcomes, using the CTC youth survey.  An assessment of community resources, services and programs is also undertaken to identify gaps and strengths.

IV. creating a plan; The Community Board creates a plan for prevention work in their community.  he Community Board creates a plan for prevention work in their community.  The Board: (a) prioritises behaviours it wants to reduce and risk and protective factors it will target to help bring about the behaviour change; (b) develops an action plan that documents tested and effective programs and policies to be implemented for the targeted risk and protective factors; 
 
V. implementation and evaluation. Communities implement, monitor and evaluate the selected programs and policies in their action plan, assisted by the research team.

For the intervention communities for each phase, standardized training sessions on how to implement and progress through the phases will be delivered..  A dedicated community relations officer (CRO) trained in the CTC process will be appointed to work with each  community.  This person will offer technical assistance and offer support through regular phone calls and emails. Coordinators will be appointed in each of the communities to work under the CRO facilitation to implement the local CTC effort.  This appointment will be recommended at a minimum of 0.6 of a full-time position.  Training for the coordinator and his/her line manager will be provided prior to the person commencing his/her role.  A minimum of fortnightly contact will be maintained by the CRO with the coordinator.

Depending on the speed in which communities work through the CTC phases, and the ease in which ethics is approved in the relevant school jurisdictions, and thus when the subsequent collection of survey data can occur, we expect communities to have completed phase 3 and .first wave of longitudinal data collection during 2016/2017.  The delivery of the intervention components will occur during 2018/2019.  Intervention components will be delivered throughout the year. Wave 2 of data collection will occur after the intervention is delivered (2018/2019).  Wave 3 data collection will occur, before the funding period has ended (2020).

The intervention will be delivered to either with a cohort of of two year levels; either  a cohort of year 8 and year 10 students, or a cohort of year 9 and year 11 students.  The cohort years will depend on when schools can be engaged to do the baseline survey, and thus fitting into the timeline of the funded study, which should be completed in 2020.  We will ensure that for one year level in the last wave of data is post year 12 (i.e year post secondary school level).   Thus, the last wave of data will comprise of participants from year 11 and 1 year post-secondary school.

The intervention will have multiple components, and all components will be delivered by the community. 

Strategies/components will be selected by each community from the Communities That Care Prevention Strategies guide (attached to the ANZCTR record), including but not limited to, reducing the supply of alcohol , social marketing/community mobilisaton, and audit and implementation of evidence-based resiliency programs..

Supply monitoring  see page 36-40 of Communities That Care Prevention Strategies Guide. This activity will be coordinated and delivered by the local community, with support of the research team. The research team will delivery training to the community as to how to deliver this intervention component..   

Social marketing to reduce adolescent demand and parent supply of alcohol:   see page 41-42 of Communities That Care Prevention Strategies Guide. Brochures designed based on behaviour change theory  targeting students  and their parents.  One brochure is designed for students, another for parents.  The purpose of this component is to promote three key messages: 
1.	Based on Australias National Health and Medical Research Councils (NHMRC) alcohol guidelines for children adolescents should avoid drinking alcohol before the age of 18 years.  
2.	Based on secondary supply legislation and liquor sales laws), adults are breaking the law if they supply alcohol to a person under 18 years.
3.	Parents should set a rule that their children will not be permitted to drink before 18.

Children's brochures will be delivered to children via a minimum of 2  school lessons; lessons have been developed with teachers and are designed to be integrated into the health curriculum, Teachers will be provided with a manual for the lessons and how to use brochures.. Brochures will also be sent home to parents.   Before the 2nd lesson children will be encouraged to discuss with parents content of brochures, in particular parent's setting a rule, 

Resiliency curricula  An audit of school resiliency curricula (including social and emotional health curricula) within all participating schools involved in the trial will be undertaken via a School Administrator Survey, by the research team.  The aim of the audit is to identify the alignment of school social and emotional health and drug education curricula with evidence-based practice  During Phase 3 of the CTC process, results from the school audit will form the basis of technical assistance recommendations to the intervention communities for strengthening school-based resiliency and drug education training.  Communities would be encouraged to implement these recommendations during Phase 5 of the CTC process. 

Implementers will attend training on implementation fidelity. Fidelity will be monitored with checklists, observations, quality delivery, participant involvement, and reach. Fidelity data will be sent to the research team.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Students participating in the longitudinal part of the study will be surveyed on three occasions between 2016-2020, these students will be sampled from both the intervention and control communities.

Main and secondary outcome analysis will be based on all randomised participants (intention-to-treat analysis). Generalised linear model with binary outcome and logit link will be initially conducted to allow for covariates and testing of attrition bias. We will implement a repeated measures split-plot in time design through logistic regression. Model parameters will be estimated using generalised estimating equations (GEEs) accounting for correlation within participants with an exchangeable working correlation matrix.

To assess the impact of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes, time by treatment interactions will be examined in a model that included the fixed categorical effects of assessment time, group indicator and treatment by group interaction. To evaluate any potential trend effect due to a staggered  rollout of intervention additional models with a fix effect categorical factor for year of treatment implementation will be implemented. 

Clustering effect of schools and communities will be evaluated by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients and if necessary a series of model adjusting for clustering effect as a fix factor will be reported.
 
Using structural equation models, analysis of the effects intervention processes on multiple outcomes (e.g. alcohol and drug use; violence; school completion) are mediated by changes in patterns of adolescent alcohol use, after adjusting for other risk factors, will be undertaken.  


Sample size calculations:
Cross-sectional sample:
We will be working with 2 schools in each of the 14 intervention communities.  Cross-sectional surveys will done with these communities/schools to inform their community profile (phase 3 of the CTC process).  Cross-sectional surveys will be done with year two year levels in each intervention community.   Another cross-sectional survey will occur after at Phase 5 of the CTC process with the same year levels.  Over the life of the project, intervention communities will do 2 cross-sectional surveys.
	
An average class size in most schools is about 25 students, and most schools have about 2-3 classes per year level (i.e. between 50-75 students per year level).  Thus, for the cross-sectional survey we will survey approximately 65 year students per year levels in each of the 2 schools where interventions are being delivered. Approximately 3640 students will participate in the cross-sectional surveys. 
	
Longitudinal sample:
We will approach 5,400 parents for informed consent anticipating recruiting 3,500 Year 8 and 10 students in 2016 into the longitudinal survey (n=1750 intervention and n=1750 control). 

We will assume an 80% retention rate, thus we will have a total of 2,800 students.  Based on power calculations, the longitudinal sample size of 2,800 is sufficient to complete each of the planned analyses. We calculated the required sample with power 0.8, probability 0.05 and a design effect based on classroom clustering of 0.05. Recent Australian secondary school survey data (White &amp; Bariola, 2012) indicate rates of alcohol use in the past month were 22% in Year 8 (average age 14) and 48% in Year 10 (age 16) (combined average 35%). With a sample of 2,800 and the above assumptions we can measure the hypothesised 15% reduction in monthly alcohol in the intervention group across the two year level cohorts.
	
The total expected number participants is 7140. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preventing alcohol misuse was listed amongst the top three Australian preventative health priorities in a national review. Despite evidence that community rates of alcohol related harm are rising, to date, the evidence-based recommendations for the federal government to implement price controls and for state government regulatory controls have not been implemented.
In this context, it is important to investigate whether there are feasible and effective intervention alternatives to reduce alcohol-related harm. Evidence from other developed countries and preliminary work in Australia (Rowland et al, 2012) suggests that evidence-based strategies that are coordinated and delivered by communities can be feasible and effective for implementation in Australia. However, in order to be supported for wider dissemination these community delivered alcohol-related harm prevention strategies require comprehensive evaluations of longer-term outcomes and economic benefits.
Our team is the major Australian research group working to develop and evaluate effective community delivered strategies that can reduce adolescent alcohol use. In recent years, with support from Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage funding (ACTRN 12612000384853), we have mounted a randomised community trial that utilised evidence-based supply and demand reduction strategies that have reduced population rates of early adolescent (age 13/14) alcohol use by 26%. Although our 2010-14 trial reveals community intervention is feasible, and our trial has reduced population rates of early adolescent alcohol use, in order for the intervention approach we are using to be recommended in evidence-based health economic reviews , longer-term follow-up and economic evaluation are required.
The current proposal is a Type 2 translation research trial that the Society for Prevention Research have recently advocated for priority research funding  to increase understanding as to how evidence-based interventions can be sustained and expanded into large scale implementations that demonstrate population impacts.
