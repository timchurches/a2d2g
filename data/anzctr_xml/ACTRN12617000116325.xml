  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised into two possible strategies of screening: Advanced imaging vs conventional imaging. 

Advanced cardiac imaging will involve inclusion of global longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction evaluation. The test will be performed by a qualified clinician (usually a sonographer), and the procedure will take about 30 minutes.

Individuals in either imaging group who are identified as having Stage B heart failure will be treated with spironolactone as an oral tablet (25mg) daily for 12 months.

Adherence to spironolactone will be monitored by tablet count from empty drug packet return.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At risk subjects will be identified by cardiologists, study nurses, general practitioners, or self-referred. We plan to compare 400 subjects with strain vs 400 controls. 

Clinical evaluation: All subjects will undertake a clinical history and answer questionnaires on general health status (EQ5D), activity (DASI), heart failure symptoms (MLHFQ) and performed a 6 minute walk test. All will undergo a screening echo for valvular disease. If these results are abnormal, subjects will be excluded.

Study protocol: A central (web-based) randomization program will be used to allocate patients to advanced vs conventional imaging only after the patient is enrolled. This allocation concealment will prevent the person performing recruitment from knowing the allocated group at the time of inclusion. Subsequent management decisions are not based on randomization and will occur as a "usual care' response to data provided from imaging.

Patients will be randomized to two possible strategies of screening: advanced imaging vs conventional imaging.
1)	Conventional imaging- Limited to evaluation of EF and valve disease. 
2)	Advanced cardiac imaging- Inclusion of global longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction evaluation. Presence of a global strain &lt;16% or raised filling pressure at diastolic function evaluation will provoke initiation of treatment

    <statisticalmethods>1)	Primary outcome- The 800 recruited subjects will be randomized into 400 studies with advanced echo and 400 with standard echo. Assuming subclinical cardiac dysfunction in 60%, we would expect 240 patients with myocardial dysfunction identified by imaging in each arm, This group will only be identifiable (and therefore treated) in the advanced echo arm. With an annualized event rate of 12% in patients with subclinical dysfunction (5% in those without), and an average follow-up of 4 years, we expect events in 40% and 15% in control and treatment groups, respectively. A comparison of 206 patients would provide an 80% power to identify the difference in the incident of HF a p&lt;0.05. To allow for 15% loss to follow-up, we will study 240/group.

2)	Secondary outcome- functional capacity: Assuming a similar 6-minute walk to previous work in patients with a similar risk profile to be 525+/-113m, so a 5% change could be identified with 297 patients per group at a power of 80%, at a p&lt;0.05.

Both calculations were performed using statistics software SPSS Sample Power 2.0, using respectively survival and t-test modules.
The initial step will be a standard questionnaire for all subjects, to identify and exclude persons who have some problem (identified or otherwise) that makes them ineligible. We will also use the same equipment to screen for impaired EF (&lt;40%) or moderate or worse valve disease.

Outcomes of patients will be compared with survival analysis (heart failure) and t-test (change in 6-minute walk test). Multivariable models (respectively Cox regression and linear) will be developed to identify effect size, and will be extremely important if groups are mismatched despite randomization. All analyses will be performed on an intention to treat basis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart failure (HF) is a problem that is assuming epidemic proportions, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, its clinical diagnosis is associated with late-stage disease, which has a poor prognosis and responds poorly to medical therapy. At present, there is no effective strategy for identifying and preventing HF, with the result that patients present late in the course of the disease where hospitalisation is inevitable and treatment responses are poor.

The Vic-ELF study (Victorian Study of Echocardiographic detection of Left ventricular dysfunction) study is a randomised trial to explore the benefits of screening selected patients at risk of developing heart failure. We will do this with a special new imaging technique (strain imaging), in which we at Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute have special expertise. Screening of "at risk" patients with a combination of clinical scores and echo imaging is able to identify patients who are liable to develop HF. 
The question that now needs to be answered is whether surveillance with GLS could change HF outcomes in at risk patients. We anticipate that the prompt initiation of therapy in these patients that are recognized to have the earliest phase of HF will result in improvement in their functional capacity, and arrest in the subsequent progression to HF.
