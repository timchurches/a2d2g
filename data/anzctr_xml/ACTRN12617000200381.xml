    <interventions>intervention - rigid flat soled post operative shoe

- The intervention group receive a rigid flat soled shoe. This is a stable device enabling near normal gait at the cost of putting pressure through the operated first ray. Patients will be given an information leaflet summarising the risks and benefits of a rigid flat post operative shoe when compared to the control which allows offloading of the operated forefoot and the expense of stability when mobilising. 


- The only difference between groups will be the type of shoe they are given. All other operative techniques and post operative instructions will be standardised between groups. The shoe will be fitted in theatre by a trained member of the surgical team (specialist nurse or subspecialist foot and ankle fellow) and the patient will be mobilised on the ward by a trained physiotherapist and discharged when safely walking with the aid of two crutches.

The patient information leaflet will include contact details of a member of the research team that they can contact if they have any queries or concerns. 

The shoe will be kept in place for 6 weeks and the only non standard post operative request will be for the patient to complete a patient reported outcome booklet containing the primary outcome measure and a secondary satisfaction measure.

At one year all patients will be requested to complete a final radiograph which is not part of standard post operative care to assess for final radiographic outcome

    <comparator>control- Reverse camber post operative shoe

The reverse camber shoe is a forefoot offloading device which is currently the gold standard after forefoot surgery. This type of shoe has been shown to reduce forefoot pressure when mobilising therefore protecting the operative procedures whilst allowing mobilisation. However, there is no clinical evidence as to whether forefoot offloading is required after first ray surgery and the reverse camber shoe used as a control has issues such as abnormal gait patterns and instability leading to falls risks.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint is a 100 point visual analogue score for pain. Previous studies have shown that the minimal clinical important difference in a (VAS) pain is around 20 points. To be certain there was no significant difference in pain between the groups we designed the study to detect a treatment effect of 10 points. Using mean pain relief and standard deviations from a recent study of first ray surgery we designed the study with 80% power at the 5% significance level. which required data from 84 patients. To allow for 10% loss to follow up we aim to recruit 100 patients. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess whether in patients who have surgery of the first ray, a flat rigid soled shoe, when compared to a reverse camber offloading shoe is associated with the level of post operative pain, satisfaction and bony healing. (union and maintenance of correction.)</summary>
