  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this study is to measure glucose levels in persons currently being treated for type 1 or 2 diabetes. 
Each participant will be required to donate 1 venous whole blood sample additional to their routine treatment and two capillary finger stick samples which are not performed as a part of their normal treatment. 
Venous and capillary blood samples will be tested directly on a self monitoring blood glucose system as well as a reference method. 
Results from the self monitoring blood glucose system will be analysed in comparison to the reference method.
No clinical decision will be made from data generated using the investigational device.
Participants will be recruited over 10 days.</interventions>
