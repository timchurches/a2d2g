Treatment: drugs: insulin aspart
Subjects were dosed according to individual requirements. Injected subcutaneously (s.c. under the skin) twice daily before meals for 10 weeks after an initial 6-week titration in treatment period 1 followed by 10 weeks after an initial 6-week titration in treatment period 2

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Europe and Oceania. The aim of this trial is to
      investigate whether insulin detemir combined with insulin aspart compared to NPH insulin
      combined with insulin aspart could reduce the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes whilst
      maintaining the same degree of glycaemic control subjects with type 1 diabetes.</summary>
