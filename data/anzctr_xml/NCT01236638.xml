Patients will continue receiving the same doses as assigned during the CCL09101 protocol; up to 400 mg once per day (QD). CYT387 will be administered orally as a single daily dose (at least 20 and no more than 28 hours apart, preferably in a fasted state at least two hours before and one hour after a meal), except for patients on the twice daily (BID) dosing regime (150 mg BID).

    <summary>This extension protocol to the core study CCL09101 allows patients who have tolerated the
      drug and derived a clinical benefit, to continue to receive treatment beyond the 9 cycles of
      the core protocol. Long term safety and efficacy of CYT387 will be evaluated.</summary>
