  <interventions>
    <interventions>A two year observational study of open label treatment with alemtuzumab for multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of the study is to develop efficient information-technology (IT) based methods for the monthly monitoring required by the risk management protocols after treatment with alemtuzumab. The effectiveness of alemtuzumab in MS has already been demonstrated in randomised trials and is not the subject of this study. 

Normally after treatment of MS with alemtuzumab patients are required to have ongoing monthly pathology monitoring. The study is to test the successful development of an electronic semi-automated monitoring of pathology results. There is no additional involvement for participants other than the normal monthly pathology testing per alemtuzumab treatment protocol.</interventions>

    <summary>Executive Summary

Alemtuzumab is a highly effective treatment for multiple sclerosis which has been demonstrated by three major clinical trials. However there are significant safety concerns arising from both the nature of the treatment and the results of the clinical trials. 

The principal risk is the late development of other treatable autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia. It is likely that by monitoring treated patients with regular blood tests, including monthly platelet counts, patients who develop such autoimmune diseases can be identified and potentially treated in some cases before catastrophic clinical sequelae occur. The risk of treatment with alemtuzumab will be thereby mitigated. However current real world (off-trial) clinical systems for ensuring patients actually get monthly blood tests and that the results are checked for early deviations from the norm are not adequate. This study proposes the development of a semi-automated Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) using international IT pathology standards that checks for the presence of results, analyses the results and determines the need for automated or human alerts as required.

Another risk is that associated with the immunosuppression and the attendant increase in infections and to a lesser extent certain malignancies. Fortunately in the trials this has not been a major problem other than herpes simplex virus which required a trial amendment for prophylaxis. However the trials did not include patients with prior immunosuppressive MS treatment which will occur in the real world. This study proposes the qualitative comparison of a specific patient education module and a standardized risk assessment module extended safety screening system to the procedures used in the CAMMS protocol. 

The aim of this study is to develop systems that help mitigate the risk associated with use of alemtuzumab and thereby improve the relationship between benefit and risk from this medication. It is proposed that this study be commenced and the systems developed now as the study anticipates potential regulatory concerns and the systems proposed may help in addressing regulatory concerns and in mitigating post regulatory approval risks of treatment.
