  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a life-long incurable disease with remissions and exacerbations.
      Inflammation confined to the rectum occurs in a quarter of patients and can be extremely hard
      to treat. Many medications have been tried in order to control the inflammation, but they do
      not always work. One of the newer medications is the immunosuppressing medication, tacrolimus
      that has been shown to be effective in UC when taken orally. Unfortunately, the oral use of
      this medication can have numerous serious side effects. In order to overcome these side
      effects, the use of topical rectal tacrolimus has been examined. Pilot studies in ulcerative
      proctitis (inflammation confined to the rectum) resistant to conventional therapies have
      demonstrated a clinical remission in 75% of patients and although the medication was well
      absorbed through the lining of the bowel, the levels in the blood were very low and no
      serious side effects were reported. The findings suggest that this preparation is indeed
      effective for inflammation in the distal bowel and that the method of administration reduces
      side effects. Further work, however, now needs to be undertaken to validate the original
      findings.</summary>
