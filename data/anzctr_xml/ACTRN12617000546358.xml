  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will come to the Human Nutrition Unit (University of Auckland) fasted. This study is of a cross-over design and thus participants will need to come on two separate occasions within a 6-day period.
Day 1 (Human Nutrition Unit): Participants will be given breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Blood glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids will taken after each meal at set time points (up to 180 mins). [Intervention Arm 1]
Day 2 (home): Participants are given breakfast, lunch and dinner to eat at home (same meals as day before). Participants will be monitored via a continuous glucose monitoring system
Day 3: wash-out
Day 4: wash-out
Day 5 (Human Nutrition Unit): Participants will not be given breakfast, but lunch and dinner. Blood glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids will taken after each meal at set time points (up to 180 mins). [Intervention Arm 2]
Day 6 (home): Participants are given breakfast, lunch and dinner to eat at home. Participants will be monitored via a continuous glucose monitoring system

Order of treatment will be determined by randomisation. Each clinic day will be approximately 10 hours. Each participant will wear the continuous glucose monitor for the entire 6-day period.

Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be given at 0845h, 1245h, 1745h; respectively at HNU. Participants will be asked to consume meals at the same time when they are at work/home. 
All meals will be 3MJ, ~55% carbohydrate, ~25% fat, ~15% protein, ~3-5% fibre.

Intervention adherence will be assessed via the CGMS. A log will be provided with the CGMS, to record calibration measurements, food intake, medications, and activity. If outliers are present in the CGMS data (due to poor compliance), the participant may be asked to repeat the intervention.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis: Prolonging the overnight fast (i.e. missing the breakfast meal) has negative effects on blood sugars throughout the day
The two intervention arms  are:
1.	Normal fasting period (i.e. breakfast, lunch and dinner provided)
2.	Prolonged fasting period (i.e. breakfast omitted, only lunch and dinner provided)
Both intervention arms comprise 2 days:
 Day 1: The participant arrives fasted. A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is fitted, and an indwelling venous cannula inserted into the forearm. Blood samples are collected at baseline, and throughout a 3h period following each meal. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be given at 0845h, 1245h, 1745h; respectively at HNU. At the end of Day 1 the participant returns home with the CGM in situ.
Day 2: Participants consume a standardised breakfast, lunch and dinner at home, and blood glucose is assessed by CGM.
Day 3-4: Wash-out period
Day 5: The participant arrives fasted. A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is fitted, and an indwelling venous cannula inserted into the forearm. Blood samples are collected at baseline, and throughout a 3h period following each meal. No breakfast will be given; but lunch, and dinner will be given at 1245h, 1745h; respectively at HNU. At the end of Day 5, the participant returns home with the CGM in situ.
Day 6: Participants consume a standardised breakfast, lunch and dinner at home, and blood glucose is assessed by CGM.
The CGM remains in situ and is removed at the end of the 6 day study</summary>
