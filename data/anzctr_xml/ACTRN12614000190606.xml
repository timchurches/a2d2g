  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prehabilitation consists of at least 4 (and maximum 8) physiotherapy sessions prior to TKJR surgery. The prehabilitation sessions consist of exercises aimed at increasing strength and range of motion about the knee. Education regarding the processes and expectations following a TKJR are discussed and participants practice using pick up frames and crutches to increase familiarity with methods of mobilising post surgery. The sessions are aimed at improving overall fitness, mobility, strength and confidence leading into having TKJR surgery. 

Prehabilitation will aim to be 2 sessions per week for 4 weeks prior to surgery, with each session lasting 30-45 minutes (depending on progress in each session).</interventions>

In order to detect a difference of 0.5 days, with a SD of 3 days, 46 participants are needed per group to detect a difference with 95% confidence and 80% power. To allow for drop outs this number has been rounded up to 100.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A Total Knee Replacement (TKJR) is a common treatment for advanced osteoarthritis of the knee. Osteoarthritis is the wearing of the joint surfaces in the knee, over time becoming painful and severely limiting a persons mobility. In a TKJR, worn joint surfaces of the knee are replaced with synthetic components, removing the source of pain and allowing a person to return to higher levels of function.  However, the nature of the surgery means rehabilitation is required to allow the person to return to previous levels of activity.
A TKJR is an elective procedure with a long wait list in the public hospital system. Individuals with private health insurance can avoid a long wait for surgery and have the procedure conducted in a private hospital, with insurance covering the majority of the costs for surgery. Private health insurance also commonly covers some of the costs associated with physiotherapy treatment and rehabilitation. 
Prehabilitation is the practice of exercising prior to a procedure to increase the strength and function of the body in order to speed up recovery after surgery. In the case of a TKJR, prehabilitation equates to increasing knee joint flexion, increasing strength in the muscles around the knee and improving general cardiovascular fitness. The ultimate aim of prehabilitation is to speed the recovery after surgery through the strengthening of major muscles groups beforehand. 
It is current practice at St Vincent's Private, Kew, that patients undergoing a TKJR are given the option to undertake prehabilitation or not. This research aims to determine whether prehabilitation in a private hospital setting improves short -term outcomes after TKJR.
