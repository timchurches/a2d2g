  <interventions>
    <interventions>A)	Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) is considered a form of Chinese exercise that has been described as enabling gains in fitness, strength, reducing pain and stress, improved cardiorespiratory function, postural balance and reduce the risk of falls in elderly. Taking into consideration the safety of players, based on the methodology of TCC Yang Style 24 movement, adapted for the elderly, mild, with simple exercises, short choreographies and with little change in direction.
B)	The practice of TCC Yang Style was performed 24 movements with a frequency of twice a week, at the same time, lessons lasting 50 minutes for 12 weeks.
C)	The TCC Yang Style was practiced by 34 elderly (all the subjects), administered by physical educator</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: To evaluate the static postural balance in community-dwelling elderly women with low bone mass before and after 12 weeks of training Tai Chi Chuan training. 
Methodology: This is an experimental research involving a convenience sample. The study group consisted of 34 elderly women randomly selected from the database of a health clinic in the city of Sao Sebastiao - DF, 20 of them participated in Tai Chi Chuan classes and 14 did not. Tai Chi Chuan training was performed in Yang Style with 24 movements. Classes were held twice a week, for 12 weeks, at the same time of the day and lasted 50 minutes. Data concerning body balance were collected using four instruments: Berg Balance Scale questionnaire (EEB), "Timed Up and Go" (TUG), Functional Reach test (TAF) and the force platform (PLAT ) AccuSway Plus brand AMTI.
Results: Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann Whitney test for differences between groups and Wilcoxon test for intra-group differences and the significance level was p less than or equal to 0.05. TCC group significantly improved balance in EEB, TUG and in the variables of the PLAT: movement of the center of pressure in y axis (COPy) and 95% of ellipse area (Area95), provided with eyes closed in PLAT. No difference was observed in the TCC group concerning TAF and PLAT variables. The control group showed no significant differences in the tests. Conclusion: TCC can improve balance in independent older women with low bone mass.</summary>
