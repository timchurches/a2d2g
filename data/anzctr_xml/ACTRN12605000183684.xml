    <interventions>This project evaluates whether correspondence programs for depression, that focus on working with general practitioners to maintain physical or mental health, result in adoption of healthier lifestyles and consequently reduce the risk of relapse. Participants are assigned to one of two treatment conditions. The depression prevention condition involves monitoring triggers and early warning signs, increasing pleasurable events, planning for relapse prevention and building social support. The physical health condition involves increasing physical activitiy, addressing smoking and improving diet and oral health. In each condition participants receive four fortnightly and three monthly letters describing the program elements and how to apply them. After six months, participants switch conditions and receive the alternate treatment program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Everyone receives both treatment streams, but half will start with one type then swtich to the other at six months.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is change in depression symptoms. This will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II and mood monitoring forms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The forms will be administered prior to commencement of treatment, throughout the treatment and six and 12 months after the completion of the two treatment programs.</timepoint>

      <outcome>There are numerous key secondary outcomes being measured. These include but are not limited to frequency of trigger and early warning sign monitoring, engagement in pleasurable activities, number and access of social supports, amount of physical activity per week, and changes in diet and oral health practices. </outcome>
