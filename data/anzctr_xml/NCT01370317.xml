    <exclusivecriteria>-  Demonstrate a decrease in absolute forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of &gt;20%

          -  Experience a decrease in AM or PM peak expiratory flow (PEF) below the Stability Limit

             inhaler (MDI) or &gt;2 nebulized treatments per day of 2.5 mg albuterol, on any 2
             consecutive days from the Screening Visit up to the Baseline Visit

          -  Experience an exacerbation defined as a clinical deterioration of asthma, as judged by
             the clinical investigator, that results in emergency treatment, hospitalization due to
             asthma, or treatment with additional, excluded medication (other than short-acting
             beta agonists [SABA]) at any time from the Screening Visit up to the Baseline Visit
