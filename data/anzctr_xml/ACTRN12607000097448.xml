    <interventions>Androgen deprivation: artificial drugs create a depression in the production of sex hormones.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prostate cancer-specific mortality.  

Prostate cancer specific mortality will be assessed by estimation of cumulative incidence (1). After ensuring that the hazards of prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM) are proportional for each trial arm, the primary analysis comparing short (6 months) and intermediate (18 months) androgen deprivation with respect to PCSM will be performed using the method of Fine and Gray (cumulative incidence competing hazards estimation), adjusting for presenting PSA level (&lt; 10, 10 - 20, &gt; 20), Gleason score (2 - 6, 7, 8 - 10) and stage (T2, 3 - 4). If the hazard rates are not proportional then the primary analysis will be performed by comparing the cumulative incidence rates at fixed time points, namely five and ten years. These comparisons will be performed adjusting for presenting PSA level, Gleason score and stage as before. Within each stratum, the 5-year and 10-year cumulative incidences of PCSM estimates and their standard errors will be determined over the 12 strata calculated and tested for significance.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	Cumulative incidence of PSA progression

PSA is measured at each follow-up and is measured more frequently on progression.  Cumulative incidence of PSA progression will be compared between treatment arms using the method of Fine and Gray (1), adjusting for PSA level, Gleason score and stage.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2.	Cumulative incidence of local, distant and bony progression and associated patterns of clinical progression

The effect of androgen deprivation on risk of local and distant progression will be tested using competing risks methodology to compare the short term and intermediate term arms as a first event in a competing risks analysis of clinical progression data. In a separate analysis the data will be examined to see if there is an interaction between androgen deprivation arm and dose of radiotherapy (=&lt; 70 Gy versus &gt; 70 Gy) using Cox regression (ie to see if the effect of duration of androgen deprivation depends on the radiation dose used).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured until local progression, distant progression, rising PSA, or death from any cause. Follow up is 3 monthly for up to 30 months. Then 6 monthly for 5 years post randomisation and then annually until death.</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. Changes in bone mineral density and osteopenic Fracture

Risk of osteoporotic fracture: Any fracture occuring during follow-up is reported, each incidence will be investigated and cause attributed by the investigator.  All patients will have a thoracor-lumbar x-ray at 0 and 3 years to assess vertebral fracture.  The effect of bisphosphonate (BP) on the risk of osteoporotic and sporadic fractures will be tested by comparing the proportions of patients at three years with new fractures, between the arms, no BP and BP, using an exact test of proportions, stratifying for type of androgen deprivation arm (Short or intermediate term) and age (&lt;60, 60 - 70, 70+). Patients eligible for this analysis will be those alive and who have been examined for presence of fracture by plain radiograph at baseline and at three years. The proportions of patients in each arm who have died before three years or who are otherwise not included in the comparison will be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. A test for interaction between bisphosphonate arm and androgen deprivation arm will be performed; if there is a significant interaction (ie if the effect of BP depends importantly on the AD arm) the BP arms may be tested separately within short-term AD patients and within intermediate term AD patients.

Loss of Bone mineral density: BMD will be measured in a subset of patients at 0, 2 and 4 years by DEXA scan.  The primary analysis for the effect of bisphosphonate on loss of BMD will be tested using multiple linear regression analysis on the change from baseline at two years of BMD, with a further analysis at 4 years, adjusting for baseline BMD and length of androgen deprivation received. It is intended to log-transform data prior to analysis, however the pooled data will be examined prior to analysis to see whether a different transformation or the use of a nonparametric test is appropriate. Patients eligible for these analyses are those alive and who are tested for BMD by DEXA scan at baseline and at two years. The proportions of patients in each arm who have died before two years or are otherwise not included in the comparison will be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. Testing for, and interpretation of, interaction between BP and AD will be as for fracture risk.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured until death. Follow up is 3 monthly for up to 30 months. Then 6 monthly for 5 years post randomisation and then annually until death.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5. Quality of life self-assessment

Patient reported outcomes will be measured using the EORTC QLQ C-30 and PR 25 questionnaires at baseline, 3 months, at end of RT and at 12, 18, 24, 36 and 60 months. Mean change from baseline in global and domain scores will be plotted by time and by treatment arm. The primary analysis of QOL will be a comparison between treatments of the change from baseline of the global QOL score at three years, adjusted for baseline QOL score, using multiple linear regression. Patients included in this analysis will be those who are alive at three years and who have completed both baseline and three-year questionnaires. Pooled data will be examined prior to analysis to see whether transformation or use of a nonparametric test is appropriate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Performed at baseline, 3 months, end of radiation therapy treatment, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 60 months and then yearly.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	Treatment related morbidity

Radiation induced toxicity:  Patient reported outcomes will be measured using the EORTC QLQ C-30 and PR25 questionnaires, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) for urinary function  and pharmaceutical intervention (PI) questionnaire for androgen deprivation and bisphosphonate side effects at baseline, 3 months, end of RT, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 60 months and then yearly.

Urinary and rectal function will be analysed at four cross-sectional time points:  1. At baseline prior to any treatment; 2. At the end of radiotherapy; 3. At 24 months (ie approximately 18 months post radiation); 4. At 36 months (ie 30 months post radiation).  Individual function scores and composite scores will be compared between trial arms using non-parametric uni-variable and multi-variable techniques.

Hormone deprivation induced toxicity: Pre-morbidity data and serial testosterone measures will be collected; reported cardiac and other adverse events will be thoroughly reviewed and classified.  Cumulative incidence (CI) of myocardial infarction or other serious adverse event will be derived by competing risk methodology and multi-variable models to determine contributing factors.  Data will be analysed at 5 years post randomisation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow up is 3 monthly for up to 30 months. Then 6 monthly for 5 years post randomisation and then annually until death.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Six months of hormone treatment improves the results of radiotherapy for men with early prostate cancer.  This trial will determine if adding another 12 months of hormone treatment after radiotherapy is even better.  Bones are often affected by prostate cancer and can also be damaged by prolong hormone treatment.  Bisphosphonates are drugs that make bones stronger.  This trial will also determine if treatment with a bisphosphonate can help prevent these bone problems.</summary>
