  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is laser therapy using Riancorp LTU-904 a class 1 low level laser, the participants will undergo 6 sixteen minute sessions spread over 6 weeks. This will be administered by either the Principal Investigator Dr Farhad Azimi, or the Research Nurse Rebecca Karantonis. The laser has a wavelength of 900nm and an output power of 5.0mW. There are 16x1cm diameter spots spaced 2cm apart in a square formation. The dose equals 1.5 Joules per cm2 per spot.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control device is a placebo using a deactivated Riancorp LTU-904. Neither the Prinicipal Investigator or the Research Nurse will know which laser has been activated. The devices are identical and sound the same when in use. The participants in the control group will also undergo 6 sixteen minute sessions spread over 6 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This is a composite primary outcome to determine if treatment with low level laser can improve the symptoms and signs of capsular contracture following expander/implant reconstruction, namely: -pain	-tightness -limited arm movement -cosmesis (appearance) The following validating tools will be used: Participants will complete the PROCCON questionnaire (Patient Reported Outcomes of Capsular CONtracture). Clinicians will complete the BRASS questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 weeks prior to treatment, and at 1 and 6 months post end of treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

    <concealment>All potential participants will be asked to complete a printed or electronic pre-treatment questionnaire which will identify if they have capsular contracture or not. This screening email/letter will contain a consent form to obtain their permission to collect their clinical information.
Those who do have significant capsular contracture will be sent a second email/letter, asking them if they are interested in participating in a trial of a non-surgical intervention that may improve their condition.
Women who would like to participate in the trial will be asked to contact the research nurse who will arrange an initial appointment with the doctor.
Written consent will be obtained at this appointment prior to any clinical examination or treatment commencing.
The results of this initial examination will be recorded on the BRASS post-operative questionnaire.
Consenting participants will be randomised to two groups: Laser A or Laser B. Block randomisation will be done using excel by a person off site not directly involved with the trial. Women in one group will receive treatment with an activated LLL (Riancorp LTU-904) while those in the other group will receive treatment with a deactivated LLL (Riancorp LTU-904).  The hand held laser devices will appear and sound identical and neither the participant nor the investigators will know whether the Laser being used is activated (a double blinded methodology). The supplier will only inform the investigators about which laser was active once the data collection is complete.

    <statisticalmethods>An estimated 40 patients (20 intervention, 20 control) will need to be recruited in order to detect a clinically significant improvement in symptoms (defined as a score difference of 2.3 out of 10), to a 2 sided significance level of 95%.

If a variable is approximately normally distributed, then the range is approximately +/- 2 standard deviations. Given the range of the rating scales score is 1 to 10, then an approximation of the standard deviation is range/4 = 2.5. While this calculation is approximate, it is a reasonable estimate given there is nothing available in the literature to suggest a better alternative. With this standard deviation and 20 participants per arm, the study would detect a difference in mean scores of 2.3 (out of 10). In other words, this sample size would detect an effect size of 0.9 (effect size = mean difference /standard deviation) with 80% power and significance level of 0.05. A difference of 2.3 should be clinically significant, as an effect size of 0.5 has been suggested as clinically meaningful for quality of life outcomes.

Comparative statistics will be used to identify significant differences in results with treatment with laser A or laser B. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse and describe the data obtained from questionnaires and surgeon aesthetic ratings, which will be scored according to standard scoring criteria published in the literature. Cross tabulations of major variables will be conducted to identify any correlations between treatment and improvement of particular signs or symptoms.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is investigating if treatment with a low level laser can help improve the signs and symptoms of capsular contracture: chest pain, chest tightness, limited arm movement and unsatisfactory appearance of the affected breast(s).

Who is it for?
Potential participants who have undergone mastectomy and breast reconstruction (with tissue expander/implant) will be identified from the databases of the RT and QoLID studies as well as from participating surgeons patient files.

Study Details
All participants will complete a pre-treatment questionnaire to determine if they have significant capsular contracture, those who do and have consented to participating in the trial will then be randomly assigned to a group (A or B). They will then undergo an initial clinical examination by a Clinician followed by 6x16min low level laser therapy sessions at weekly intervals. One of the groups will receive the laser therapy while the other group will be treated with a deactivated laser. Neither the clinician administering the treatment or the participant will know which group is receiving the active therapy. At the conclusion of the treatment participants will undergo clinical and aesthetic assessments as well as complete the initial questionnaire at the 1 and 6 month post treatment mark.</summary>
