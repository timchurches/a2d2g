  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of the project is to test whether daily consumption of de-alcoholised Shiraz red wine improves indicators of healthy ageing in overweight/obese men and women who are at least 50 years old. The intervention will be conducted over a period of 16 weeks and will test two doses of wine (187.5ml and 375.0ml daily). In the first eight weeks, participants will drink 187.5ml wine daily. Then the same participants will drink 375.0ml in the next eight weeks. The participants will be required to provide blood samples at the start of trial, after 8 weeks and at the end of 16 weeks. The effects of the de-alcoholised red wine will be compared to that of drinking water only. Participants will be randomly allocated to either consume the de-alcoholised wine or water. Blood, saliva and cells from the inside of the mouth will be collected on six occasions during the intervention.  The tissue samples will be used to determine molecular biomarkers of ageing. Cognitive function and blood pressure will also be measured.

After every 4 weeks, the participants will submit the proof of empty bottles electronically.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Twenty five subjects will undergo intervention with de-alcoholised Shiraz wine and twenty five with water only as controls. Both groups will be matched for age, gender, blood pressure and BMI. The statistical power estimate is based on the main outcome measure which is micronucleus frequency in lymphocytes (a biomarker of DNA damage previously shown to be reduced following red wine consumption). The power-estimates for effects on base-line and radiation-induced micronucleus frequency are described below. 
Base-line Micronucleus Frequency
Using data from previous trials conducted in our lab) the mean micronucleus frequency (per 1000 binucleated cells) and standard deviation for healthy adults aged 50-70 years is 26.8 and 14.2 respectively. The following are the power estimates based on the above mean and SD:
Minimum difference detectable at p = 0.05 (one-tailed)	Effect size relative to mean base-line MN frequency
90% power	8.5	32%
80% power	7.2	27%

Radiation-Induced Micronucleus Frequency using data from previous study, the mean micronucleus frequency (per 1000 binucleated cells) induced by 1.5Gy X-rays and standard deviation for healthy adults aged 65-75 years is 220 and 30 respectively. The following are the power estimates based on the above mean and SD:
Minimum difference detectable at p = 0.05 (one-tailed), effect size relative to mean of MN frequency induced by 1.5Gy X-rays
90% power	17.9	8%
80% power	15.2	7%

Parametric statistical methods will be used for biomarkers exhibiting Gaussian distribution. Non-parametric methods will be employed to analyse the results for biomarkers that were not Gaussian in their distribution. Paired t-test or Wicoxon-matched pairs test will be used to (i) compare the biomarker differences between the base-line and post-intervention results within each treatment group and (ii) compare the differences between the effect of wine and water (i.e. the difference between treatments for their effects on biomarkers measured as the change in the post-intervention result relative to the base-line result, measured by subtraction). Correlation analysis will be performed by Spearmans or Pearsons test depending on whether the biomarker data were Gaussian or non-Gaussian in their distribution. Two way analysis of variance tests will also be performed when required to assess interaction effects of two variables (e.g. treatment by time, gender by treatment). All P values were for 2-tailed tests unless otherwise stated. Statistical tests were performed using Prism 6.0 (Graphpad Inc., USA) and SPSS (IBM SPSS version 22).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol-removed wines are relevant  to reducing the risk of DNA damage and other alcohol-related pathologies in (i) the foetus in utero and the mother/father for those couples who choose to continue drinking wine before and during pregnancy, (ii) those who habitually exceed current alcohol drinking recommendations and are trying to maintain their social habits, (iii) those who are genetically susceptible because they can not metabolise alcohol properly and/or detoxify its carcinogenic metabolite acetaldehyde (i.e. ALDH2 defect commonly found in Asians), (iv) those who want the health benefit of increased wine phenolic intake without the detrimental effect  of alcohol in wine or the high sugar in grape juice (e.g. diabetics) and (vi) those who want to drink wine phenolics because of the emerging evidence of their protective effects against neurodegeneration and their role as potential  caloric restriction mimetics. The direct benefits of de-alcoholised wine may be particularly relevant to obese individuals because they exhibit higher levels of DNA damage and oxidative stress as well as being at a higher risk of developing diseases associated with increased DNA damage such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease. 
The main aim of the project is to test whether daily consumption of either 187.5 ml of Eden Vale de-alcoholised Shiraz for 8 weeks followed by consumption of 375.0ml for another 8 weeks prevents age-associated genome pathology and metabolic stress in overweight/obese men and women who are at least 50 years old. The hypothesis we are testing is Increased consumption of de-alcoholised red wine prevents DNA damage and other biomarkers of ageing in overweight/obese older men and women.
