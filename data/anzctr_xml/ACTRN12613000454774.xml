  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group of patients will receive a telephone call 2 weeks prior to procedure. The details of the procedure, the complications and risks of the procedure will be re-stated. Patients will also be reminded of bowel preparation compliance.

The telephone call will be administered by one of the investigators, primarily Miss Brianne Lauritz. The duration of the call will be approximately 10minutes, however may vary if the patient has questions or concerns

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Informed consent for the procedure will be obtained at a General Surgery or Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic appointment, approximately 4 weeks prior to the procedure date. At the Outpatient Clinic patients will receive an information pamphlet on colonoscopy. Patients will also be asked if they wish to participate in this study and those that do, will sign a consent form. Patients will be informed of the purpose of this study, that that may or may not receive a phone call prior to the procedure and that they have the right to refuse to participate without any compromise to their care.
One of the investigators will be responsible for determining if a patient is eligible for inclusion in the trial and at the time will be unaware which to group the subject will be allocated. Allocation concealment will be done by sealed opaque envelopes.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Random order generation will involve simple randomisation using a randomisation table in statistics book.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A minimum of 100 participants per group is estimated to be necessary to yield 80% power at a two-tailed 0.05 level of clinical significance to demonstrate an effect size of 0.5 s.d. allowing for a 15% drop-out rate

Appropriate statistical analysis will be used to compare the two groups in; knowledge of procedure and risks, perceived helpfulness of pamphlet, what questions or concerns were not addressed previously or had to be re-addressed, perceived helpfulness of phone call, quality of bowel preparation. A p value of &lt;0.05 is to be considered clinically significant. We will adjust for patient demographics
