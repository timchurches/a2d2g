Experimental: PK Lead-in Phase, Cohort 1 - During screening, participants will receive placebo to match LDV/SOF FDC to assess ability to swallow. After screening, participants between 12 to &lt; 18 years of age weighing = 45 kg will receive LDV/SOF FDC 90 mg/400 mg for 10 days (or LDV/SOF FDC 4 x 22.5 mg/100 mg based on swallowability assessment during screening).

Experimental: PK Lead-in Phase, Cohort 2 - During screening, participants will receive placebo to match LDV/SOF FDC to assess ability to swallow. After screening, participants between 6 to &lt; 12 years of age weighing = 17 kg and &lt; 45 kg will receive LDV/SOF FDC 2 x 22.5 mg/100 mg for 10 days.

Experimental: PK Lead-in Phase, Cohort 3 - Participants between 3 to &lt; 6 years of age weighing = 17 kg will receive 45 mg/ 200 mg (4 x 11.25 mg/ 50 mg packets) LDV/SOF FDC and those weighing &lt; 17 kg will receive 33.75 mg/ 150 mg (3 x 11.25 mg/ 50 mg packets) LDV/SOF FDC for 10 days.

Experimental: Treatment Phase, Group 1 - Participants not rolling over from the PK Lead-in Phase will receive placebo to match LDV/SOF FDC to assess ability to swallow during screening.

Experimental: Treatment Phase, Group 2 - Participants not rolling over from the PK Lead-in Phase will receive placebo to match LDV/SOF FDC to assess ability to swallow during screening. Participants between 3 to &lt; 12 years of age will receive LDV/SOF FDC (age-appropriate dose and formulation pending PK and safety results from Cohort 2 in PK lead-in phase).
HCV Genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 (United Kingdom/ United States/Australia/New Zealand): Treatment naive with or without cirrhosis and treatment-experienced without cirrhosis will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks. Treatment-experienced with cirrhosis will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 24 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will have two parts as follows:

      The PK Lead-in Phase of the study will evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      confirm the dose of ledipasvir/sofobuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed dose combination (FDC) in hepatitis
      C virus (HCV)-infected pediatric participants. The PK Lead-in Phase will also evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of 10 days of dosing of LDV/SOF FDC in
      HCV-infected pediatric participants.

      The Treatment Phase will be initiated by age cohort after confirmation of age-appropriate
      LDV/SOF FDC dosage levels. Participants from the PK Lead-in Phase will immediately rollover
      into the Treatment Phase with no interruption of study drug administration. The Treatment
      Phase will evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LDV/SOF FDC +/-
      Ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks in pediatric participants with HCV.</summary>
