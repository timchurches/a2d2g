  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparison of performance of selenium-coated contact lenses to that of high oxygen permeable lenses when worn on a monthly replacement daily or continuous wear schedule for up to 6 months.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether selenium coated lenses are safe and effective for daily and extended wear. The trial will last for up to 6 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments will occur on a monthly basis</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether selenium coated lenses retain antibacterial efficacy after wear.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Lenses will be assessed on after each month of wear.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
