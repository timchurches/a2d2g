    <interventions>The objective of the PIANO study is to describe prospectively in detail the clinical, laboratory, microbiological and radiological features, economic costs for patients presenting with prothetic joint infection and treatment outcomes in terms of initial treatment strategy, surgical methods, choice and duration of antibiotic therapy and micro-organism (duration of 5.75 years in total, May 2014-Dec 2019).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infection outcomes will measure the number of patients with clinical cure &amp; relapse free prosthesis survival.
Clinical cure is defined as those who remain alive, with no clinical evidence of ongoing infection timed from the day of diagnosis. At 12 month and 24 month cure will be defined as all four of:
i. No clinical evidence of infection (none of the following: draining fistula; redness, swelling or effusion of the index joint, fever without alternative explanation)
ii. No microbiological evidence of infection (as per inclusion criteria, but does not have to be with the initial infecting organism).
iii. No use of ongoing antibiotic therapy for the index joint infection.
&amp; Relapse-free prosthesis survival defined as patients who are judged to have been clinically cured at the end of the initial management, the subsequent time that the prosthesis remains in place and free of relapse. Relapse will be defined as either
i) Clinical relapse  any of the above mentioned 3 criteria.
ii) Microbiological relapse  growth of one or more of the originally infecting pathogens from either synovial fluid or intra-operative fluid or tissue specimens.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be defined at 12 month and 24 months from the day of diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost outcomes will be calculated from the health payer perspective and will be extrapolated to estimate the total annual national cost. 
Primary data collected to inform cost analysis will be length of hospital stay, number and nature of operating theatre visits; nature of any new prosthesis inserted in the 12-month period; use of pathology and radiology services, length of hospital in the home treatment and direct antibiotic costs. Costs attributable to hospitalisation will be based on data from each participating institution. Outpatient costs will be derived from medicare rebates, whilst drug costs will estimated from listed drug costs from Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), or in the case of rifampicin and other non-PBS drugs, from direct pharmacy costs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The direct annual costs of PJI to the Australian health care system will be estimated using costs incurred over the first 12 months post diagnosis.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional outcomes will measure the impact of the prosthetic joint infection on the individual. This will be determined by;
i. The Oxford Hip and Knee score, a disease- specific, short, patient-centred questionnaire that is designed to assess functional ability and pain from the patient's perspective and.
ii. The Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12 v2.0) which provides a comprehensive, psychometrically sound, and efficient way to measure health from the patient's point of view by scoring responses to standardised questions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be will be assessed at 3, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>a.	Age at least 18 years
b.	Prosthetic Joint infection diagnosed according to infection clinically suspected by an infectious diseases specialist or orthopaedic surgeon, AND presence of at least one of:
i.	Presence of sinus tract communicating with the prosthesis
ii.	Increased leukocyte count or neutrophil percentage in preoperative synovial fluid aspirate (synovial fluid white blood cell count over 1700 cells/microlitre or neutrophil percentage greater than 65%).
iii.	Visible pus around the prosthesis at operation without alternative explanation
iv.	Acute inflammation as reported by the clinical pathologist on examination of periprosthetic tissue (&gt;=5 or more neutrophils per high power field)
v.	Two or more pre-operative or intraoperative cultures (blood, synovial fluid, peri-prosthetic tissue, or sonication fluid) that yield the same organism (indistinguishable based on common laboratory tests including genus and species identification or common antibiogram). 
vi.	Pure growth of Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci or pathogenic aerobic Gram negative rod from a single synovial fluid or intraoperative tissue/fluid specimen

c. The infected joint is one of hip, knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist or ankle
d. The infected prosthesis is either a total joint replacement or hemi-arthroplasty. 
e. The PJI is current. This means that there is ongoing active treatment for it at the time of enrollment, and that all data relating to this episode are accessible. For example if the infection was diagnosed at another hospital 3 months ago, and is currently being treated at the recruiting site, then they can be enrolled as long as the data from the original hospital are accessible.

    <statisticalmethods>Depending on the type of data, the demographic results will be expressed as mean +/- SD or number of subjects (percentage). 
 Cure will be used as a dichotomous dependent variable in a logistic regression analysis. Variables such as infecting organism, initial management strategy, age, weight, co-morbidities will be included in a backward stepwise progression. The most parsimonious model will be determined using AIC and ANOVA methods. The sample size and the expected rates of cure will enable incorporation of between 5-10 variables safely in the final models
Subgroup analyses will also be performed for initial management strategy and infecting microorganism. A number of variables will be evaluated with regards to treatment outcome within the following parameters: (i) type of joint prosthesis, (ii) type of surgical procedure, (iii) type of antimicrobial treatment. 
Factors that influence the functional status of participants will be identified by a bivariate survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier). Potential risk factors identified will be then confirmed by a multivariate survival analysis (Cox regression model). The results are expressed as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. 
Size of study population;
In total, we expect to recruit &gt;600 (150-300/y) patients, making this one of the largest and most detailed prospective observational studies of PJIs in the world. These case-numbers are feasible; at the 5 initial pilot sites, we estimate that 75-100 patients per year can be recruited including 25-30, 20-25, 15-25, 10-20 and 5-10 patients from Fremantle, Royal Perth, St. Vincents, John Hunter and Brisbane Private hospitals, respectively. Based on data from the workload study from the workload study, =20 sites in Australia and =5 sites in NZ will enrol patients into this study. This will ensure collection of data that captures the heterogeneity of management approaches from a broad cross-section of centres across Australia and NZ. 
This sample size provides adequate statistical power to answer important questions. For example, 300 patients will provide 80% power (at a significance level of 5%) to detect a difference in cure rates at 24 months of 10% (80% versus 70%) in two treatment groups. Within this framework, the following key research questions can be addressed to inform the design of subsequent randomised controlled trials: i) do patients who do not meet the conventional requirements for DAIR, but have this initial approach, have poorer outcomes than initial 2-stage replacement strategy, ii) do patients that undergo DAIR and treated with rifampicin have superior 24-month cure rates than those who are not and iii) if rifampicin is part of the antibiotic regimen, is the duration of intravenous antibiotics (dichotomised as =2 versus &gt;2 weeks,) an important predictor of clinical cure?

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently a lack of high quality evidence to inform the management of prosthetic joint infections (PJI), an uncommon, but potentially devastating complication of joint replacement surgery. Prosthetic Joint Infection in Australia and New Zealand Observational Study (PIANO) is a multicentre, prospective observational study of prosthetic joint infections in Australia and New Zealand. The study aims to describe the clinical, laboratory, microbiological and radiological features of patients presenting with prosthetic joint infections and their management and subsequent outcomes. </summary>
