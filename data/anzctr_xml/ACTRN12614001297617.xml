  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients would be randomised to two groups.

Both groups would receive 1g systemic IV cefazolin 15 minutes prior to tourniquet inflation. This ensures all patients in the study receive effective antibiotic prophylaxis regardless of randomisation. Both groups of patients would then undergo routine prep and draping prior to exsanguination and inflation of an above knee tourniquet to 300mmHg.

Immediately following inflation, the intervention group would receive 500mg of vancomycin via an EZ-IO (Vidacare, San Antonio, Texas) intraosseous cannula. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group would receive 15mg/kg based on actual body weight (maximum of 2g) of IV vancomycin</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse effects
- Infusion related events
During or soon after infusion of vancomycin, patients may develop flushing of the upper body ("red neck") or pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes, but may persist for several hours. Such events are infrequent if vancomycin is given by a slow infusion and at an appropriate dilution, and can be treated effectively with antihistamines.
- Renal
Rarely, renal failure, principally manifested by increased serum creatinine or urea concentrations, especially in patients given large doses of vancomycin, has been reported. .



Assessment of adverse events
- Patients will be followed closely through their 45
days as an inpatient following surgery and then regular clinic
appointments.

During the the operation, patient safety will be monitored by full cardiovascular and anaesthetic monitors. Following
surgery patients will spend 12 hours in recovery again with full monitoring and 1 to 1 nursing supervision.

Adverse events will be recorded and reviewed by an independent research nurse specialist</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Power was calculated based on our previous randomization control trial of comparing intraosseous administration vs. systematic administration of vancomycin. The mean tissue concentrations of vancomycin in subcutaneous fat and bone was 40.3 (+/-47.2) in the intraosseous group and 3.6 (+/-2.2) in the systemic group.
10 patients in each arm will be expected to provide the summary of concentration in bone, fat, and blood samples. 

Means, standard deviations, and the 95% confidence limits will be calculated for the concentrations in the different samples. Different tissue samples will be pooled according to surgical steps. Coefficient of variations (CV) of concentration level will be summarized at each surgical step for the comparison between three arms. Repeat measure analysis of variance will be used to compare the average level of concentration across time between groups adjusted by diabetes, age, and length of surgical procedure; Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to assess the normality of the residuals.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the proposed study is to assess the concentration of vancomycin for prophylactic total knee arthroplasty in the obese patient. 

Infection remains a devastating complication to total knee joint arthroplasty. Obesity (BMI&gt;30) has been shown in a meta-analysis of 150000 patients to have a significantly higher incidence of deep and superficial infections with an odds ratio of 2.4 and 2.2 respectively.

Intraosseous regional administration (IORA) has been validated to produce higher tissue concentration of vancomycin compared to systemic administration in a study performed by the project leader that recently received the Mark Coventry Award.

The pathophysiology of obesity alters the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin with a higher volume of distribution and a shorter elimination half-life. Thus the systemic dose of vancomycin increases according to body weight. The significance of this for regional antibiotics is unknown.</summary>
