  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be asked to undergo exposure of approximately 15% of their body (i.e. the face, hands and arms) usually between 9.30am  10am daily during the year, 5 days per week.  During mid summer, these sessions will run between 8.30am  9am.  It is recognized that it may be practically difficult to achieve this exposure during the months of June  August and exposure during these winter months may be less effective, but it considered important the study should run continuously through the year for adherence purposes.   Adherence will be enhanced via the appointment of Sunlight Assistants in each intervention institution, who will be normally employed in that institution for other duties but reimbursed for 1.5 hours per day for their duties in the study.  Calcium supplements (Caltrate, 600mg elemental calcium, orally, morning) will be administered to the group, daily. Individual and doctors consent are obtained from each resident.  The hostels pharmacy distributes the calcium tablets in individual Webster packs.  All participants will receive the medical care usually provided by other health professionals.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects in the intervention groups will be asked to undergo exposure of approximately 15% of their body (i.e. the face, hands and arms) usually between 9.30am  10am daily during the year, 5 days per week.  During mid summer, these sessions will run between 8.30am  9am.  Subjects in the control group will be provided with a brochure about vitamin D deficiency and how to treat it.  They will receive their usual routine care and nutrition.  All participants will receive the medical care usually provided by other health professionals.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study will determine the effect of a public health strategy (ie. increased sun light exposure and increased calcium intake) to reduce falls in older people in residential care using a randomised trial. The primary hypothesis of the trial is that increased appropriate sun light exposure will reduce falls, improve 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels and lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Secondary hypotheses are that the intervention will reduce accelerated bone turnover, reduce fractures, improve motor function and improve mood.</summary>
