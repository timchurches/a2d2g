  <interventions>
    <interventions>Phase I: In the phase I study patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3. They will receive fixed dose temozolomide [200 mg/m2 orally (po) once daily for 5 days] in cycles of 28 days and escalating doses of lapatinib. The starting dose of lapatinib will be 1000 mg administered orally (po) once daily (OD) every day of the 28 day cycle. Three dose levels of lapatinib will be explored (1000, 1250 and 1500 mg). Patients will receive lapatinib/ temozolomide combination until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 patients will receive escalating doses of lapatinib until the maximum tolerated dose is determined (MTD) as recorded in week 4 of treatment. Phase II: Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 orally (po) once daily for 5 days will be used along with Lapatinib  1000 mg orally (po) once daily (dose as defined from phase I). The cycle duration is 28 days. The treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal.</interventions>

    <summary>This study will integrate an initial phase I dose-escalation part aimed at documenting the safety profile and recommended dose of lapatininb in combination with temozolomide in patients with recurrent refractory glioblastoma multiforme. It will be followed by a phase II open-label study to evaluate the efficacy of lapatinib /temozolomide combination in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas.  Patients will be treated with the combination until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal.</summary>
