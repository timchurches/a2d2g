    <summary>The purpose of this study is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose
      for expansion of LDK378 as a single agent, assess safety, tolerability and anti-tumor
      activity and characterize single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics when administered orally
      to pediatric patients with ALK-activated tumors, with and without food.</summary>
