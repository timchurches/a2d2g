  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will be conducted with selected stroke patients in subacute period previously treated in the Rehabilitation Clinic.
Participants who meet eligibility requirements will be randomly divided into the control and the study group. Study group patients will be enrolled in treadmill training with partial body weight support (PBWS) and real time visual feedback. The treadmill software displays a real time visualization of patients feet placement and the area in which the next step should be placed to maintain the symmetry of patients gait. The gait velocity and the required step length will be adjusted to the patients physical abilities. The amount of body weight support will not exceed 30% of the patients body weight. The control group members will be trained on the same treadmill with exactly the same body weight support system.
Treadmill training in both groups will be conducted by a physiotherapist who is not participating neither in a basic survey nor in a control test. Training parameters for each patient will be individually tailored by the physiotherapist. Participation in the training is confirmed in medical records.
Both groups sessions will be conducted Monday to Friday ( 5 days) for 3 weeks. Each session will last 30 minutes. 
Patients will implement a standard rehabilitation program but no other equipment as Lokomat or exoskeleton Ekso GT. Standard program is sent by rehabilitation team and is not administered as part of this study
All patients qualified for the study will practice on the treadmill as well as participate in the rehabilitation program set up by a physiotherapists team.
Each patient will train for a maximum 90 minutes a day. Patients will be assessed before and after treadmill gait training. Patients will stay in Rehabilitation Clinic for 5 to 7 weeks. All exercises including treadmill trainings will be prepared by the experienced physiotherapists, working in the Rehabilitation Clinic.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Members of the control group will undergo the training on the same treadmill with exactly the same PBWS system as the study group. The control group will not be provided with the visual feedback software. The gait speed will be adjusted to the patients individual abilities. The amount of body weight support will not exceed 30% of patients body weight. Treadmill gait training time- 30 minutes. Number of trainings- 15, 3 weeks (form Monday to Friday). Alongside the treadmill training, the control group will also undergo a daily rehabilitation program, including 90 minutes of excersise therapy. Patients will stay in Rehabilitation Clinic from 5 to 7 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Brain strokes are one of the main causes of permanent impairment. The main symptoms of stroke are hemiparesis, muscle tension disorders, balance and coordination impairment, cognitive functions and communicative disorders. Restoration of patients gait is one of the primary targets of rehabilitation after stroke. Although 80% of stroke survivors regain the ability of independent walking, their gait is often impaired and limited. Disorders mainly lower the gait speed and the covered distance, they also affect the stability of gait. Among many patients the asymmetrical walking pattern is observed among time and space-related parameters. In rehabilitation of stroke patients many different techniques and devices are used, treadmills, partial body weight support systems and robots are commonly used. The efficacy of gait training is increased in systems providing real time feedback (gait parameters), the method using acoustic and visual feedback is very efficient and important. The use of treadmill and PBWS facilitates patients moves, it also facilitates to perform a full gait cycle (similar pattern to the natural one) by patient, it allows to increase the gait speed, covered distance, what increases the efficacy of motoric training. The real time, visual feedback about the symmetry and the length of patients step allows him to adjust his gate properly and learn the symmetrical walking pattern. 
The aim of this study is to asses the gait training with PBWS treadmill and visual feedback  among patients during subacute period after stroke. The assumed hypothesis is that gait training on a treadmill with PBWS and visual feedback facilitates the reconstruction of the symmetrical gait in comparison to patients training on a treadmill with PBWS, but without visual feedback.
The study will be conducted on the clinical rehabilitation ward of the Clinical Provincial Hospital in Rzeszów, Poland. Patients recruited for the study will be stroke survivors, that had suffered from brain stroke three weeks before they were recruited for the study. Gait training will be performed using the Gait Trainer 3 treadmill with partial body weight support system (provided by Biodex). The treadmill software enables a real time feedback, informing the patient about the placement of his feet and the correct area they should be placed in order to make the patients step length symmetrical.
Patients qualified for the study will be randomly divided into two groups. The study group will be training on a treadmill with real time visual feedback and the control group will use the same treadmill, but without visual feedback provided. Each patient is going to undergo the training every day (from Monday to Friday) for three weeks. One training session will last for 30 minutes.
Qualifications for the study will be performed by experienced physiotherapists. Initial and control examinations will be performed by the team member, who is not participating in patients training. Along the treadmill gait training, patients will be undergoing the rehabilitation program, set by the physiotherapeutic team.
