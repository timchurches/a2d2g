  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will provide three blood samples of 50 mL each.  The first two blood samples from each subject will be used for baseline measurement of immune cell markers, including markers of innate and acquired immune responses.

The third blood sample will be incubated with a ZESPRI Gold kiwifruit puree for two hours, after which time immune cell markers will be measured as for the baseline samples.  The puree will be added to cells at final dilutions of 1:64, 1:128, 1:256, and 1:512.</interventions>
    <comparator>Immune cell responses within each participant will be compared between baseline blood samples and the sample incubated with kiwifruit products.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in blood markers of immune cell function (innate and acquired immune responses, including assays for phagocytosis, neutrophil oxidative burst, natural killer cell activity, T-cell activation, and cytokine production) in response to in vitro incubation with kiwifruit products.</outcome>
