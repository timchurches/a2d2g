A &gt;/=10-point change in the score perceived by participants was considered as clinically significant. The QLQ-LC13 consisted of 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items that assessed the specific symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use of lung cancer participants receiving chemotherapy. Scale score range: 0 to 100. Higher symptom score = greater degree of symptom severity.</outcome>

      <outcome>EORTC QLQ-LC13 Questionnaire Score: Sore Mouth - QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for sore mouth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 of each treatment Cycle up to EOT (up to approximately 2.25 years); 6 week following PD (up to approximately 2.25 years); survival follow-up-1 (up to approximately 2.25 years) (1 Cycle= 21 days)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This global, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of atezolizumab (an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1] antibody)compared
      with docetaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) after failure with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized
      1:1 to receive either docetaxel or atezolizumab. Treatment may continue as long as
      participants are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, i.e., in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease
      progression.</summary>
