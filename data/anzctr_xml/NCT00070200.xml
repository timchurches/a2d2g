  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan and cyclophosphamide, use different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy
      with autologous stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of
      chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of induction chemotherapy using
      cyclophosphamide and topotecan in treating patients who are undergoing surgery and autologous
      stem cell transplantation followed by radiation therapy for newly diagnosed or progressive
      neuroblastoma.</summary>
