  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ferric Carboxymaltose
Subjects who are eligible and agreed to participate in study will be given ferric carboxymaltose for iron deficiency. Ferric carboxymaltose is given intravenously. There will be 2 phases of replacement, namely Corrective phase (week 1 to 10) and Maintenance phase (week 10 to week 24), as detailed below. 
Corrective phase: The total iron dose required for iron repletion was calculated at baseline, according to Ganzonis formula and the mean of the two hemoglobin values obtained during the screening period. Dosing frequency is weekly with maximum dose being 1000mg per week until total iron dose administered.
Maintenance phase: Reassessment on iron status, haemoglobin and iron-repletion dose performed on 4 weekly bases from week 10 onwards until week 24. Maintenance dose is determined by Ganzonis formula. Dosing frequency is on as required basis with maximum dose being 1000mg per week.
Adherence is monitored by attendance to day ward for Ferric Carboxymaltose intravenous infusion.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Iron deficiency is commonly seen in congestive heart failure (CHF) in both anaemic and nonanaemic patients. Recent studies have shown that intravenous iron treatment for iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, in congestive heart failure patient improves symptoms, functional capacity and quality of life. 
This study expand the investigation on the effect of intravenous iron to exercise capacity, echocardiogram changes as well as physical functioning and quality of life in patients with iron deficiency and congestive heart failure.
