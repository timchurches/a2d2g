    <interventions>The unique povidone-iodine based contact lens cleaning and disinfecting system First Care, will be dispensed to 40 regular, daily wear, frequent replacement soft contact lens wearers, for use with their own contact lenses over a period of 3 months. The efficacy of this system, against ocular pathogens in vivo, will be determined as measured via used contact lens storage case microbial contamination rates.
The product contains: 2-layered tablets with the disinfectant (Povidone-iodine) in the outer layer and both the neutralizer and protein remover in the inner layer; dissolving and rinsing solution and; lens case. After daily removal of contact lenses from the eyes, contact lenses are placed in the appropriate compartment (right eye or left eye) of the lens case and the basket is closed. The lens case is filled with First Care dissolving and rinsing solution, and the 2-layered tablet is added to the lens case. The lens case cap is secured on and contact lenses are to be kept in the case for at least 4 hours for the disinfecting, neutralizing and cleaning process to be completed. Contact lenses are removed from the basket and rinsed with fresh First Care dissolving and rinsing solution before inserting the lenses on eye. 
Participants will be asked to use the First Care system each day after removal of their contact lenses, prior to sleep. 
Participants will be provided with sufficient study product to last up until their next visit. Compliance with use of the study product will be monitored at the follow-up visits, when unused study product will be returned. </interventions>
    <comparator>The microbial contamination rates of used First Care contact lens storage cases will be compared with historical controls (c.f. Willcox et. al. Optom Vis Sci 2010;87:456-464). This data were collected from a series of dispensing clinical studies conducted at the Institute for Eye Research, Sydney. Approximately 40 participants were enrolled, and wore lenses on a daily wear basis for 3 months. The following lens/solution combinations were evaluated: OASYS/ClearCare; PureVision/Aquify; Biofinity/ClearCare; Biofinity/Aquify; Biofinity/Opti-Free Express; Biofinity/Opti-free RepleniSH.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Microbial contamination rates of used First Care contact lens storage cases. Lens cases will be sent to the Microbiology Laboratory within one hour of collection, where they will be swabbed using an alginate swab soaked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (wt/vol) sodium hexametaphosphate to dissolve the alginate. After mixing for 30 s, the solution will be cultured by plating aliquots onto three "chocolate" agar plates and one Sabouraud dextrose agar plate. One each of the chocolate agar plates will be incubated at 37degC in 5% CO2 (2 days), one in aerobic conditions (2 days) and one under anaerobic conditions (4 days). Sabouraud dextrose agar will be incubated at 25degC for 7 days to culture for yeast and molds. The number of colony forming units will be calculated for each microbial type. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>40 subjects will be enrolled. Assuming a case contamination rate of 80% with regular cases, a sample of 40 participants using the First Care contact lens case collected at two study visits is required to demonstrate a significant reduction of 50% (80% vs. 40%) in case contamination rates compared to historical controls. This sample was estimated at the 5% level of significance and with 90% power and assuming a 20% drop out rate. 
The number of colony forming units (CFU) for different microbial types, and the percentage of contact lens storage cases contaminated with various microbial species will be calculated, and compared with historical controls.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>First Care is the only product on the market of its kind that uses Povidone-iodine as a disinfectant. Povidone-iodine is the most commonly used medical disinfectant, and First Care has been shown to be a safe and efficient care product for all types of frequent replacement contact lenses. First Care is currently approved for sale in Japan. 
We hope to learn how effective the First Care system is, for reducing microbial contamination (e.g. bacteria and fungi) of used contact lens storage cases over a 3 month period, and to compare the results to other commercially available frequent replacement contact lens cleaning and disinfecting solution storage cases (using historical controls).
We hypothesize that the microbial contamination rates of used First Care cleaning and disinfecting system lens storage cases will be lower compared to used lens storage cases of other commercially available frequent replacement contact lens cleaning and disinfecting solutions.</summary>
