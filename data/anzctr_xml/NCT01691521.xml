  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Clinically Significant Exacerbations of Asthma Per Year - Clinically significant exacerbations of asthma are defined as worsening of asthma which required use of systemic corticosteroids (IV or oral steroid like prednisone, for at least 3 days or a single intramuscular (IM) corticosteroid (CS) dose is required. For maintenance of systemic corticosteroids, at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days was required) and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department (ED) visits. The frequency of clinically significant exacerbations of asthma over the 32-week treatment period is expressed as the number of exacerbations per year. Analysis of the number of exacerbations performed using a negative binomial model with covariates of treatment group, baseline maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), region, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable) and baseline % predicted FEV1, and with logarithm of time on treatment as an offset variable.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Clinically Significant Exacerbations Requiring Hospitalization (Including Intubation and Admittance to an Intensive Care Unit [ICU]) or ED Visits Per Year - Clinically significant exacerbations of asthma are defined as worsening of asthma which required use of systemic corticosteroids (IV or oral steroid like prednisone, for at least 3 days or a single intramuscular (IM) corticosteroid (CS) dose is required. For maintenance of systemic corticosteroids, at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days was required) and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department (ED) visits.

      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Pre-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 32 - FEV1 is defined as the volume of air expelled from the lungs in 1 second. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 measurements were taken by spirometry. The change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the value of the endpoint at the time point of interest and the baseline value. Analysis performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of baseline, region, baseline maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable), treatment and visit, plus interaction terms for visit by baseline and visit by treatment group.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Total Score at Week 32 - The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire is an established instrument, comprising 50 questions, evaluating symptoms, activity, and impacts; to measure Quality of Life in participants with diseases of airway obstruction and to elicit the participant's opinion of his/her health. The lowest possible value is zero and the highest possible value is 100. The higher values correspond to greater impairment in quality of life. The questionnaire was administered at Baseline (Visit 2) and at the Exit Visit (approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment). The change from baseline is defined as the difference between the value of the endpoint at the time point of interest and the baseline value. Analysis performed using analysis of covariance with covariates of baseline, region, baseline maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable), baseline % predicted FEV1, and treatment.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate two dose regimens of mepolizumab [75mg intravenous (i.v.) or 100mg
      subcutaneous (SC) every 4 weeks] compared with placebo over a 32 week treatment period in
      subjects with severe refractory asthma with elevated blood eosinophils. Efficacy will be
      measured by a reduction in the frequency of asthma exacerbations. Additional efficacy
      assessments will include measurements of lung function, symptom scores, and quality of life.
      Safety will be assessed by clinical laboratory samples, ECGs, immunogenicity and adverse
      events.

      This study is intended to replicate the Phase IIb/III study MEA112997. Subjects in MEA115588,
      who meet all eligibility criteria at screening visit, will enter the run-in period. Those
      subjects that are not able/eligible to be randomised at the end of the 6 week run-in period
      will be deemed run-in failures. Subjects will remain on their current maintenance therapy
      throughout the run-in, double-blind treatment administration and follow-up periods. Subjects
      who meet the randomisation eligibility criteria will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive one of the following treatments every 4 weeks for a total of 8 doses: Mepolizumab 75
      miligram (mg) i.v. and placebo SC, or Mepolizumab 100 mg SC and placebo i.v. or Placebo i.v.
      and placebo SC.

      Subjects that receive all 8 doses of double-blind treatment, and meet the eligibility
      criteria for the Open-Label Extension (OLE) Study, will be offered the opportunity to
      participate in the OLE trial.</summary>
