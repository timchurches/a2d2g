  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients within the intensive care unit who have severe infections causing shock and kidney
      failure have almost a 60% risk of dying despite antibiotic therapy, surgical drainage of the
      site of infection and intensive care support with fluids, nutrition, mechanical ventilation
      and continuous artificial kidney support. This persistently high death rate continues to
      stimulate the development of new approaches to the treatment of septic shock.

      Much clinical and molecular biology research suggests that these patients die because of an
      uncontrolled immune systems response to infection. This response involves the production of
      several substances (so called humoral mediators), which enter the blood stream and affect
      the patient's organs ability to function and the patient's ability to kill germs. These
      substances may potentially be removed by new artificial filters similar to those currently
      used during continuous hemofiltration (the type of artificial kidney support used in
      intensive care).

      Recent investigations by ourselves and others, however, have made the following findings:

        1. Standard filters currently used in intensive care are ineffective in removing large
           amounts of these humoral mediators because the holes in the filter are too small to
           allow all of them to pass through

        2. The standard filters currently used in intensive care are also ineffective in removing
           large amounts of these humoral mediators because the standard filtration flow through
           the membrane is less than 100 ml/min

        3. When the filtration flow through the membrane is increased to above 100ml/min, patients
           require a lesser dose of drugs to support their blood pressure which is an indirect sign
           that the filters are clearing some of the "humoral mediators"

        4. Even when the blood flow through standard filters is increased to above 100ml/min, there
           is still not optimal clearing of "humoral mediators" It is possible, however, that,
           using a different filter membrane with bigger holes in it, would make it easier to clear
           the blood of these "humoral mediators". It is thought that this would be noticeable
           clinically in the amount of drugs required to support blood pressure.

      A filter that has these bigger holes is now available. It is made of the same material as the
      standard filters that are currently used in the intensive care unit, only the holes have been
      made bigger to allow these "humoral mediators" to be removed from the blood. This polyamide
      filter is made of synthetic semipermeable material. This material is highly compatible with
      human blood. This modified polyamide filter is made of exactly the same compatible material
      but the holes in the material are slightly larger through a minor modification of the
      manufacturing process.

      This larger hole filter has now been used in preliminary studies in humans and has been found
      to reduce the blood levels of some "humoral mediators". Laboratory studies conducted by
      ourselves showed that this new filter can achieve the highest reported clearance of some of
      the "humoral mediators" with minimal effect on useful proteins in blood such as albumin
      during hemodialysis. This loss is very small and unlikely to contribute to any detectable
      clinical changes.

      We, therefore, now propose to study the effect of using new large hole filters with
      hemodialysis in patients with severe infections and acute kidney failure.

      We wish to compare the effect of this new therapy to that of standard filters. The new
      therapy will be considered to be effective if it lowers the amount of drugs used to support
      blood pressure and if it lowers the blood levels of some "humoral mediators" more than
      standard therapy. We will also monitor blood levels of important components of blood such as
      albumin and electrolytes in each group.

      This is a pilot study involving only 10 patients who will each receive 4 hours of the
      standard therapy and 4 hours of the new therapy. Which treatment the patient receives first
      will be random (like the tossing of a coin). Blood samples will be taken at the start and
      after 4 hours of each treatment. The waste product of dialysis called spent dialysate will
      also be collected for the measurement of humoral mediators at the start and after 4 hours of
      each treatment. The changes in blood pressure and drugs used to support it will be recorded
      hourly. As patients involved in the study would normally receive hemofiltration because of
      their kidney failure, all the risks and benefits associated with the procedure would be
      unchanged. The only risk to patients would come from exposure to a modified membrane and from
      having two additional spoonfuls of blood taken.

      If this new membrane were found to have a major effect on the blood level of "humoral
      mediators" and on the patients blood pressure, further studies would then be justified to
      assess its clinical effects (time in ICU, time in hospital, time on ventilator, duration of
      organ failure, etc).</summary>
