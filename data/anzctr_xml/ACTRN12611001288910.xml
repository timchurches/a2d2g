  <interventions>
    <interventions>Resveratrol belongs to a class of polyphenolic compounds called stillbenes, found largely in the skins of red grapes and root of Japanese knotweed. It is a fat-soluble compound typically used in oriental medicine to treat diseases of the blood vessels, heart and liver. An increasing body of evidence from in vitro, animal model and ex vivo studies suggest that resveratrol has the potential to prevent or reduce the risk of certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease, certain cancers (DNA-protective effects) and cognitive dysfunction or dementias. 

This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, repeated groups study, with a 7-day washout period between treatments.

Participants will be required to attend 2 study visits. Visits will be scheduled to begin in the mornings as participants will be required to fast prior to testing. Each visit will progress in the same fashion and last for approximately 2.5 hours. 

Participants will complete a baseline 20-minute cognitive battery comprised of 2 repetitions of the Cognitive Demand Battery which consists of the serial three subtraction task, serial seven subtraction task and the Rapid Visual Information Processing Task. Following this a fasting blood sample will be taken as a baseline measure. Participants will then be given their treatment for the day. 

Participants will be randomised to receive either:
1) 100mg of grape derived resveratrol in 100ml red wine
2) 100ml red wine, 

such that at the conclusion of the study all participants will have received both treatments. 

A 45 minute absorption period is required prior to a second blood sample being taken. Following this, participants will complete a 60 minute cognitive battery comprised of 6 repetitions of the CDB. Following this, participants will be required to give a third blood sample. Finally, following a further 30 minutes, a fourth blood sample will be taken.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through advertising and word of mouth. 

To minimize bias this study will employ both randomization and blinding.

Randomization of participants to treatment groups will be determined by random allocation. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The randomisation order that has been placed next to the participant’s number will be the allocated treatment order for that individual.

Blinding will be achieved by enlisting a person outside of the project to code the treatments, and maintain the key to this code until data collection is completed. The codes will only be broken in an emergency, such as an SAE that requires knowledge of the treatment being taken in order to manage a participant’s condition. The principle investigator and ethics committee will be informed within 24 hours of the code-break envelope being opened.</concealment>
