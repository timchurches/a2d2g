  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 sessions of therapeutic songwriting provided to an adult with either spinal cord injury or acquired brain injury by a registered music therapist. The protocol is designed to target the self-concept whereby the therapist engages the participant in the creation of three songs guided by covering the six domains of the self-concept - the social self, the personal self, the family self, the physical self, the moral self, the academic self. The participant writes the first song about the past self (4 x 1 hour sessions twice per week), the second song about the present self (4 x 1 hour sessions twice per week), and a song about the imagined future self (4 x 1 hour sessions twice per week). sessions will be individual, provided in a face to face context, bedside or in a private room within the hospital or participants' homes. A log of session attendance will be used to monitor adherence. The music therapist with at least 5 years experience will utilise an iPad with garageband software to facilitate the creation and recording of lyrics and music.

32 ABI and 32 SCI participants would be a feasible number to recruit over the study period and sufficient to determine the effect size of the intervention and the factors of efficacy. 

STATISTICAL METHODS TO BE UNDERTAKEN
The data will be summarized as mean (standard deviation) and analyzed using paired sample t-tests using a significance level of 0.05. Effect size calculations will also be conducted, in addition to the probability analyses, to determine the size of any clinically significant changes in wellbeing. We will also search for correlations between the wellbeing measures (including experience sampling) and flow and meaningfulness of the songwriting process and song product.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study is to determine the effects of a therapeutic songwriting protocol on a range of wellbeing measures for people who are undergoing inpatient rehabilitation and those who are 0-24 months post discharge from acquired brain injury (ABI) or spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. A pre­-post design will determine whether therapeutic songwriting can assist people who have sustained long­term injuries resulting from traumatic injury (such as workplace or road accidents) to work through issues of identity. This guided therapeutic process may include exploring a new identity that integrates the old pre­injured self with a new identity that integrates the residual physical/cognitive/and psychosocial effects of the injury. The main purpose of this pilot project is to test the feasibility of the study protocol, establish the appropriateness of the measures for answering the research questions, and collect data that will capture the factors of efficacy. </summary>
