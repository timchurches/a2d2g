    <interventions>Selection procedure: Along with the baseline questionnaire, the children in the experimental schools completed peer nominations questions (whom they respected, wanted to be like, looked up to, went to for advice, and regarded as good leaders) to identify the most influential children in their classroom. Fifteen percent of boys and 15% of girls with the most nominations over all questions were invited for to be trained as peer motivators. 

Training: The training was delivered by the experimenter in groups of max. 12 children in a one 90-minute session during school hours. The aim of the training was to give the most influential children the knowledge and skills to promote water consumption within their social networks. The objectives of the training were: (1) to emphasize the benefits of water, (2) to encourage peer motivators to consume more water, and (3) to teach peer motivators skills to promote water consumption within their social network. The children were taught skills to promote water consumption by discussing possible ways through which they can encourage their peers to drink more water.

follow-up sessions: The peer motivators were asked to promote water consumption within their social networks during eight weeks. The experimenters offered support at two school-based follow-up sessions (one and four weeks after the training). The purpose of the follow-up visits was to (1) offer the peer motivators visible support and resolve any problems they experienced in their role and (2) refresh the information that was discussed in the training. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overweight and obesity are among the most common public health problems in Western society. One major contributor of obesity in children is the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages. A possible solution to the obesity epidemic is to replace childrens consumption of sugar sweetened beverages with water. With use of the diffusion of innovation theory, the proposed program targeted primary school students aged 9-13 years and aimed to increase water consumption among these students. The program consisted of training opinion leaders to acts as peer supporters during informal interactions and encourage their peers to drink more water. The primary goal of this project was to develop and assess the effectiveness of the  program in primary schools in the Netherlands. </summary>
