      <outcome>NF-kB Activity by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) - NF-kB activity will be measured as a continuous variable (ng NF-kB/Mg protein). Differences in NF-?B activity between time points will be assessed using summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and range.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib and to see how
      well it works when given together with combination chemotherapy in treating younger patients
      with recurrent, refractory, or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bortezomib may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with bortezomib may
      kill more cancer cells</summary>
