  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The core study looked at the effect of Zoledronic Acid given once as an intravenous (i.v.)
      infusion compared to 60 days of oral Risedronate in patients with Paget's disease of bone.
      The effect was demonstrated in the reduction of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP). The
      extended observation period included participants of the core study who responded to
      treatment.</summary>
