  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from Baseline to 12 week follow up in PANSS-positive and negative syndrome scale - Positive and Negative Symptom Schedule (PANSS): The PANSS will be performed at baseline and at weeks 2,4,6,8,10 and 12. The PANSS consists of a Positive Scale (7 positive symptom constructs), a Negative Scale (7 negative symptom constructs) and a General Psychopathology Scale (16 symptom constructs). For each patient, the scale will be administered by the same trained rater. The PANSS provides a well standardised method of evaluating and monitoring psychotic symptoms. The rater is trained and recertified against an internationally recognised "gold standard".</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, week2, week4, week 6, week 8, week 10, week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): - Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): The MADRS will be performed at baseline, then at weeks 2,4,6,8,10 and 12. Many patients with schizophrenia have co-existing depression, hence monitoring of depression is important.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, week2, week4, week 6, week 8, week 10, week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery - MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB): The MATRICS test battery will be conducted at baseline and at study completion to quantify changes in cognitive functioning. This standardized battery assess the key separable cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and has a high test-retest reliability. The MATRICS comprises 7 Domains of which we will be assessing speed of processing, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning and reasoning and problem solving.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) - A neuropsychological test battery will be conducted at baseline and study completion to quantify changes in cognitive functioning. The RBANS comprises 12 subtests that are used to calculate five index scores (Immediate Memory; Visuospatial/Constructional; Language; Attention and Delayed Memory) and a total score. There are alternate forms to be used at each time point to avoid practice effects. The inclusion of the RBANS will allow direct comparisons in cognitive functioning with our other estrogen trials.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of Raloxifene 120mg in men with
      schizophrenia. This trial will adopt a 12 week randomised controlled model.

      Hypotheses 1: That the men receiving adjunctive selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM)
      will have a significantly greater reduction in psychosis symptoms over the course of the
      study than men receiving adjunctive placebo.

      Hypotheses 2: That the men receiving adjunctive SERM will have a significantly greater
      improvement in cognitive function than men receiving adjunctive placebo</summary>
