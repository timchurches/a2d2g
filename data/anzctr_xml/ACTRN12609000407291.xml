  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. This is an observational study comparing three new non-invasive cardiac output monitors.  None of these monitors can act as the reference technique as neither are gold standard cardiac output monitors.  However, the question is if they are interchangeable?  So a comparison study will be able to see if they meausre haemodynamic events in a similar way.

In a smaller subgroup of cardiac patients, thermodilution will act as the reference.  This control however will only be limited to cardiac surgery.

The observation period will start after induction of a general anaesthetic (GA) and be completed at the end of the anaesthetic.  Typically a case may last 2 to 4 hours.  Haemodynamic measurements will be taken at 10minutely intervals or at the same time as events.  In the cardiac subgroup, there will be a further observational period of up to 2 hours in intensive care unit (ICU) whilst the patient remains intubated and sedated.

2. The oesophageal monitor will involve the insertion of a oesophageal probe under GA.  It will allow continuous monitoring of cardiac ouput until it is removed before the end of the GA.  The arterial pressure derived cardiac ouput (APCO) device/s will measure the cardiac ouput using the signal from a standard arterial line.  Two APCO devices will be used; the Vigileo Flotrac by Edwards Lifesciences and the Lidco Rapid by Lidco.
The haemodynamic parameters generated by the monitors will be transcibed onto a spreadsheet as will clinical events such as administration of fluid, hypotension, use of vasoactive drugs, etc...</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accuracy of these cardiac output monitors.

This will be assessed in a number of ways.  
For static error, we will use bias and variation compared to thermodilution for each of the devices.  A standard representation method is Bland Altman analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intraoperative</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ability to track changes in cardiac output.
For dynamic error, we will use event analysis.  Here, we will use mean and variation for change of cardiac ouput for an event such as fluid administration.  We will subject the data to an appropriate test of statistical significance.  This will enable us to determine if there is a difference in the way these machines track event changes.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks how accurately some monitoring systems perform during major surgery.  One device looks at flow in a major artery and uses a probe inserted into the gullet under general anaesthesia.  The other device/s reads a signal from a standard line inserted into a small blood vessel in your arm to record the blood pressure.  The aim is to see whether these devices measure changes in blood flow accurately during surgery.  As these devices are relatively new, it is important to identify wihch monitor is most accurate in helping the anaesthetic doctor to make potentially important decisions.  It is an observational study and does not change your anaesthetic in a significant way.</summary>
