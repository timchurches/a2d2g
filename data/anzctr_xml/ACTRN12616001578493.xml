  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in this study have peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) inserted in the RBWH department of medical imaging. Consenting  patients (if appropriate) will have the type of PICC inserted randomised to either one of the following randomly assigned products

Arm 1: BioFlo polyurethane PICC with endexo technology
Arm 2 (Control): Cook polyurethane PICC

The randomly allocated PICC will be inserted using standard technique for insertion and will remain insitu until completion of therapy, or complication requiring removal. Patients will be followed until device removal, the maximum duration of follow up is 4 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2 (Control): Cook Polyurethane PICC is a PICC line with a soft polyurethane plastic for increased patient comfort whilst still offering the stability and strength of first generation polyurethane with the ability to power inject contrast at higher pressures</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PICC failure or complication: Composite measure of any reason for unplanned PICC removal or complication prior to the completion of therapy. This includes (i) central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI); (ii) local infection of skin; (iii)device occlusion; (iv)venous thrombosis; (v) PICC fracture or dislodgement. The primary outcome of device failure is an objective measure, assigned by clinical staff (not research staff or investigators). This is routine clinical practice. Research staff will collect the primary endpoint from the medical records with additional information obtained from the clinical staff/patients if required.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) were developed to provide short to medium term vascular access for patients requiring the infusion of vessel irritant medications, or frequent blood sampling. While PICCs provide necessary, reliable and accessible vascular access; they are associated with biological, mechanical or infectious complication. These complications result in delayed treatment, need for reinsertion, and delayed treatment of the underlying complication - causing extended admission time, increased healthcare costs, venous depletion and increased morbidity and mortality. Microbial biofilm formation makes treatment of infections more complicated since the detached microbial cells from the biofilm can repeatedly infect the blood, and these microorganisms are highly resistant to many antimicrobial agents, frequently requiring PICC removal and antibiotic treatment.

Maintaining catheter function is vital for the safe provision of treatment. BioFlo (trademark) PICC (by Angiondynamics; NY) claims to provide a novel solution and the manufacturers claim the material is resistant to blood products and biofilm development, reducing the risk of standard PICC complications including infection, fracture, thrombosis, leakage, localised swelling, accidental removal and dislodgement . These PICCs are now on the basis of some clinician preference at some Australian facilities. The effectiveness of this product at reducing PICC-associated complications as previously described has not been undertaken. 

We plan to undertake a randomized controlled trial at the RBWH. Patients who consent to participate in the trial will be randomly assigned to either study group. The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the feasibility of launching a full-scale efficacy trial, using pre-defined feasibility criteria for recruitment, retention and protocol fidelity. The secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of this new PICC technology compared to older generation PICC relating to failure and complication due to infection, occlusion, dislodgement, thrombosis, or breakage, for adults with PICC in acute care.</summary>
