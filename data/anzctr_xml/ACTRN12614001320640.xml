  <interventions>
    <interventions>A simple baseline controlled open trial methodology will be used to investigate the efficacy of the Strengths eHealth program, as well as the characteristics of participants and their usage of the program. The Strengths eHealth program is housed within the Federation eHealth Platform. People visiting the website, in response to advertisements or through self interest, will be informed of the availability of the Strengths eHealth program and invited to participate in the study.

The Strengths eHealth program consists of three sessions designed to help a person identify, develop and maximize the use of their personal strengths to enhance their health and wellbeing. The program uses evidence based positive psychology principles and established face-to-face protocols that were operationalised and transformed for self-administration via a fully automated website with automated feedback (when online) and reminder mechanisms via automated email (e.g., when to complete certain questionnaires, when a new module becomes available, reminders to log on if they have not done so for several days while undertaking the program modules, reminders to complete the questionnaires if they have not been completed after several days of notification). 

Participants will spend a week completing each session before moving onto the next session, so as to practise and to reinforce the session material learnt. Each session will last for approximately 15 minutes and its user friendly and interactive components are designed to keep the user engaged. To consolidate learning, participants will be given activities (approximately five minutes per day) to complete offline to practise the principles of identify and maximising strengths and asked to provide simple feedback on this practise at the next session.


Participants will be provided access to the Strengths eHealth program for the duration of the study (i.e., 15 weeks). </interventions>

Previous research has reported medium effects can be expected. Therefore, assuming a small to medium effect (i.e., f test = .35), significance set at 5% (p = .05), power at 80%, a sample of 27 will be required to demonstrate statistical significance. However allowing for a 30% attrition rate, we will be required to recruit a minimum of 39 participants.</statisticalmethods>

    <withdrawnreasonother>Given delays with getting the first digital platform ready to go 'live', a new program was written and uploaded during this 'delay wait time' and so this particular program was replaced with the more recent version. Therefore there was no longer a need to run a trial on this 'older' version and so the study never commenced.. </withdrawnreasonother>
