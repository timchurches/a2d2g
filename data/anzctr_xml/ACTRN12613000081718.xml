  <interventions>
    <interventions>A NZ$500 payment into the electricity account of the household of the participant, the payment made at the start of winter.  The participants will be given a brochure telling them how much electricity they could buy with the voucher, and be encouraged to use the electricity for additional winter heating. The period of expected behaviour change is the winter months, however we are also measuring during the summer months to gain a personal baseline.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac autonomic balance as assessed by measurements of the beat-to-beat changes in heart rate recorded over 24 hours.  This will be measured by a 24-hour Holter monitor fitted  during late winter and late summer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Changes between the late winter measurement and prior late summer measurement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Cardiovascular blood markers (Pro NT-BNP, for heart failure and severity of heart failure;  hsCRP, for inflammatory state; and hsTnT, a marker of cardiac necrosis)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Changes between the late winter reading and the prior late summer reading</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dwelling warmth, as measured by the installed dataloggers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Feburary/March (late summer) and July/August (late winter)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self reported well-being as measured by questionnaire asked during the fitting of the Holter monitor.  (The questionnaire will be based on those asked during previous studies)</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants are invited to participate and enroll.  After the first summer data collection is carried out, a statistican external to the study team will carry out the randomisation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The statistician will be given a list of study ID codes, (s)he will then assign a random number to each ID code.  The participants assigned the lowest 1/2 of the random numbers will be assigned to the early intervention group, and the others to the late intervention group.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Features of both 'parallel' and 'crossover'.  The "early" and "late" groups receive the same intervention, with the "late" group delayed by a year, however due to the possibility of the intervention changing later behaviour this is not a standard crossover design.  Neither is it a standard parallel design, as the two groups receive the same intervention </designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of Warm Hearts is to investigate the impact of variations in indoor temperatures on the cardiac functioning of older people with COPD.
Our hypothesis is that cold indoor temperatures impair cardiac functioning. This increase impairment will be associated with an increase in oxygen demand and blood pressure. In people with reduced cardiovascular reserve, these effects may increase the risk of caridac symptoms or heart attacks and progression of heart failure.
