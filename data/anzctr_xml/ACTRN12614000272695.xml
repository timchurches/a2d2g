  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1  Neurostimulation device (EMS 2000) - Lacrimal gland neurostimulation is self-administered nasally during waking hours.  The current provided is approximately 1 milliamp with the patient controlling the amplitude with a knob.  The recommended duration of treatment is approximately 30 seconds and the recommended treatment frequency is every two to four hours.  The duration of the intervention period is three months.  The allocated treatment will commence two days prior to LASIK and continue post-LASIK.

Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by questioning of participants by study staff with responses recorded on case report forms.

Arm 2  One drop of unpreserved artificial tears per eye to be self-administered during waking hours every two to four hours or as needed for a period of three months.  The allocated treatment will commence two days prior to LASIK and continue post-LASIK.

Patient reports of their use of artificial tears are recorded on case report forms to monitor adherence to the intervention.

    <statisticalmethods>Because this is a Phase 2 clinical study, no formal hypothesis testing will be performed.  Baseline and demographic characteristics will be presented.  Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics (sample size; mean; standard deviation; median; minimum and maximum).  Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.  Adverse events will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage of participants having any adverse event.  Any other information collected (such as severity or relationship to study device) will be listed as appropriate.  Any statistical tests performed to explore the data will be used only to highlight any interesting comparisons that may warrant further consideration.</statisticalmethods>
