  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is the most prevalent mental health disorder in New Zealand. Although many treatments are available
for approximately one third of patients these treatments will be ineffective and they will be classified as "treatment-resistant".
New research indicates that the approved medicine ketamine given at low doses can be used successfully as antidepressant in approximately two thirds of patients with treatment resistant depression. Moreover ketamines rapid antidepressant
actions, within several hours, make it remarkable compared to usual therapies. In addition to offering hope to patients, for scientists studying depression ketamine allows new
opportunities to study the disease. In this study we will give patients with treatment-resistant depression ketamine
to rapidly move them from a state of depression to nondepression. We will use brain imaging technologies and
blood biomarkers to attempt to understand what processes occur in these patients that underlie the transition to
elevated mood.</summary>
