  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The target population for the study is healthy women aged 16 years or older who have delivered a healthy term singleton infant. Since the study will follow participating mothers and their infants until the baby is 12 months old, continued participation requires that the infant does not contract or suffer from any serious on-going health problems. 
Postpartum women's new born infants will be included in the study if they are healthy. These infants can be a boy or girl, and are aged between 3 weeks and 12 months. </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>The main outcome measure is iodine excreted per day with three repeated measurement of spot urine samples, and this is the basis for the sample size calculation using means and SD from our preliminary data utilising G*Power 3.1 (Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf). The NZDep2013 index of deprivation ordinal scale ranges from 1 to 10, where 1 represents the areas with the least deprived scores and 10 the areas with the most deprived scores, which will be divided into 5 socioeconomic groups. The analysis is based on using 1way ANOVA with 5 socioeconomic groups (95% power, alpha = 0.05, two tailed). 180 participants will be required, using expected means for the groups of 100, 100, 100, 70 and 70 microgram/L (i.e. a maximum difference between groups of 30 microgram/L) and SD of 55 based on previous iodine study of breastfeeding women. We intend to over sample disadvantaged women as we expect more of these participants to drop out of the study.
Statistical analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20 . Baseline data will be described using mean (standard deviation), median (25, 75 percentile) or frequencies summary statistics. ANOVA will be used to analysis the continuous variables.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to investigate intake and status of micronutrients (iodine, selenium, and iron) and to explore effects on thyroid function and risk of postnatal depression in postpartum women and their infants, resident in the lower North Island of New Zealand. This follows two recent government initiatives - mandatory fortification of bread with iodised salt in September 2009; and the provision of an iodine supplement for all pregnant and lactating women from July 2011. The study aims are to analyse postpartum womens iodine, selenium, iron intake and status, measure whether multiple micronutrient deficiencies may adversely affect thyroid function; assess whether postpartum women remain iodine deficient despite the two recent government initiatives; investigate to what extent inadequate status of iodine, selenium and iron are associated with the risk of postnatal depression in participating women, which, subsequently, may adversely affect their infants development. Iodine is an important trace element for both postpartum women and their infants; iodine deficiency has been described as the single greatest cause of preventable mental impairment. Coexisting inadequacy of iodine, selenium, and iron status has been suggested to impair optimal thyroid function. It is important to investigate the intakes and status of iodine, selenium, and iron together, rather than investigating a single micronutrient in isolation. We will recruit 250 postpartum women (at least 3 weeks to 3 months postpartum) of a range of ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds, within the lower North island of New Zealand. Dietary assessment will be used to collect data about intake of selected micronutrients. Maternal health and child development through the first year of the life will be assessed by questionnaires. Biological samples (urine, breast milk and blood samples and nail clippings) will be collected to measure micronutrient status and thyroid function.</summary>
