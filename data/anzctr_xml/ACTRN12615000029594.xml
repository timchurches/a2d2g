    <studytitle>Smarter, Safer Homes for the Ageing and Disabled Person Pilot Study to investigate the feasibility, acceptance, usage and impact of providing a smart home platform with environmental sensors and mobile techniques to facilitate safe living of older and disabled Australians.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Smarter, Safer Homes for the Ageing and Disabled Person Pilot Study aims at assessing the viability of CSIRO's Smarter Safer Homes (SSH) platform to support both aged and young people with physical disability to live independently longer at home, to assist service providers' decision making for individualised care planning for timely intervention. </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>No specific intervention or treatment. All participant homes will have environmental sensors and medical devices installed for health, wellbeing and activity monitoring and a corresponding support tablet PC and application over a period of 12 months.

Participants are encouraged to do regular measurements of their body weight, blood pressure, body temperature, and blood glucose (only when necessary) at least once per week. They can do these measurements by themselves, or clinical/nursing staff from our trial collaborators can arrange weekly visits to help them do these measurements. All measurements will be automatically uploaded to our data server, with no requirements of participants' manually inputs.  

The system also provides a courtesy videoconference module that only intends to provide another way for participants to communicate with their family members, and/or healthcare providers.  We will not use this module to communicate with participants. However we do record number of usages of this videoconference module as an index of their activity level of social connectivity for their self-monitor purpose.

Environmental sensors are:
*Motion sensor  detects indoor movements
*Power sensor  detects power usages of electrical appliances
*Contact sensor  detects open/close of doors including front/back doors, fridge
*Temperature/humidity  detects changes in temperature or humidity in bathroom or kitchen
*Accelerometer  detect movements on beds, such as tossing and turning during sleep
Medical devices are:
*AND UA-321PBT scale  measures human body weight
*AND UA-767PBT  measures blood pressure
*Myglucohealth Glucometer  measures blood glucose level
*Tunstall Ear thermometer - measures body temperature
Information from sensors will be collected and made available to participants for a period of 12 months in an easy to understand format on iPads to provide an overview of their health, well-being and activity levels. Furthermore, data will be analysed to assess for correlations with episodes of illness and to determine a new way of scoring daily activity for health and wellbeing monitoring purposes.
A corresponding Internet portal application will be provided to their family, friend or relative assigned by the participant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the Smarter, Safer Homes project is to investigate the feasibility, acceptance, usage and impact of providing cutting edge technology into the homes of elderly people and providing a number of services informed by the technology to:
1.	A resident or aged/disabled person
2.	Their family
3.	Their health care providers

To this end we have created the SSH platform, which is made up of a collection of hardware (sensors, computers, iPad) and software (iPad app and portals) which will be provided to participants for a period of twelve months for the purpose of a pilot study of a series of Smart Homes.

The SSH platform is a web based monitoring and communication system which can a) collectively present health and well-being information of independently living aged/disabled people in a way useful to care providers; b) collectively present health and well-being information of independently living aged/disabled people in a way useful to interested adult children of the elderly person or family members of the disabled people, without compromising the privacy of the aged/disabled person; c) enhance and promote interactions by care providers and family members through the use of the video conferencing module.

The primary outcomes of the study are:
*  Independent living scales or Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (Mobility, Meal, Hygiene, Transfer, Dress) assessed through tools e.g. Katz index, Barthel Index
	
The secondary outcomes of the study are:
*  Develop methods to recognise and identify individual activity profile(s) in multi-resident homes through sensors, which will be assessed by comparing against routine activity data collected through wearable sensors (such as mobile phones) and simple daily routine questionnaires.</summary>
