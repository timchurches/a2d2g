  <interventions>
    <interventions>8-week (group of 4-6; 3 sessions per week, 1 hour per session), center-initiated home based functional task exercise program. For the first 4 weeks, center-based sessions will be scheduled twice weekly supported with once weekly home practice with caregiver, followed by once weekly center-based and twice weekly home practice session for 4 weeks. The intervention program will be conducted by occupational therapist. Physical parameters associated with balance, strength, flexibility, mobility will be incorporated to daily functional task. All exercise sessions will begin with a 5-10 minutes warm-up consisting of light stretching designed to increase flexibility, 30-40 minutes core exercise and end with a 5-10 minutes cool-down. The core exercise includes simulated functional task (table task of placing and collection with five levels and combined with chair rise exercise) will be used according to the training protocol and training guidelines.
Compliance/ Intervention Monitor:
Attendance for center-based sessions will be registered and home exercise log will be recorded by participants and followed up during each first supervised session in the week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group 1: Cognitive training group 
The control group will receive an existing center-based computer cognitive training program (group of 4-6; 60-minutes session; 2 times/week) with home exercise for a total of 8 weeks. All the participants will continue with their usual routine medical care. 
The group will be supervised by an occupational therapist using the program of RehaCom and CognitPlus for training of attention, memory, executive function, and visual perceptual function. The home program includes a 60-minutes cognitive training with a free online program Love your Brain.  Compliance will be monitored with a log book.

Control group 2: Exercise training group
The control group will receive an existing exercise training program supervised by an occupational therapist (60-minutes session, 2 times/week, with home exercise for a total of 8 weeks). All exercise sessions will begin with a 5-10 minutes warm-up consisting of light stretching designed to increase flexibility, 30-40 minutes moderate intensity aerobic exercise at 4-5/10 Rate of Perceived Exertion and end with a 5-10 minutes cool-down. All the participants will continue with their usual routine medical care. Home program includes at least one session/week  of 30 minutes brisk walking/ exercise bike at 4-5/10 Rate of Perceived Exertion. Compliance will be monitored with a log book. 

Control group 3: Wait-list control group
No active treatment. Participants in this group may choose to receive an existing available treatment after completion of the study (5 months after randomization).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of this study is to validate the early findings whether a combined cognitive and exercise programme is effective in improving the cognitive functions of older individuals with mild cognitive impairment. A further aim is to assess whether participation in a combined cognitive and exercise programme can reduce functional decline and increase quality of life in older individuals with mild cognitive impairment and their carers.</summary>
