  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention 1: 1 mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Anodal stimulation will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathode will be placed over the right orbit. Stimulation will be delivered for for 20-minutes using a Starstim/Neuroelectrics stimulator and will be administered with concurrent attentional bias modification training. Attentional bias modification is a computerised dot-probe task. It involves simultaneous presentation of positive and negative stimuli and repeated orientation of attention towards the positive stimuli via dot probe. 

All participants will complete two experimental sessions, one each of the following: 

- active tDCS + attentional bias modification training
- sham tDCS + attentional bias modification training

Sessions will be conducted a minimum of 72-hours apart and interventions will be administered by a single trained researcher. Session order will follow a pre-determined randomisation schedule. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention 2: identical to Intervention 1 but sham (i.e. no current) rather than active tDCS will be applied concurrent with attentional bias modification training.

Attentional bias assessment task: the attentional bias assessment task is a computerised dot-probe task. It follows the same format as the attentional bias modification in that it involves simultaneous presentation of positive and negative stimuli.  It differs in that the dot probes are are presented in a 50:50 positive: negative contingency and differences in reaction time to positive and negative stimuli are used to infer attentional bias. </outcome>

      <outcome>Pre versus post intervention EEG activity during completion of an emotive sternberg working memory task.

Emotive Sternberg Task: comprises blocks of positive, neutral and negative stimuli. Differences in accuracy and reaction times by valence and stimulation condition will be examined. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is investigating the capacity of tDCS to alter emotional processing bias. Emotional processing bias refers to the interaction of cognitive and emotional processing that result in unconscious preferential processing of emotional stimuli of a certain valence (e.g. unconscious preference for positive or negative stimuli and information). We all have unconscious biases in our emotional processing. A positive emotional processing bias has been linked to aspects of mental health and maladaptive biases are a key component of many mental illnesses, such as depression. Very few studies have investigated whether tDCS can alter emotional processing bias, and due to methodological limitations the findings of those small number that have are inconclusive. Also, no studies to date have investigated the patterns of brain activity associated with tDCS and bias modification.</summary>
