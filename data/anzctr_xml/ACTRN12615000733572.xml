  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Alert Program is a framework designed to support occupational therapist, teachers, parents and other professionals to teach children how to self-regulate by changing their arousal or levels of alertness using sensorimotor strategies. The primary focus is to help children learn to monitor, maintain, and change their levels of alertness so that it is appropriate to a situation or task. The program was initially designed for children aged eight to 12 however it can be adapted for preschool through high school, and for adults. It can be implemented in a variety of settings and the suggested activities can be adapted to meet the needs of the specific client group.

In this study, teachers from nine primary schools will deliver a curriculum version of the Alert Program that has been developed by adapting the commercial resources. Children attending schools in years 1 - 6 in Fitzroy Valley primary schools will by taught 8 Alert Program lessons by their teacher (with the support of the Aboriginal Islander Education Officer or Education Assistant if they have access to one in class). Each lesson will go for approximately 45 minutes to one hour. The curriculum will be delivered over eight weeks in one school term. Schools will make a decision to implement the curriculum (as they can do with any program) however parents will provide consent for their child to participate in data collection.

Teachers will be trained in the Alert Program concepts by attending two six hour training sessions delivered by researchers. The first training session will take place before the intervention commences in the classroom and the second training session between weeks three and four of the intervention. These sessions will include information about the research study, the Alert Program and familiarisation with the curriculum guide and resources provided to teachers. The training will include the viewing of five out of 18 of the original on-line Alert Program leader's training produced by Therapy Works Inc who are the program developers. 

All materials and resources required to implement the curriculum will be provided to participating schools. Self-report measures for teacher's adherence to the lesson plans have been included in the curriculum guide. At least 20% of the lessons will be audio recorded and viewed by researchers who will check the lesson delivery against a fidelity checklist.

In addition to the Alert Program lessons being taught in class, a parent workshop will be designed by researchers and delivered to interested family members to learn about the Alert Program concepts and activities they can do at home with their children (who are learning about the program at school).

The sessions will be approximately 90 minutes in duration and delivered at a time negotiated with the school community during the classroom intervention period. The sessions have been designed in consultation with an occupational therapist and the Alert Program trained research team member and community researcher.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is regular schooling. The control group will receive the intervention within this cluster randomised control trial (a stepped wedge like study design will be used).

Cluster one will receive the intervention in term two 2016.

The cluster two will act as a control to cluster one in term two 2016 and will receive the intervention in term three of 2016.
Cluster three will act as a control to cluster two in term three of 2016 then receive the intervention in term two 2017.
Cluster four will act as a control to cluster three in term two of 2017 and receive the intervention in term three of 2017.

There is no direct control group for cluster four. </comparator>

    <concealment>All schools within the Fitzroy Valley region of Western Australia have all agreed in principle to take part in this study. The computer randomisation of schools to clusters was undertaken by Data and Statistics Manager who was not involved in inclusion eligibility decisions. 

All eligible students at participating schools will be invited to enrol in the study with consent sought from their parent/caregiver.

As the clustering occurs at the school level with the entire school receiving the program it is not possible to conceal allocation from participants or researchers.

</concealment>
    <sequence>Each school will be assigned to a cluster using geographical proximity and school enrolment numbers. he timing for each cluster to receive the Alert Program or act as a control will be randomised by computer generated sequence. One cluster will not be randomised because of local considerations. This cluster will receive the intervention last (term three, 2017).</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Cluster randomised control trial. This is a variation of the stepped wedge design. There are four geographically stratified clusters. At each time step a new randomly selected cluster is selected to receive the program with an associated control cluster. Clusters which act as controls then receive treatment in the next time step. The final time step has only one treatment group with no control. Testing will occure before and after each time step for each involved cluster with additional follow-up testing undertaken for each treatment cluster.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>For quantitative measures the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach will be used as is seems most appropriate for this modified stepped wedge design, can provide weighting for unequal cluster sizes and can estimate effects for other independent variables.

Qualitative data collected via the structured interviews will be analysed using an iterative framework. This framework involves collecting information via interviews or observation, transcribing the collected information and finally reflecting upon the data to determine emergent themes. In this study the researcher will digitally record interviews, which will be transcribed verbatim and then analysed.

Original power calculations were based on a full stepped wedge study design and required 261 children assuming a 10% loss for an RCT with an effect of 30%. As this design has been altered additional power calculations will need to be undertaken by statistical experts. However, all schools within the geographical area have been invited to take part.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In 2008 local leaders in Fitzroy Valley identified prevention, diagnosis and management of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and early life trauma (ELT) as a community priority. This led to the development of the Marulu Strategy which aims to address FASD prevention, diagnosis and therapy. Following the results of a prevalence study, Aboriginal community leaders also identified an urgent need for a system-wide and sustainable response to high rates of FASD and neurodevelopmental impairment. 
This study will investigate the effectiveness of the Alert Program (registered trademark) at improving primary school aged childrens measures of self-regulation and executive function in the Fitzroy Valley region including those children with FASD. 
This study will introduce the Alert Program (registered trademark) to families and community members, into school programs and child health practices in the Fitzroy Valley. The project will document a sustainable and culturally appropriate method of implementing the program through the trial site schools. It is anticipated an approach to screening and therapy for impairments in self-regulation and executive functioning will be translated into other health and educational sites.
Teacher and school support staff will deliver ten Alert Program (registered trademark) lessons in their classrooms over eight weeks using a curriculum and resources provided by the study team. These materials have been developed by adapting existing Alert Program (registered trademark) activities and resources to suit the Kimberley classroom environment. Three workshops will be developed for parents and caregivers so they too can learn about Alert Program(registered trademark) and implement the concepts, activities and vocabulary of the program at home. 
Furthermore, this study will contribute to an emerging evidence-base of a multidisciplinary and collaborative model for children in remote and regional areas with FASD, and the development of a sustainable model of health care in the remote Kimberley region. It is also hoped this research will lead to improving the efficiency of health service delivery through utilising telehealth.
