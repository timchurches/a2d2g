      <outcome>Percentage of Participants in Clinical Remission at Both Weeks 28 and 52 of the 52-week Treatment Period Among Those Participants Who Were in Clinical Remission at Baseline - Clinical remission is defined as a CDAI score &lt;150 points. Among participants in remission at baseline, the percentage of participants with clinical remission at both Weeks 28 and 52 of the treatment period using the no effect imputation for missing data were to be compared between each GSK1605786A dose group and placebo using Fisher's exact test. Participants with missing CDAI scores were to be considered not to be in remission according to the missing=no effect imputation. The limited data resulting from early termination of Study CCX114157 did not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of GSK1605786A in the maintenance of clinical remission in participants with Crohn's disease.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in CDAI Score at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52 - The CDAI score is used to quantify the symptoms of participants with Crohn's Disease. A score of 150 or below indicates remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease. A decrease in CDAI over time indicates improvement in disease activity. CDAI scores and changes in CDAI scores during the 52-week treatment period were to be summarized by treatment group at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52. The limited data resulting from early termination of Study CCX114157 did not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of GSK1605786A in the maintenance of clinical remission in participants with Crohn's disease. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at the time of assessment.</outcome>

The response to each question can range from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating severe problem and 7 indicating normal health. The total IBDQ is computed as the sum of the responses to the individual IBDQ questions. The total score can range between 32 to 224 with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. The limited data resulting from early termination of Study CCX114157 did not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of GSK1605786A in the maintenance of clinical remission in participants with Crohn's disease.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity &amp; Activity Impairment - Crohn's Disease (WPAI-CD) at Weeks 28 and 52 - WPAI measures the effect of your CD on your ability to work and perform regular activities. 6-items assess impairment in work productivity and daily activity during the 7 days before the assessment. It measures the percentage of overall impairment in work productivity and daily activity due to CD. A WPAI score of 0% = no impairment and a score of 100% = total loss of work productivity or activity.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      two doses (500 mg once daily and 500 mg twice daily) of GSK1605786A in maintaining remission
      over 52 weeks in adult subjects with Crohn's disease. Efficacy will be assessed by the
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score. Eligible subjects will have achieved response
      (CDAI decrease of at least 100 points) and/or remission (CDAI less than 150) in a prior GSK
      sponsored induction study. The primary endpoint will be proportion of subjects in remission
      at both Weeks 28 and 52. Safety will be assessed by recording of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory parameters including liver function tests, vital signs and electrocardiogram.
      Population pharmacokinetics will evaluate the two doses of GSK1605786A. Health outcomes
      assessments will include changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), SF-36v2,
      EQ-5D, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment - Crohn's Disease (WPAI-CD) and disability.</summary>
