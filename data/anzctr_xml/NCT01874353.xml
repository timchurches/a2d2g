Treatment: drugs: Olaparib 300mg tablets
300mg Olaparib or placebo tablets taken orally twice daily until objective radiological disease progression as per RECIST as assessed by the investigator (or as long as in the investigator's opinion they are benefiting from treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation criteria). Dose reduction to 250mg and subsequently 200mg is permitted following confirmation of toxicity.
