  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate the effects of vasopressor therapy on cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, in the beach chair position during shoulder surgery. Following interscalene brachial plexus anaesthesia with 20-20 ml ropivicaine 0.75%, general anaesthesia will be induced with propofol 50-200mg and maintained on sevoflurane 2-3%. Phenylephrine infusion 0.15 - 0.5 microgram/kg/min titrated to increase mean arterial pressure by 20 % versus saline infusion. Infusion is maintained whilst patient placed into beachchair position for surgery. The duration of intervention is 1 hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>In control patients saline will be infused  at the same rate as the phenylephrine infusion, and for the same duration. Infusions will be unmarked and contents unknown to the observer making measurements.</comparator>

      <outcome>Fluid and vasopressor requirements. The extra volume of crystalloid and/or colloid, and total additional phenylephrine bolus dose and/or atropine bolus dose required to treat refractory hypotension and bradycardia.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During shoulder surgery patients are commonly positioned into an upright sitting position for optimal access to the shoulder joint.

In some patients blood pressure may decrease and a concern of the anaesthetist is whether sufficient blood reaches the brain during such surgery. Even though this can be routinely treated with cardiac drugs, the exact effect of this treatment on the brain is unknown. 

This study plans to investigate the changes in cardiac function and flow to the brain when patients are anaesthetised and placed upright. The surgery will be performed using the anaesthetic technique that we use for the majority of the surgeons cases. The patient will receive a nerve block that will anaesthetise the arm receiving surgery. This will be combined with  a general anaesthetic. 

Special monitoring of the heart and blood flow using sound waves, and brain function using reflected light waves will be used. These techniques are both non-invasive and present no harm to the patient. The study will investigate whether the administration of medication to gently increase blood pressure has an effect on hypotension and blood flow to the brain. In addition postoperative cognitive recovery will be assessed via a questionaire.

By agreeing to the study patients will give us permission to make these extra measurements during anaesthesia, in order to understand whether we are protecting the brain during surgery.</summary>
