             (stage IIIC to IV per American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC])

          -  Documented evidence of BRAF V600 mutation.

          -  Newly obtained tumor biopsy at baseline, and patient agrees to a mandatory biopsy at
             the time of progression, if not medically contraindicated.

             metastases that are asymptomatic in the absence of corticosteroid therapy or on a

             stable at least 4 weeks with verification by imaging (e.g. brain MRI completed at
