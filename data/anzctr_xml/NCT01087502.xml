  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HbA1c Change From Baseline to Week 12 - HbA1c is measured as a percentage. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 12 HbA1c percent minus the baseline HbA1c percent. Means are treatment adjusted for baseline HbA1c, renal function impairment and prior use of antidiabetic agents.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HbA1c Change From Baseline Over Time - HbA1c is measured as a percentage. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the HbA1c percent over time minus the baseline HbA1c percent. This outcome measure only provides descriptive statistics without any modelling.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16, week 20, week 24, week 28, week 34, week 40, week 46, week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Change From Baseline to Week 12 - This change from baseline reflects the Week 12 FPG minus the baseline FPG. Means are treatment-adjusted for baseline HbA1c, baseline FPG and prior use of insulin, week repeated within patient and week by treatment interaction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and week 12</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With HbA1c &lt;7.0% - The percentage of patients with an HbA1c value below 7% at week 12 and week 52 were calculated for each treatment arm. If a patient did not have an HbA1c value at week 12 or 52 respectively, they were considered a failure, so HbA1c above 7%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, week 12 and week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With HbA1c &lt;6.5% - The percentage of patients with an HbA1c value below 6.5% at week 12 and week 52 was calculated for each treatment arm. If a patient did not have an HbA1c value at week 12 or 52 respectively they were considered a failure, so HbA1c above 6.5%.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients Who Have a HbA1c Lowering by at Least 0.5% - The percentage of patients with an HbA1c reduction of =0.5% at week 12 and week 52 from baseline was calculated for each treatment arm. If a patient did not have an HbA1c value at week 12 or 52 respectively they were considered a failure, so HbA1c reduction less than 0.5%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, week 12 and week 52</timepoint>

      <outcome>Plasma Concentration of Linagliptin at Trough - Trough levels of concentration of Linagliptin in plasma.</outcome>

    <summary>The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      linagliptin (5 mg / once daily) compared to placebo given over 12 weeks in drug naive or
      previously treated type 2 diabetic patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and
      insufficient glycaemic control. In addition safety in this patient population with longer
      term (40 week) treatment in comparison to sulfonylurea drug (glimepiride).</summary>
