  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One third of patients affected by severe trauma die from uncontrolled bleeding. Many of these patients are found to have abnormalities of the clotting system collectively known as acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). The two most important abnormalities in ATC are a low fibrinogen and increased clot breakdown. It has been hypothesised, and there are some non-randomised studies that show that treatment with fibrinogen therapy in trauma patients who are bleeding can stop bleeding more effectively than standard care, reduce transfusion needs and may reduce death rates.
This study will look at the effects of infusing fibrinogen concentrate (FgC, a concentrated source of fibrinogen) to adult trauma patients as early as possible (within 45 minutes of admission to hospital). It has been shown in a large trauma randomised controlled trial that treatment for bleeding has better outcomes if delivered to patients quickly. This study will evaluate whether it is possible to enrol patients, deliver and infuse drug within 45 minutes and will also look at laboratory and clinical outcome measures.
