  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: Incidence of Adverse Events through 52 week follow-up - Safety will be assessed by incidence and evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure through the 52-week evaluation of bilateral treatment. Included in this assessment will be the proportion of subjects with any of the following outcomes: (1) death, or (2) medical morbidity, including but not limited to renal artery aneurysm, stenosis, significant deterioration of renal function, fistulae or ureteral stenosis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One Year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decrease in Blood Pressure - Clinical utility will be evaluated by assessing pre and post therapy systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 and 24 weeks post therapy</timepoint>

          -  Subject has active pyelonephritis or a history of pyelonephritis which in the
             discretion of the investigator may interfere with treatment.

          -  Subject has a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or
             cerebrovascular accident within the last six months.

          -  Subject has hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease.

          -  Subject has an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, pacemaker, neurostimulator or
             other device incompatible with MRI.

          -  Subject has a body weight &gt; 150 kilograms.

          -  Subject has a target treatment depth &gt; 14 cm.

          -  Subject is pregnant, nursing or intends to become pregnant during the trial period.

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in other potentially confounding research.

          -  Subject has any condition that, at the discretion of the investigator, would preclude
             participation in the trial.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a prospective, multi-center trial wherein each included subject will receive
      the experimental externally focused ultrasound renal denervation therapy. It will be
      conducted on a maximum of fifty patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and
      have signed the informed consent form. Safety is the primary endpoint of this study and will
      be assessed by incidence and evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the
      investigational procedure through the 52-week evaluation. Clinical utility is the secondary
      endpoint of this study and will be evaluated by assessing pre and post therapy systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure.</summary>
