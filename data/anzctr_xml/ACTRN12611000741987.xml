  <interventions>
    <interventions>A clinician performed ultrasound (CPU) by qualified neonatal medical staff will assess ductal size and haemodynamic significance. This will be documented utilising the standard measures of flow pattern, diastolic flow in the descending aorta, left atrium / aortic ratio (LA/AO), left pulmonary artery diastolic velocity (LPAD), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular output (LVO).
If not routinely collected in the previous week, a blood sample of 0.5ml will then be collected for elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, plus conjugated SBR levels, to detect any abnormal liver function prior to commencement of study medication. 
After randomisation, the study group will receive paracetamol as per Neofax guidelines with an oral loading dose of 25mg/kg/dose, followed by a maintenance dose of 15mg/kg/dose. The maintenance dosing interval will be 8 hourly in preterm infants more than or equal to 32 weeks postmenstrual age, 12 hourly in preterm less than 32 weeks postmenstrual age, and 6 hourly in term infants. The total duration of treatment will be 5 days in all groups.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At randomisation, 50% of the infants will be allocated to the active treatment of oral paracetamol, while the other 50% will have the placebo medication: the oral sucrose solution used in our unit for pain relief. Allocation concealment will be achieved by the use of a random number table that is only available to the clinical trials pharmacist who will allocate the treatment group independent of clinical staff who will see only a trial number. Clinicians enroling participants will not be involved with allocation to a treatment group.
Treatment allocation will be blinded to nursing staff administering the dose, the medical staff performing the diagnostic clinician performed ultrasound (CPU) and the senior clinician reviewing the CPU results. Pathology staff will also be blinded to treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Babies in each group will be randomised to either paracetamol or placebo group using a random number table with a variable block size. Stratification will be into two groups: that of gestation less than 29 weeks and that of gestation 29 to less than 33 weeks.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: In term infants functional closure of the PDA usually occurs in the first 72 hours, but may take longer in
preterm infants. The primary rationale for treatment of the duct is that the left to right shunt across the PDA can cause
deleterious systemic and pulmonary haemodynamic effects. This potentially leads to excessive pulmonary blood
flow that may result in pulmonary haemorrhage or a need for increased respiratory support (oxygen and/or positive
pressure) and systemic circulatory compromise causing abnormal organ function and tissue injury.
The need to treat a PDA at a later stage when acute complications are less likely is currently controversial. Though
the data on the outcome of preterm infants with persistent ductus arteriosus have been scarce, there has been a
study addressing this issue which reports eightfold increase in mortality of VLBW neonates with persistent PDA.
A recent abstract publication described a case series of 5 infants who appeared to have spontaneous late PDA
closure following the use of paracetamol for unrelated indications. Paracetamol is a commonly used medication in
infants with a relatively benign side effect profile, so if found to be efficacious, could provide a useful alternative for
treatment of PDA.
Aim: 1.To study the effect of paracetamol given orally in closure of late PDA in premature neonates; 2. Examine the
safety and efficacy profile of paracetamol.
Study design: a prospective randomised, blinded, placebo controlled trial.
Population: Preterm infants born &lt;33 weeks gestational age with a persistent PDA who are &gt;4 weeks of postnatal
age and tolerating at least 50% enteral feeds.
Method: A clinician performed ultrasound (CPU) by qualified neonatal medical staff will assess ductal size and
haemodynamic significance at 4 weeks of age.
Any abnormal liver function will be excluded prior to commencement of study medication using routine blood tests.
After randomisation, the study group will receive paracetamol as per Australian guidelines for neonates(25mg/kg
loading dose, followed by maintenance dose of 15mg/kg at an interval appropriate for gestational age. The placebo
group will receive the same volume of oral placebo solution, most likely sucrose. The study medication course will
be for 5 days.
A CPU by a clinician blinded to study medication allocation will be performed after 48 hours of medication
administration and again after 5 days to document ductal patency and haemodynamic significance.
0.5ml of blood will be collected in a lithium heparin tube for repeat liver function tests and paracetamol serum levels
48 hours after commencement of study medication and again at completion of study medication on day 5. Some of
these tests may overlap with required routine blood tests and therefore may not be extra.
The primary outcome will be succesful closure of PDA as documented on clinician performed ultrasound.</summary>
