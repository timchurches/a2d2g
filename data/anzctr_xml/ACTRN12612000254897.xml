  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist of a treatment course principally consisting of telephone administered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Specifically it will start with a face-to-face session of 50 minutes duration at the outpatient clinic or the patient's home followed by eight scheduled weekly telephone calls of up to 30 minutes in length. The interventions include behavioural strategies such as behavioural activation, activity scheduling, relaxation training, exposure hierarchies and social skills training, as well as cognitive strategies, such as cognitive restructuring, structured problem solving and behavioural experiments. The therapist administering the telephone calls will be a registered or provisionally registered psychologist who is experienced in the delivery of telephone CBT and has knowledge of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) education. The therapist will receive supervision by one of the Associate Researchers on the project who is a Clinical Psychologist with the relevant endorsement as a supervisor. Telephone sessions with be audio recorded to facilitate supervision.
Participants will undertake assessments at screening, baseline, and two follow-up assessments (one at nine weeks and 17 weeks post commencement of intervention). Assessments will consist of administration of questionnaires. The intervention will be administered in addition to the usual care received by the participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control group will be provided with usual care plus a course consisting of one face-to-face session of 50 minutes duration either at the outpatient clinic or in the patient's home followed by eight scheduled weekly telephone calls of up to 30 minutes duration providing general psychosocial support. The usual care means that the participants remain under the management of their respiratory physician or the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Clinic and they will continue to receive mediacations and any other treatments as determined by their health care provider. Participants will undertake assessments at screening, baseline, and two follow-up assessments (one at nine weeks and 17 weeks post commencement of placebo). Assessments will consist of administration of questionnaires.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effect of telephone-administered CBT on outcomes for clients with diagnosed COPD who are assessed as having at least mild to moderate levels of depression and/or anxiety.
It is expected that COPD patients completing telephone CBT in addition to usual pulmonary rehabilitation will have greater reductions in depression and/or anxiety scores than patients receiving usual pulmonary rehabilitation care and placebo phone contact.</summary>
