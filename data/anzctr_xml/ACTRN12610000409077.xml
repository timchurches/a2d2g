  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prednisolone 4-10mg/day orally for 7-10 days. We will be comparing participants with inflammatory rheumatologic disease who are on prednisolone as usual treatment with those who are not on prednisolone as usual treatment. Participants who are not on prednisolone as usual treatment will undergo a series of investigations and then take a short course of prednisolone. The prednisolone dose will be the mean dose of those who are usually on prednisolone (this group will be studied first). The course of prednisolone will be between 7-10 days, with this period being determined by the timing of repeat investigations. Participants who are on prednisolone as usual treatment will be tested once. Participants who are not on prednisolone as usual treatment will be followed up after 7-10 days for repeat investigations.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2 - Usual treatment  including oral prednisolone (4-10mg/day) with no intervention.
Group 1 - Usual treatment does not include prednisolone. These patients will have baseline studies as a control group and then studies after 7-10 days of treatment with oral prednisolone (mean dose of Group 2) to assess the acute effects of low dose prednisolone. The period of 7-10 days will vary depending on availability for investigation bookings. 
Baseline studies and those repeated after 7-10 days will be the same. These studies include a deuterated glucose infusion, hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, indirect calorimetry, intravenous glucose tolerance test, assessment of endothelial function, arterial stiffness and baroreceptor sensitivity, as well as a computed tomography (CT) scan abdomen (2 slice) and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry(DXA) scan.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>Group 1 - investigations will be performed at baseline and immediately after 7-10 days of treatment with oral prednisolone. 
Group 2 - investigations will be performed once. 
Secondary outcome (as above) will be based on results obtained from the investigations.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to assess:
* How low dose steroids affect insulin secretion and sensitivity
* Whether low dose steroids increase the risk of heart disease
We hope that this information will increase understanding of the risk of diabetes conferred by low dose steroids and how best to treat it.
We will be studying participants with inflammatory joint disease. One group of participants will usually take prednisolone (a steroid tablet) for their joint disease. They will be studied once. The other group of participants will not usually be treated with prednisolone for their joint disease. This group of participants will be studied, and then they will be asked to take low dose prednisolone for 7-10 days before being studied again.
On the first study day we will assess how sensitive the body is to insulin with an insulin clamp study. On the second day we will assess the risk of heart disease, how much insulin the body is making and body composition.</summary>
