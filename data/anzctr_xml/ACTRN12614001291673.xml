  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Problem Management Plus. Arm 2: Enhanced Treatment as Usual. Therapy is administered once-weekly over 5 weeks on an individual 90 minute basis. Problem Management Plus includes skills in identifying emotional and practical problems that can be managed and strategies to reduce and cope with these problems. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after immediate post-trial follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 1.5 months. Therapy is provided by local health workers.</interventions>
    <comparator>Enhanced Treatment as Usual comprises normal treatment provided by local primary care providers (usually nurses) who have received training in supportive counseling and psychological first aid. Treatment as Usual involves non-directive counselling about daily problems reported by participants, as well as provision of basic education about common psychological problems. Attendance at sessions will be monitored via session attendance records. Adherence to strategies will be monitored by checklists of strategies employed. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after immediate post-trial follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 1.5 months. </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be adult females who will be included through community screening by independent assessors in the catchment area of volunteer Community Health Workers. Participants will be enrolled when indicating moderate distress &amp; impaired functioning. Participants wishing to participate will be randomly allocated according to a random numbers system administered by an individual unit. </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomized by an independent research assistant, not involved in the assessments. There is no stratification in this pilot trial. Randomisation will occur by a randomization table created by a computerized sequence.</sequence>

Power calculations indicated a minimum sample of 133 per group (power = 0.95, alpha = 0.05. two-sided). On basis of 30% attrition, it estimated that 346 participants (173 per group) is needed.</statisticalmethods>
