  <interventions>
    <interventions>The following end-points will be evaluated in this study: Time to progression from primary diagnosis (TTP). Progression-free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS). This project is a multi-centre, prospective cohort study that will aim to enrol 800 patients at participating sites. It involves collection of data into the PURPLE registry, linkage and analysis of data via a WEHI developed database. Comprehensive clinicopathological data will be collected, start and stop dates for all systemic therapies will be captured as well as treatment response data for each therapy used, the reason for any change in treatment, and the date of disease progression. Data related to any resection of primary and or metastatic disease will be collected.

    <statisticalmethods>It is anticipated that a sample size of 800 is sufficient to achieve the aim of this study, and to achieve preliminary insights into variation in practice and outcomes across sites. In order to compare clinical outcomes across different subgroups, Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be defined from survival data and constructed using SAS (registered trademark) software. The stratified log rank test will be used to compare survival curves between different groups of participants. P-values of 0.05 will be considered significant. Due to the non-randomised nature of such comparisons propensity score techniques will be used to balance comparison groups according to baseline factors.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is non-interventional registry of the treatment and outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer managed at hospitals enrolled to participate in Australia.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (with or without metastatic disease) , with any ECOG performance status and are yet to receive treatment.

Study details
This registry will capture data on presentation and the disease course of pancreatic cancer, surgical interventions for primary and metastatic disease, prescription of systemic therapies, and information regarding multi-disciplinary management and outcomes of this disease in the routine clinical practice setting. This project will collect clinical data using the already established data collection and analysis resources built up over the last 15 years in the Systems Biology &amp; Personalised Medicine Division of the Walter &amp; Eliza Hall Institute of medical research (WEHI). This protocol aims to enrol at least 800 eligible patients over 10 years.
Findings from analyses that occur as part of this project are anticipated to improve our understanding of the presentation, clinical course and management of pancreatic cancer in Australia and other participating countries.</summary>
