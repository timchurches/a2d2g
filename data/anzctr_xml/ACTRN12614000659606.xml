  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants receive 10 weeks access to the Cool Little Kids Online website program. The program aims to help parents of shy young children who at risk of developing anxiety problems. The program has 8 interactive online modules containing a mix of written information, videos, audio narration, activities and parent experiential stories. The modules contain the same content as in the Cool Little Kids parenting group program developed by Rapee and colleagues. Modules take about 30 to 60 minutes to complete. Parents are advised to work at an ideal pace of one module per week, although they can choose to work at whichever pace suits them best. Just like the group parenting program, Cool Little Kids Online sets parents home practice tasks to work on with their child between modules. To encourage program adherence, participants receive emails upon completion of each module, half-way through the program, and after 2 weeks of not logging in to the program. 

Two versions of the program are being evaluated: one is self-guided, and the other is guided by a clinician. Participants allocated to the clinician arm will receive up to 2 support phone calls during the study, one after module 2 (or week 3) and one after module 5 (or week 6).

    <concealment>Participants will complete an online screening questionnaire to see if they are eligible to participate. This online screening questionnaire is automatically scored, and those who are ineligible will be automatically informed and will exit the survey. Those who are eligible will be invited to participate after reading more about the study, and will give their informed consent online. They will then be asked to complete the rest of the baseline questionnaire online. Once they have completed the questionnaire they will be automatically redirected to the registration page of the Cool Little Kids Online website, where they can register for the program and immediately gain access to it.  

Randomisation to group occurs at the end of the baseline questionnaire, and is calculated automatically using a computer script.
