  <interventions>
    <interventions>Angiography is the x-ray imaging of blood vessels using a substance injected into the blood stream showing the blood vessels in the heart. Late venous phase coronary angiography includes using a longer (3-5seconds) fluoroscopy sequence after contrast media injection performed by the cardiologist. Angiography would take less than an hour (typically 30-45 minutes) and this trial will only add 3 to 5 seconds more.

This scan takes place immediately following injection of contrast media.
A catheter is inserted into the forearm and is then threaded up through to the major coronary artery by the cardiologist. The contrast media is then administered through this catheter immediately prior to the x-ray image being taken</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We are assessing the effectiveness of venous phase coronary angiography coronary sinus imaging to successfully provide satisfactory imaging of the coronary sinus and its tributaries for cardiac interventions such as left ventricular lead placement in cardiac resynchronisation therapy/biventricular pacing. 

Satisfactory imaging is defined as successfully being able to visualise the coronary sinus for placement of left ventricular lead placement. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research team aims to investigate the use of venous phase coronary angiography to visualise the coronary sinus and tributary vessels in patients who are having a standard coronary angiogram and that are not having CRT implantation. We hypothesise that this imaging will enhance knowledge of CS anatomy and pathology; and that this knowledge will assist both this specific patient population (if needing CRT in the future), and other
general populations from a greater understanding and better planning of CRT lead placements.

We seek to prove that venous phase coronary angiography CS imaging is able to successfully provide satisfactory imaging of the coronary sinus and its tributaries for cardiac interventions such as left ventricular lead placement in cardiac resynchronisation therapy/biventricular pacing.
We also seek to determine relationships between factors (ie. age, gender etc.) and the
anatomy/visualisation of coronary sinus and its tributaries.</summary>
