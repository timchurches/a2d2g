  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo 18FGE-180-Positron Emission Tomography scan at the Herston Imaging Research Facility (HIRF) at Time Point 1 (within 7 days of clinically diagnosed Grade II-IV GI-GVHD) and Time Point 2 (7-14 days following the initial scan based on participant and scanner availability). 

During the scanning session participants will be required to be present at HIRF for approximately 1.5 hours.  
Participants will be required to have 18FGE-180 administered intravenously and wait 60 minutes to allow the tracer to be distributed throughout the body.  After 60 minutes the participant will be moved to the PET/MRI scanner and the scan time will be 30 minutes. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>A Gut biopsy is part of the standard of care clinical management of patients diagnosed with GVHD at the RBWH.  The gut biopsy will occur prior to project consent and enrolment as part of GVHD diagnostic procedures.  Participants who consent to the project will have their Gut Biopsy results compared to the PET/MRI as part of the project analysis.  </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether 18FGE-180-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans can predict response to steroid treatment for acute gastrointestinal graft versus host disease (GI-GVHD) following haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) for a haematological cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enrol in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been referred for diagnostic endoscopy within the previous 7 days for suspected GI-GVHD following HPCT in the previous 100 days for a haematological cancer.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will receive standard treatment for their condition. In addition, they will all receive two 18FGE-180-PET scans at enrolment (within 7 days of referral for endoscopy) and another scan 7-14 days after the first. The scans will last approximately 30 minutes and will involve receiving an intravenous injection of 18FGE-180 waiting 60 minutes and then proceeding to have a PET/MRI of 30 minutes duration. Researchers will compare the results of these scans to results of the endoscopy procedure by reviewing each patient's medical records.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether 18FGE-180-PET may be useful for predicting response to steroid treatment in these patients</summary>
