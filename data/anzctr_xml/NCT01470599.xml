    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adjudicated Potential Cardiovascular Events - Pre-specified cardiovascular events were adjudicated by committees of external experts who were blinded to treatment assignment. Potential events of interest (pEoI) were identified by the investigator, sponsor, review of alerts from central electrocardiogram assessments, and by search of adverse events (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE) listings for events coded to death (coronary and non-coronary), myocardial infarction (non-fatal), all coronary revascularization, unstable angina, stroke (fatal and non-fatal), transient ischemic attack, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial vascular disease, dyspnoea, and chest pain. The independent reviewers (IRs) determined if the pEoI met the criteria for EoI classification according to the definitions summarized from the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium 'Standardized Definitions for End Point Events in Cardiovascular Trials' published October 2010.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adjudicated Malignancy Events - Pre-specified malignancy events were adjudicated by committees of external experts who were blinded to treatment assignment. pEoI were identified by the investigator, sponsor, potential primary event notifications (i.e. malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) for a specific protocol, events submitted for histopathology review for potential malignancies which met the criteria for potential malignancies, and by search of AE/SAE listings for events coded to Malignant tumors Standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (SMQ) (20000194). IRs determined if the pEoI met the criteria for EoI classification according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, a ten-digit multi-axial classification of the site (4 characters), morphology (4 digits), behavior (1 digit), and grading (1 digit) of neoplasms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to Week 52</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adjudicated Hepatic Injury Events - Pre-specified liver injury events were adjudicated by blinded committees of external experts. pEoI were identified by investigator, sponsor &amp; search of clinical, safety &amp; laboratory databases (potential Hy's law event, ALT/AST =5 x ULN, events meeting hepatic discontinuation criteria, SAEs coded to MedDRA hepatobiliary system organ class (SOC), AEs/SAEs coded to MedDRA liver infections or infectious biliary disorders SMQ, AEs coded to MedDRA drug-induced liver injury (DILI) preferred term or any death with ALT or AST =3xULN, bilirubin =2xULN or jaundice). IRs determined if the pEoI met the criteria for EoI classification by assessing DILI (definite, highly likely, probable, possible, unlikely, unrelated or undetermined), pattern (hepatocellular, mixed, cholestatic or undetermined), likely, competing or alternative cause(s), severity (mild, moderate, severe, fatal/transplantation or undetermined), Hy's law case, recovery &amp; liver failure (all yes, no or undetermined).</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adjudicated Opportunistic Infection Events - Pre-specified opportunistic infection events were adjudicated by blinded committees of external experts. pEoI were identified by investigator, sponsor &amp; search of SAE listings for serious infections coded to MedDRA infections &amp; infestations SOC &amp;/or events meeting pre-specified criteria for IR pre-screening to determine if adjudication is required. IRs determined if the pEoI met the criteria for EoI classification according to definitions for opportunistic infections (invasive fungal infections per the European Organization for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group &amp; the National Institute of Allergy &amp; Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group [EORTC/MSG] Consensus Group definitions, endemic fungal infections per the EORTC/MSG Consensus Group definitions, other fungal infections, viral, bacterial &amp; parasitic infections &amp; vaccine dissemination) &amp; special interest infections (actinomycosis, Legionella &amp; mononucleosis-like toxoplasmosis).</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adjudicated Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforation Events - Pre-specified GI perforation events were adjudicated by committees of external experts who were blinded to treatment assignment. The pEoI were identified via search of AE/SAE listings using the MedDRA GI Perforation SMQ. The IRs determined if the pEoI met the criteria for EoI classification based on whether a GI perforation occurred and if yes, the location within the GI tract, possible contributing medical conditions and/or concomitant medications.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to Week 52</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adjudicated Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Events - Pre-specified ILD events were adjudicated by committees of external experts who were blinded to treatment assignment. pEoI were identified by searches of the clinical, safety &amp; laboratory databases (AEs coded to the MedDRA ILD SMQ and events nominated by the study clinician or clinical lead). The IRs determined if the pEoI met the criteria for EoI classification by assessment of the ILD event (probably ILD, possible ILD, alternative diagnosis likely, other or insufficient information to classify).</outcome>

Total score is the sum of each item score, and ranged from 32 to 224 with a higher score indicating a better QoL. Positive change in total score indicated improvement in QoL. n = number of participants with non-missing data.</outcome>
