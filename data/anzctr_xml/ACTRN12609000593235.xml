    <concealment>Subjects will be randomised to receive infusions of either zoledronic acid 5mg in 100mL or this volume of normal saline over 15 minutes.  Infusions will be prepared by a staff member who has no contact with the study subjects and no role in any other study procedures including assessments of end-points. All personnel having contact with study subjects and the subjects themselves will be blinded to treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Treatments will be allocated randomly using a minimisation algorithm balancing for age and the occurrence of fractures after the age of 40 years.</sequence>
