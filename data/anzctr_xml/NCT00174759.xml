  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A patient is eligible for inclusion in the study 2-4 days after surgery
        if all the following criteria are fulfilled:

          -  Informed consent obtained;

          -  Chronic background treatment with daily ASA, whatever the dose, started at least 4
             weeks before surgery. A window of a few days without ASA before surgery is acceptable,
             according to local practice. Post-randomization use of ASA must be between 75 and 100
             mg/day.

          -  Unilateral below knee bypass graft (i.e. the distal anastomosis is below the level of
             the knee joint) for atherosclerotic PAD within the previous 4 days;

          -  Demonstration of initial patency of the index graft by an objective measurement (e.g.
             intra-operative Doppler scanning, flow measurement, angiography, Duplex scanning)
             during bypass surgery, or between surgery and the time of randomization;

          -  No clinical evidence of graft occlusion at time of randomization.</inclusivecriteria>

             grafts, or undergoing peripheral transcutaneous angioplasty (PTA), with or without
             stenting, during the same surgery.

        Medical history related to bleeding risk

          -  Current active bleeding at surgical site

          -  Withdrawal of an epidural catheter less than 12 hours before randomization

          -  Current active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding, such as severe hepatic
             insufficiency, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, peptic ulceration, bleeding
             diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  Peptic ulceration within 12 months of randomization

          -  Previous or current intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic stroke, or any previous
             stroke for which the diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke cannot be excluded

          -  Any history of severe spontaneous bleeding such as gastrointestinal bleeding, gross
             hematuria, intraocular bleeding

        Other medical conditions

          -  Previous disabling stroke (severe cerebral deficit such that the patient is bedridden
             or demented)

          -  NYHA Class IV heart failure

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension: Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) &gt; 180 mm Hg, or Diastolic
             Blood Pressure (DBP) &gt; 100 mm Hg</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary objective:

      To evaluate whether clopidogrel 75 mg o.d. versus placebo (on a background of ASA 75-100
      mg/d) will lead to an increased rate of primary patency, limb salvage and survival, in
      patients receiving a below knee bypass graft for the treatment of PAD.

      Secondary objectives:

      Comparison, between the two treatment groups, of :

        -  Primary patency,

        -  Assisted primary patency,

        -  Cardiovascular death / myocardial infarction / stroke / any amputation above the ankle.

        -  Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) changes from baseline</summary>
