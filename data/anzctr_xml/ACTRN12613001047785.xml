    <studytitle>A Trial to determine which method of performing the Duodenal Switch leads to greater weight loss in morbidly obese patients.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of a standardised 100cm common channel and 150cm alimentary limb length versus an individually tailored small bowel partition on weight loss in the duodenal switch (DS) in morbidly obese patients.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Compare 2 different ways of performing the Duodenal Switch.  A standard 100cm common channel and 150 cm alimentary limb vs a tailored small bowel partition.  To determine which technique provides superior weight loss and resolution of co-morbidities.

In order to tailor the small bowel the total small bowel length is measured intra-operatively.  A common channel of 10% of the total small bowel length (but not less than 100cm) is fashioned.  The alimentary limb is 40% of the total small bowel length.  The small bowel anastamosis is performed in a side to side stapled fashion.

This is a descrition of the tailored small bowel partition.  Approximate length of surgery 3-4 hours.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Appropriate statistical analysis will be performed at the end of the trial period.
Sample size has been calculated in consultation with a statistician (Dr Lifeng Zhou, WDHB). On the basis of an expected 20% difference in weight loss between the 2 groups at 2 years; using a 2 sided statistical test with a power of 80% and an a risk of 0.05, a sample size of 25 patents per group would be required assuming 100% follow up.  Allowing for a 20% participant drop out rate, 30 participants per arm would be required</statisticalmethods>
