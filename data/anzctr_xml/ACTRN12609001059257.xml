  <interventions>
    <interventions>As part of a multicenter randomized trial, participants will be stratified according to the timing of their first presentation(Women requiring early chemotherapy will be randomly allocated to receive either early chemotherapy alone (EC Control) or GnRH-ant (Cetrotide0.25 mg, cetrorelix, Merck Serono, Switzerland) and GnRH-ag (Decapeptyl CR, triptorelin 3.75 mg, Ferring, Switzerland) combination followed by chemotherapy (EC GnRH) when down-regulation (E2&lt;50 pg/ml) is confirmed with discontinuation of GnRH-ant and continuation of triptorelin every 4 weeks until end of chemotherapy
 
When chemotherapy is planned to start later than 10 days, women will be randomized to receive either chemotherapy alone (DC Control) or GnRH-ag followed by chemotherapy (DC GnRH) after confirmation of down-regulation (E2&lt;50 pg/ml) with continuation of agonist until end of chemotherapy.



FAC regime will be used in all participants (IV 5-flourouracil (500\m2), adriamycin, (50mg\m2) and cyclophosphamide (500mg\m2) every 21 days for six cycle in absence of disease progression or toxicity. Adverse events will be assessed clinically and by means of hematologic and biochemical measurements. Lymph node dissection wil bel performed on a case-by-case basis. Regional adjuvant radiotherapy will be allowed.</interventions>
    <comparator>there are 2 contol groups taking chemotherapy only.
first. in women coming to start early chemotherapy, there is contol group taking only chemotherapy vs active taking antagonist/agonist plus chemo

second. women coming to start delayed chemo are submitted to receive either delayed chemo only (control) or agonist followed by chemo</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cancer is not uncommon in women of reproductive age. Women diagnosed with cancer during their reproductive period are often concerned not only with the uncertainty of long-term survival, but also with the potential loss of fertility as a result of cancer treatment. A combination of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue administrations with cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy may provide protection to the woman's ovaries during treatment. We wished to determine this in a multi-center, open label  controlled trial of 100 reproductive age women needing chemotherapy.</summary>
