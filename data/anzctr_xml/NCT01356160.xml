  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of response guided therapy. - To evaluate the antiviral efficacy as measured by sustained virologic response (SVR, defined as plasma HCV RNA &lt; Lower Limit of Quantification (LLoQ) at 24 weeks post-treatment) of response guided therapy (RGT) with GS-5885 + GS-9451 + PEG/RBV, or GS-5885 + PEG/RBV.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through 24 weeks post-treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of each regimen. - The primary safety endpoint is any AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drugs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through 24 weeks post-treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize viral dynamics of GS-5885 and GS-9451 when administered with PEG and RBV. - HCV RNA levels, pharmacokinetics and viral sequencing</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through Day 10 on study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the viral resistance to GS-5885 and GS-9451 when administered in combination with PEG and RBV. - Plasma samples will be collected and stored at each visit for possible resistance analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 or 24 weeks</timepoint>
