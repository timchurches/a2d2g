  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score at Day 90 - The OSDI consists of 12 questions to assess visual function, ocular symptoms and environmental triggers related to dry eye. Each of the 12 questions is assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none of the time; 4 = all of the time) which is converted to a total score between 0-100. OSDI total scores of 0-12=normal (best), 13-22= mild ocular surface disease, 23-32 =moderate ocular surface disease, and 33-100=severe ocular surface disease (worst). A negative number change from Baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 90</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Tear Break-up Time (TBUT) - TBUT is the time in seconds for the tear film to visually break up after a complete blink. The average of 3 consecutive observations is reported for each participant. The longer it takes, the more stable the tear film. The eye with the shorter average TBUT at Baseline was used for analysis. A positive number change from Baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 90</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Corneal Staining - Staining of the cornea following ocular administration of fluorescein dye was graded using a 6-point scale (0=no staining, 5=diffuse staining). The eye with the higher score at Baseline was used for analysis. The higher the grade score, the worse the dry eye severity. A negative number change from Baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 90</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Conjunctival Staining - Staining of the conjunctiva following ocular administration of lissamine green dye was graded using a 6-point scale (0=no staining, 5=diffuse staining). Conjunctival staining has 2 zones, nasal and temporal, which are added together to provide the total staining score. The eye with the higher score at Baseline was used for analysis. The higher the grade score, the worse the dry eye severity. A negative number change from Baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 90</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Schirmer Test - The Schirmer's Test measures the rate of the secretion of tears produced by the eye over 5 minutes. The results indicate the presence of dry eye. The eye with the lower value at Baseline was used for Analysis. Normal = greater than or equal to 15 millimeters (mm) of tears, Dry Eye = less than 15 mm of tears.. The smaller the number, the more severe the dry eye. A positive number change from Baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
