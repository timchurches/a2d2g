    <interventions>Interventional Procedure (Arm 1): Initial inspection with linked colour imaging (LCI) then white light (WL)

The procedure will be performed by qualified gastroenterologists (who also underwent additional advanced therapeutic colonoscopy training). They are A/Prof David Hewett (FRACP), Dr Nicholas Tutticci (FRACP) and Dr Ammar Kheir (FRACP).

The duration of the total procedure time will be approximately 30 - 40 minutes. Keeping in mind that insertion time to the caecum will average 5 minutes with minimum 6 minutes withdrawal time (as per national standard) for each insertion. 

The device used is the new is the 7000 'Trademark' endoscopic system powered by Fujifilms unique 4-LED Multi Light 'Trademark' technology sets a new standard in light intensity and endoscopic imaging (this is equivalent to the European model  ELUXEO 'Trademark'). The white light (WL) is essentially a high definition normal white light without manipulation of the normal light wavelengths. The Linked-colour imaging (LCI) creates clear and bright endoscopic images using short wavelength witha  narrow-band light that enhances the vessels in on the mucosal surface and patterns of the mucosa (410-nm and 450-nm wavelengths with a bandwidth that is &lt;2nm),

A research assistant will measure insertion and withdrawal times by using a stopwatch. On insertion, the stopwatch will be started at the moment the rectal mucosa is visualised, and timing will be continued until the colonoscope tip has entered the caecal caput. On withdrawal, mucosal inspection will be performed firstly using linked colour imaging until withdrawn to the rectum. Polyps will be removed as they are identified (via standard polypectomy techniques) and each polyp submitted separately for pathological examination. 

Reinsertion will then be performed to the caecum and further mucosal inspection performed using white light until withdrawn to the rectum. Further detected polyps will be removed as they are identified (via standard polypectomy techniques) and each polyp submitted separately for pathological examination.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The following assumptions were used to calculate required sample size: 30% adenoma miss rate for white light inspection and 10% miss rate for linked colour imaging inspection; two thirds of patients will have at least one adenoma, and patients with polyps will have an average of 3.7 polyps [as per previous study by Hewett and Rex (Gastrointest Endosc 2010; 72: 77581)].

For the study to have 80% power to detect 3 fold reduction in adenoma miss rates, by using a chi square test with 5% significance level, the study will need 62 polyps per group (i.e. 124 polyps total). Thus recruitment of 100 patients (n=100, with n=50 per arm) will ensure that the study will fulfill the above criteria with a power of 80%.

alpha = 0.05 , power = 0.8 , delta = 0.2

For characterisation, 60 consecutive images will be used and 60 consecutive videos (5-10 seconds in white light, 5-10 seconds in LCI). Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and NPV will be measured. Inter-observer and intra-observer agreement will be measured (Fleiss Kappa and Kappa, respectively).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficiency of two endoscopic imaging techniques for detecting colonic adenoma during colonoscopy.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over, and are scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will receive colonoscopy using both standard white light (WL) and linked colour imaging (LCI). LCI is a new endoscopic image enhancement technology that is built-in within scopes and activated by a push-button and highlight mucosal abnormalities within the gastrointestinal lumen. LCI uses different band widths and filters and is hypothesized to improve detection of subtle gastrointestinal pathology. Participants will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive WL imaging first, followed immediately by LCI to detect any polyps missed by WL, or to receive LCI imaging first, followed immediately by WL to detect any polyps missed by LCI.

This will allow researchers to investigate which technique results in less missed adenomas during colonoscopy.</summary>
