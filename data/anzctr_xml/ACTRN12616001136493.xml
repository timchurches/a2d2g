    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to calculate mean, standard deviation (or median and interquartile range) and 95% confidence intervals of pre-sedation TcCO2 as well as changes in TcCO2 that occur after sedation is administered. Multiple regression will be used to identify associations between ventilation status (measured as the mean tcCO2 whilst OAA/S score 4 or less) and participant and procedural characteristics.
Sample size considerations
A formal sample size calculation is not required for the primary outcome of this study, which is to describe changes in TcCO2 during sedation. It is generally recommended that 10 observations per variable are required for multivariate statistical analysis. We plan to recruit a sample of at least 100 participants in order to examine associations between ten pre-selected variables and post-sedation mean TcCO2 levels. The variables include: age, gender, BMI, sleep apnoea/obesity hypoventilation syndrome status, presence of COPD, smoking status, history of benzodiazepine/opiod use, total dose of opioids and total dose of midazolam, supplemental oxygen use and clinician interventions to support ventilation (realigning airway, verbal/physical stimulation to increase level of consciousness).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Respiratory depression is more likely to be detected during sedation when capnography is used. However, sedation-induced respiratory depression is commonly transient and does not always cause patient harm. Randomised controlled trials have produced conflicting results regarding whether capnography improves patient safety when used during sedation. Further research is required to determine whether applying capnography to the conscious sedation context is warranted. One considerable difficulty in designing a trial to determine whether a specific intervention improves the safety of conscious sedation is that adverse sedation events that pose potential risks to patient safety, such as hypoxaemia, should be so rare that it would not be feasible to recruit the required number of participants. In contrast, the number of participants required to detect a clinically significant difference in ventilation status during conscious sedation, as measured by transcutaneous carbon dioxide concentration (TcCO2), would be feasible to recruit in the context of a clinical trial. However, in order to calculate a sample size for such a trial, the expected control group TcCO2 needs to be identified. In this study, continuous TcCO2 measurements will be recorded from patients undergoing procedures with conscious sedation, starting before conscious sedation is induced (for measurement of baseline TcC02) and ceasing at the end of the procedure. </summary>
