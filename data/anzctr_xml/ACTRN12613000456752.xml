  <interventions>
    <interventions>The computerised psychological treatment program, SHADE, comprises 10 sessions of combination cognitive behaviour therapy and motivational interviewing focussed on reducing depression and reducing/ceasing alcohol/other drug use problems (including cannabis).  It is delivered either in DVD or Internet-delivered format.  All participants will complete the SHADE treatment over the Internet, excepting those who do not have reliable Internet access but have access to a computer in their homes.  In these cases, participants will be offered the SHADE treatment program delivered via DVD.  Participants are asked to complete each of the 10 session one week apart, with each session taking around 45 minutes to complete.  Each computerised session is supported by a therapist (by telephone) who provides a compliance check of sessions completed, encouragement to continue engagement with the program, troubleshooting barriers to completing homework tasks, and a risk assessment (approximately 15 minutes duration).  Telephone-based therapist support sessions occur once weekly over the 10-week intervention period.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Research Team members liaise with clinicians working in early psychosis clinics in the target area to identify potential participants for the study.  Potential participants are provided with a "consent to release contact details" form by their treating clinician for consideration.  Participants signing this form agree to have their contact details passed onto Research Team members, and are provided with the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form by their treating clinician at the time of signing.  One week following provision of these study documents, the Research Team will contact the potential participant via their preferred contact method to discuss the content of the Information Statement, answer any questions, to determine study eligibility and to discuss consent.  Written consent will be obtained from each participant.  Consenting, eligible participants will be enrolled in the study, and complete the baseline assessment with the Research Team via the telephone.  At the conclusion of the baseline assessment, participants will receive their random allocation to SHADE or wait-list.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence will be generated via a computerised table of random numbers, with the randomisation outcome (treatment/wait-list) being concealed in a sealed envelope by Dr Frances Kay-Lambkin.  The outside of the envelopes will be labelled with study enrolment numbers, and participants will receive the relevant envelope (matching their study enrolment number) at the conclusion of the initial assessment.   </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Data coding and analysis will be carried out by the research team using available software packages (eg. SPSS). Variables hypothesised to change over time according to treatment allocation will be examined using repeated measures analysis of covariance (e.g. cannabis use). Chi-square analyses or logistic regression will be performed on categorical outcome variables (abstinence vs. not). Outcome measures will be analysed in two ways (1) intention to treat (with study dropouts regarded as continuing users and/or with unchanged scores relative to baseline); (2) performed with the sub-sample of participants who actually attended treatment and completed all follow-up phases.   The sample size was determined based on feasibility of recruitment within the funding-body specified timeframe, with a file audit conducted within the Bondi Clinic in 2010 indicating that approximately 15-20 participants engaged with the service would meet eligibility criteria.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to trial the use of a computerized psychological treatment for problematic cannabis use in Early Psychosis.

Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychosis and cannabis use is high in people presenting for treatment of first episode psychosis (FEP). Cannabis use is also associated with high relapse rates in FEP. Therefore, it is vital that Early Psychosis Treatment Centers (EPTC) address cannabis use. 

This project aims to trial the SHADE computerized treatment package among an FEP sample presenting to an EPTC at Bondi Junction Community Mental Health Centre and Campbelltown Community Mental Health Centre, to determine whether the addition of this resource is effective in reducing cannabis use over the treatment period. </summary>
