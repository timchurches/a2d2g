    <studytitle>Antibiotic drop efficacy trial</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A proof-of-principle, prospective, open label, randomised, controlled, parallel design, one-month clinical trial to determine if prophylactic instillation of antibiotic drops during continuous wear of silicone hydrogel contact lenses reduces the incidence of contact lens related ocular inflammatory adverse events.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Test group will be randomised to instil Moxifloxacin antibiotic drops twice a day into each eye on waking and prior to sleep (in the evening). Commercially available siliconhydrogel lenses are to be worn on a continuous wear basis (that is, during the day and night) for approximately I month</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will instil unit dose saline (5mL, 0.9% sodium chloride)lubricant as treatment twice a day into each eye on waking and prior to sleep (in the evening). Lenses are to be worn on a continuous wear basis (that is, during the day and night) for approximately I month</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction of contact lens related inflammatory ocular adverse events compared to control group. Ocular redness (bulbar limbal and palpebral), palpebral roughness and corneal and conjunctival staining will be assessed and recorded using the Brien Holden Vision Institute Grading scales. History (including medical and general health) at baseline, and changes from baseline history that occur between visits, will be recorded in the source documentation at each visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ocular examination using slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be carried out at baseline and all follow up visits (i.e. 1 night, 1 week (if a neophyte- new contact lens wearer) and 1 Month)</timepoint>

    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition that would preclude contact lens fitting,
Had eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial,
Undergone previous corneal refractive surgery,
Contraindications to contact lens wear,
Allergy or intolerance to moxifloxacin or other quinolones/fluoroquinolones,
Be currently enrolled in another clinical trial or participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for longer-term studies and 48 hours between short-term studies,

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be pre-screened for suitability by way of a routine eye examination which includes refraction, visual acuity and general eye health. Informed consent will be obtained prior to any clinical trial procedures. Participants will be randomly allocated into either the lubricant or antibiotic drop instillation group. Concealed allocation will be by way of central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly assigned to either the saline or antibiotic drop grou. A randomisation plan will be generated from http://www.randomization.com/. The randomisation list will be generated based on an independent group design</sequence>
