  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is not an interventional study but a feasibility study measuring patient reported outcomes (PROs) in the evaluation of side effects and toxicities from steroid use in patients with brain tumours or brain metastases or advanced cancer.  Clinician's will rate patient toxicities from steroid use at baseline using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. 50 patients  will be recruited to the study with at least half (25) having a primary brain tumour (and 50 associated caregivers). The caregivers responses are collected in conjunction with those of the patients and are crucial for assessing the reliability of the measurements.

The duration of observation for each patient is 8 weeks with timepoints occuring at baseline, 2, 4 and 8 weeks.  At each timepoint, questionnaires are required to be completed.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and their nominated caregiver will complete the Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) battery which comprises the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire Chronic (DSQ-Chronic), acetazolomide toxicity questionnaire and  European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire: a shortened questionnaire for cancer patients in palliative care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL) at recruitment and again at 2, 4 and 8 weeks. Clinician will assess dexamethasone toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4 criteria and rate patient's Karnofsky Performace Status (KPS) at baseline.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will investigate quality of life issues related to having brain cancer, other cancers which spread to the brain or advanced cancer of other types; where the person is required to take regular dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) for disease management and/or chemotherapy. The study will enable us to follow how patients are doing during their treatment for cancer by looking at the severity and frequency of side effects that occur with dexamethasone, in particular by using a new instrument which assist patients and their caregivers to tell us about the possible side effects they might be experiencing in relation to dexamethasone treatment and their severity. The study will also look at factors that might help us decide how to improve the management of dexamethasone use.</summary>
