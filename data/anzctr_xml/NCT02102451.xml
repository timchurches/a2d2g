  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of rapid scale-up of new hepatitis C
      (HCV) treatments, known as interferon-free Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) drugs, and impact on
      the proportion of people with HCV within the HIV-HCV coinfected population of Australia.

      It is hypothesised that a rapid scale-up of hepatitis C treatment with interferon-free
      therapies in individuals with HIV-HCV coinfection will assist in controlling HCV infection in
      this population.</summary>
