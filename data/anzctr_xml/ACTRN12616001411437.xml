  <interventions>
    <interventions>multidiciplinary home visits two years observation. The preventive home visits were delivered by a nurse with experience of working with geriatric patients, a physiotherapist and a social worker. The team of professionals had a possibility to consult a doctor from a geriatric ward if needed. The intervention protocol was planned and discussed together with all the team members, including the doctor, and uniform instructions were given personally and on paper to all of the persons delivering the home visits.
All professionals visited the participants of the intervention group once. The three home visits were delivered during a time period of 6 to 9 months, first the nurse visit, second the physiotherapist visit and the social worker visit last. The interval between each visit to the participant was circa 3 months, but due to practical arrangements (vacations etc.) the interval varied from 1 month to 6 months. Most of the visits were delivered with 3 month intervals.

The nurse home visit lasted 1-1,5 hours per participant. During the home visit the nurse made a structured assessment on functioning, quality of life, nutrition, memory functions, depression, activities of daily living and instrumental activities on daily living.The nurse also measured blood pressure and blood glucose levels of the participant. The participant was given information about the different health and social services offered by the municipality and local voluntary and third sector organizations. If concerns on the health or well-being of the participant arouse from the visit, the nurse directed them to contact their family doctor, the memory clinic or other suitable health or social service and left written contact information of the consequential services. 

Physiotherapist home visits were delivered during march 2014 to may 2014. The physiotherapist home visit lasted 1-1,5 hours per participant. During the home visit the physiotherapist made a structured assessment of the barriers of mobility, fall risk and home safety (FROP- Com Screen and home safety assessment). The physiotherapist also performed a hand grip strength test (Jamar) and chair stand test to the participant. Individual excercise instructions were compiled by the physiotherapist based on the test results and the motivation and wishes of the participant, and these compiled written instructions were given to the participant. The participant was given information on the services the municipality physiotherapy offers for individuals and groups, and services offered and groups aranged by local voluntary and third sector organizations. Based on the assessment and the wishes and needs of the participants, the physiotherapist left written contact information of the consequential services and/or arranged prospective physiotherapy services.

The social worker home visit lasted 0,5-1,5 hours per participant and made a structured assessment on social functioning,The social worker also gave information on financial and other benefits for older people and the social services provided by the municipality and local voluntary and third sector organizations, and left contact information when needed.

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive. We calculated the needed sample size with strength calculation based on change in 15D, the primary outcome of our study. The strength calculation is based on detecting a difference of 0.03 points in 15D. We assume the standard deviation of 15D to be 0.15 for this calculation. The calculated minimum sample size was 392 study participants, when type 1 error is 5% and strength being 80%.</statisticalmethods>
