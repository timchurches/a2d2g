  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to develop/evaluate a group behavioural program for parents that targets overweight/obese children aged 3 to 10 years. 

It is thought that participation will result in: reduced child BMI scores, reduced energy intake, reduced media viewing, increased activity levels; and reduced primary parent BMI scores. These changes are thought to be able to be maintained three months after treatment. 

Parental participation will hopefully result in improved parenting behaviour. These will be indicated by improved scores on parental self report measures of consistency, sense of satisfaction/efficacy and inter-parental conflict.</summary>
