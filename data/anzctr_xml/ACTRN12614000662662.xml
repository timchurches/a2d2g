    <interventions>Contrast enhanced ultrasound, a non ionising diagnostic imaging study using intravenously administered microbubble contrast ("Definity"). This study is performed on each participant on a single occasion for the affected joint, and takes approximately 30-45 minutes. </interventions>
    <comparator>Contrast enhanced MRI, a non ionising imaging study, which involves intravenous administration of gadolinium contrast. This study is performed on each participant on a single occasion for the affected joint, and takes approximately 30-45 minutes. 
The MRI and US will take place on the same day.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relationship between the presence or absence of synovitis as determined by two experienced radiologists from contrast enhanced ultrasound (CE-US) and MRI will be determined. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary time point is the time of ultrasound and MRI.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of Definity CE-US as determined by the number of adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4 (CTCAE) form.  Adverse effects are uncommon but include anaphylaxis (acute allergic reactions) and cardiovascular instability, such as low blood pressure.
Anaphylactic reactions range from urticaria (hives) and itching, to bronchospasm (muscle spasms of passages in the lungs) and facial and laryngeal edema (swelling).
 </outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary time point is at the time of ultrasound and MRI and on review in clinic 2-4 weeks later.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to demonstrate that contrast enhanced ultrasound is an equally effective method for detecting synovitis in patients with haemophilia in whom the diagnosis of synovitis (joint capsule inflammation) from physical examination is unclear. 

Currently, MRI is the screening tool for synovitis in this population; however it is time consuming, claustrophobic for some patients and has long waiting times.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is the application of ultrasound contrast medium to traditional medical sonography. Ultrasound contrast agents may be used during an ultrasound examination to improve the clarity and accuracy of a conventional ultrasound image. </summary>
