Experimental: Treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, autologous SCI) - INDUCTION: Patients receive vincristine IV; cisplatin IV; cyclophosphamide IV; and G-CSF SC beginning on day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover.
CONSOLIDATION (stage 4a or 4b disease only): Patients receive carboplatin IV; thiotepa IV; and etoposide IV.
AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL INFUSION (stage 4a or 4b disease only): Patients undergo autologous stem cell infusion on day 0 and receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.
RADIOTHERAPY: Patients with stage 2 or 3 disease (orbital and/or regional involvement) undergo radiotherapy to sites that were initially involved beginning within 42 days after the start of course 4 of induction chemotherapy. Patients with stage 4a or 4b disease undergo radiotherapy to sites initially involved based on response beginning approximately 42 days after autologous stem cell infusion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Failure-free survival (FFS) - FFS experience of each group of patients (distant metastatic CNS positive, distant metastatic CNS negative, and orbit patients) can be adequately modeled using the exponential cure model. The observed survival experience will be compared to the expected distribution using a method adapted from Woolson. The difference between the number of observed and expected failures is approximately normally distributed with independent increments and may be used for interim monitoring using standard group sequential boundaries.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Response rate to the induction phase of the regimen using a modified version of the international criteria for neuroblastoma response - Estimated and a corresponding 95% confidence interval calculated for all strata combined.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 10 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of adverse events as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 - The toxicity-associated death rate and the percentage of patients for whom an adequate yield of stem cells cannot be harvested will be monitored across all treatment groups collectively. Toxicities will be descriptively summarized.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients must have histologic or cytologic verification of extra-ocular
             retinoblastoma; extra-ocular disease includes orbital disease, optic nerve involvement
             at the surgical margin, regional nodal disease, and/or overt distant metastatic
             disease (at sites such as bone, bone marrow, liver and/or the central nervous system);
             patients with trilateral retinoblastoma will also be included in this protocol

               -  Patients with a CNS lesion consistent with trilateral or stage 4b disease may be
                  enrolled without tissue confirmation if (1) unequivocal leptomeningeal disease is

                  primary tumor is at least 2 cm in diameter, predominantly solid, and demonstrates
                  enhancement on the post-gadolinium images; however, even in such cases surgery
                  should be given serious consideration

          -  Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) scores of 0, 1, or 2; use Karnofsky for patients &gt; 16 years of age and

          -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 750/uL

               -  If the ANC and/or platelet count are not adequate, but due to bone marrow
                  metastatic disease, these criteria will be waived

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 75,000/uL (transfusion independent)

               -  If the ANC and/or platelet count are not adequate, but due to bone marrow
                  metastatic disease, these criteria will be waived

          -  Creatinine clearance OR radioisotope glomerular filtration rate &gt;= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying the side effects and how well giving combination
      chemotherapy together with autologous stem cell transplant and/or radiation therapy works in
      treating young patients with extraocular retinoblastoma. Giving chemotherapy before an
      autologous stem cell transplant stops the growth of tumor cells by stopping them from
      dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood
      and/or bone marrow and stored. More chemotherapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the
      stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the
      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after combination chemotherapy
      and/or autologous stem cell transplant may kill any remaining tumor cells.</summary>
