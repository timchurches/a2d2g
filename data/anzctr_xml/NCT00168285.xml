  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a highly disabling group of conditions including
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute and chronic interstitial pneumonias, connective
      tissue diseases and sarcoidosis. People with ILD frequently experience breathlessness on
      exertion, which limits their ability to undertake daily activities. People with ILD report
      very poor quality of life due to low levels of physical functioning and vitality, and high
      levels of breathlessness and fatigue. There are few treatments for ILD and those that are
      available have limited impact on quality of life.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of Pulmonary Rehabilitation, which consists of
      specialised exercise training for people with lung disease, on exercise capacity and quality
      of life in people with ILD. We hypothesis that exercise training will result in reduced
      dyspnoea, improved exercise tolerance and enhanced quality of life.</summary>
