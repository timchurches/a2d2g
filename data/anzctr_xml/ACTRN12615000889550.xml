      <outcome>Beck Anxiety Inventory at baseline and on the day of surgery

Rather than a composite outcome, the Beck Anxiety Inventory is a questionnaire that provides a validated level of 'anxiety' through a scored questionnaire: 21 questions, each scored with 0, 1, 2 or 3 points. The scores within a patient at a particular time are summed, to be a total score ranging from 0 to 63. A score of 0-7 indicates minimal, 8-15 mild, 16-25 moderate and 26-63 severe anxiety. ANOVA will be used to assess whether there are differences in Beck Anxiety Inventory between groups, with p-values reported.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients diagnosed with breast carcinoma have an initial consultation with a breast surgeon to determine suitability for surgical resection. If surgery is the initial management, patients will be screened for suitability for enrollment. A study investigator will subsequently discuss the study and obtain written informed consent from the patient. 

Allocation to the Propranolol or placebo arms will occur on the day of recruitment and registration. The Department of Pharmacy has pre-prepared a random sequence pre-determining patient registration number and group allocation (Propranolol or placebo). The random sequence has been generated by Ms Carol Rice (Clinical Trials Pharmacist) using Microsoft Excel Software in accordance with standard policy. 

Once recruited, each patient will be assigned a study number. The study number will correspond to the pre-prepared (numbered) dispensary bottles.

As such, the Department of Pharmacy (Ms Rice) alone will be aware of patient allocation. No investigator (or patient) will be aware of treatment allocation until the completion of recruitment and sample analyses. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses for primary endpoint I and secondary endpoint II will be conducted by collaborator SC. All other patient outcome data will be analysed by the studys statistician (EL).

All patients registered on the trial and randomised to a treatment arm will be accounted for in reports of trial outcomes. Analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Baseline patient characteristics will be summarised for the whole sample and by treatment arm using descriptive statistics and will be reported for continuous variables as number of patients, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum; and for categorical variables as counts and percentages.  

For each of the continuous primary and secondary endpoints, the mean difference between the treatment arms will be calculated with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Hypothesis testing will be performed for each endpoint at each time point separately using the appropriate statistical test based on the distribution of data (e.g., mixed effect linear models for the a priori gene expression composite outcomes). For single-value outcomes, an independent two-sample t-test will be used if data are normally distributed or if an appropriate transformation can be found, otherwise a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test will be performed. Given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, no adjustments for multiple comparisons will be made. We will generate both simple estimates of effect size as well as adjusted estimates, controlling for any accidental confounding that may occur despite randomization.

Specifically, secondary endpoint 2 (CTRA signature) will be analysed using the following approach. Effects of drug treatment on a priori-defined gene expression composites (53 CTRA genes in whole blood samples) will be analyzed using mixed effect linear models treating experimental condition as the primary variable of interest and treating the multiple target genes as repeated measures (with covariance matrices estimated to control for potential correlations in gene expression across participants). In cross-sectional analyses at one time point, analyses will examine the effect of experimental Group on average level of transcript expression across all a priori indicator genes.  In analyses of change over time, a similar mixed effect linear models will use a Group x Time factorial design. In both cases, expression values will be quantile normalized across subjects, log2-transformed to stabilize variance, and centered to mean = 0 to facilitate estimation algorithms. Any factors that are found to be potentially confounded (e.g., p &lt; .10 for association with experimental group) will be included as covariates in subsequent mixed effect linear model analyses.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate whether, in patients receiving breast cancer surgery, pre-operative Propranolol compared with placebo, changes the cancer's gene expression. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18-70 years old, have histologically-confirmed breast cancer and will undergo breast cancer surgery at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. 
Study details Participants will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two treatment groups. Patients in one group will receive Propranolol for 7 days prior to their scheduled breast cancer surgery while patients in the other group will receive a placebo tablet over the same period. Tablets will be taken two times a day. To determine the results of the study, the researchers will compare blood tests and tumour samples (biopsy and excision samples) obtained before and after administration of the study medication (at the time of surgery). In the samples, the investigators will be looking for the behaviour of specific anti-cancer immune cells in the blood and in the tissue surrounding and controlling the tumour. The investigators will also be analysing the immune cells to understand the biological effects of the stress that a patient may be experiencing. The information from this study will be presented to clinicians and researchers and will provide very useful information to guide a larger study examining the role of propranolol in all patients receiving breast surgery or in those patients where breast cancer has spread.</summary>
