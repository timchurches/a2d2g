  <interventions>
    <interventions>   We recruited 100 patients of ASA physical status 1-2 who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia requiring tracheal intubation.
     After obtaining written informed consent, patients were assigned, by using a computer-generated block randomisation, to laryngoscopy with either McGrath videolaryngoscope or the Macintosh laryngoscope. All tracheal intubations with both the Macintosh laryngoscope and McGrath videolaryngoscope were performed by one anesthesiologist who had used both devices more than 50 times clinically.
       All patients were expected to fast 6-8 hours before surgery, and no one premedicated. With the patient placed in the supine position, routine monitors (consisting of a pulse oximeter, 3-lead ECG and a non-invasive blood pressure cuff) were applied. Baseline measurements were obtained and 3 min of pre-oxygenation was performed before the induction of general anaesthesia. Standardised anesthetic induction was preformed with 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 1-2 mg/kg of propofol, and when consciousness was lost, 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium was injected. After, making sure that all four TOF responses of the Adductor Pollicis disappeared, which ensures sufficient musclular blockade, intubation was then performed. Number 3 or 4 blades was used in all patients. A size 7.0 mm tracheal tube was used to intubate the trachea in female patients, and a size 7.5 mm tube was used for all male patients.
     If more than one intubation attempt was required, the patient received bag-and mask ventilation between attempts and various manoeuvres were employed, including external laryngeal pressure, readjustment of the stylet and use of a bougie. Failed intubation was defined as failure after three attempts and a pre-determined alternative airway management plan was instituted by the treating anaesthetist. Correct placement of the tracheal tube was confirmed by capnography and bilateral chest auscultation.
   Data were collected by one independent observer. The time taken for successful tracheal intubation was measured from the time the allocated laryngoscope was inserted in the patients mouth until end-tidal carbon dioxide was detected. 
The difference between The McGrath videolaryngoscope with the Macintosh laryngoscope is to obtain laryngoscopic view with the help of a monitor.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intubation is one of the most important procedure for  anaesthetists. 
There are currently many different intubating devices available.  
McGrath videolaryngoscope is relatively new for anesthesia practice which have a high-resolution camera and light source embedded  at the distal end of the blade. It allows a view of the anterior glottis  without the need for a direct line of sight. Currently, there are no studies comparing the use of this  videolaryngoscope in patients with normal airways, which are usually the most useful situations.
The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to compare the  effectiveness of using this devices in performing endotracheal  intubation in adult patients with normal airways.
The research is designed to be conducted in 100 adult patients. After informed consent, 
the patients will be randomized to having either the McGrath videolarygngoscope or Macintosh laryngoscope for the intubation. The primary outcome was the laryngoscopy view using percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score. Secondary outcomes included Cormack and Lehane grading system, time to intubation, number of failed intubations, number of attempts before successful intubation, haemodynamic changes during intubation and any associated complications (such as, injury to lips, oral mucosal or dentition, oesophageal intubation, or hypoxia (SpO2 &lt; 90%) ). These data were collected by one independent observer. </summary>
