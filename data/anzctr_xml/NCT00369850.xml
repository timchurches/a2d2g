Other interventions: laboratory biomarker analysis
Biomarkers (C-telopeptide, osteocalcin and skeletal alkaline phosphatase) will be assessed in serum.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as bone mineral density testing and x-ray, help
      measure bone loss in women receiving treatment for breast cancer. The test results may help
      doctors plan better treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying bone density and bone loss in postmenopausal women
      with breast cancer receiving treatment in clinical trial IBCSG-1-98.</summary>
