  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine SPD489 in subjects aged 18-65 with major depressive disorder (MDD)
      who are taking certain types of antidepressants but continue to have residual depression
      symptoms. The purpose of this study is to help answer the following questions:

        -  How safe is SPD489 for the supplemental treatment of depression and what are the side
           effects that might be related to it?

        -  Can SPD489 help patients with depression who are also taking an antidepressant?

        -  How much SPD489 should be given to patients with depression who are also taking an
           antidepressant?

        -  How does SPD489 compare to placebo in depressed patients who are also taking an
           antidepressant?</summary>
