                  either breast are excluded regardless of disease free interval. Patients with

                  9. Serious non-malignant disease (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary, systemic lupus
                  erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma) which would preclude definitive radiation
                  treatment.

                  10. Estrogen receptor status (ER) not known.

                  11. For patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: unable to commence
                  radiation therapy within 12 weeks of the last surgical procedure on the breast.

                  12. For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: unable to commence within 8
                  weeks of the last dose of chemotherapy.

                  13. Currently pregnant or lactating.

                  14. Psychiatric or addictive disorders which would preclude obtaining informed
                  consent or adherence to protocol.

                  15. Geographic inaccessibility for follow-up.

                  16. Inability to localize surgical cavity on CT (i.e., no evidence of surgical
                  clips or seroma).

                  17. Inability to adequately plan the patient for the experimental technique.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine if Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation, using 3D CRT, is as effective as
      Whole Breast Irradiation following breast conserving surgery in women with an new
      histological diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ only or invasive breast cancer without
      evidence of metastatic disease. Effectiveness will be determined by the rate of ipsilateral
      breast tumour recurrence.

      General objective is to improve the convenience and quality of life of female patients who
      receive breast irradiation.</summary>
