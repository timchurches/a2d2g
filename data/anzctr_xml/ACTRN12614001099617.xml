  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will complete 4 lessons of an internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) program, the UniWellbeing Course, focusing on the management of stress, anxiety, low mood and depression. All 4 Lessons will be administered via the internet and one lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about others with anxiety and depression, taking a further 20 minutes per summary. All participants will also receive automatic email and weekly reminder phone calls by a psychologist. The duration of the reminder emails and phone calls is expected to be 5-10 minutes per week. The duration of the program is 5 weeks. Study questionnaires will be administered at  pre-treatment, post-treatment and then 3-months post-treatment. These questionnaires will take about 5 minutes to complete.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will learn about the trial via the Macquarie University Campus Wellbeing Service, which provides a broad range of psychological and physical health support services to students at the University. All interested participants will complete the DSM V Level 1 Self Rated Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. Participants who have anxiety or depression scores of &lt; 4 will and who score &lt; 3 on the safety question will be offered the opportunity to participate in the program immediately. Participants with anxiety or depression scores &gt; 3 or safety scores &gt; 3 will be be referred for an assessment with a clinician before any offer of participation is made. Suitable participants will be provided with login details and a start date for the program.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be carried out using conservative intention-to-treat principles and using mixed-linear models analyses to handle missing data. Mixed-models are a robust statistical approach for analysing clinical trial data and these analyses will employ an appropriate covariance structure and maximum likelihood estimation, which provides unbiased estimates in the case of missing data; under the assumption that data is missing at random.

Sample size: With an alpha at 0.05 and power set at 0.80, 27 participants are needed to detect an effect size improvement in symptoms of .50. However, to hedge against attrition and enable the robust estimation and exploration of treatment effects many more participants will be recruited - i.e., based on previous experience, we have capacity to recruit and treat as many as 150 students in the next 9 months, which would provide us with a more robust exploration of the treatment effects compared to smaller samples of, for example, 27 participants. The effect size of 0.50 is also conservative estimate with larger effect sizes having been observed in previous trials. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed project seeks to examine the acceptability, efficacy and feasibility of low-intensity CBT-based treatment program, the UniWellbeing Course, in reducing symptoms of stress, anxiety, low mood and depression in tertiary students attending Macquarie University. The UniWellbeing Course is based on the already established and efficacious Wellbeing and Mood Mechanic Courses (e.g., Titov et al., 2013, PLOS One; Johnston, et al., 2014, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry).</summary>
