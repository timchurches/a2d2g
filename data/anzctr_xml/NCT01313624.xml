Treatment: drugs: AZLI
AZLI 75 mg reconstituted with diluent and administered via nebulizer three times daily

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in QOL-B Respiratory Symptoms Score at Day 28 - The mean (SD) change in the Respiratory Symptoms score on the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bronchiectasis (QOL-B) was measured from baseline to the end of Course 1 (Day 28). The QOL-B respiratory symptoms score was transformed onto a scale of 0-100, with higher scores representing a better quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in QOL-B Respiratory Symptoms Score at Day 84 - The mean (SD) change in the Respiratory Symptoms score on the QOL-B was measured from baseline to the end of Course 2 (Day 84). The QOL-B respiratory symptoms score was transformed onto a scale of 0-100, with higher scores representing a better quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Day 84</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Protocol-Defined Exacerbation (PDE) - Protocol-defined exacerbation was defined as an acute worsening of respiratory disease that triggered the initiation of a non-study antibiotic meeting at least 3 major criteria, or 2 major and at least 2 minor criteria.
Major Criteria: increased sputum production; increased discoloration of sputum; increased dyspnea; increased cough
Minor Criteria: fever (&gt; 38ยบ C) measured during clinic visit; increased malaise or fatigue; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (L) or forced vital capacity (FVC) decreased &gt; 10% from baseline; new or increased hemoptysis</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The AIR-BX1 study enrolled people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis and
      gram-negative airway infection. Participants received two 28-day courses of either Aztreonam
      for Inhalation Solution (AZLI) or placebo taken 3 times a day. Each course was followed by a
      28-day off-drug period. Following the two blinded courses, all participants received a 28-day
      course of open-label AZLI then were followed for an additional 56 days.</summary>
