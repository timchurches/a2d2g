  <interventions>
    <interventions>We compared three different types of intraocular lenses (IOL), AcrySof MA60BM, Sensar AR40e, and the Rayner C-Flex 2. These lenses are intraocular, so participants will be wearing the lenses for wholelife. There are three different groups of participants who wear one type of lens only. The AcrySof MA60BM (Alcon Inc, Fort Worth, TX, USA) is a 3-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL with flexible polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) C-loop haptics with 10-degree angulation. Its overall length is 13.0 mm, with a biconvex optic having a diameter of 6.0 mm. The Sensar AR40e (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA, USA) is a 3-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL with flexible PMMA C-loop haptics with 5-degree angulation. Its overall length is 13.0 mm, with a biconvex optic having a diameter of 6.0 mm. The Rayner C-Flex (Rayner Intraocular Lenses Limited, East Sussex, UK) is a 1-piece hydrophilic acrylic IOL. This lens has a plate-haptic configuration without angulation. It has a body diameter of 5.75 mm and overall length of 12.00 mm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Accommodation is ability of the eye to adjust to an object at any given distance, projecting this object onto the retina where it creates a focused image. So, we can see near objects through accommodation ability. Patients who have undergone phacoemulsification and IOL implantation surgery (pseudophakic) loss the accommodation ability and need correction with glasses. But, some pseudophakic patients with monofocal IOLs have good near visual acuity without correction. 

Our hypothesis is monofocal IOLs either monoblock or three piece may have some degree of accommodative amplitudes in vivo. Our purpose is to assess the accommodative amplitudes of three different foldable acrylic IOLs by measuring with photorefractor Plusoptix CR03 (Plusoptix GmbH, Nuernberg, Germany). The second aim of the study is to compare the accomodative amplitudes of the monoblock or three piece foldable acrylic IOLs if any</summary>
