  <interventions>
    <interventions>Elective adult shoulder surgery patients will be recruited for a 2 year observational study on postoperative functional outcomes. Prior to surgery, patients will receive a baseline assessment of function using the following questionnaires: Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale (PostopQRS), the modified Brief Pain Inventory scale (mBPI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) scale. These will assess the functional domains of recovery, pre-operative pain levels, susceptibility for chronic pain, and functional measures of shoulder movement and ability, respectively. 
As a pragmatic study, there will be no change to anaesthesia, surgical, or nursing management of these patients. 
Patients will be followed up at the following time periods using the following schedule:
Baseline - PostopQRS, mBPI, PCS, CSS, WORC
15 minutes after cessation of anaesthesia - PostopQRS
40 minutes after cessation of anaesthesia - PostopQRS
Day 1 postoperative - PostopQRS, mBPI
Day 3 postoperative - PostopQRS, mBPI
Month 3 postoperative - PostopQRS, mBPI, PCS, CSS, WORC
Year 1 postoperative - mBPI, PCS, CSS, WORC
Year 2 postoperative - mBPI, PCS, CSS, WORC

Patient characteristics and intra-operative data will be analysed using independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-square test as appropriate. 
  The primary outcome of proportion of patients recovered in each cohort will be analysed by Fisher's exact test. For analysis of secondary outcomes of recovery in the individual PostopQRS domains, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with continuity correction will be used to assess proportions of patients who recovered between groups, over all timepoints, stratified by age, duration of surgery, pain, and surgical pathology. 
  The secondary outcome of CPSP is determined by a VAS score &gt; 5 on the mBPI at M3, Y1, and Y2 timepoints. To identify factors which contribute to CPSP, univariate analysis will be performed on pre-operative, intra-operative, and acute pain outcomes and CPSP. Factors which scored a p value &lt; 0.02 will be entered into a multivariable logistic regression model.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an observational trial of functional outcomes and chronic pain after elective shoulder surgery. 
  In this study, we will recruit adult patients admitted for elective shoulder surgery at Kareena Private Hospital. Baseline assessment will occur using the PostopQRS, modified Brief Pain Inventory (mBPI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) scales. Major timepoints during follow up is Day 3 post-operative for cognitive recovery, Month 3 and 2 years for chronic pain rates, and shoulder function. 

The primary outcome is Day 3 cognitive domain recovery as assessed using the PostopQRS tool. The secondary outcomes include:
1. Quality of recovery in the individual and overall recovery PostopQRS domains across all time periods up to Month 3 post-operative, in shoulder surgery patients when stratified by age, duration of surgery, and shoulder pathology. 
2. Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) at Month 3, Year 1, and Year 2 post-operative, assessed using the mBPI, when stratified by age, duration of surgery, shoulder pathology, and PCS score

It is currently unknown what is the rate of medium to long term recovery after shoulder surgery. Our previous concept of recovery was limited to pain, nausea, and mobility in the first 24 hours, but relatively little is known about how patients recovery after major shoulder surgery over the ensuing weeks to months. This study aims to collect data to shed light into the rates of functional recovery and in particular, whether cognition is affected by anaesthesia. Similarly, the incidence of chronic post-surgical pain after shoulder surgery is relatively unknown. In other types of surgery, CPSP is common and impacts on quality of life, and has negative economic and social costs. As a secondary outcome, CPSP will be measured in this study at 3 months and 2 years post-operatively to determine the frequency of this complication.
