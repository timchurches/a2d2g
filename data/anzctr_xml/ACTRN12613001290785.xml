  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two weeks following performing a VO2 max test to determine 90% VO2 max and after following a low antioxidant baseline diet (subjects will be provided with a diet protocol of foods to avoid), a sample group of moderately well-trained middle-distance and distance runners will follow a high-antioxidant diet for 14 days. After a two week washout the subjects will switch to the other diet.  Using FoodWorks7, an analysis of antioxidant content of different fruits and vegetables has been conducted. Fruit and vegetable boxes will be designed to include fruits and vegetables with a high antioxidant content e.g. carrots, zucchinis, berries (&gt;15,000ug). Participants will also be instructed to avoid other high antioxidant foods such as nuts, seeds, tea and wine. Fruit and vegetable boxes will be provided and a dietitian on hand if assistance with dietary prescription is required. Participants will be provided with a diet protocol specifying foods to avoid and ways to incorporate the fruits and vegetables provided, apart from this, subjects can consume any other foods. Participants will be instructed to consume 5 serves of vegetables and 2 serves of fruit/day. Diet will be monitored at the start and end of each 2 week period using a modified FFQ assessing fruit, vegetable and fat intake over the previous 2 weeks. Additionally, plasma carotenoids and tocopherols will be assessed. Impact on airway inflammation will be determined by measuring immunological markers, markers of anti-oxidant status and oxidative damage following a prescribed bout of treadmill running exercise (6x3mins intervals at 90% max with 90sec recovery). </interventions>
    <comparator>Two weeks following performing a VO2 max test to determine 90% VO2 max and after following a low antioxidant baseline diet (subjects will be provided with a diet protocol of foods to avoid), a sample group of moderately well-trained middle-distance and distance runners will continue to follow a low-antioxidant diet for 14 days. After a two week washout the subjects will switch to the other diet.  Using FoodWorks7, an analysis of antioxidant content of different fruits and vegetables has been conducted. Fruit and vegetable boxes will be designed to include low antioxidant content e.g. turnip, pear (&lt;5000ug) fruits and vegetables.

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics (mean and SD) and magnitude-based inferences will be used to characterise the inflammatory response to the exercise trials. The mean effect of treatments on inflammatory markers will be estimated via the unequal-variances t statistic computed for the difference in the change in the mean scores between pre- and post-tests. Each subject's change score will be expressed as a percentage of baseline score via analysis of log-transformed values, in order to reduce bias arising from non-uniformity of error. The magnitude of difference between treatments will be expressed as a standardised effect size. The criteria to interpret the magnitude of the sizes are: &lt;0.2 trivial, 0.2-0.6 small, 0.6-1.2 moderate, 1.2-2.0 large and &gt; 2.0 very large. The precision of these estimates will be indicated by 90% confidence limits. An effect will be inferred to be unclear if its confidence interval spanned substantial positive and substantial negative values (+/- 0.2 of the between-subject standard deviation). As this study is being conducted to inform sporting organisations and generally sporting teams have small numbers, this number of participants was selected by an experienced researcher in the field and was selected so that if results show significance researchers can be more confident that this can be translated into practice. Also this study is somewhat exploratory to determine if this is an area warranting further investigation so there is a possibility for a larger study to be conducted in the future if results look promising. </statisticalmethods>
