  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This registry is designed as a multi-centre longitudinal cohort study of patients diagnosed
      with HCC between 1st January 2013 and 30th June 2018 in nine countries (ie, Korea, Taiwan,
      Thailand, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore). Approximately 30%
      of the sample size will be identified retrospectively and 70% will be identified
      prospectively from the start date of the registry (October 2016), with an even distribution
      of consecutively diagnosed patients within the different years.</summary>
