Treatment: surgery - Surgery

Experimental: Cohort 1 - Participants completed protocol NTMT-01. All participants received surgery to implant NT-501. All participants received ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).

Experimental: Cohort 2 - Participants completed protocol NTMT-02. Participants received surgery to implant NT-501 or sham surgery to mimic implant procedure. Participants that received NT-501 implant were exposed to ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).


Other interventions: Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)
The investigational product is the NT-501 encapsulated cell system, which consists of cells encapsulated within a semi-permeable polymer membrane and supportive matrices. NT-501 contains NTC-201 cells that secrete recombinant human CNTF, which were derived from genetically modified NTC-200 cells.

Treatment: surgery: Surgery
Surgery to implant device for NT-501 or sham surgery
