  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One important clinical challenge in older individuals is maintaining mobility in the absence of pain.  Peripheral arterial disease affects up to 12% of adults over 50 and impairs quality of life due to intermittent claudication causing pain and limiting mobility.  Conventional therapies have only modest effect in improving symptoms.  We hypothesise that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (with ramipril), which causes arterial vasodilation, also improves clinical symptoms in patients with peripheral arterial disease.</summary>
