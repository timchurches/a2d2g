    <statisticalmethods>Pearsons Correlation Coefficient will be used to measure relationships between normally distributed continuous variables.  Where data are normally distributed, differences between groups will also be identified by Students t-tests.  These will be used to establish the effectiveness of baclofen in reducing cognitive impairment during alcohol withdrawal in alcohol dependent people.   Other exploratory analyses will be aimed at identifying the relationship of the results of baclofen use and the additional variables recorded.  Where the relationship between baclofen and other variable is binary (yes/no) logistic regression will be used.  For example for gender the odds of sub range levels comparing males and females will be compared.  
This is a pilot study which is designed to establish the effectiveness of this research method. One prior study using this method was able to demonstrate significant results with 16 participants so this study is expected to have useful results with 20 participants</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol Dependence is a disorder with multiple adverse health and social impacts. Recent research has suggested that some of the ongoing tendency for relapse to heavy drinking is a consequence of pre frontal lobe dysfunction.  An established marker of this dysfunction is high frequency beta electroencephalogram dysfunction.  This pilot trial is designed to establish if the medication, baclofen, reduces this electroencephalographic marker. This medication has been used widely for this purpose in Australia and other countries based on empirical observations of its benefit for alcohol dependence.  This study will hopefully further elucidate its mechanism of action in this condition. </summary>
