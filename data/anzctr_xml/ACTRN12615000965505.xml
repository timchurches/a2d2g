  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will attend the Physiotherapy Dept for a supervised exercise programme twice weekly. They will attend for 24 sessions of 1 hour each, delivered twice  weekly over a 12 week intervention period.  They will attend the gym and the hydrotherapy pool at SCGH. Patients will be part of a group doing 1 hour of land based and 1 hour of water based exercise classes each week. These will be supervised by a Physiotherapist. 

The land/gym based exercise class will include a combination of balance and strength training using walking exercises, stepup and down exercises, theraband/elastic exercises, free weights and quadriceps machines and cycling. The pool exercise class will include a walking programme, stepping exercises, buoyancy assisted exercises for balance and specific water resisted leg strengthening exercises.

Once each fortnight they will also receive manual therapy from a post-graduate qualified (Musculoskeletal) Physiotherapist. Patients will receive a total of 6 sessions of 10 minutes duration each, over the 12 week intervention period, of manual therapy. This will include gliding techniques to the patella and soft tissue techniques to the surrounding muscles.

All patients will be registered for each session on an attendance sheet as per usual Physiotherapy Outpatient Department practice. Patient notes will also be completed on each occasion of service, including the date, treatment administered and type of exercise undertaken. These records wil be kept in accordance with the infrastructure already in place in the Department.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation:
Using a type 1 error rate of 5%, power of 80% and an expected standard deviation in the difference in WOMAC scores from pre- to post-treatment of 55 points, we require a sample size of 76 participants per group to detect a difference of 25 points in the mean pre-post differences of WOMAC scores between treatment and control groups. The target sample of 200 was decided upon to take into account potential drop outs from the study once it has commenced.

Statistical Analysis Plan:
Linear mixed models will be used to compare differences from pre- to post-treatment in WOMAC scores between the treatment and control groups. Fixed factors of group and time (pre-treatment vs. post-treatment) will be used along with a random effect of individual.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine whether patients who are waiting on a surgical waitlist for Total Knee Replacement, can decrease pain by participating in regular supervised exercise, together with targeted manual therapy.
HYPOTHESIS: Patients with severe OA of the knee who participate in a Physiotherapy intervention programme will experience a reduction in knee pain.</summary>
