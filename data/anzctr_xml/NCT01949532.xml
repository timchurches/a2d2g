    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Carfilzomib

Experimental: Normal Renal Function - Participants with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] = 75 mL/min) received carfilzomib 20 mg/m² intravenous infusion (IV) on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1, followed by 27 mg/m² IV on days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of cycle 1. Participants who adequately tolerated dosing at 27 mg/m² received carfilzomib 56 mg/m² IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of cycle 2 and all subsequent cycles. Participants continued treatment until confirmed progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, study closure, or death.

Experimental: End Stage Renal Disease - Participants with end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis) received carfilzomib 20 mg/m² intravenous infusion (IV) on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1, followed by 27 mg/m² IV on days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of cycle 1. Participants who adequately tolerated dosing at 27 mg/m² received carfilzomib 56 mg/m² IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of cycle 2 and all subsequent cycles. Participants continued treatment until confirmed progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, study closure, or death.


Treatment: drugs: Carfilzomib

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - Determination of the severity of all adverse events was assessed following the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.03, where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Fatal.
A Serious AE is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:
Death,
Life-threatening experience;
Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization,
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization.
Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) are adverse events considered related to carfilzomib by the investigator, including those with unknown relationship.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see how the body and the cancer react to carfilzomib,
      including measuring the amount of the study drug in the blood at certain times following
      dosing. This study is being done in people with normal kidney function and those with
      end-stage renal disease to see if they respond differently to the study drug.</summary>
