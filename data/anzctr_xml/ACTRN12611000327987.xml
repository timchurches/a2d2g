  <interventions>
    <interventions>Amplitude integrated electroencephalography monitoring will be applied to consented newborn infants admitted to participating Neonatal Intensive Care Units. Infants will be randomized into two groups:

(1) Clinical seizure group (CSG) - infants  who will recieve treatment of clinical seizures alone - this is standard treatment (electrographic seizures will not be revealed to the treating physician).  

(2) Electrographic seizure group (ESG) - infants who will be treated for both clinical and electrographic seizures. Electrographic seizures will be detected by a bedside amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) monitor. Monitoring will be applied for five days. 

Treatment of seizures in both groups will follow a strict alogrithim based on current standard practice. Anticonvulsants used will include phenobarbitone, phenytoin and midazolam at standard clinical dosage.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Treatment (Clinical seizure group) - The comparator used is the  treatment of seizures detected on clinical seizure activity alone which is the standard of care in most Neonatal Intensive Care Units. 
A conventional EEG(electroencephologram) will be taken for one hour at the first available opportunity to ensure infants are not in non-convulsive status epilepticus (infant will be withdrawn from the study if status is verified) and decisions to obtain further EEG's will be at the discretion of the primary medical team as per standard care.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All cause mortality as assessed by data linkage to medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 years of age of participant unless death occurs during the intervention phase.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severe disability as defined as motor and/or cognitive delay more than one standard deviation below the mean (i.e. 15 points) measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd edition</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 years of age of participant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>MRI injury - will  be qualitatively scored using a previously published scoring system based on signal from the cortex, white matter and deep nuclear grey matter being scored as normal, mildly abnormal, moderately abnormal or severely abnormal. Scoring system is referenced in the following publication:
Inder TE. Wells SJ. Mogridge NB. Spencer C. Volpe JJ. Defining the nature of the cerebral abnormalities in the premature infant: a qualitative magnetic resonance imaging study. Journal of Pediatrics. 143(2):171-9, 2003 Aug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>10-14 days days of life.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Seizure burden - will be measured as the total duration of electrographic seizures for the duration of the intervention phase. Accumulative total number of seizure minutes will be calculated from both the medical record and the aEEG and recorded on the appropriate CRF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>10 - 14 days of life</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anti-convulsant use - throughout the inpatient period, anti-convulsant use will be entered daily into the CRF. Data verification will be performed using the participants medical records. Total dosage in mg/kg of each anticonvulsant used during initial inpatient stay will be recorded.

At 2 year follow up, anti-convulsant use will be assessed from parent recall/reporting and through access to the participants medical record. This data will  be entered into the appropriate CRF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two time points: 

1. During in-patient period
2. At 2 year follow up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Length of inpatient stay during initial admission- will be calculated from recorded time of admission to recorded time of discharge (Hours/Days) as per the participants medical record. This figure will be entered into the appropriate CRF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Discharge from hospital</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Development of epilepsy - will be assessed from parent reporting and medical record data. This outcome will be dependent upon the participant fulfilling the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy ascribed by the treating paediatrician or neurologist. This diagnosis will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 year follow up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to full suck feeds - will be assessed and verified from the participants medical record  and clinical medical/nursing team. Participants will be assessed as having achieved full suck feeds when they are able to suck all of their feeds for a full 24 hour period, without supplemental feeds via a nasogastric tube.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During in-patient period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential subjects will be identified by study staff located at participating sites and the parents will be approached to determine their interest in participation in the project. Those parents who express interest will be provided with an information statement and consent form. All ethical and ICH/GCP procedures will be adhered to in respect to the consent process.  

Once informed consent has been obtained by the Principal Investigator or his/her delegate, the infant will be randomized by the site via a web based randomisation procedure available 24 hours per day. Should access to the internet be disrupted for any reason, investigators will be able to call the Coorodinating centre on a mobile number for manual randomisation.

Investigators will be required to enter basic subject data such as age, gender, diagnosis at the time of randomisation. Treatment allocation will then be computer generated. Investigators will not be able to influence treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation has been stratified by diagnosis - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or other. Therefore, there will be 2 strata.

Treatment allocation is then computer generated using block randomisation with variable block sizes by an independent statistician.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Due to the design of this study it is not possible to conceal treatment allocation from the parents or the treating clinicians as it will be obvious which infants have their monitor covered.

However, at the 2 year follow up the psychologist conducting the assessment of the primary outcome, will effectively be blinded to treatment allocations as they will not have been involved in the inpatient care of the participating infants and parents will be asked not to reveal their treatment allocation to the psychologist.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Doctors know that seizures occur more often in babies than older children. Seizures in babies may result in damage to their brain that may lead to epilepsy or affect their learning, thinking and memory. There is not a lot of research as to the best way to treat seizures in babies and to protect their brain function.

The aim of this research project is to compare the treatment of seizures that are physically seen by doctors and nurses (standard clinical care) to when seizures are detected using an amplitude integrated electroencephalograph monitor (aEEG), to see which method is better at protecting brain function in the longer term.

We hope a total of 630 babies will take part in this study. Half of the babies will receive standard treatment and half will be treated when a seizure is seen on the aEEG monitor. After the babies have been discharged from hospital we will follow them up at 2 years of age to assess their development. 

This research project is important because it may change the way doctors treat seizures in babies in the future, and we want to make sure that our treatment is protecting the babies brain.</summary>
