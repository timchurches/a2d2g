    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - EDS-EP dose range of ~5-10 mg DSP/infusion
Treatment: drugs - EDS-EP dose range of ~14-22 mg DSP/infusion
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: EDS-EP dose range of ~5-10 mg DSP/infusion - Drug: EDS-EP dose range of ~5-10 mg DSP/infusion EDS-EP dose range of ~5-10 mg DSP/infusion: A DSP loading quantity of 50.0 mg will be added to the EDS process, by using 2.0 mL of the 25 mg/mL DSP solution to deliver an EDS dose range of ~5-10 mg. DSP is diluted with 11 mL sterile water for injection in the same syringe, for a total of 13.0 mL.

EryDex System end product

Experimental: EDS-EP dose range of ~14-22 mg DSP/infusion - Drug: DSP/infusion EDS-EP dose range of ~14-22 mg DSP/infusion DSP/infusion EDS-EP dose range of ~14-22 mg DSP/infusion: A DSP loading quantity of 125 mg will be added to the EDS process, by using 5.0 mL of the 25 mg/mL DSP solution to deliver an EDS dose range of 14-22 mg. DSP is diluted with 11 mL sterile water for injection in the same syringe, for a total of 16 mL.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo EDS infusion - Patients will be treated with autologous erythrocytes prepared with the EDS process using a placebo solution (5 mL of 0.372% NaCl solution) instead of experimental drug (DSP). Placebo is diluted with 11 mL sterile water for injection in the same syringe, for a total of 16 mL.

    <inclusivecriteria>Main 

          -  Patient meets clinical criteria for diagnosis of AT. The neurological signs of AT
             (incoordination of the head and eyes in lateral gaze deflection, gait ataxia
             associated with an inappropriately narrow base) must be documented.

          -  Patient is in autonomous gait or is helped by periodic use of a support.

          -  Patient will be investigated for the proven genetic diagnosis of AT (prior
             documentation or by central laboratory test report).

          -  Patient is at least 6 years of age, of either sex

          -  Body weight &gt; 15 kg.

          -  The patient and his/her parent/caregiver (if below the age of consent), or a legal
             representative, has provided written informed consent to participate. If consent is
             provided solely by the caregiver in accordance with local regulations, the patient
             must provide assent to participate in the study.

             determined by the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.

          -  Chronic condition or prior allergic reaction representing a contraindication to the
             use of dexamethasone or other steroid drugs.

          -  Has participated in any other trial with an investigational drug and received a dose
             within 30 days or 10 half-lives (whichever is greater) from the start of the 30-day
             Screening Period.

          -  Has participated in a previous trial with EDS.

          -  Requires any concomitant medication prohibited by the protocol.

          -  Has taken a drug or treatment known to cause major organ system toxicity during the
             past year.

          -  Use of any drug that is a strong inducer/inhibitor of CYP3A4 within 4 weeks before
