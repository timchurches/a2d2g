  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness and safety of the study drug RAD001
      in patients with advanced (metastatic) cholangiocarcinoma. Palliative chemotherapy provides
      some benefit to this group of patients. However, chemotherapy treatment only shows low rates
      of radiological response and short times to tumour progression. Therefore, further treatment
      options are urgently required.

      In laboratory studies, RAD001 has been shown to interrupt the signals that cancer cells use
      to grow, spread and form new blood vessels (angiogenesis). RAD001 has been approved for the
      treatment of kidney cancer. It has also been approved for use in Australia for the treatment
      of patients with kidney and liver transplants, and has been used in thousands of patients
      worldwide for this indication. Preliminary studies suggest that RAD001 may have activity in a
      range of other cancers. This study will evaluate the activity of RAD001 in advanced
      cholangiocarcinoma.</summary>
