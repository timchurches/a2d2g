  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>At present, about 50% of homosexual men have HIV tests at least once per year. Increasing this proportion is predicted to reduce the rate of HIV transmission in the population, due to changes in sexual behaviour brought about by diagnosis. Rapid HIV tests are not currently approved or available for general use in Australia, but these may prove more accepatable because patients do not need to return for a second consultation for their result and a less invasive sample is required. This study is a randomised trial of the effect of making rapid HIV tests available to men having sex with men (MSM) on the frequency with which they have HIV tests. 
Consenting HIV-negative MSM requesting an HIV test at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) will be randomised in equal proportion to either onging access to a rapid test for 18 months or to standard laboratory-based serology (which requires them to return for their result in a week).
This is not blinded; both groups are sent three-monthly reminders by e-mail and SMS, reminding them of their study allocation, and asking them to complete six-monthly questionnaires on sexual behaviour and whether they have had HIV tests elsewhere.</summary>
