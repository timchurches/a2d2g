  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Male or female subjects, aged 18 years or above at the point of screening for
             participation.

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
             this clinical investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are able to understand this
             clinical investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing
             to return to the hospital for all the required post-treatment follow-ups.

          -  Subjects with non-inflammatory osteoarthritis of the hip who require a primary total
             hip replacement and are considered suitable for a cementless femoral and acetabular
             component.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that
             would compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
             could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
             the last 6 months. This exclusion does not apply to those subjects who are
             participating in the pilot investigation of the DePuy Silent Hip (CT01/27)

          -  Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

          -  Subjects who have osteonecrosis of the femoral neck

          -  Subjects with significant bone loss or gross deformity in the region of the neck of
             the femur as identified on the pre-operative radiographs, where in the Investigator's
             opinion, there could be considerable migration of the DePuy Silent Hip or a
             significant chance of fracture of the femoral shaft and/or the lack of adequate bone
             to support the DePuy Silent Hip.

          -  Subjects with a Charnley C classification.

          -  Subjects with an active local or systemic infection.

          -  Subjects with loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in
             the affected limb rendering the arthroplasty procedure unjustified.

          -  Subjects with Paget's disease</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the Silent hip is effective in the treatment of
      patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the
      study will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical
      and x-ray assessments. A subset of patients will undergo scans to allow the bone mineral
      density of the bone surrounding the implant to be monitored</summary>
