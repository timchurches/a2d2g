  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist of a sheet of paper, generated and printed automatically, given to the patient when he or she arrives for a consultation at a general practice.   Each patient will receive a sheet no more often than every six months, during the one year trial period.  The sheet will contain information about preventive activities that are indicated for the patient, why they are important, when each activity has last been performed, the result, finding or action at that time, and when the activity was or is due to be performed next.  The sheet will encourage the patient to discuss the information on the sheet with their doctor or nurse in the imminent consultation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: this will be whatever care the general practitioner would normally provide for that particular patient at that particular consultation.  This will differ between patients, based on each patient's age, gender and known medical history, and may differ between visits made by the same patient, depending on whether any indicated preventive activities have become due and/or been performed at or since the previous consultation.</comparator>

General practices are randomly allocated to intervention or control group.
The nature of the intervention means that allocation cannot be concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Practices in each Division of General Practice will be ranked on their baseline performance of preventive activities, and allocated alternately to intervention or control group.   Divisions of General Practice will be ranked according to the aggregate preventive performance of participating practices in them.  

A random number provided by statistician will determine whether the the highest-ranked practice in the highest-ranked Division of General Practice is allocated to intervention or control group, and allocation of practices will alternate down the list of practices thereafter.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial seeks to discover whether giving patients arriving for consultations at general practices a summary of their preventive care status, that encourages them to discuss this with the GP or nurse that they are about to see, results in increased performance of preventive activities that are recommended and due to be performed for that patient. The study is aimed at improving the performance of a wide range of preventive activities, including all routine child and adult immunisations, screening for common chronic conditions including high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol (hyperlipidaemia), diabetes and kidney disease, and prevention and early detection of a range of cancers. Who is it for? All patients attending a participating practice during the trial will be enrolled automatically in this study. Trial Details: The intervention will consist of a sheet of paper, generated and printed automatically, given to you when you arrive for a consultation at a general practice. You will receive no more than two information sheets, one every six months, over the one year trial period. The sheet will contain information about preventive activities that are recommended for you based on your age, gender and known medical history, why they are important, when each activity has last been performed, the result, finding or action at that time, and when the activity was or is due to be performed next. The sheet will encourage you to discuss the information on the sheet with your doctor or nurse in the imminent consultation. You will not be required to re-attend the practice for the purposes of this study, but can attend as and when you feel it is necessary or as agreed between you and your GP or nurse.  If your general practice is randomly allocated to be in the usual care control group, all care will occur as it normally would.</summary>
