  <interventions>
    <interventions>Using hair as a biological sample to test for drugs known to be identified in drug-facilitated sexual assault. Hair is analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) and by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for other drugs.
People in whom drug facilitated sexual assault is suspected will be asked to provide 2 samples of hair (collected by examiner) about a pencil thickness each. This will be taken at 4-12 weeks after alleged sexual assault. One sample will be analysed for GHB and the other sample will be used for the other drugs.
This will be in addition to blood and urine samples taken as determined by the Sexual Assault Service protocols.
Hair samples will be collected, stored and analysed in batches over a 2 year period which is the duration calculated to recruit 100 participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>Currently, urine and blood are the biological samples routinely used to identify drugs that may be involved in drug-facilitated sexual assault.
Each participant will undergo hair testing. Blood and urine testing will also be done in the participant if it would normally be done as per Sexual Assault Service guidelines ie Blood sample if presentation within 24 hours of alleged sexual assault and urine sample if presentation within one week.
Blood and urine samples undergo screening, identification and quantitation for basic drugs (eg benzodiazepines, narcotic analgesics, anti-histamines, alcohol, etc) by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, the samples undergo an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for some amphetamines, morphine and cannabinoids.
Samples will be collected, stored and analysed in batches over a 2 year period which is the duration calculated to recruit 100 participants.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare hair drug analysis with urine and blood drug analysis which is currently used for investigating allegations of drug facilitated sexual assault (DFSA). Our hypothesis is that hair drug analysis will detect additional drugs than those detected in urine and blood samples.
In addition, we hope to document drugs involved in suspicions of DFSA in the South Australian population, identify which drugs may have improved detection with hair toxicology and document time frames for drug detection in different biological specimens.</summary>
