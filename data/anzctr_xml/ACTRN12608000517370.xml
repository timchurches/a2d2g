  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to 1 of 2 treatments of 6 weeks duration each and crossed over at the end of each 6 weeks to the alternative. The treatments are either test foods (rice, cereal, bread) consumed daily containing either wholegrain or refined flour. Rice (white/brown) is 60gram raw weight per day, cereal is(weeties/cornflakes) 70gram per day, bread (white/wholemeal multigrain) is 6 slices per day. The wholegrain and refined foods will provide 55% of the total energy of the participants diet (based on 8000 kilojoules). Participants will be required to incorporate the test foods into their existing diet by replacing like foods. In this way efforts will be made to keep the diet kilojoule stable and hence participant weight stable.
There is a 2 week washout period between each treatment phase and participants will consume their usual diet for this time.</interventions>
    <comparator>Refined flour is the control treatment.
When refined flour is produced commercially, the germ and outer layers of the grain are removed prior to grinding. This flour consists almost entirely of endosperm, for example the floury part of the kernel. Participants will consume 60gm raw weight per day of white rice, 70gm per day of cornflakes, 6 slices of white bread per day.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A 14 week study investigating whether whole grain rich diets have beneficial effects on the markers of metabolic syndrome compared to diets rich in refined grains. There will be 2 different diets of 6 weeks each duration. Participants will be required to follow one diet for 6 weeks, then a 2 week "Wash out" (normal eating pattern) before following the second diet for 6 weeks. The study will compare the effect of a diet rich in whole grain foods versus a diet rich in refined grain foods on glucose levels and clot breakdown.</summary>
