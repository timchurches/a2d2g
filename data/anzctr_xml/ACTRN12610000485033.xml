  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week intervention which involves training in mindfulness meditation, a practice of self-regulating attention in a present-moment-oriented, non-judgmental manner, that lowers reactivity to stress triggers.   Participants are required to attend a weekly two-hour training session, a one-day retreat (mid-intervention) and complete daily homework in the form of mindfulness exercises.  During the course, participants will learn formal mindfulness practices of sitting meditation, walking meditation, and mindful yoga and how to integrate practice into everyday life.  Training sessions will be administered in group classes (10 people per group) by the PhD candidate who is trained in teaching MBSR.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be randomly assigned to either the MBSR condition or treatment as usual.  Treatment as usual means routine monitoring of participants by their Consultant Rheumatologists and General Practitioners (GPs) including monthly blood samples and regular joint assessments and participants' adherence to usual medication regimes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain as measured by visual analogue, pain-related acceptance as measured by the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (McCracken et al, 2004) and disease activity as assessed by the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28-CRP), a composite measure reflecting the number of tender and swollen joints, C-reactive Protein and patients' assessment of general health on a 100-mm visual analogue scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, immediately post-intervention, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression/anxiety as measured by the Hospital and Anxiety Scale (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 2007) and psychological well-being (Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995).</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded if they have major psychiatric illness, previous experience of mindfulness meditation, significant experience of any other type of meditation or are unable to attend study sessions.

    <concealment>Potential participants will be sent a letter inviting them to take part in the study.  The PhD student will contact interested participants by phone to discuss the study and to complete screening.  Eligible participants will then give written consent to participate and be enrolled in the study.  Allocation of participants to groups will be centrally randomized by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Using a computer program, participants will be assigned to groups on the basis of blocked randomization, to ensure that the number of males and females allocated to groups reflects the relative incidence of Rheumatoid Arthritis in each gender (approximately 3:1 female to male ratio within the general population).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a mind-body intervention called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to improve the psychological and physical well-being of individuals who have Rheumatoid Arthritis.  The study will also explore how the intervention works i.e. the processes of change that occur during mindfulness training which may explain any significant improvements in outcome following the intervention.  Participants will be randomly assigned to MBSR or treatment as usual and will be assessed at several time-points on a range of psychological, physical and clinical health outcomes.</summary>
