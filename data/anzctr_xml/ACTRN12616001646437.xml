  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part A (Cohorts 1 - 5): Fasted
Cohort 1a: 0.5 mg GS-9688 or placebo, oral tablet, single dose (sentinel group of 2 subjects)
Cohort 1b: 0.5 mg GS-9688 or placebo, oral tablet, single dose
Cohort 2: 1.5 mg GS-9688 or placebo, oral tablet, single dose
Cohort 3: 5 mg GS-9688 or placebo, oral tablet, single dose
Cohort 4: 0.5 mg to 15 mg GS-9688 or placebo, oral tablet, single dose
Cohort 5: 0.5 mg to 30 mg GS-9688 or placebo, oral tablet, single dose

Cohort 1 will be conducted in two separate groups with a Sentinel group (Cohort 1a) of 2 subjects (1 active: 1 placebo) and Cohort 1b for the remaining 13 subjects (11 active: 2 placebo). Cohort 1a safety data up to and including Day 5 will  support commencement of dosing (Day 1) for Cohort 1b.
Cohorts 4 and 5 dose will be decided based on available safety and PK and PD data from cohorts 1 - 3.

Part B (Cohort 6): Food Effect
Cohort 6 - Day 1: 0.5 mg to 30 mg GS-9688, oral tablet, single dose, fasted
Cohort 6 - Day 8: 0.5 mg to 30 mg GS-9688, oral tablet, single dose, fed state
(Part B dose will be determined based on safety and available PK and PD data from within Part A, Cohort 6 may be initiated in parallel with cohorts in Part A if the dose under evaluation is at or below a dose that has already been evaluated.)

Part C (Cohort 7): Adaptive Cohort
Cohort 7 - Day 1: 0.5 mg to 30 mg GS-9688 or placebo, oral tablet, single dose, fasted or fed state
Cohort 7 - Day 8: 0.5 mg to 30 mg GS-9688 or placebo, oral tablet, single dose, fasted or fed state
(Dose and mode of administration (fed or fasted) will be decided based on available safety and PK and PD data from Parts A and B)
GS-9688 dose will be at or below the highest dose from which data are available from Parts A and B.
Day 1 and day 8 dose will be the same and the same conditions will apply (fed or fasted).

*Fasted: no food or liquids, except water, for at least 10 hours prior to dosing
*Fed State: administered with a moderate fat meal (~ 600 kcal; 25-30% fat) and with 240 mL of water after an overnight fast (no food or liquids, except water for at least 10 hours).

The investigator will maintain an accurate inventory of all study drug(s). Each dose of the study drug(s) administered at the study center will be administered by qualified study center staff. The dose of study drug(s) administered to subjects in the clinic under the supervision of staff will be accurately recorded, which indicates the date and quantity of each dosage formulation dispensed to individual subjects.
Used and unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, are to be returned to the shipping facility from which it came for destruction following drug accountability and drug inventory reconciliation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo-to-match (PTM) GS-9688 tablets are identical in size, shape, color and appearance to the corresponding active strength GS-9688 tablets. The PTM GS-9688 tablet cores contain commonly used excipients including lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Phase 1 study entails administration of GS-9688 to humans for the first time with the objective of evaluating in a step-wise fashion the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD), and thereby understand the clinical pharmacology profile of GS-9688 to determine if it is suitable for further clinical development. 
The study will proceed in three parts. Part A will first evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single doses of GS-9688 administered in the fasted state via a pre specified dose escalation through 3 cohorts. As guided by the safety and available PK and PD data from pre-specified cohorts, the adaptive Part A will commence to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of GS-9688 with dose selection (up to 30 mg) through the next 2 cohorts. The effect of food (moderate-fat calorie meal) will be explored in Part B in which the subjects will receive single doses of GS-9688 one week apart. The doses to be evaluated in Part B will be informed by the safety and available PK and PD data from Parts A (pre-specified and adaptive cohorts). The results from Parts A and B will subsequently inform the dose and the mode of administration (fed or fasted) of GS-9688 in Part C, designed to examine the safety and PK and PD of two single doses of GS-9688 administered one week apart.</summary>
