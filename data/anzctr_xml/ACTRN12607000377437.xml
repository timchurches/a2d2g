    <interventions>Patients will be randomly allocated into groups to commence the trial (placebo and two treatment conditions).                                                                                                                               The SAM-e condition receive capsules containing SAM-e 400mg or 800 mg. Subjects will be required to take the capsules (x2) daily in the morning throughout the trial. Each treatment condition is of 8 weeks duration. All individuals will be exposed to all treatment conditions in this repeated measures design of 24 weeks duration in total.</interventions>

    <concealment>Subjects were referred by their medical practitioner and attended an information evening where they were enrolled. For each diagnostic category, those who meet the inclusion criteria are then randomly allocated to a starting treatment condition to determine the order of treatments in this trial. This random allocation is achieved by using a randomisation table created by computer software. Both subject and experimenter will be blind to the treatment conditions.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fundamentally, the trial aims to conduct a gold-standard test of the clinical impact of SAM-e in the treatment of depressed mood and general symptoms of fibromyalgia (FMS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).  

We have previously conducted a trial with FMS patients using a low dose of SAM-e over a brief timeframe. The results of this study were encouraging and revealed the possibility that a circadian  mechanism relying upon adequate SAM-e levels in the brain may provide a new avenue for treatment.  We seek to investigate this finding in a comprehensive trial of SAM-e and to include patients with CFS.

As such, salient clinical and pathological parameters will be assessed over a 24-week period in 180 patients who will be provided with the supplement (12 weeks) and placebo preparation (12 weeks).  On the basis of previous literature, it is hypothesised that patients in the active treatment group will experience moderate but significant improvements across the clinical measures, and that these gains will be significantly greater than any reported in the placebo group. All patients will provide informed consent. All procedures will be conducted under medical supervision and the preparation itself is very safe when used in the manner proposed for the trial.</summary>
