  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate the effects of clinically used vasopressor drugs versus saline infusion on cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, in patients placed into beach chair position for shoulder surgery. Following interscalene brachial plexus anaesthesia with 20-30 ml ropivicaine 0.75%, general anaesthesia will be induced with propofol 50-200mg and maintained on sevoflurane 2-3%. Following stabilisation an infusion of either noradrenaline (20 microg/ml), phenylephrine (100 microg/ml), ephedrine (300 microg/ml) or vasopressin (0.3 U/ml) will be commenced. Infusions are equipotent in concentration and will initially commence at a rate of 6 ml/hr. At 2.5 minutely intervals, the infusion rate will be increased stepwise to 15, 30, 45 and 60 ml/hr. Infusion is titrated until the mean arterial pressure increases to 120 % baseline/or cerebral desaturation decreases to 80% baseline. Infusion is maintained within these limits whilst patient placed into beachchair position for surgery. The duration of intervention is 1 hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>In control patients saline will be infused at the same rate as the vasopressor infusion, and for the same duration. Infusions will be unmarked and contents unknown to the observer making measurements.</comparator>

    <concealment>Discussion of the study with patient prior to surgery, followed by informed, written consent.
Placement in control or intervention groups will be decided via sealed envelopes on day of procedure. Patients will be randomised to one of five groups:
Arm 1: Normal saline control
Arm 2: Noradrenaline (20 microg/ml)
Arm 3: Phenylephrine (100 microg/ml))
Arm 4: Ephedrine ( 300 microg/ml)
Arm 5: Vasopressin ( 0.3 U/ml)</concealment>
    <sequence>Equal numbers of randomisation pairs using a randomisation table created by computer software,and assigned in this order to sealed envelopes by an independent person.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The anaesthetist is blinded to the infusion and an independent observer will record study measurements</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Data are presented as mean (SD). In a previous study vasopressor infusion was shown to have significant effects on MAP and ScO2 during BCP, with PE (100microgram.kg-1.min-1) increasing MAP by 38 mmHg, and decreasing ScO2 by 7%. Analysis indicated that a sample size of n = 40 (8 each group) was required to compare vasopressors (alpha 0.05, power 0.8). This sample number was particularly feasible for our resources and time commitment. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During shoulder surgery patients are positioned into an upright sitting position for optimal access to the shoulder joint.

In some patients blood pressure may decrease and a concern of the anaesthetist is whether sufficient blood reaches the brain during such surgery. Even though this can be routinely treated with cardiac drugs, the exact effect of this treatment on the brain is unknown. 

This study plans to investigate the changes in flow to the brain when patients are anaesthetised and placed upright.   The surgery will be performed using the anaesthetic technique that we use for the majority of the surgeons cases.

Special monitoring of the oxygen level within the brain, using reflected light waves, will be used. This technique is non-invasive and presents no harm to the patient. The study will investigate whether the administration of medication to gently increase blood pressure has an effect on blood flow to the brain, and on recovery following surgery. A number of commonly used drugs will be studied by infusing them into a large vein within the arm.

By agreeing to the study patients will give us permission to make these extra measurements during anaesthesia. This will help us understand whether we are protecting the brain during surgery.
