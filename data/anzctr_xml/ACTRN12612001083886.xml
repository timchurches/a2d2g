  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mindfulness Meditation training will be conducted in groups of approximately 10 patients per group. Participants will be contacted by the trained Mindfulness therapist (Alice Shires) and given information about the group that they have been allocated to. Each group session will be 2 hours and will be conducted on a weekly basis for 8 weeks.

Mindfulness training is a form of attentional training which requires a daily practice of deliberately focusing attention on ones own experience from moment to moment and in a non-judgmental way. Participants are helped to develop the ability to quickly recognise and inhibit their typical response to emerging thoughts, to prevent distractibility and refocus their attention on the breath. 
As participants develop these skills, they are then taught to scan their body systematically and develop an ability to feel both salient and more subtle sensations while purposefully inhibiting habitual, learned reactions. As participants have learned to do with their thoughts, participants develop an increasing ability to accept whatever arises in their body from moment to moment while remaining as non-reactive as possible. 
Participants will be taught mindful meditation techniques which are practised in the group session and then particpants are encouraged to continue daily practice between group sessions using guided meditation practice via CDs distributed in the group sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The attending to music control condition will control for non-specific effects of: attending a group; therapist attention and rapport; and the act of concentrating on an activity both within session and  between sessions.  Participants will attend the same number of sessions as the mindfuless group  for a matched time period (2 hour sessions weekly over 8 weeks), and will be encouraged to practice attending to music in between sessions by listening to music on CD's distributed in the group sessions . The therapist will guide participants through listening to relaxing music within the sessions.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in hippocampal volume and connectivity.
Hippocampal Volume: will be measured at baseline 6, 12 months and 24 months follow up. 
MRI scans will be digitized and sent to Professor Luder for analysis. The analysis will be based on previous pilot work (see Luders et al., 2009).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 6, 12 and 24 month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduced risk of relapse for those with a previous history of depression.
Relapses: 
Neurologist reported relapses will be assessed through the medical files. Self-reported relapses will be assessed via monthly email contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 6, 12 and 24 month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cortisol: We will assess Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning by measuring cortisol on wakening and in the evening. Cortisol exists in free form in saliva. Saliva will be collected using cotton dental rolls.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-treatment, 6 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up and 2 year follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression Centre for Epidemiological Studies (Depression) Scale (CES-D) will be used to asess for depression.The CES-D contains four factors that measure depressed affect, positive effect, somatic complaints or retarded activity and interpersonal relationships.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-treatment, 6 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up and 2 year follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety and stress will be measures by the Depression Anxiety abd Stress scale (DASS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-treatment, 6 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up and 2 year follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life (QOL): will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and each follow-up using the WHOQOL-BREF (The WHOQOL Group; 26-item), the brief version of the WHOQOL-100. The WHOQOL-BREF subscales are highly correlated with the WHOQOL-100 subscales (about r=.9), and they assess four QOL domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-treatment, 6 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up and 2 year follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fatigue severity will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and each follow-up using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (Krupp et al., 1989), a 9-item self-report scale assessing functional impairments resulting from fatigue over the past week, on 7-point Likert scales.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-treatment, 6 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up and 2 year follow-up</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be invited to take part in their study at the out-patient appointment. Participants will be explained about the study and given the participant information statement that will be approved by the relevant ethics committee. Those participants who consent will be given a series of questionnaires and be asked to either complete them before leaving the hospital or bring them to their next appointment for assessment. All participants will attend an assessment session where they will be assessed for the presence of a history of clinical depression by a research assistant prior to allocation. The participants will also be screened for any other exclusion criteria. Once the participants have completed the baseline assessment, an independent researcher blind to the patient's characteristics will reveal the allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be determined according to the www.randomizer.org. and concealed until after the participant has completed the baseline assessment</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mindfulness has been shown to be effective in treating fatigue and mood problems in people with MS. At the same time, there is evidence that training in mindfulness meditation can improve brain function - specifically increasing the volume of the hippocampus - in healthy people. MS is characterised by hippocampal loss early in the progression of the disease. This research project asks whether mindfulness could potentially protect against hippocampal loss in people with multiple sclerosis.</summary>
