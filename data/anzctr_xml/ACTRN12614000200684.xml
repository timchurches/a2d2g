  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with some diseases (e.g some cancers) or donors) may have stem cell mobilization treatments to increase numbers of stem cells released into the blood from bone marrow.  These can then be harvested from the blood for the patient to use for replenishment after chemotherapy.

Preliminary data in mice and humans support investigating ATL1102 as an agent for mobilising stem cells, in combination with G-CSF.

The trial participation period will be approximately six weeks, which includes screening, treatment and post-dose study follow-up. There will be a total of five clinical trial visits per subject.</summary>
