  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of post-operative chemotherapy for 12 weeks versus 24 weeks in patients with locally advanced colon cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are 18 years or above and have stage III colon cancer which has been fully resected (i.e. removed by surgery). You should not have undergone any previous chemotherapy for your cancer. Trial details Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will undergo chemotherapy for 12 weeks. Participants in the other group will undergo chemotherapy for 24 weeks. Chemotherapy will either be with the drugs oxaliplatin/5-FU or oxaliplatin/capecitabine depending on the preference of your treating doctor. Participants will be regularly assessed for a period of up to 7 years to determine disease free survival, overall survival, toxicity, cost effectiveness and quality of life.</summary>
