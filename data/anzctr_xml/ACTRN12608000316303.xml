    <interventions>15-20 minute physiotherapy screening/triage appointment within two days of admission to trial.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients on the waiting list with chronic conditions will be phoned. The researcher has a scripted procedure to inform about the trial, seek verbal consent, and screen for red flags. If the patient agrees to participate, the researcher draws out an envelope from a basket of pre-randomised group allocations, which has a script for the next stage of participating in the trial.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine if early intervention for chronic pain problems, provided in the form of physiotherapy triage, improves patient outcomes while they wait for their physiotherapy treatment. Triage involves a brief assessment, with advice about pain management, basic exercises and resource information.</summary>
