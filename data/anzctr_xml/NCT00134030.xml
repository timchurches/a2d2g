Active Comparator: Maintenance therapy group 1 arm I - Patient undergoes definitive surgery (therapeutic conventional surgery).

Patients also receive high-dose methotrexate (MTX) IV over 4 hours on day 1 in weeks 15, 16, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, and 29. Quality-of-life assessment, prior to start of Cycle 2, after recovery from the doxorubicin of Week 22 Cycle 5, Week 24/Cycle 5, week 72 (18 months after the start of treatment), week 144 (3 years after the start of treatment)

Experimental: Maintenance therapy group 1 arm II - Patient undergoes definitive surgery (therapeutic conventional surgery). Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride, cisplatin, and high-dose methotrexate (MTX) as in arm I. Patients than receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once daily on day 1 in weeks 30-104. Quality-of-life assessment, prior to start of Cycle 2, after recovery from the doxorubicin of Week 22 Cycle 5, Week 24/Cycle 5, week 72 (18 months after the start of treatment), week 144 (3 years after the start of treatment)

Experimental: Maintenance therapy group 2 arm II - Patient undergoes definitive surgery (therapeutic conventional surgery). Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 48 hours on days 1-2 in weeks 12, 20, 28, and 36 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 in weeks 12 and 28. Patients also receive high-dose methotrexate (MTX) IV over 4 hours on day 1 in weeks 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, and 40. Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 4 hours on days 1-5 in weeks 16, 24, and 32 and on days 1-3 in weeks 20 and 36 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 16, 24, and 32. Quality-of-life assessment, prior to start of Cycle 2, after recovery from the doxorubicin of Week 22 Cycle 5, Week 24/Cycle 5, week 72 (18 months after the start of treatment), week 144 (3 years after the start of treatment)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy followed by surgery and
      two different combination chemotherapy regimens with or without PEG-interferon alfa-2b to
      compare how well they work in treating patients with osteosarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as PEG-interferon alfa-2b, may interfere with
      the growth of tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the
      tumor so it can be removed. Giving combination chemotherapy together with PEG-interferon
      alfa-2b after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving
      combination therapy together with PEG-interferon alfa-2b is more effective than two different
      combination chemotherapy regimens alone after surgery in treating osteosarcoma.</summary>
