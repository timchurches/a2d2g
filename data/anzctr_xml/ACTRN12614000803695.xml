    <interventions>The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) and to compare focused versus radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of tennis elbow. The primary study endpoints will be an analysis of pain relief change and functional improvement inside all groups of patients (comparison before and after therapy inside each group) The secondary endpoint will be a follow-up observation (3, 6 and 12 weeks after the end of the study - comparison between both groups). 

Intervention:
Patients from group A will receive a focused shockwave therapy utilising the Wolf Piezowave device without anaesthesia. The lateral epicondyle will  receive a total of 2000 shocks during a session (4 Hz; 0.2 mJ/mm2). Each patient will have 3 sessions  (each session will be approximately 45 minutes long) at weekly intervals. 
Radial shock wave therapy making use of the Gymna Uniphy ShockMaster 500 will be applied to patients form group B also without anaesthesia. In the first stage of treatment, the lateral epicondyle will receive 2000 shocks (8 Hz, 2.5 bars). In the second stage, 2000 shocks will be applied to the dorsal part of the forearm with the same frequency and pressure. Each patient will participate in 3 therapeutic sessions (each session will be approximately 45 minutes long) at weekly intervals.

Measurements:
Before and after treatment, as well as 3, 6 and 12 weeks later, all patients will be evaluated:
- for the level of pain with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
- for the average strength muscle with a grip strength using a SH5001 dynamometer

    <concealment>Participants will be randomly allocated to the groups. Computer-generated random numbers will be sealed in sequentially numbered envelopes, and the group allocation be independent of the time and person delivering the treatment. The physician (research coordinator) who will allocate the subjects to groups have envelopes, each containing a piece of paper marked with either group A (focused ESWT) or B (radial ESWT) or C (placebo). The physician will select and openan envelope in the presence of a physiotherapist to see the symbol and then direct the patient to the corresponding group.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis and evaluation of the results will be based on the comparison of intra- and intergroup results. Statistical analysis of these results will be performed by means of the Statistica 10 software, manufactured by StatSoft (licence of Medical University of Silesia). All analysed intergroup variables will be checked with respect to their similarity (uniformity; chi2 NW). A critical significance level a (alpha) = 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant. For measurable variables (quantitative), arithmetic mean, standard deviations, medians and range of variability (extreme values) will be calculated. For qualitative variables, the frequency of occurrence (percentage) will be calculated. Comparison of intergroup results in order to determine the significance of the achieved differences, will be performed by means of parametric (ANOVA, Student's t-test, Welch's t test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney`s and Fischer tests, depending on meeting criteria for the specific test. Correlation of variables in the examined groups will also be checked.

To achieve study objectives the absolute minimal number of participants should be 20 in each group (for non-parametric tests). Smaller number of patients will not be enough from both statistical and clinical point of view (the smaller number of patients is not enough for reliable statistical analysis because of too large standard deviations due to characteristics of patients). However, the most reliable number od patients should be 30 in each comparative group (we will be able to use parametric tests). The reliable number of participants was estimated by Statistica 10 software, manufactured by StatSoft (licence of Medical University of Silesia).

In calculating our sample size we have allowed for:
1. 20% loss to follow up
2. Historical information from our unit that 45% of patients who are offered conservative (standard physical therapy) management for this condition opt for ESWT within 6 months.

This investigation has 95% power to detect a difference between group mean (SD) in the primary outcome pain (VAS) and muscle power of 12 patients.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Management of tennis elbow is a significant and difficult medical problem. Common interventions include rest, inelastic proximal forearm strap (functional brace) and analgesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, and surgery. Literature to substantiate these show that limited evidence supports the efficacy of drugs and surgical procedures, which are reported to have small effect sizes and only relieve pain in the short term. Current physiotherapy treatments, including extensor eccentric strengthening and progressive resistance exercise program, transverse friction massage, Cyriax and Mills manipulation, ultrasound, electrical stimulation and iontophoresis, low-dose laser therapy may provide short term pain relief but show minimal benefit over rest and advice in the medium to long term, making this a less cost effective treatment option. Modern, well-documented and promising methods from physical therapy are needed, as extracorporeal shock wave therapy. Radial ESWT is generated by pneumatic devices, which produce linear pressure with low energy values. The main role in radial ESWT plays the special cartridge that is located inside the generator. The energy is produced by the pressure wave, while compressed air starts accelerate the cartridge which strikes at the top of the applicator. The energy generated by the pressure wave is absorbed into the skin deep and spread with a widen beam to the larger target area.
Focused ESWT is generated by electromagnetic, electrohydraulic, and piezoelectric sources. Pressure pulses arise rapidly in range of 10-100 MPa and concentrate the acoustic energy beam in narrower target area with a penetration depth - muscle and fascia tissues.Based on a Medline and Pubmed database search and on a review of key journals, no previous study had been conducted to compare these two modalities of lateral epicondylitis treatment.
