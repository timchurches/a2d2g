  <interventions>
    <interventions>Between pre- and post-measures, the participants will be trained in neurofeedback using the nexus II system to enhance band amplitudes within specific individualised brain frequency bins (neurofeedback). Sessions will be approximately 30 minutes in duration and administered one on one by a physiologist. We anticipate 15 standardised conditioning sessions conducted 5 per week as per previous neurofeedback studies.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Sham Neurofeedback (randomised frequency condition)
The design of the control group will be identical to the experimental group however; will differ only in the brain frequency adjustments. 
Where the experimental group will have to enhance specific frequency amplitudes throughout ALL conditioning sessions, the controls will be dedicated to a randomised frequency paradigm. </comparator>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Due to the recruitment of participants for the current study allocation by randomisation will be difficult to assure a balance between characteristic groups i.e. gender and age.  
An acceptable alternative for treatment allocation is through utilising “minimisation”. This process will ensure balance between group’s (gender and age) in a smaller sample study. With minimisation the treatment allocated to the next participant enrolled in the trial depends (wholly or partly) on the characteristics of those participants already enrolled. The aim therefore is each allocation should minimise the imbalance across multiple factors.

</concealment>
    <sequence>Using the minimisation procedure explained above, minimisation will be performed with the aid of a free software program “minim” which was advised in the referenced article. The use of the software will ensure adherence to the protocol as the trial progresses. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The main hypothesis for the project is: Does an individualised neurofeedback protocol improve sleep in healthy individuals? To analyse this question a linear mixed model will be run for each of the baseline variables. The variables to be analysed are: total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE) and % of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM). The conditions tested: neurofeedback and control. Time points: Pre intervention and Post intervention. In addition to the linear mixed model baseline variables will be examined between the intervention group and the controls using an Independent Sample t-test to check for differences in sleep variables between both groups. Significance level will be set at p = 0.05.
The current sample size was selected based on power analysis (a=0.05,power=0.8,calculated sample size=15) using differences in total sleep time pre- and post- neurofeedback training in seventeen insomniacs (Cortoos et al. 2010)</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current sleep research in patients with insomnia has indicated the non- pharmacological intervention of neurofeedback (the ability to self-regulate brainwave frequencies) has the capability to successfully enhance sleep parameters. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an individualised neurofeedback protocol for optimising sleep in healthy individuals. With sleep believed to be one of the fundamental aspects of recovery and wellbeing, developing an effective non-pharmacological treatment for enhancing sleep has great potential to enhance recovery and everyday performances.</summary>
