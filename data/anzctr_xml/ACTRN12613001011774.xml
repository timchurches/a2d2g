    <interventions>Oral opioid analgesia post ceasarean section in the form of Controlled release Oxycodone 20mg twice daily for a maximum of 4 doses over a period of 48 hours, with Oxycodone immediate release 10 to 15mg orally at a minimum interval of 3 hours between doses as needed over a period of 48 hours post partum.  

Drug charts are monitored to monitor drug use over the mentioned period. 

Both test and control group will receive additional analgesia in the form of Paracetamol 1 gram oral, Ibuprofen 400mg regularly. Tramadol 50 - 100mg IV or oral is available as a rescue medication in case of poor pain control despite maximum use of the trial regimen. 

The anaesthetic for the caesarean section is standardised to a single shot spinal anaesthetic with a combination of Heavy Bupivavaine 0.5% and Fentanyl 15 - 25mcg, Paracetamol 1g and Diclofenac 100mg PR</interventions>
    <comparator>Opioid Post caesarean section pain relief in the form of intravenous morphine patient controlled analgesia. 

The regimen is as follows: Morphine 1 mg per ml in  100ml Saline (0.9%). Every successful push of the button will administer a dose of 1 ml (1mg) of morphine followed by a lockout of 5 minutes and no hourly limit. 

Patient controlled devices are monitored daily for 48 hours to note the doses of morphine being used. 
Both test and control group will receive additional analgesia in the form of Paracetamol 1 gram oral, Ibuprofen 400mg regularly. Tramadol 50 - 100mg IV or oral was available as a rescue medication in case of poor pain control despite maximum use of the trial regimen.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparing the pain scores, averaged  per 24 hours for a 48 hours, between the test (Oxydone) and control (Morphine) group. Patients are asked to use a numerical pain score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) to rate their pain. A pain score difference of 2 has been chosen to correlate with clinical significance. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations are done 6 hourly over a period of 48 hours, Patients sleep is not interrupted for observations.  Pain scores done on a 6 hourly basis are averaged using an area under the curve of a pain score time diagram to process the multiple observations from a single patient into a single numerical value for every 24 hours for a period of 48 hours. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparing the incidence of pruritis between the control (morphine) and the test (Oxycodone) group. The outcome is assesesed by the patient subjective reporting either the presence or absence of of pruritis. Nursing staff note the presence on an observations sheet. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations are done 6 hourly over a period of 48 hours, Patients sleep is not interrupted for observations.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nausea: incidence and severity (based on antiemtic use) comparing the control (morphine) and the test (Oxycodone) group. The outcome is assesesed by the patient subjective reporting either the presence or absence of of Nausea. Nursing staff note the presence on an observations sheet. The severity scale used is mild: Nausea present, no treatment required, moderate: Nausea present, treatment required, Severe: Vomiting</outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations are done 6 hourly over a period of 48 hours, Patients sleep is not interrupted for observations.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparing the incidence of sedation between the control (morphine) and the test (Oxycodone) group. Using sedation score from 1 to 5: 1 no sedation, 2 sedation present, but not problematic for patient, 3 sedation present enough to be a problem for the patient, 4 (Clinical significant sedation): patient difficult to wake, 5 coma. The outcome is assesesed by the patient subjective reporting either the presence or absence of of sedation and by the clinical assesment by the bursing staff.  Nursing staff note the level of sedation on an observations sheet. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations are done 6 hourly over a period of 48 hours, Patients sleep is not interrupted for observations.  '</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction is compared between the test and control group. Using a questionnaire which the patient has to complete: How would you rate your analgesia: 1 very bad, 2 bad, 3 reasonable, 4 good, 5 very good. Will they use it again and will they recommend it to a friend? </outcome>
      <timepoint>Once off Questionnaire the morning of the second day after caesarean section. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of a change in protocol required for patient or clinical reasons. The drug chart adn clincal notes are reviewed to identify a change to the randomised protocol. All efforts are made to identify the reason for the change, by reviewing chart, talking to patient, nursing and medical staff. A short summary of the events leading to the change in protocol is made on the assesment form. </outcome>
      <timepoint>48 hours post caesarean section </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Use of rescue analgesia medication above true trial protocol. This is assesed by reviewing the drug charts and noting the times and doses resque medication has been accessed on the as needed part of the chart. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 24 hours for 2 days post caesarean section </timepoint>

    <concealment>Contact is made with patients at the pre anaesthetic clinic prior to their Caesarean section. Patients are screened for exclusion criteria and are given verbal and written information about the trial. After informed consent patients are randomly assigned to either test or control group. 

The randomisation process is as follows: a randomisation list is produced using appropriate software. Participants are allocated a sequential number from 1 to 120. The numbers corresponds to randomly assigned test or control group. The recruitment officer is blinded to which group the patient will be randomised to at time of consent. The key to randomisation is held by a staff member not involved in recruitment. 

Following randomisation the participant is given written and verbal information relating to their analgesic regimen . </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants are assigned a number from 1 to 120. This numbering process is sequential. The numbers correspond to a randomly allocated test or control analgesic regimen. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between pain scores between the 2 groups. A pain score of 2 is clinically significant. 

Pain scores are in the form of a non parametric score from 0 to 10. Where 0 corresponds to no pain and 10 the most severe pain imaginable.

Power (obtained)	0.802
	
	
Test interpretation:	
H0: The difference between the means is equal to 0.	
Ha: The difference between the means is different to 0.	
The risk to not reject the null hypothesis H0 while it is false is 0.2.	
For the given parameters, for an alpha of 0.05, the necessary sample size to reach a power of 0.8 is 55 observations.	

The calculation was conducted using XLSTAT

An extra 10% was added to the sample size to account for patient drop outs. 

Leaving the number of patients to be recruited 121. 

Dealing with the problem of multiple observations for the same patient: The pain scores for an individual patient for a period of 24 hours are averaged using the area under the curve of the pain time graph for that patient. It is repeated for the first and second 24 hours. The first 24 hours will be used to calculate the primary outcome. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The CROPP trial evaluates the hypothesis that 2 drug regimens are equally effective to deliver pain relief after a caesarean section. The drug which we are testing is called Oxycodone. We deliver the Oxycodone to participants in the test group in controlled release form on a regular basis over 2 days. The participant is also able to request immediate release Oxycodone for the breakthrough pain. These tablets are swallowed with water. In the control group the participants will receive Morphine into a vein each time a computer called a Patient controlled analgesic device is activated by the participant. The primary aim of the research project is to see if the 2 types of drugs have the same ability to relieve pain. The secondary aims are to see if these 2 drugs have the same safety profile, nausea, vomiting and pruritis incidence and if patients in both groups are equally satisfied with their treatment. </summary>
