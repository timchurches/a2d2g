  <interventions>
    <interventions>* Fathers and daughters will attend 9 weekly face-face sessions of the DADEE program together. 

* Each session will be broken up into 3 components:

(i) a 15-minute education session with fathers and daughters together;
(ii) a 30-minute education session for fathers and daughters conducted separately;
(ii) a 45-minute practical session where fathers and daughters participate together.

Mothers and siblings are also invited to attend session 5 of the program, where all family members participate in the activities together..

* The sessions will be group-based (~20 families), delivered by university-trained facilitators (qualified teachers) at local school halls.

For fathers, the education sessions focus on proven parenting strategies to improve their daughters social-emotional well-being, sports skills and physical activity levels. 

The daughters education sessions focus on developing key social and emotional skills including self-control, persistence, critical thinking, resilience, and self-reliance.

The 45-minute DADEE practical sessions focus on 3 key areas - Rough and Tumble Play, Fitness and Fundamental Movement Skills. 

* All fathers will be provided with program resources including a t-shirt, a folder containing session summaries, a, sport skills booklet and a log book to document brief tasks (e.g., step count monitoring). 

* All daughters will receive a t-shirt and a booklet with session summaries. As in the sessions, the daughters material will cover similar themes to the dads material, but will be tailored for the age group.

*All participants will have access to the 'DADEE' App for the duration of the program (and beyond the study period). This app includes physical activity tasks for fathers to complete with their daughter/s at home (e.g., rough and tumble play activities, fitness circuits, sports skills games). Brief instructions are provided for each task on the app. Participants will be advised to complete activities from a variety of categories equating to an approximate time investment of 30 minutes per week.

Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by:
- Attendance records at the sessions
- Activities completed in the Dads Log Book
- Activities completed on the DADEE app</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Study information for the two different groups (DADEE program group and wait-list control) will be pre-packed into identical, sealed opaque envelopes and consecutively numbered and ordered according to the randomisation schedule.

The packing and sequencing of these envelopes will be completed by a research assistant who will not be involved in enrolment, assessment or allocation of participants.

Study participants will complete all baseline assessments before proceeding to a separate room to meet with a research assistant who will not be involved with assessments. The allocation sequence will be concealed during this process.

Families will be stratified by father's BMI category and their name will be written down in the next available position on the relevant randomisation schedule. At this point the corresponding envelope for that position will be opened by the research assistant and details of the group assignment will be provided to the family using a standardised protocol.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation allocation sequence will be generated by a statistician who will not have any contact with participants during the trial. Allocation will be stratified by father's BMI category and the allocation sequence within strata will be generated by a computer based random number producing algorithm.

Randomisation codes will be stored in a restricted computer folder, which will not be accessible by those assessing participants, those involved in group allocating participants or those participating in data entry for the study.</sequence>

A sample size of 74 fathers will provide 90% power to detect a 1200 step/day difference in physical activity between the intervention and control groups at 3 months with 20% attrition (p&lt;0.05). This calculation is based on a pre-post correlation of 0.76 and a change score standard deviation of 2020 steps/day (values derived from fathers in the DADEE pilot study).

A sample size of 191 daughters will provide 90% power to detect a 1200 step/day difference in physical activity between the intervention and control groups at 3 months with 20% attrition (p&lt;0.05). This calculation is based on a pre-post correlation of 0.61 and a change score standard deviation of 2298 steps/day (values derived from daughters in the DADEE pilot study).

As multiple daughters per family will be eligible to participate, this calculation also adjusts for clustering at the family level using a correction factor of [1+ (m-1) x ICC], where m = average daughters per family and ICC = the intracluster correlation coefficient. Assuming an average number of 1.33 daughters per family and an ICC of 0.73 for physical activity, the correction factor is 1.24 (estimates based on DADEE pilot data).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well established that physical activity is associated with many physical and psychological health benefits. Participating in regular physical activity during childhood is also vital for optimal growth and development and kids who are active show greater resilience and increased social-emotional wellbeing. However, more than 80% of adolescent girls do not meet government physical activity recommendations and there is a striking difference in activity levels between boys and girls at all ages.  

Current strategies to engage girls in physical activity and sports programs have had minimal impact and innovative approaches that address the underlying socio-cultural barriers that girls face are needed. Targeting fathers to take an active role in increasing their daughters physical activity levels may be one such innovation.

The DADEE Program is an intervention which engages fathers in positive lifestyle role modelling and effective parenting strategies to improve the physical activity behaviours, physical confidence, sport skills and social-emotional wellbeing of their daughters. Importantly, DADEE also targets girls to improve the fitness and physical activity levels, and parenting skills of their fathers.

The program has been successfully tested in an efficacy RCT at the University of Newcastle. The aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness of the DADEE Program when delivered by local trained facilitators in community settings (i.e., schools).

As in the DADEE pilot study, the two major purposes of this community effectiveness trial are:

(i) to help fathers improve their own physical activity levels and learn parenting skills to promote and role model positive behaviours relating to physical activity for their daughters

(ii) to improve the physical activity behaviours, fundamental movement skill proficiency and social-emotional well-being of their daughters.</summary>
