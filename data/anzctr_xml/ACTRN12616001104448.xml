  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo a 1-week Washout Period to discontinue current anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) and other analgesics (except acetaminophen)  followed by a 1-week Baseline Period capturing daily pain ratings using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS). After the washout and baseline periods, participants will receive one of three treatments as indicated below: 
- Treatment A: ZYN002  CBD 250 mg every 12 hours, or
- Treatment B: ZYN002  CBD 125 mg every 12 hours, or
- Treatment C: placebo every 12 hours
for 12 weeks. 

ZYN002 or placebo gel will be applied to the skin of both the right and left shoulder and/or upper arms. 

Participants will bring used and unused sachets to each visit for site to check treatment compliance.

    <concealment>On Day 1, participants with knee pain due to OA of the knee will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either Treatment A ZYN002 â€“ CBD 250 mg Q12 H, Treatment B ZYN002 - CBD 125 mg Q12 H or Treatment C placebo Q12 H for 12 weeks.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis will be a mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model on the change from baseline (ChgPAIN). The model will include terms for treatment group, site, week and treatment-by-week interaction, and Baseline Period pain score a) PAIN(Baseline) and b) baseline-by-week interaction. The contrast at Week 12 comparing each active dose against placebo will be used to test the significance of treatment effect.
To assess the impact of missing data, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be conducted at Week 12 with PAIN(Baseline) as the covariate using last observation carried forward (LOCF), baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) and a modified BOCF (mBOCF) imputation strategies. In the mBOCF approach, a BOCF strategy will be used to impute missing data from dropouts due to lack of efficacy (LOE) or AE and an LOCF strategy will be used to impute missing data from dropouts due to other reasons.

Secondary Efficacy Analysis
The secondary analyses will include:
a) 30% and 50% responder rate: Logistic regression with factors for treatment and center will be used to compare the active treatment group to placebo at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.
b) Percent change from Baseline in weekly mean pain: %ChgPAIN. Descriptive statistics including number (N), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum will be presented by treatment group. Graphs of cumulative distribution functions for %ChgPAIN will be presented by treatment group.
c) Change from Baseline (ChgPAIN) in the weekly mean of the 24-hour average worst pain score at Weeks 4 and 8. Descriptive statistics including N, mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum will be presented by treatment group.
d) Change from Baseline in the WOMAC Pain, Stiffness and Physical Function Subscales at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. ANCOVA will be used to compare each active treatment group to placebo at each time point (Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12) with factors for treatment and Baseline PAIN scores.
e) Percentage of patients using rescue pain medication weekly during the 12-week treatment period. Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group.
f) Physician assessment of presence of joint effusion. Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group

The sample size of 100 patients per treatment group is sufficient to have a power of 80% to detect a difference of 1.0 between the change from Baseline for active and placebo with a standard deviation (SD) of 2.5. To account for a possible screening failure rate of approximately 8%, a total of 320 patients should be enrolled to ensure there will be 300 patients to randomize.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of twice daily ZYN002, for 12 weeks in 320 (300 randomized) adults with knee pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee. This will be done by analysing a daily pain score and skin check, knee pain and rescue medication diary, and side effects. Safety will be monitored during the treatment visits using standard measures, including physical and neurological exams, vital signs (including oral temperature), 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory tests and side effect monitoring. Skin at the application sites will be checked to see if there is any irritation or reactions present after applications. 

Who is if for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 40 and 75 years, have knee pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee and are in otherwise general good health. 

Study details: This study will investigate two doses of ZYN002 compared to a placebo gel (a treatment with no active ingredients which looks like the real thing but it is not). This study is double-blind which means you and your study doctor, together with the study staff will not know whether you are receiving ZYN002 or placebo gel. 

What does study participation involve? Your participation in the study includes a screening visit; a 1 week washout period, a 1 week baseline period; a 12 week study treatment period; and an end of study (EOS) visit at Week 12. 

During the washout period, participants will be asked to discontinue their anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., NSAIDs) and other analgesics prior to the Baseline Period. Only paracetemol (not more than 3 grams per day) will be allowed as rescue medication.
During the Baseline Period, participants will use a 0 to 10 point numeric rating scale to capture their worst pain severity every day. Only paracetemol (not more than 3 grams per day) will be allowed as rescue medication. Participants will record rescue pain medication in a daily diary (Skin Check, Knee Pain, Rescue Medication Diary.

During the treatment period four clinic visits are required for: blood sampling; review of daily diary, medications, AEs and skin irritation; measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate and temperature ; suicide risk; and possibly, a brief physical and neurological exam, pregnancy tests (females only, if applicable) and an ECG. Participants will record rescue pain medication in a daily diary (Skin Check, Knee Pain, Rescue Medication Diary.
Participants will apply all study drug to clean, dry, intact skin, thoroughly massaging it into both the right and left shoulders and/or upper arms until the area is dry.
