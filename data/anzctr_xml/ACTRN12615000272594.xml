  <interventions>
    <interventions>Be Positive Be Healthe is a 6-month intervention. The goal of Be Positive Be Healthe is to facilitate a 5 to 10% reduction from baseline weight. Participants will set an individualised energy intake and energy expenditure goal to facilitate a weight loss of approximately 0.5kg/week. They will be encouraged to meet this goal by making changes to the eating and physical activity behaviours that cause weight gain and increase CVD risk. To assist young women to implement the desired changes to behaviour, the behavioural strategies for weight management, which will be targeted throughout the intervention, and be highlighted as a weekly topic. Participants will be asked to engage with the eHealth tools to facilitate behaviour change and meet their weight loss goal.  The eHealth tools include a study website (information and resources available at all times); online quizzes with individualised email feedback (Week 1, 3, 8, 12 and 20) and goal setting (Week 1); a smartphone application for self-monitoring (recommended to use 4 days per week), email newsletters and text messages for education (1 newsletter/week and 2 text messages/week Week 1-12 and 1 newsletter/fortnight and 1 text message/week Week 13-26), and social media (Facebook and Instagram) for social support (available at all times).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the research is to compare the efficacy of a 6-month weight loss intervention for young (18 to 35 years) overweight and obese (Body Mass Index 25 to 34.9kg/m2) women delivered using eHealth technologies to a waiting list control group.

Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention (Be Positive Be Healthe) or waiting list control group. After 6-months the waiting list control group will receive access to Be Positive Be Healthe program tools.

Participants in both groups will be asked to have a series of measures taken (e.g. weight, height) and complete online questionnaires at the start of the program (baseline), mid-program (3-months) and post program (6-months). The researchers will also track intervention participants use of the eHealth tools.</summary>
