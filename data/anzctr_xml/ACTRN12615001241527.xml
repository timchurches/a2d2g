  <interventions>
    <interventions>Strength training with tDCS (group 1): 6 week strength training program for the lower body including leg press, sit-to-stands, calf raises, toe lifts, and balance tasks. 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions will be performed at 70% of single repetition maximum for each exercise. 3 x 1 hour sessions are performed each week (total 18 sessions), with the intensity of each exercise progressing by 5% as the participant becomes stronger. tDCS is applied to the motor area of the brain during the first 20 mins of exercise, at an intensity of 2mA. This will involve wearing dampened electrode sponges secured on the scalp with rubber straps, and usually results in a light tingling or warm sensation. All session are performed one-on-one with an exercise physiologist or researcher, in the Deakin University clinical exercise space. Attendance and performance in each exercise will be recorded, with a minimum 80% attendance rate required.

Strength training with sham tDCS (group 2): 6 week strength training program for the lower body including leg press, sit-to-stands, calf raises, toe lifts, and balance tasks. 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions will be performed at 70% of single repetition maximum for each exercise. 3 x 1 hour sessions are performed each week (total 18 sessions), with the intensity of each exercise progressing by 5% as the participant becomes stronger. Sham tDCS is applied to the motor area of the brain, with stimulation ceasing after 15 seconds. This will involve wearing dampened electrode sponges secured on the scalp with rubber straps, and usually results in a light tingling or warm sensation. All session are performed one-on-one with an exercise physiologist or researcher, in the Deakin University clinical exercise space. Attendance and performance in each exercise will be recorded, with a minimum 80% attendance rate required.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Parkinson's disease is characterised by a loss of dopamine in the brain that leads to movement dysfunctions such as slowness, impaired balance, resting tremor and muscle stiffness. The loss of dopamine also results in maladaptive brain plasticity, or an inability of the brain to adapt to a new stimulus, which is believed to underpin motor dysfunctions. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that uses low level electrical currents to alter brain plasticity and make the brain more receptive to stimuli, such as resistance training. The use of resistance training has been shown to improve movement function in patients with Parkinson's disease, however the concurrent use of both resistance training and tDCS has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of tDCS applied during 6 weeks of resistance training on walking and balance in patients with Parkinson's disease. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either resistance training with tDCS, resistance training with sham tDCS, or standard care. Resistance training of the lower body will be performed 3 times per week for 6 weeks, one-on-one with an exercise physiologist in a specialised gym. Real tDCS will be delivered at 2mA for the first 20 mins of exercise. Sham tDCS will be delivered for 15 seconds, after which the unit will become inactive. It is hypothesised that the benefits of resistance training will be enhanced in patients receiving tDCS in comparison to those receiving sham tDCS, or standard care.</summary>
