  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RA101495 in patients with
      Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). There will be two groups of patients in the study:
      the first group will include patients who have never received eculizumab for treatment of
      PNH. The second group will include patients who have received treatment with eculizumab for
      at least 6 months prior to the study. Patients will be treated with RA101495 for 12 weeks.</summary>
