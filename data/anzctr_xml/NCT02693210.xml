    <summary>WA16291 is a Phase IIa "proof-of-concept" study. The primary objective of this study is to
      determine the safety and efficacy of rituximab (a B cell depleting chimeric monoclonal
      antibody) used either as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or cyclophosphamide
      in participants with rheumatoid arthritis who have failed prior Disease Modifying
      Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) therapy and currently have an inadequate clinical response to
      methotrexate.</summary>
