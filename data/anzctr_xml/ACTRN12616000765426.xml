  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants were asked to refrain from ingesting dietary anthocyanins or flavonoids and were provided with a food and exercise plan and diary to complete in the week prior to both the familiarisation and trial sessions.  Participants underwent an initial familiarisation session, at which time baseline blood samples were taken. Participants completed a ramp incremental VO2max test to ascertain their level of cardiovascular fitness.  Lactate and blood glucose measurements were taken every 2 minutes via finger prick.  Participants with a VO2max of between 4.5 and 5.0L/min were included in the supplementation and trial sessions.  Participants were given cherry drinks containing cherries, water and lemon juice (at a 10:5:1 ratio) with an anthocyanin content of 540mg/drink, or carbohydrate-matched, blended pear drinks containing 0mg anthocyanin (placebo).  One drink was consumed each day for the 3 days prior to the trial, with a final drink consumed 1 hour immediately prior to the commencement of the trial. To monitor adherence to the intervention, drinks were provided in opaque bottles which were returned the day following provision.  The cycling trial consisted of 60second intervals of cycling on a cycle ergometer at a workload equivalent to 100%VO2max followed by 75 seconds of active recovery at 50%VO2max, until the 100%VO2max workload was unable to be maintained.  A 10 minute warm-up and cool-down at 50%VO2max was undertaken prior to and following the trial.  Lactate and blood glucose measurements were taken in each active recovery phase via finger prick.  Venous blood samples were collected immediately following exercise and at 24 hours post exercise.  At 24 hours post exercise, participants indicated perceived muscle soreness via a 10 cm visual analog scale. Following a washout period of at least two weeks, participant groups crossed over and the supplementation and cycling trial was repeated. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will utilise a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design to investigate the following aims.
1.	Determine if consumption of sweet cherries attenuates exercise-induced inflammation.
2.	Determine if consumption of sweet cherries improves post-exercise recovery.
3.	Determine if consumption of sweet cherries improves exercise performance.
Inclusion criteria: competitive cyclists training for a minimum of 7 hours per week; an endurance training history of at least 3 years; Exclusion criteria: cardiovascular history; history of fainting; diabetes; history of allergy/reaction to stone fruit. Participants will be asked to refrain from ingesting dietary anthocyanins or flavonoids and will be provided with a food and exercise plan and diary to complete in the week prior to both the familiarisation and trial sessions.  Participants will undergo an initial familiarisation session, at which time baseline blood samples will be taken. Participants will undertake a ramp incremental VO2max test to ascertain their level of cardiovascular fitness.  Lactate and blood glucose measurements will be taken every 2 minutes via finger prick.  Participants with a VO2max of between 4.5 and 5.0L/min will be included in the supplementation and trial sessions.  Participants will be randomly assigned to the cherry or placebo group. Participants will be given blended cherry drinks containing cherries, water and lemon juice (at a ratio of 10:5:1) with an anthocyanin content of 540mg/drink or carbohydrate-matched, blended pear drinks containing 0% anthocyanin (placebo).  Participants will be asked to consume one drink at 8pm for the 3 days prior to the cycling trial, and one drink 1 hour immediately prior to the commencement of the trial.  To assess the efficacy of the blinding process, participants will be asked if they believe they have received the blended cherry drink or the placebo.  The cycling trial will consist of 60second intervals of cycling on a cycle ergometer at a workload equivalent to 100%VO2max followed by 75 seconds of active recovery at 50%VO2max, until the 100%VO2max workload is unable to be maintained.  A 10 minute warm-up and cool-down at 50%VO2max will be undertaken prior to and following the trial.  Lactate and blood glucose measurements will be taken in each active recovery phase via finger prick.  Venous blood samples will be collected immediately following exercise and at 24 hours post exercise.  At 24 hours post exercise, participants will indicate perceived muscle soreness via a 10 cm visual analog scale. Following a washout period of at least two weeks, participant groups will crossover and the supplementation and cycling trial will be repeated.  Blood samples will be tested for levels of the circulating inflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-10, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, CRP and MCP-1 using ELISA kits, and LOOH levels and creatine kinase levels will be monitored.</summary>
