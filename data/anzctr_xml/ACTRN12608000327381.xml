  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.All patients in this study will receive the standard treatment for metastatic melanoma when its isolated to a limb.The standard treatment is  an Isoloated Limb Infusion (ILI).An Isoloated Limb Infusion is where a limb is isolated by a tourniquet &amp; anti-cancer drug are given via venous  &amp; arterial catheters. Prior to the ILI patients will have a small amount tumour taken. This is the only time tumour is taken.
Tumour material will be immediately debrided, cut into small pieces and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then transported to the Westmead Institute for Cancer Research laboratories where RNA will be extracted as previously described (www.nhgri.nih.gov/DIR/microarray), batched, and shipped to NIH, Bethesda for preparation of fluorescently-labelled cDNA and microarray analysis. The purpose of this study is to establish a genome scale expression database for melanoma in vivo that does, and does not, respond to standard chemotherapy. This entirely new type of data will provide the basis for "mining" the genome for genes which are relevant to melanoma treatment.
Patients will be assessed  the first week post-procedure, then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months and 24 months or up until patients progress.  Each visit will have a plus or minus one week window.  The assessments will consist of a physical assessment.  At each visit the following  observations will be undertaken as part of the observational study, tumour measurements, limb photography and blood sampling for Lactate Dehydroginase(LDH)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>By microarray analysis, to determine the profile of expressed molecules in metastatic melanoma in two groups of patients: a) those responding to standard Isolated Limb Infusion (ILI) with melphalan and fotemustine, and b) those who fail to respond.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed the first week post-procedure, then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months and 24 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>By microarray analysis, to determine the molecular profile of expressed molecules in the circulating T-lymphocytes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed the first week post-procedure, then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months and 24 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In selected patients, where repeat biopsy is possible post-therapy, to determine, by microarray analysis, the molecular signature of non-responding tumours after exposure to chemotherapy, in order to ascertain the presence of induced molecules relevant to  chemoresistance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed the first week post-procedure, then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months and 24 months.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.Histologically confirmed malignant melanoma with locoregional recurrence in a pattern deemed to be suitable for Isolated Limb Infusion (ILI).
2.Age: 17 years and over.
3.Patients may be untreated, surgically treated, or may have received prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or prior Isolated Limb Infusion(ILIs). Patients may have received prior immunotherapy with Vaccinia Melanoma Cell Lysate (VMCL) or Canvaxin (C-VAX) vaccines.

9.Serum creatinine less than or equal to 180 umol/L.
10.Serum bilirubin less than 3 times the upper limits of normal and Aspartate transaminase (AST)  less than 5 times the upper limits of normal.
11.No other systemic anti-cancer therapy during the study, except corticosteroid medication, or radiotherapy to non-indicator sites of disease.
