    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>That improvement in depression symptoms in the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy group are mediated by change in attentional control in contrast to the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy group where improvement in depression symptoms is mediated by cognitive change
That participants in the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy group will demonstrate greater improvements at 8 weeks and at follow ups in measure of anxiety and mindfulness than participants in the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy group. Conversely, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy group members will demonstrate greater improvements in changing negative thinking styles than those in the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy group at 8-week and at follow-ups
Subjects who maintain their skills in both groups over the follow-up periods of 6- and 12-months will continue to improve or maintain improvements when compared to those who do not.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured through questionnaires and activities administered prior to the groups commencing to establish baseline, during the sessions to assess progress, at the completion of the group and then at 6-month and 12-month followup to establish the longer term effects of the intervention. The questionnaires included are
- Composite International Diagnostic Interview for and Anxiety (pre-group measure only)
- Beck Anxiety Index
- Rational-Experiential Inventory
- Anxiety Sensitivity Index
- Mindful Attention Awareness Scale</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the effectiveness of group Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and standard Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) as treatments for depression as well as examine the mechanisms of change and predictors of change in both groups. Depressed participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive one of the group programs. Both programs will run for 2.5 hours a week for eight weeks. Participants will receive a clinical assessment prior to randomisation and will complete a number of questionnaires before and after the group program and at follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months. The first pilot phase of the study will assess feasibility and likely effectiveness of MBCT, and pending results will be followed by the second main phase of the study.</summary>
