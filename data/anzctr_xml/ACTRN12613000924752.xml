  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose and schedule of olaparib in combination with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide. The outcome is assessed using the "Escalation Decision Rule" along with Dose Limiting Toxicity. Toxicity grading will be according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Any of the following events that occur during the first 2 cycles will be considered a Dose Limiting Toxicity:
* ANC &lt;0.5 x 109/L without fever and lasting for more than 5 days
* ANC &gt;0.5 × 109/L but less than 1.5 × 109/L with fever &gt;=38.5oC and neutropenic sepsis
* Platelets &lt;25 x 109/L * Any grade 3 or 4 non-haematological adverse event with the exception of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia or arthralgia, unless appropriate measures have been undertaken to treat these symptoms
* Any AE not otherwise described that results in treatment delay of &gt;21 consecutive days * Any grade 3 or 4 toxicity considered, in the opinion of the investigator, to be dose limiting
* Requirement for repeated blood transfusions within the first 2 cycles.

Patients with documented response beyond cycle 2 who experience dose limiting toxicity related to the study drugs as listed above are allowed to continue with the study after appropriate dose modifications. The occurrence of any of the above dose limiting toxicities beyond cycle 2 for the current or previous dose levels will also be considered by the Trial Management Committee at the time of any decision to escalate or expand recruitment for a dose level. 

AEs that are considered unrelated to the study drugs should be managed as clinically indicated, but will NOT be considered dose limiting. Patients who require dose omission or dose delay of &gt;7 days due to adverse events that are considered unrelated to study drugs in the period evaluable for DLT (first 42 days of treatment), will be regarded as non-evaluable for DLT. They may continue on study, but will be replaced to fulfill the aims of the study. When the relationship between an adverse event and the study drugs is clinically uncertain, the event should be considered possibly related to the study drugs.

After cycle 2, patients may have the cyclophosphamide dose reduced because of toxicity and remain on treatment with olaparib provided, in the opinion of the investigator, they are continuing to benefit from treatment. However, the patient should be considered for discontinuation from the study drugs if:
* The patient is required to stop treatment due to unacceptable toxicity, or
* The patient would receive cyclophosphamide 50mg for less than 3 days per week over the 21-day cycle, and/or
* The patient would receive olaparib at a dose less than 200mg twice per day over the 21-day cycle.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This aim of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Olaparib combined with cyclophosphamide in patients with breast cancer or ovarian cancer.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with either metastatic BRCA-associated breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer or serous ovarian cancer.
Trial details
Olaparib is a highly active agent when used as a single therapy in a standard dose of 400mg twice a day. However, olaparib frequently results in suppression of the immune system when combined with chemotherapy.

Cyclophosphamide is a DNA-damaging agent widely used in breast cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer in metronomic (low dose, continuous therapy) doses and does not have significant suppression of the immune system. It is suggested that combining full-dose olaparib with metronomic cyclophosphamide might result in better treatment of cancers without causing extra difficulties with the immune system.

In this study, participants will be administered olaparib as 300mg tablets twice per day in combination with Cyclophosphamide, which will be administered as 50mg tablets at a pre-specified schedule (the schedule will differ slightly for each dose level). Patients will enter the study as a cohort of 3 patients per dose level. Each dose level cohort will be assessed for toxicity until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

Two extension cohorts will be treated at the MTD. Each cohort will consist of nine or more patients: one cohort of patients with breast cancer, the other cohort of patients with ovarian cancer.

Treatment duration will be up to a maximum of 8 x 21 day cycles. All participants will be regularly monitored throughout treatment to evaluate toxicity, and to assess response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival. </summary>
