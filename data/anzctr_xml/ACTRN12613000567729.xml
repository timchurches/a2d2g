    <interventions>Supination Resistance Arch Blocks Test

The participant is told to march on the spot before standing in relaxed calcaneal stance position (RCSP). The tester will perform the Supination Resistance Arch Blocks test as outlined:

1.Place the first block attached with an overlying valgus pad underneath the marked navicular tuberosity of each foot.

2. Add additional blocks under the first block until the Neutral Calcaneal Stance Position (NCSP) of the foot is achieved. This is confirmed by using a tractograph to measure the angle between the posterior calcaneal bisection and a line that is perpendicular to the ground.

3. If the NCSP is not achieved, continue adding blocks until the NCSP is achieved.

4. Record the number of blocks required to correct the foot from RCSP to NCSP and the NCSP value of the foot after correction.

The Supination Resistance Arch Blocks test will be performed on both feet of each participant and will take approximately 15 minutes. The test will then be repeated on each foot after a one hour interval by the same tester. Upon completion of the test, the participants will be immediately followed up on their level of satisfaction and any adverse events they may have experienced during the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Manual supination resistance test

The manual supination test is used to estimate the amount of force required to supinate the foot about the subtalar joint (STJ). In our study, the manual supination resistance test will be performed after the Supination Resistance Arch Blocks test.

The participant is told to stand in the relaxed calcaneal stance position (RCSP). The tester will then place two fingers under the navicular tuberosity and estimate the amount of upward force required to supinate the STJ from RCSP. At the same time, it must be ensured that the participant is not providing any form of assistance. The amount of upward force required to supinate the STJ will be assigned a supination resistance score between zero to five, with zero being the easiest and five being the hardest. 

The manual supination resistance test will be performed on both feet of each participant and will take approximately 5 minutes. The test will be performed for 5 consecutive times on each foot by the same tester and the average score from all five trials will be used for comparison with the Supination Resistance Arch Blocks test.

    <statisticalmethods>We aim to achieve a sample size of 50 feet (25 participants) in our study. This was estimated based on the sample size used in previous studies which assessed undergraduate populations. As the scope of these studies was similar to ours, we decided to adopt the same approach. In addition, as this is an undergraduate research project with a limited amount of time for data collection, this sample size is most appropriate.

Collected data will be analysed using the SPSS software. To determine the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the arch blocks test, the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient with a confidence interval of 95% will be used. The correlation between the results obtained from the arch blocks test and the manual supination resistance test will be determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to develop a new clinical tool to assist in the design of foot orthoses. This tool will be tested on both feet of each study participant by two different investigators and the results obtained will be compared. We will also be comparing the use of this tool to an established clinical test, the manual supination resistance test. At the end of the study, information on participant satisfaction will be collected.</summary>
