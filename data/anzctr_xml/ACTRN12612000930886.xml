  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adult patients who are already assigned to receive a PICC as part of their standard medical care will be randomly allocated to receive either an anti-thrombotic or a third-generation polyurethane proximal valve, power-injectable PICC. Both PICCs will be inserted using the same method (modified-Seldinger technique) by specially trained registered nurses in the Radiology department. The duration of the procedure varies according to the vasculature of the patient but approximately takes 30 minutes. Both PICCs have power-injectable capability and incorporate proximal valves, they differ in regards to the materials they are manufactured from; one is a third generation polyurethane and the other contains an anti-thrombotic polymer. The PICC will stay in situ until treatment is completed or as decided by the treating team.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A composite measure of adverse events, namely if a patient has one or more of the following: catheter related blood stream infection (CR-BSI), local infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), occlusion, bleeding, ongoing pain, infiltration/extravasation, phlebitis, or catheter fracture and dislodgement will be recorded. Premature removal will also be documented. These will be defined as the number of adverse events and removal per 1000 PICC days. These outcomes will be assessed using hospital reports, medical records and patient interviews.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The number of adverse events and need for removal will be measured at 58 days post-insertion. This time period will be measured as the period of risk regardless of whether patients still have a PICC in situ due to longer treatment regimens.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A cost-benefit analysis will indicate the total cost associated with use of anti-thrombotic PICCs to the hospital and analyse whether there is an overall cost saving or loss compared to third generation polyurethane PICCs. An overall cost for the hospital will be determined for each PICC which will include insertion and adverse event management costs. 
Insertion costs will be determined from hospital data. Adverse event management costs will be obtained from Australian Health Department data (AR-DRG codes) as well as wage/equipment costs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The cost-benefit analysis will be undertaken after adverse event data collection is completed.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>- All adult (18 years or older) patients who are to have a  PICC inserted above the ante-cubital fossa region (as per normal practice) by one of the two lead nurse PICC inserters in the Radiology Department at the proposed study site.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Once the patient has consented and is allocated to a diagnostic group by the researcher, the participant will  enter into a procedure room where the PICC inserter will choose the next sequential envelope in the series relevant to the treatment group. A sealed, opaque envelope system will be used to indicate which PICC type to use.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software will be performed by an independent statistician. A stratified randomisation method will be used based on diagnosis types; ‘haematological cancers’, ‘solid tumours’, ‘infection’ and ‘other’ due to differences in risk.
These results will then be placed in opaque envelopes as mentioned above.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study will evaluate the safety and costs associated with use of two PICC designs. The primary aim is to ascertain whether a new anti-thrombotic design is associated with less adverse events and need for removal than third-generation polyurethane. Additionally costs associated with using this new technology will be evaluated.</summary>
