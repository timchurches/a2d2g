    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total seconds of FOG - duration of freezing with device on versus During the 2 week home trial, Kinematic data to capture FOG duration will be logged on the device during the same time period each day with the device on different settings. Fall data will collected from 6am to 10pm.
FOG episodes on all 3 settings of the device will be recorded. The primary outcome measure will be the total seconds of FOG when the device is simply recording compared with the total FOG seconds when a FOG dependent ( or continuous FOG independent) cue is provided by the device. This will be recorded by means of a microSD card within the device. The data will be downloaded once the device is returned</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The CuePeD trial is an intervention trial measuring the effectiveness of a novel treatment
      for Freezing of Gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD). The primary intervention is the use
      of a wearable cueing device (WCD), which detects and responds to FOG and extinguishes on the
      resumption of normal walking. It is designed for use in PD patients with FOG, in their home
      environment where FOG is most severe. Kinematic data will be logged by a memory card in the
      belt worn device recording FOG, and falls. The device will be used on 3 different settings in
      a gait laboratory environment, and then for 2 weeks in the patient's own home using the same
      3 settings. A battery of psychometric instruments will be administered before and after the
      trial</summary>
