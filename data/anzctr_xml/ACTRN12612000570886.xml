  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to show that oral vitamin D supplementation will improve the severity of childhood atopic dermatitis (eczema). We will compare the severity of disease in children with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis after 3 months of daily Vitamin D therapy or placebo, using randomised double blind placebo controlled methodology.
We propose that the severity of moderate and moderate-severe atopic dermatitis will be significantly decreased by oral Vitamin D therapy. We aim to show that in these children, following 3 months of daily vitamin D3 at 1000IU, there will be a significant decrease in their disease severity and decreased use of topical corticosteroids. We aim to demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of life for these children, as measured by a validated quality of life questionnaire.</summary>
