  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 week exercise programme with action and coping plans. The exercise programme consists of general strnegthening and mobility exercises done at the departmental gymnasium, and a brisk walking done at home. The gym sessions are one hour in duration two to three times per week, and the walking is done two to three times per week for about 30 minutes. The action plans involve the patient indicating when, where, and how  they will undertake their gym exercise sessions and the whe, where, how and with whom they undertake the walking. The coping plans are based on the participants indicating the barriers/obstacles they predict may hinder their participation in the exercise programme, and how they may overcome them. Participants are given a written record of their action and coping plans to refer to throughout their time on the exercise programme.</interventions>
