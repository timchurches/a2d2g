  <interventions>
    <interventions>To determine whether continous local anaesthetic, ie. ropivacaine 1% (Naropin - produced by AstroZeneca) via a dual catheter PainBuster Soaker Pain Management System (produced by I-Flow) is a more effective form of post operative analgesia compared to traditional analgesias for midline incisions following major colorectal resections. The PainBuster Soaker System is tested in a randomised double blinded control study where participants either receive ropivacaine 1% or Saline in their PainBuster Device for the first three days.  Both groups also receive a Morphine PCA, Tramadol, Ketorolac and Panadol.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Ropivacaine was provided to an external third party who specialises in sterile phrmaceutical setups (Baxter).  Baxter filled Luer lock syringes with either ropivacaine 1% or saline. The syringes were not marked which solution they had. Rather, they were allocated a number from 1 to 300 based on a computer generated list which randomised patient numbers to the two different treatments. The syringes were then provided to the investigators. The trial will not be unblinded until it's completion. Finally patients are allocated a number in consecutive order as they enter a trial.  Based on the computer generated randomisation list, this will determine if they receive ropivacaine or normal saline.</concealment>
    <sequence>A radomization list was computer generated allocating consecutive numbers between 1 and 300 to be either LA or normal saline</sequence>
