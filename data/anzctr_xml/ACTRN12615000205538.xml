  <interventions>
    <interventions>All study instruments will be connected in parallel, a mandatory 10 minute period is then provided before commencement of gas exchange measurements to allow the Deltatrac mixing chamber to equilibrate with expired gas from the patient after the initial break in the ventilator circuit during connection. Simultaneous measurements with Deltatrac II and either Quark RMR or E-sCOVX will then be performed in a randomized order. After measuring with the first device, another parallel measurement will be performed with the second device and Deltatrac II. Average values for energy expenditure (EE), VO2, VCO2, minute ventilation (MV) and respiratory quotient (RQ) will be registered after a 20 minute period. Measurements where the reference method registers a mean RQ of &lt;0.6 or &gt;1.2 will be discarded.

All aspects of the patient's ICU therapy are determined by the attending physician. Changes in ventilator settings, disconnection of the ventilator circuit or patient mobilization are to be avoided during and one hour previous to measurements unless deemed necessary by medical staff. In such event the ongoing measurement will be discontinued and restarted after a 15 minute resting period.  </interventions>

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>Limits of agreement and bias between VO2/VCO2 as measured by study instruments (E-sCOVX/Quark RMR) and the reference method (Deltatrac II) will be compared using Bland-Altman plots. Agreement of energy expenditure values as measured by study devices and the reference method will also be compared with the Bland-Altman method, although it is a dependent variable calculated from VO2 and VCO2. A sample size of 50 measurements in at least 20 patients is considered sufficient to determine limits of agreement within +/- 2.0 SD, and coefficients of variation between repeated measurements with the same instrument (n =/&gt;15 for each device). 

For descriptive statistics continuous variables with parametric distribution will be analyzed for significance using a two-tailed Student's t-test for paired samples and Mann-Whitney U-test for non-parametric data, an alpha level of =/&lt;0.05 considered as significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Determining an optimal provision of nutritional therapy in ICU patients continues to challenge clinicians. Indirect calorimetry can accurately determine energy expenditure in individual patients, but previous studies (Sundstrom et al, Clin Nutr. 2013 Feb;32(1), Graf et al Clin Nutr. 2014 Jan 21) have demonstrated varying agreement between instruments.

The aim of this study is to determine the level of agreement of gas exchange measurements between three instruments for indirect calorimetry in mechanically ventilated ICU patients: the E-sCOVX (GE, Helsinki, Finland), Quark RMR (Cosmed, Rome, Italy) and the Deltatrac in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. We hypothesize that all instruments measure oxygen comsumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) with equal precision and accuracy.</summary>
