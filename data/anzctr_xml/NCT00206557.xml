  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to investigate the use of raloxifene (a new form of estrogen) as a
      treatment for schizophrenia in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen
      receptor modulator (SERM) which means that it can affect the central nervous system effects
      of estrogen (eg: improving emotional symptoms, memory, information processing and
      concentration), without adversely affecting reproductive tissue / organs such as breast,
      uterus and ovaries.We are conducting a double blind placebo controlled 3 month duration study
      comparing the psychotic symptom response between three groups of postmenopausal women with
      schizophrenia. One group will receive standard antipsychotic medication plus 60mg Raloxifene,
      the second group receives standard antipsychotic medication plus Hormone Therapy(estradiol
      2mg oral per day + dyhydroprogesterone 10mg oral per day) and the third group receives
      standard antipsychotic medication plus oral placebo. Hypothesis 1: That the women receiving
      adjunctive raloxifene or HT would have a quicker recovery from psychotic symptoms, as
      measured on the rating scales, compared with the women receiving adjunctive
      placebo.Hypothesis 2: That the Raloxifene group would have better cognitive improvement than
      the other two groups.</summary>
