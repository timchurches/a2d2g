    <interventions>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label; non-randomized study in transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma. Participants will receive the following: 

Induction: Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) 56mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on D1, 2, 8, 9, 15,16  (except 20mg/m2 on D1 and 2 of the first cycle) Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 orally on  D1, 8, 15 and Dexamethasone 20mg orally on D1, 2, 8, 9, 15 ,16  for five 28 day cycles.  

Transplant: Stem cell mobilization will start following completion of the 5th induction cycle and will be done according to local institutional guidelines. Autologous bone marrow transplant will be done following stem cell collection also according to local institutional guidelines. 
If patients become ineligible for transplant during the course of induction therapy or stem cell mobilization, Stem cell mobilization and/or autologous BMT can be omitted. Patients may then start consolidation therapy as below, if further treatment is not precluded.

Consolidation: Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) 56mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on D1, 2, 8, 9, 15,16. Thalidomide 100mg daily taken orally(continuously) Dexamethasone 20mg taken orally D1, 2, 8, 9, 15 ,16   for four 28 day cycles starting 3 months post Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (ABMT)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to assess the response rate of patients on this trial

Blood tests to measure immunoglobulin and serum free light chain values will be performed at the end of each cycle to assess disease response.
Bone marrow biopsies will also be performed at 4 time points (at screening, pre-transplant, at day 100 post transplant and on completion of the consolidation phase) to determine the depth of response by measuring minimal residual disease by flow cytometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Upon completion of post-transplant consolidation therapy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of the treatment. 

Safety assessments will include the monitoring and assessment of all Adverse Events such as new medical problems or the worsening of existing medical problems, clinical laboratory parameters monitored by blood tests, and vital signs in relation to clinical study events.Patients will also undergo a physical exam by a doctor on day 1 of every cycle.

Participants will be given details of whom to contact in an emergency

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> This study will determine the effectiveness of a Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) based induction with autologous bone marrow transplant and Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) post-transplant consolidation in patients with untreated Myeloma. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been newly diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma and are eligible for bone marrow transplant. 

Study details: All participants in this study will receive 5 cycles of Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) 56mg/m2 by intravenous infusion (i.e. directly into the vein) on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15,16 (except 20mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 of the first cycle) Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 orally on Days 1, 8, 15 and Dexamethasone 20mg orally on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 for five 28 day cycles. This will be followed by a stem cell collection and autologous bone marrow transplant according to local institutional guidelines. 
Post-transplant consolidation therapy will consist of 4 cycles of Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) 56mg/m2 by intravenous infusion (i.e. directly into the vein) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15,16 Thalidomide 100mg daily orally (continuously), Dexamethasone 20mg orally on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 ,16 for four 28 day cycles starting 3 months post-transplant.
The study will monitor the disease response, adverse events, progression free survival and overall survival in each patient for up to 5 years. 

Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) is not registered for use by Medsafe in New Zealand but has been approved by the FDA. Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone are approved drugs currently being used to treat Myeloma.</summary>
