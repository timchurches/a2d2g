  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment 1 will contain 21% protein,28% fat and 51% carbohydrate this treatment will consist of 3 sandwich meals for breakfast lunch and dinner.Treatment 2 will contain  26% protein,40% fat and 34% carbohydrate,this treatment will consist of an omelette breakfast and a sandwich meal for lunch and dinner.At crossover there will be 5 days washout..Each treatment is one day.Treatment 1 and 2 are both a three meal a day treatment scheme.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment 2 will contain only 2grams  of carbohydrate for breakfast,whereas lunch and dinner is exactly the same as lunch and dinner in treatment 1, 75gms.Breakfast,will differ in the two treatments</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Data from Continuous Glucose monitoring System over 48 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitoring will take place immediately once the first meal test commences and it will continue for 48 hours until the second meal test is completed. After 5 days washout this will be repeated.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Results from Gastric emptying breath testing on 2 occasions after the standard lunch is consumed for both treatments preceded by the different breakfast meal patterns.The test will last 6 hours .</outcome>
      <timepoint>On 2 occasions immediately after the standard lunch is consumed and continues for 6 hours until the third meal is consumed.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) are used to assess diabetes control.  However high peak blood sugar levels after meals probably contribute more to the complications of diabetes than high average levels. There is very little known about the effects of meal composition and carbohydrate distribution on overall blood sugar control. This study will contribute to our understanding of the role of diet in the management of type 2 diabetes and help in the development of evidence based dietary guidelines regarding carbohydrate distribution.

To investigate the effect of three identical meals on diurnal blood glucose excursion,tretment 1,breakfast lunch and dinner.
To explore the effect of withholding carbohydrates at first meal after a prolonged (overnight) fast on the impact of carbohydrate ingestion at lunch time,treatment 2,breakfast lunch and dinner.Hence there are 2 arms to the study each diet is investigated for one full day.A gastric emptying breath test is performed on the first day in both weeks.
To determine the rate of gastric emptying when comparing a standard lunch following either a carbohydrate containing breakfast or a breakfast with no carbohydrate.</summary>
