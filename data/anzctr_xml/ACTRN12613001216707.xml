  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mask ventilation with a 2 person method whereby one person holds the mask over the neonate's face with both hands and the second person provides the positive pressure breaths.
Duration of mask ventilation will be 5-10 minutes. It will be given once only. Endotracheal intubation will be performed immediately after mask ventilation has stabilised baby's oxygenation level. Follow up includes data collection from the monitors immediately after the intervention has concluded. There is no longer term follow up.</interventions>
    <comparator>The intervention is being compared with the current standard 1 person method whereby that person holds the mask over the neonate's face with one hand and provides positive pressure breaths with the other hand.
Duration of mask ventilation will be 5-10 minutes. It will be given once only.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mask leak
A respiratory function monitor [NM3 Respiratory Profile Monitor (Philips)] will be attached between the mask and the T piece resuscitator. It will collect data regarding inspired and expired tidal volume. Mask leak will be calculated as expired tidal volume x 100/inspired tidal volume.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After completing endotracheal intubation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Airway obstruction
A respiratory function monitor [Respironics NM3 (Philips Healthcare, Netherlands)] will be attached between the mask and the T piece resuscitator. It will indicate patency of the airway during mask ventilation by showing expired carbon dioxide reading.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After completing endotracheal intubation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cerebral oxygenation
It will be assessed by using a near infra-red spectroscopy monitor (Nonin Medical Inc, Plymouth, Minnesota, USA). A probe will be applied to the scalp non-invasively to collect data regarding oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin from which a reading of tissue oxygenation index will be derived.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated based on a previous manikin based study which had shown 50% reduction in mask leak with the two-person method as compared to the one-person method. Using a p value of 0.05, 80% power and 50% reduction in mask leak, we will require 28 patients in each group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Newborn intensive care provides life-saving mechanical ventilation when the lungs of a very ill baby deteriorate with illness and need assistance to provide blood oxygen and removal of blood carbon dioxide. This involves the routine placement of a soft plastic tube called an endotracheal tube into the main breathing passageway called the trachea. This tube is placed via the nose or the mouth and mediations are used to relax the baby to ensure the procedure occurs with minimal disturbance. With these medications, the medical staff will provide breaths with a mask placed over the mouth and nose. There are two recognized ways of holding the mask. In both methods some leak of the breath provided occurs around the mask and occasionally a degree of obstruction occurs. This study seeks to determine which method is better.

These methods are; where one person holds the mask in place with one hand and provides breaths with the other hand compared to the other method where one person holds the mask and another person provides the breaths.

The purpose is to investigate whether by using a two-person method for mask ventilation; we are able to reduce the leak and airway obstruction so that the ventilation is more effective.
