    <interventions>This is a phase III, multi-centre, randomised double-blind parallel arm controlled fixed dose trial studying treatment approaches for the relief of breathlessness in people with refractory dyspnoea. Participants will be randomised to identical-appearing sustained release morphine (20 mg every 24 hours (every morning), or placebo for one week. The intervention period will run for 7 days. At all times, all participants will have the ability to take up to eight doses of 2.5mg of immediate release oral morphine solution on an as needed basis in any twenty four hour period.

Participants in the active arm will also take oral blinded docusate (50 milligram (mg)) with senna (8mg) (2 tablets orally each morning), and participants in the placebo arm, will take identical placebo (2 tablets orally each morning). In addition, participants will have access to open label oral docusate (50mg) with senna (8mg) to treat constipation if required.

People will be randomonly allocated to one of the 2 study arms
Arm 1 One week of sustained release morphine orally 20mg (on waking) or,
Arm 2 One week of identical looking oral placebo each day (on waking) </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At each centre, participants will be sequentially allocated a unique identifying number (ID) on referral to the study. This ID number will be used for all subsequent study documentation for that participant. The procedures outlined in the Allocation of ID number Standard Operating Procedure are to be followed.

All people with breathlessness will be referred to the study. The study nurse will ask the consultant in charge for permission to approach potentially eligible participants. This referral will be recorded within both the Case Report Form and the participant’s clinical file.

On notification of a participant, the pharmacist at each site will consult the strata table according to the strata determined by the diagnosis of underlying dyspnoea, and will allocate the next code available according to the supplied strata table and dispense the active or inactive medicine delivered in a labeled bottle. The participant ID, allocation code, dates of request, preparation, and dispensing will be recorded in a log maintained by the pharmacist and supplied to the central registry on each randomisation.

All capsules will be prepared in a central manufacturing pharmacy, where the medication will be encased in an opaque capsule in order to have all study medications and the placebo looking identical. Each daily dose for each participant will be contained within a tamper proof bottle which will contain the 7 day supply of the study medication. A second tamper proof bottle will contain either 2 docusate with senna tablets (if on active arm) or placebo (if on the inactive arm). Each bottle will be numbered according to the pre-determined allocation code and labeled as:

008/08 study – Study medication – 1 capsule every 24 hours consisting of morphine Slow Release (SR) 20mg:  placebo. Take one capsule as prescribed until finished.

All bottles for each site will be supplied to the site clinical trial pharmacist according to the randomisation schedule with a log of the bottle number. On randomisation of a participant, the site pharmacist will obtain the bottle corresponding to the randomisation number, and record the participant details in a log against the bottle number.

Treatment allocation will not be disclosed to participant, study staff, treating clinicians or investigators. The code will only be broken in cases of extreme clinical emergency. Such situations only include where knowledge of the code will have consequences for clinical decision making. </concealment>
    <sequence>Strata tables will be developed for each site using random number tables, generated at an independent centre (central registry). Treatment for each participant will be allocated according to a block randomisation schedule held by the central registry. This is described in more detail within the Palliative Care Clinical Studies Collaborative (PaCCSC) Randomisation Standard Operating Procedure. Block randomisation will ensure even allocation to each code. The central registry will supply strata tables to each site pharmacy. Stratification will be according to baseline dominant cause of dyspnoea (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, end-stage cardiac failure, mixed etiology and other).  Stratification will ensure adequate distribution across study arms for each diagnosis.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breathlessness continues to be a major clinical problem for many people with advanced progressive illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage cardiac failure, and cancer, even when they are receiving the best treatment for their underlying disease. There are phase II/III data and one meta-analysis which support the use of morphine in this setting, but further good phase III data are needed in order to that this is a well tolerated and effective intervention suitable for a broad range of people with refractory breathlessness. It is also important to establish that the overall net benefit outweighs any toxicity encountered. Further, a particular concern to many clinicians is the theoretical risk that opioids may cause respiratory depression. In steady state, at the relatively low regular doses proposed, there are no data to support this concern, but this study will specifically address this question through careful collection of non-invasive measures of respiratory function regularly throughout the study including end-tidal carbon dioxide at the beginning and the end of the study.

Objectives: Among participants with refractory breathlessness: 1) To compare the efficacy for relieving the sensation of dyspnoea, level of function, safety and quality of life (QOL) of opioids (sustained release morphine) with placebo; 2) To identify clinical and pharmacogenomic parameters that predict which individuals will achieve the greatest benefit from the intervention and establish any blinded participant preference. Secondary objectives focus of the impact of the intervention on improving quality of life, adverse effects, function, use of breakthrough opioids and clinical predictors of benefit.

Study design: This is a phase III, multi-site, randomised double-blind parallel arm fixed dose controlled trial studying treatment approaches for the palliative relief of breathlessness in participants with refractory dyspnoea. Participants will be randomised to fixed dose identical-appearing sustained release morphine (20 mg every 24 hours), or placebo for one week. The intervention period will run for 7 days; participants will receive study interventions at target doses and blinded therapy for constipation with each active arm together with identical appearing placebo for constipation for the placebo arm.</summary>
