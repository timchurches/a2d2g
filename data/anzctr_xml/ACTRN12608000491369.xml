  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 2 separate arms to this study:
1. Healthy adult participants randomized to the Expressive Writing (EW) [or to the Neutral Writing/ Control condition]. Healthy participants randomized to the  EW condition are asked to write about a nominated personal stressful life experience on 4 consecutive weekly sessions for 20 mins per session. 
2. Recently treated adult cancer patients. Similarly there are 2 writing conditions for the cancer arm of this trial. Participants randomized to the EW condition are asked to write about their cancer experience over 4 consecutive weekly sessions for 20 mins per session.</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Healthy adult participants
2. Recently adult treated cancer patients.
For both sub-samples, participants randomized to the Control conditions are asked to write about neutral (non-emotive events) over 4 consecutive weekly sessions for 20 mins per session.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Expressive Writing technique involves writing about a stressful experience using both emotional and factual descriptive words utlising a journal format. The technique has been found to be helpful in improving psychological and physical health functioning in various populations, under experimental conditions. Researchers have yet to adequately explain how this technique leads to health benefits. The aim of this study is to investigate how the Expressive Writing task leads to positive health functioning in two distinct populations; cancer survivors and healthy individuals. The study outcomes will be helpful in identifying how this task can be adapted to be used as a therapeutic technique in clinical health settings, to enhance the well-being of Australians.</summary>
