  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - ASN-002
Treatment: drugs - 5-FU

Experimental: Cohort 1 - Study Participants will receive ASN-002 at a dose 5X 10(10) vp, weekly injection in tumor nodules for 3 weeks.

Experimental: Cohort 2 - Study Participants will receive ASN-002 at a dose of 1.5X 10(11) vp weekly injection in tumor nodules for 3 weeks

Experimental: Cohort 4 - Study Participants will receive ASN- 002 at a dose of 3.0X 10(11) vp weekly injections in tumor nodules for 3 weeks.

Experimental: Cohort 5 - Study Participants will receive ASN- 002 at a dose of 2.25X 10(11) vp weekly injections in tumor nodules for 3 weeks.

Experimental: Combination Cohorts - Study Participants will receive ASN- 002 at either dose of Cohorts II, IV or V in combination with a low dose 5-FU (1mg/2.5 mg/5mg/10mg or 25mg) weekly injections in tumor nodules for 3 weeks.


Other interventions: ASN-002
ASN-002, is made of a suspension of recombinant adenoviral particles carrying a gene coding for the human interferon-gamma (IFN). Study participants will receive protocol defined dose of ASN-002 as intra-tumoral injections.

Treatment: drugs: 5-FU
5-FU is chemotherapeutic agent used to treat various cancers.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidences of ASN-002 related Adverse Event in patients with previously untreated nBCC - changes in vital signs, adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory abnormalities and withdrawals from study. Local skin and injection site reactions will be assessed in detail scoring erythema, ulceration, pain and overall severity as none, mild, moderate or severe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be followed up for up to 6 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Microscopic clearance of the injected basal cell carcinoma. - Histological clearance (HC) will be defined as the absence of detectable evidence of BCC tumor cell nests in serial histological samples as determined by central pathology review.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Microscopic examinations of sample collected at 17weeks after the first dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Changes in size of nBCC tumor over time after treatment with ASN-002 alone or in combination with 5-FU - Change in nBCC lesion size will be assessed by investigator at baseline and then every 4 weeks until the surgical excision of BCC after ASN-002 therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change in nBCC will be assessed for up to 6 months from the first treatment visit.</timepoint>
