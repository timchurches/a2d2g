    <statisticalmethods>The variables will be assessed for normality using skewness and kurtosis test. Data will be presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR). Categorical variables will be expressed as frequency and percent and compared using Pearsons x2 or Fishers exact test as appropriate.
 Univariate logistic regression will be used to assess the association between nutritional status and unplanned readmission within 7 days, 30 days and 180 days post-discharge. Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to test the relationship between readmissions and nutrition status at different time points and will be adjusted for other variables-age, gender, Charlson index, principal diagnosis at presentation, number of medications at admission, length of hospital stay, number of medical emergency response team calls during index admission and total number of hours spent in intensive care unit (ICU). Variance inflation factor and tolerance values will be used to detect collinearity between variables included in the model. A link test will be used to confirm that the linear approach to model the outcome is correct. Model fit will be assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-offit test. Kaplan Meier survival curve will be plotted from time of discharge to the first endpoint (readmission) and Log rank test will be utilized used to compare survival proportions in the nourished and malnourished groups. A two-sided p&lt;0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance. All analysis will be performed using STATA version 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hospital readmissions are common and are risky for the patients and imposes additional financial burden on already constrained health care resources. Although numerous readmission predictor tools have been developed their ability to accurately identify patients at high risk of unplanned readmissions is only modest. Experts believe that this could be due to unknown variables, which needs to be identified. Majority of studies predicting hospital readmissions have so far been carried out in United States and only limited studies are available in Australia. Moreover, these studies are centred on 30-day readmission rate, as this is a commonly used benchmark to reimburse hospitals in US. The present study aims to study predictors, which can influence very early and late readmissions in medical inpatients and whether nutrition status as determined by Malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST) can be used as a predictor of hospital readmissions.</summary>
