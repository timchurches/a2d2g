    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All children, between the ages of 24 to 72 months of age, presenting to the ED with acute wheeze will be considered for the study.  Wheeze will be defined by clinical criteria provided by the assessment of the first attending ED physician.  The ED physician will then clinically judge if the presenting wheezing episode was preceded by or associated with the symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection.  If the patient satisfies these criteria and the full study inclusion / exclusion criteria they will be approached for inclusion to the study with written consent obtained for all children enrolled.
The patient will then receive the next sequentially numbered study drug from the dispensory.  Solutions labelled with study numbers will be given out in numerical order to maintain randomisation with block randomization.
The study drugs will be formulated by the clinical trials pharmacy and will be matched for volume, concentration, colour, smell and taste.  Each study bottle will have no identifying markings indicating difference between placebo and prednisolone. The solutions will be prepared and packed in individual bottles identified by a 4-digit study number on the label.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computerised randomisation process administered by clinical trials pharmacist who maintains the randomisation schedule and will label all bottles with blinded study numbers.  The randomisation code will be retained in a locked cupboard in the pharmacy department until the end of the trial.</sequence>
