    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - LGX818

Experimental: LGX818 single agent - Patients had to have written documentation of a BRAFV600 mutation, which was to have been obtained locally on a fresh tumor biopsy (preferred) or on the most recent archival tumor sample available.


Treatment: drugs: LGX818
BRAF inhibitor. LGX818 was administered QD orally on a daily schedule (21-day cycles) as a flat-fixed dose and not by body weight or body surface area. LGX818 100 mg capsules and 50 mg capsules.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tumor Response (Overall Response Rate) Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (Part I &amp; Part II) - Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) is a set of published rules that define the status of tumors in cancer patients during a specific treatment.
The Overall Response Rate was calculated according to the RECIST criteria, as per investigator assessment.
Per RECIST guidelines:
Complete Response (CR) is the Disappearance of all target lesions.
Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD) is the at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.
Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through study completion (approximately 2 years)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) (Part II) - Incidence of DLTs in Part II of the study was not evaluated due to an inadequate number of patients enrolled in Part II prior to the permanent recruitment halt of this study.</outcome>

One patient with documented PD at study Day 146 entered into Part II of the study and received combination treatment of LGX818 450 mg plus MEK162 45 mg for two weeks. The patient experienced disease progression on Day 22 of Part II and discontinued the study.</outcome>
