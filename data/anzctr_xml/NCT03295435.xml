  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Various definitions of poor dentition in older adults has been linked with inadequate intake
      of nutrients and poor diet quality. This study aims to look at the associations between poor
      dentition as defined by the composition of functional tooth units, and dietary intake of
      nutrients in community dwelling older men.</summary>
