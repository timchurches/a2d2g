  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be required to complete 3 x 15 mins of standard typing under three conditions applied to the dominant trapezius muscle (muscle on top of the shoulder): no taping; sham taping; inhibitory taping. For the inhibitory taping, a rigid tape will be applied from the anterior aspect of the mid clavicle across the body of the Upper Trapezius muscles to approximately the level of the seventh rib with a posterio-inferior force to bunch the Upper Trapezius muscle fibres. For sham taping, tape will be applied without tension on the same spot of the Upper Trapezius as the inhibitory taping. Activity of this muscle during the three typing conditions will be evaluated using surface electromyography (sEMG) (non-invasive). Participants will complete a baseline 15 minute typing task immediately prior to each 15 minute intervention period (i.e. 30 minutes typing in total).
Taping will be removed after 15mins of a typing task.
Wash-out period between the 3 x 15 min testing sessions will be 3 days at least.</interventions>

    <concealment>Asymptomatic participants will be recruited via notices and flyers on university notice boards. Notices may also be placed on community notice boards in surrounding suburbs. The project will be advertised to students prior to lectures after having obtained the lecturers permission.
Participants will sign a consent form. Information on participants’ age, sex, relevant medical history, height and weight will then be collected. They will then complete two questionnaires, the NDI and a computer use questionnaire.
This study is a randomised cross-over design. Firstly, each participant will select one card from  an envelope in which the order of the three interventions will be written (eg, Time 1: inhibition taping, Time 2: no tape, Time 3: sham taping). The participant gives this card to the attending researcher without viewing the contents. The envelope will contain 6 cards – corresponding to the number of possible combinations of the three conditions. The order of the intervention will be known to the therapist applying the tape only and the order of application will be blinded to each participant and the researcher undertaking  the data analysis and collection.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: A primary source for the development of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders is prolonged muscle  activity. Cognitive work-load, visual load and repetitive low-load tasks during the use of a computer can increase Trapezius muscle activity, resulting in pain around the neck and shoulders. It is believed clinically, that inhibition McConnell taping  applied across muscle fibers can reduce muscle activity, potentially contribute to alleviation of muscle stiffness and pain. However, there are few high quality studies which have investigated the effectiveness of this taping with varying outcomes. Hence, a comprehensive study is warranted.
Study design:  Randomized Placebo Controlled Assessor Blinded Cross-over design
Subjects: Sixty asymptomatic volunteers will be recruited from university staff and students 
Measures: Myoelectric activity of the upper and lower trapezius will be recorded during 3 x 15 minutes computer work using surface electromyography. The EMG data will be analysed using the Amplitude Probability Distribution Function, which is appropriate for the assessment of muscle load during a prolonged functional task.
Procedures: All subjects will perform a 15 minute standardized computer task in 3 conditions, which will be separated by at least one week as a wash-out period, following a baseline assessment with the 15 minute standardized computer task in each timepoint. Order of the 3 conditions will be randomised. In Condition 1, a rigid tape will be applied from the anterior aspect of the mid clavicle across the body of the Upper Trapezius muscles to approximately the level of the seventh rib with a posterio-inferior force to bunch the Upper Trapezius muscle fibres. In Condition 2, a tape will be applied without tension on the same spot of the Upper Trapezius (Placebo tape). Condition 3 will be the control condition without any tape applied. On completion of the taping, a towel will conceal the taping from view. The effect of taping in each allocated condition will be statistically analysed with repeated measures ANOVA or Freedman tests.</summary>
