  <interventions>
    <interventions>The amino acid N-acetyl cysteine (500mg capsules, taken orally) versus placebo, used adjunctive to stable medication (minimum 8-weeks at consistent dosages) for the individuals OCD for 20 weeks (and an additional 4-week placebo run-out from week-20 to week-24 for all participants). 

Randomised participants will take 2 capsules, twice per day (equating to 2,000mg NAC or placebo per day) for the first 8-weeks of the study. In cases of non-response (&lt;35% reduction in baseline score of primary outcome measure: Y-BOCS), participants will increase their dose by an additional 1,000mg per day from week-8 and remain on this dose for the subsequent 4-weeks. The maximum dose permitted in this study will be 4,000mg (4 capsules twice daily), however, participants will only be permitted to increase their dose by 1,000mg at a time and must remain on this dose for a minimum of 4-weeks before a further titration can occur. Titration will occur at week-8, week-12, week-16 and week-20 in cases of non response. 

All participants will receive placebo (single-blinded, participants remain blinded) for the final 4-weeks of the study (week-20 to week-24). They will continue on the same amount of capsules (however, will be placebo) from the previous 4-weeks OR  in cases of non-response (determined at week-20 after completing Y-BOCS), will increase their dose by an additional 1,000mg (maximum 4,000mg IP per day, 4 capsules bid).

Participants will be asked to return all remaining capsules in their containers at each study follow-up visit. Remaining capsules will be counted by a 3rd party to determine participant compliance. </interventions>

NAC may induce gastrointestinal side effects including mild abdominal pain or discomfort, heartburn, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and cramps. Headaches and skin rashes have also been reported in previous clinical studies. However, specific to psychiatric research studies, only a small minority of participants have withdrawn due to side effects of NAC including a skin rash (n = 1), aggression (n = 1), severe heartburn (n = 1), neutropenia with 6 grams of NAC which resolved when dose reduced to 2.4g, (n = 1) and sensorineural deafness (n = 1) (Slattery et al., 2015). </outcome>

    <sequence>Randomisation of participants to treatment groups (for the first 20-weeks of the study) will be determined by computerised random allocation. Recruited eligible participants will be assigned a participant number and provided capsules according to a corresponding investigational product (IP) number. Participant numbers are provided sequentially and the randomisation code is set up in a 2 by 2 block design, with no group identifying them (to avoid potentially unblinding researcherâ€™s if participants were randomised to medication bottles labelled A or B).</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Participants will be randomised into either NAC or placebo for the first 20-weeks of the study in a double  blind manner. For the last 4-weeks of the study, all participants will receive placebo in a single blinded manner (researchers unblinded). The purpose of including a 4-week, placebo-run out is to asses any withdraw effects and/or sustained response of the NAC.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 200 participants (100 participants in each arm) are to be recruited and intention-to-treat principles will be applied to all data. A large sample of 200 participants is powered to detect a potential small to moderate effect size (f = 0.15) difference between NAC and placebo beyond treatment as usual, approximating a clinically significant 3 point reduction on the Y-BOCS (using all post-baseline data via intention-to-treat analysis). Based on an ANOVA model over seven time-points, a two tailed analysis with alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.80, and a critical F of 3.78; 200 participants (not including drop-outs) are required to detect a small to moderate effect size difference in Y-BOCS scale score between treatment and placebo.       

The primary efficacy analysis will assess mean treatment group differences for the primary outcome measure (Y-BOCS) using a mixed-effects model, repeated measures approach (MMRM). Results from the analysis of dichotomous data (e.g. demographics data) will be presented as proportions with 95% confidence interval, and Fishers Exact p-value where appropriate. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will also be used to compare differences between treatment means in changes from baseline to week 20 last observation carried forward (LOCF) endpoint. The ANCOVA model will assess confounding covariates including intervention type (medication or psychological care), as well as age, gender, weight, physical activity levels, smoking and alcohol consumption. 

Non-parametric statistics will be used when assumptions for parametric methods are violated. Effect sizes will be calculated using Cohens d. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted using a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals. Data will be analysed via SPSS 23.0.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study seeks to elucidate the benefits of NAC augmentation (2-4 grams/day) compared to placebo in the treatment of OCD, in a 20-week, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, with an additional 4-week, single blinded placebo run-out. The purpose of including a 4-week, placebo-run out is to asses any withdraw effects and/or sustained response of the NAC.  It is hypothesized that NAC will be superior over placebo for improving OCD symptoms as measured by a reduction in Y-BOCS scores from baseline against each subsequent time point (W4, W8, W12, W16, W20 and W24). Additional benefits are anticipated for relieving anxiety as well as improving mood, functioning and overall quality of life. </summary>
