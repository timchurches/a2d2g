    <interventions>All participants will be recruited at the preanaesthetic visit and will be consented voluntarily to the study after approval from the consulting anaesthetist. 
Each patient will complete Lung function testing which will involve two different tests before anaesthesia induction: the measurement of respiratory mechanics using the forced oscillation technique and lung volumes using the multiple breath washout technique. These tests will take approximtaley 1 hour. The forced oscilation technique will be repeated after anaesthesia induction. This will take between 5 and 10 minutes. Patients will be monitored throughout their procedures and postoperatively in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU). Any respiratory complications that may occur will be documented. Patients will be followed up on the ward or via telephone within 3 days following surgery incase of any complications. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This study is the first study to establish reference values for lung function and lung mechanics in children under general anaesthesia for surgical procedures.  We have thoroughly reviewed the relevant literature and were not able to find reported reference values of resistance and reactance under anaesthesia in children.  
  
The primary aim of the study is to develop reference ranges for respiratory resistance and compliance and tidal breathing measurements in children aged 1-15 years during surgery under general anaesthesia.  We acknowledge that lung function increases with growth at a varied rate during different age periods.  We will develop the reference equations separately for the three age groups: 1 to&lt;6, 6 to&lt;11 and 11 to &lt;16 years.  Age, gender, height, weight and other potential predictors for these lung function parameters will be investigated to develop the reference equations.  In the best model to predict the normal values of lung function we expect to include all predictors with a correlation coefficient &gt;0.3 for a given lung function parameter.  At the significance of 0.05 we have a power of 86% to significantly identify predictors with this strength of correlation for 100 children in each of the three age groups.  There will be confounding effects between predictors.  We select a variance inflation factor of 1.2 for the adjustment of multicollinearity. After the adjustment we need to recruit 120 children for each of the three age groups.  We have further to account for 25% loss due to unacceptable data, subject exclusion due to clinical conditions during surgery and/or change in clinical management of airway over the three age groups.  Therefore we will recruit 480 children overall for the study to develop reference equations of lung function parameters in children for the three age groups.  

For the investigated predictors we will perform a set of regression analyses with respiratory resistance and compliance and tidal breathing measurements as dependent variables. Diagnostic tests for outliers and influential cases will be utilised to identify outliers. Linear, logarithmic, power and exponential regression techniques will be employed to determine the best relationship between every measured lung function parameter and the investigated predictors.  The best-fitting regression model will be selected according to the likelihood ratio test.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paediatric patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery, or who have been admitted to the Neonatal/Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (NICU/PICU), often require mechanical ventilation. During the perioperative period, these patients are at risk of several types of lung injury, including atelectasis (collapse of lung tissue), pneumonia (disease marked by inflammation of the lungs), pneumothorax (presence of air within the pleural cavity leading to lung collapse), Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
Anaesthetic management can contribute to these injuries, exacerbate any underlying lung conditions or even improve outcomes, depending on the specific situation. Moreover, several studies have shown that pulmonary complications, more specifically respiratory failure requiring ventilation, are associated with high morbidity and mortality along with increased health-related costs and greater length of hospital stay. 
Ventilation mode (volume, pressure or dual), modality (controlled, assisted, support ventilation) and respiratory parameters (e.g. tidal volume and respiratory rate) are the most important factors of mechanical ventilation. An important aspect of ventilation strategies is to optimise respiratory mechanics. A critical part of this process is knowing the normal range of respiratory mechanics during ventilation. This allows clinicians to define ventilation such that the respiratory mechanics can be maintained at a level expected for that particular patient and therefore protect against over- or under ventilation and thus minimise potential harm. While the normal ranges of a variety of respiratory outcomes during mechanical ventilation have been assessed in adults, there are no normal reference ranges of values available for the paediatric population. This precludes the formulation of clear evidence-based ventilation guidelines in children. 
Measurable mechanical and physiological parameters such as pulmonary compliance (ease of expansion of the lungs and thorax), respiratory resistance (resistance to flow of gases during ventilation), tidal volume (volume of air moved in and out during quiet/normal breathing) can be used to effectively monitor the effect of changes in mechanical ventilation and limit the risk of Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury VILI. Furthermore, the lack of precise data on these essential parameters as well as the implications relating to the lack of this important data, have been highlighted by experts from the recent American Thoracic Society workshop on the evaluation of respiratory mechanics and function in patients being cared for in paediatric and neonatal ICU settings (personal communication from Dr Carmichael-Peterson, Chair of the American Thoracic Society Task Force for the measurement of respiratory function in the ICU). Better ventilation strategies are also of particular importance in children with cardiac and/or respiratory co-morbidities undergoing anaesthesia as well as children with prolonged surgeries impacting on respiratory function, e.g. pneumoperitoneum, extensive abdominal surgery.

This study aims at measuring lung function outcomes in children aged between 1 and 15 years old who are undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia and require mechanical ventilation. 

We hypothesise that by measuring the respiratory resistance and pulmonary compliance of children undergoing surgery before and after anaesthesia induction, we will be able to develop robust prediction equations and nomograms that define the values of physiological parameters to be programmed in mechanical ventilators for optimal lung function in anaesthetised children having surgery.</summary>
