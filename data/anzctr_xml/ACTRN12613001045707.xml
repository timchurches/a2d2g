  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a two-component observational study that will collect data both retrospectively and prospectively. Data for all pregnant women and their infants in NZ between 2009 and 2013 will be obtained and pertussis vaccine exposure during pregnancy verified (Study One). A sub-study will actively follow mothers who received Tdap during pregnancy with one also following their infants for upto one year after birth (Study Two ). </interventions>

      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1 : To establish background rated for key endpoints in pregnant women and their infants (Study One).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary Outcome 1 Timepoint: Data on all women in NZ who were pregnant between 2009 and 2013 will be retrieved from four datasets: National Minimum Dataset for Hospitalisation Data, The National Immunisation Register for Infant Immunisation Data, Notification Data from the ESR, Pregnancy Immunisation records from the HealthPAC claims database. Data will be analysed once collected. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2 : To evaluate health outcomes in infants of mothers vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy (Study Two). The pregnancy safety data will be descriptive in nature, including percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The rates of AEs and SAEs following pertussis vaccine will be discussed in context with the rates previously described pertussis. The expected background rates of MAEs and SAEs for Tdap given during pregnancy are unknown, but as a guide the rates of MAEs for pregnant women receiving influenza vaccine previously reported ranged from 1.1 to 3.8% while the rate of SAEs ranged from 0.4 to 1.5%. Women who have complicated pregnancies will be excluded from the final analyses and described separately. The temporal relationship between onset of events and vaccination will be presented including distribution where appropriate). This is an observational study and in this small study sample we anticipant events to be primary restricted to local injection site reactions such as redness, swelling or induration. There may be reports of systemic events such as malise, fever or headache. This is not an intervention so there is no change in usual practice.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary Outcome 2 Timepoint: Mothers will be contact by phone as soon as possible after identification to capture any solicited events within the first 48 hours and the first 7 days of receiving vaccine(s). Four weeks post-vaccine administration to pregnant woman (prospective). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Any difference in hospital-related outcomes of those women vaccinated or not with Tdap during pregnancy will be examined (Study One).
Any difference in birth outcomes and hospital-related outcomes of infants born to mothers vaccinated or not with Tdap during pregnancy will be examined (Study One). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Study one- This study is over a five-year period with approximately 325,000 births. The maternal vaccinated is anticipated to increase over the time as the funded vaccine is promoted approximately 30% of mothers are expected to have received vaccination during pregnancy between 2009 and 2013. This data forms part of a population datalink study drawing together four datasets being National Minimum Dataset for hospitalisation data, The National Immunisation Register for infant immunisation data, Notification data from the, ESR, Pregnancy Immunisation records from the HealthPAC claims database. Data will be analysis once collected.

      <timepoint>Study two will envolve the Practice staff identifying potential participants and providing them with an information sheet summary The first contact with mother by phone (standard script) as soon as possible after identification to capture any solicited events within first 48 hours and first 7 days of receiving vaccine(s). Four weeks post-vaccine administration to pregnant woman (prospective). Phone/written questionnaire will be administered to capture any solicited events in mother up to four weeks after receipt of vaccine</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Study one -Logistic regression will be used to estimate odds ratios for the risk for (specific) adverse events for both mothers and infants in vaccine exposed and unexposed groups. Age, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation and season for hospital admission will be included as additional explanatory variables.
As specific diagnoses are not necessarily independent events each person will only be counted once for each hospitalisation, the primary diagnosis and repeat admissions for the same episode will be removed, including transfers from one hospital to another.
For diagnosis where individuals may have multiple admissions for different occurrences and the outcome is a count, Poisson regression will be used with testing and adjustment for overdispersion where required.
The temporal relationship between onset of events and vaccination will be presented including distribution where appropriate,
Serious adverse events will be reported as detailed clinical cases. 
To analyse the effect of TdaP on still births we will perform a survival analysis. The time dependent explanatory variable of vaccination status and failure of still birth and censored at birth, also including demographics as explanatory variables. The independent explanatory variable will be TdaP vaccination status of the mother (time dependent). Time will commence at the beginning of the inclusion time for an individual 28(20) weeks gestation. Women will be censored at time of live birth or at the end of the study period, 31 December 2013, whichever occurs first.
Study two- The pregnancy safety data will be descriptive in nature, including percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The rates of AEs and SAEs following pertussis vaccine will be discussed in context with the rates previously described pertussis. The expected background rates of MAEs and SAEs for Tdap given during pregnancy are unknown, but as a guide the rates of MAEs for pregnant women receiving influenza vaccine previously reported ranged from 1.1 to 3.8% while the rate of SAEs ranged from 0.4 to 1.5%.  
Women who have complicated pregnancies will be excluded from the final analyses and described separately.
The temporal relationship between onset of events and vaccination will be presented including distribution where appropriate.
Serious adverse events will be reported as detailed clinical cases. Other events will be groups according to Brighton Collaboration Definitions.
