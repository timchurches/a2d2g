    <concealment>Randomisation will be achieved using a minimisation algorithm via a password-protected encrypted web based interface. Randomisation will be stratified according to participating site and operative or non-operative admission to the ICU. Following successful randomisation, each patient will be assigned a unique ‘patient study number’ and a unique ‘study treatment number’. The unique study treatment number is matched to blinded study treatment with sufficient study drug to last the 7 day course of treatment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be achieved using a minimisation algorithm.
Stratification will occur at centre level and by operative and non operative.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether adult patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with septic shock
who are given hydrocortisone compared to placebo (a dummy solution), will have an improved rate of survival 90
days later.
Septic shock is the result of an infection, which triggers a complex response by the body (the inflammatory
response) that causes a decrease in blood pressure and subsequently one or more organ systems to fail when
blood supply to these organs is reduced. This may result in poor recovery and death. About a quarter of the people
who suffer septic shock that is not rapidly reversed, will die.
When patients are admitted to Intensive Care with sepsis and/or septic shock they receive a number of therapies.
These include fluids given through a drip, antibiotics, drugs to boost your blood pressure and other organ systems.
In addition to these therapies, steroids (hydrocortisone) are sometimes administered. Whether steroids are useful
or not in the treatment of severe infections has been studied for more than 50 years. Previous research has
suggested that the use of low dose steroid may have shortterm
benefits in improving the circulation. However, there
is no agreement amongst doctors around the world about whether treatment with or without low dose steroids
improves the overall recovery and survival in patients with septic shock. This study would allow doctors to make
informed decisions about whether the addition of low dose steroid therapy is better for patients with septic shock in
intensive care.
The study will include 3800 intensive care patients who have septic shock.
Each enrolled patient will be randomised to receive either Hydrocortisone 200mg or placebo daily for 7 days as a
continuous intravenous infusion while in intensive care. The patient will be followed for 90 days. If the patient is
discharged prior to 90 days a telephone call will be made for the followup information. At six months the patient will
be contacted again for completion of a quality of life questionnaire.</summary>
