    <interventions>New device (Odon Device) to deliver the fetus. The Odon device is a low cost, easy to use technological innovation to facilitate operative vaginal delivery and designed to minimize trauma to the mother and baby. The device is made of film-like polyethylene material and designed to be easily applied with the help of an inserter. It may be potentially safer and easier to apply than forceps/vacuum extractor for assisted deliveries, and a safe alternative to some caesarean sections (www.odondevice.com). 

In Phase I, the device will be applied to women without labour complications under non-emergency/normal delivery conditions. The device is applied on second stage of labour (i.e. cervix fully dilated) and on a station level equivalent to 2 cm or more below the spines.</interventions>
    <comparator>No comparator is used (Phase I). In this phase of the trial the device will be tested for safety and feasibility in terms of ease of application and successful delivery under non-emergency/normal delviery conditions</comparator>

    <concealment>Women will be approached during antenatal visits by a midwife who will explain the study objective and procedures. If the woman agrees to receive more information about the study, she will be fully briefed by a member of the study team who will review the consent form and show her the Odon device and how it functions. An explanatory video will also be made available. She will take the information home to think about it and discuss with family members if she wishes. She can sign the consent form when she returns for the next antenatal visit. Consent will be obtained before the initiation of labor.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intrapartum complications are responsible for approximately half of all maternal deaths and two million stillbirth and neonatal deaths per year. Prolonged second stage of labor is associated with potentially fatal maternal complications and is a major cause of stillbirth and newborn morbidity and mortality. Currently, the three main options for managing prolonged second stage of labor are cesarean section, forceps and vacuum extractor. All three clinical practices require relatively expensive equipment, highly trained staff that are often not available in low resource settings and, even if available, their use is associated with increased maternal and perinatal complications.

The specific aim of the proposed study is to test the safety and feasibility (Phase 1) and preliminary efficacy (Phase 2) of a new device (Odon Device) to deliver the fetus during prolonged second stage of labor. The Odon device is a low cost, easy to use technological innovation to facilitate operative vaginal delivery and designed to minimize trauma to the mother and baby. This device may be potentially safer and easier to apply than forceps/vacuum extractor for assisted deliveries, and a safe alternative to some caesarean sections. If proven safe and effective, the Odon Device will be the first innovation in operative vaginal delivery since the independent development of forceps and the vacuum extractor centuries ago. The Odon device could play a major role in improving intrapartum obstetric care in low resource settings by making possible effective management of intrapartum complications in facilities lacking surgical capacity and/or personnel adequately trained in the use of forceps and the vacuum extractor. </summary>
