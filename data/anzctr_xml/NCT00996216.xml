    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Eltrombopag
Treatment: drugs - Antiviral therapy

Experimental: Open-label eltrombopag - Open-label eltrombopag with dose titrations to support adequate platelet counts.


Treatment: drugs: Eltrombopag
Eltrombopag starting at 25 mg dose and titrated in Part 1 of study to 50, 75, 100 mg. Platelet count must reach sufficient level to allow initiation of antiviral therapy. Eltrombopag dose may be adjusted during antiviral treatment phase of study to maintain platelet count to continue antiviral therapy without adjustment to antiviral dose.

Treatment: drugs: Antiviral therapy
Combination of either peginterferon alfa-2a or alfa-2b with ribavirin at investigator's discretion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in Part 1 - An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs and SAEs.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when used to
      increase and maintain platelet count. Platelet count to be maintained at a level sufficient
      to facilitate initiation of antiviral therapy, to minimize antiviral therapy dose reductions,
      and to avoid permanent discontinuation of antiviral therapy.</summary>
