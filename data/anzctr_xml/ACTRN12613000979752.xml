    <statisticalmethods>For this analysis, the predictor variables, waist circumference and BMI will be considered as both continuous and categorical variables, with cut-off values for overweight and obese as specified by the World Health Organisation. Descriptive statistics will be computed by frequency and percentage distribution for categorical data and mean with standard deviation for continuous data. A univariate logistic  regression analysis of the  predictor variables to the  primary outcome, namely 30-day major adverse events will be performed followed by multivariate logistic regression after adjusting for the covariates namely demographics,  preoperative comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values and  intraoperative data including the complexity of surgeries, classified as either intermediate or high risk. Multiple least squares regression of length of stay and costs incurred on waist circumference and BMI will be separately performed both as univariate and multivariate models.  These analyses will be repeated with neck circumference and waist to hip ratio to compare their association with the outcomes. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> Many recent studies have shown that overweight and mildly obese individuals have marginally better outcomes compared to individuals with normal weight following surgery or even nonsurgical situations such as heart related problems. However, body mass index (BMI) is not an accurate measure of body fat composition. We therefore need a measure that can be used at the bedside as well as one that can accurately predict the body fat composition and hence the risk associated with surgery. This pilot study is a miniature version of a future multicentre prospective cohort study to assess if waist circumference is a predictor of postoperative major adverse outcomes after elective non-cardiac surgeries. If that is so, we would like to know if it is better predictor than the currently popular predictor, BMI. We are also testing if other measures like waist to hip ratio, neck circumference are equally useful predictors or not.</summary>
