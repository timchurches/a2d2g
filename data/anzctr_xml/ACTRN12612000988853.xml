    <interventions>Computer-Based Attention-Focused Treatment:
The treatment will involve children viewing a series of pictures on a computer screen presented in 3 x 3 displays; some pictures will be mildly aversive and unpleasant while others will be calm and pleasant pictures. To train children to focus on pleasant and calm stimuli within their environment in order to offset the anxiety response, children are required to find and click on the pleasant or calm target picture presented within each 3 x 3 display. These displays are presented in a series of blocks of trials (20-40 trials per block over 9 blocks) in which the number of pleasant and calm targets varies from 1 to 3 targets children have to choose from. This is to promote active search for a pleasant or calm target. Children will complete the training program at home via a DVD sent to them containing the training program. They will complete the training independently 4 times per week for 3 weeks, consistent with prior paediatric research on attention modification training in children (Waters, Pittaway, Bradley, Mogg, &amp; Pine, under review). Each training session will take approximately 20 minutes. The program has been piloted with several children during development and includes short breaks throughout the training. Children are also encouraged to use key messages throughout the program to assist with learning to direct their attention to pleasant and calm targets. These include "look for good', "look for calm', 'use both options' and 'never give up' trying to utilise these strategies. Parents are provided with an information booklet about the program and how they can assist their child in learning the strategies.</interventions>
    <comparator>To accomplish the scientific goals of this project, participants will be randomly assigned to the attention-focused treatment condition or to a waitlist condition. Following an initial assessment the children in the Active Treatment Condition will undertake the treatment while the Waitlist Condition waits. Both groups will then be re-assessed after which time the children in the Waitlist Condition will then receive the treatment. All children will be re-assessed at 6-month and 12-month follow-up after treatment.</comparator>

    <concealment>Eligibility for enrollment in the study will be determined before participants are randomy allocated to treatment conditions. Those who are determined to be ineligible will be referred elsewhere. 

Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to treatment conditions using a computer-generated randomisation schedule. This schedule will be stored by a research assistant independent to this project. Therapists completing pre-treatment assessments will be blind to the child's allocated condition until after assessments are finalised. New therapists blind to children's pre-treatment diagnosis and condition will complete subsequent post-treatment and follow-up assessments.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will examine a new treatment that is based on recent scientific findings about how children direct their attention to different stimuli that triggers anxiety. This treatment, called attention-focused treatment is delivered on a computer and takes about 30 min to complete. Children will complete the treatment 12 times over 3 weeks during sessions they can undertake at home. The treatment is thought to work because it helps children learn to control the focus of their attention on certain stimuli in the environment which in turn helps to prevent anxiety.</summary>
