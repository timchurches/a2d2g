  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: a multiple micronutrient supplement

Composition of each capsule: 12.5 mg iron, 10 mg zinc, 400 micrograms vitamin A, 0.5 mg vitamin B1, 0.5 mg vitamin B2, 0.5 mg vitamin B6, 0.9 microgram vitamin B12, 30 mg vitamin C, 5 micrograms vitamin D3, 5 mg vitamin E, 150 micrograms folic acid, 6 mg vitamin B3, 0.56 mg copper, 90 micrograms iodine and 17 micrograms selenium. One capsule will be consumed by each participant five times per week (Monday to Friday) for six months. 

Adherence: school staff will administer the supplement (1 capsule) to each child every day (Monday to Friday) for six months. School staff will monitor and record if the supplement has been taken; both empty and unused blister packs will be collected from school staff to further assess adherence. A blood sample will be taken at the beginning and end of study to confirm the effectiveness of the supplement in increasing haemoglobin concentration, and improving iron, zinc, vitamin A and other micronutrient status.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Micronutrient deficiencies are a major health problem among underweight children in Vietnam. Similarly, overweight/obese children are at an increased risk of micronutrient deficiencies. This is of concern because both underweight and overweight/obesity affect many school children in Vietnam. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a multiple micronutrient supplement on the micronutrient status of underweight and overweight/obese primary school children in rural areas in Vietnam.</summary>
