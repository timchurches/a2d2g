  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA)
Treatment: drugs - recombinant deoxyribonuclease (DNase)

Experimental: Single dose - The first 5 consented participants will be administered t-PA 10mg + DNase 5mg instilled into a dialysate bag and infused for a 4 hour intraperitoneal dwell.

Experimental: 2 doses - The next 5 consented participants will be administered t-PA 10mg + DNase 5mg instilled twice a day for one day

Experimental: 4 doses - The next 5 consented participants will be administered tPA 10mg + DNase 5mg twice a day for 2 days.

No Intervention: control - Any potential participants that have not consented into the intervention arms will be approached to be consented into a non-intervention observational control group. A maximum of 5 participants will be recruited into this control group.


Treatment: drugs: Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA)
tPA 10mg per dose intraperitoneal

Treatment: drugs: recombinant deoxyribonuclease (DNase)
DNase 5mg per dose given intraperitoneally.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis:

      Intraperitoneal tPA and DNase is well tolerated at a number of different doses. Different
      doses of tPA and DNase will have a dose-related effect on inflammatory markers (CRP and
      intraperitoneal white cell count).

      Aims:

        1. To examine the tolerability of different doses of intraperitoneal tPA and DNase compared
           to standard treatment.

        2. To examine the changes in biochemical and clinical outcomes of PD Peritonitis with the
           addition of intraperitoneal tPA and DNase to usual therapy.</summary>
