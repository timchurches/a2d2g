    <interventions>This study compares the effectiveness of a novel device-based self-monitoring intervention to improve adults physical activity, sedentary, and sleep-wake behaviours, compared with a user-entered self-monitoring intervention. The intervention used in this study, Balance, will be a freely available app that can be used on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) with a self-monitoring device (device-measured (Fitbit); Group 1) or without one (user-entered; Group 2). 
The proposed project will involve the development of a 2 arm intervention (Group 1: device (device-measured (Fitbit); Group 2: no device, user-entered) to engage participants in daily self-monitoring of physical activity, sitting and sleep-wake behaviours and to improve these behaviours. The intervention duration is 9 weeks and participants can access the intervention throughout the entire study period, both groups will be encouraged to engage in daily self-monitoring of behaviours. The proposed intervention may contribute to reducing levels of physical inactivity and insufficient sleep. 
We aim to recruit a minimum of 64 adults aged 18-55 years from the Hunter Region, NSW, Australia. Participants will be low active, report frequent insufficient sleep and have a BMI between 18.5-35. It has been determined that a minimum of 32 participants per group would be required to detect statistically significant effects assuming a drop out of 35%. 
Eligible participants will be asked to complete both physiological and survey based assessments at baseline, and 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 9 weeks post baseline. Participants will have access to the intervention throughout the entire study period and following the completion of the study. 
Participants in both intervention groups will be able to self-monitor physical activity, sitting and sleep-wake behaviours, set goals for these behaviours, be provided with graphical feedback on their behaviour. Only the method of self-monitoring will differ, device measured or user-entered. In the device measured group, Fitbit data is automatically synchronized with the Balance platform via bluetooth and the internet (either wifi or phone network). Both groups will receive educational materials outlining the health effects of physical inactivity and insufficient sleep and strategies to assist in improving these behaviours.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited via recruit posters distributed at University of Newcastle Callaghan campus, local businesses, community notice boards (both physical and electronically), community events (e.g., relay for life, bike for life) and via electronic communication (PRC-PAN email lists, social media profiles of PRC-PAN and researchers, University associated participant registries, email and promotions). 
Interested participants will be asked to visit a website where they will complete a online screening questionnaire to assess eligibility. 

Eligible participants will be invited to attend a baseline assessment session at the University of Newcastle, Callaghan campus. At this session the study purpose, requirements will be described to participants, consent will be obtained, and participants will be provided with a GENEActiv monitor to wear for 8 days. After this participants will return to University to return the GENEActiv, complete surveys instruments and have physiological assessments completed. Following the completion of these assessments participants will be randomized to a intervention group, have the app installed on their device and if allocated to the device-entered group be provided with a Fitbit. 
Randomisation will occur using a computer-based random number generator. The sequence will be generated by a researcher not involved in participant assessments and will be stored on a central database not accessible to those completing the assessments. Group allocations will be concealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes which will be distributed to participants by a researcher not involved in the assessments.

The analysis will be conducted using STATA and alpha will be set at &lt;0.05. Sample size was determined assuming a correlation of 0.6 between repeated measures, 80% power, and a group by time interaction for each of the five primary outcome variables, at the 1% significance threshold, and differences between groups of 30 minutes of physical activity, 90 minutes of sedentary behaviour, 30 minutes in sleep variation.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of Balanced project is to examine the feasibility of a mobile device intervention, Balanced, to improve the physical activity and sleep behaviours of Australian adults (aged 18-55). Balanced will allow participants to keep track of their sitting, physical activity and sleep behaviours each day and will encourage them to make changes to daily routines to improve these behaviours. 

Following recruitment and completion of baseline assessments participants will be randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups. One group will be asked to wear an activity tracker on their wrist which will record daily activities, participants will be asked to return this monitor at the end of the study; the second group will be asked to recall and record their activities each day. 

Participants will complete follow-up assessments at 3,6 and 9 weeks post baseline assessment. Objective measures of behaviour and cardiometabolic risk will be assessed in addition to self-report measures of behaviour, physical and mental well-being and correlates of activity, sitting and sleep behaviours. </summary>
