  <interventions>
    <interventions>Insomnia is a distressing difficulty in falling asleep, staying asleep, waking early or a combination of these symptoms, where there is also a perception of insufficient sleep. Research has shown that CBT group treatment of insomnia is significantly effective in treatment outcomes (improved sleep and mood), reduced treatment time and resources. CBT group workshops have been running since October 2003 at RPAH.  The current group workshop comprises of four, one and half hour sessions held once a fortnight.  Our aim is to assess both the outcomes and effectiveness of this current insomnia program with long term follow up at 6 and 12 months and 3 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep Efficiency is the primary outcome.  Sleep efficiency is derived from the formula of estimated total sleep time/time in bed and multiplied by 100/1.  This formula is a component score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sleep efficiency will be assessed at baseline and at the 4th session. Questionnaires will be sent to participants at 6 months, 12 months &amp; 3 years.</timepoint>
