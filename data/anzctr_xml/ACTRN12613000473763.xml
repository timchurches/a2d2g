  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention participants will take part in a 12-week lifestyle program during which they will wear a pedometer and use an online resource. The main focus of the online resource is a step log where participants enter their daily step counts, perception of exertion and feeling daily. Based on this information they will be emailed weekly step count goals. The website will also include an interactive forum that links participants to other cancer survivors. There will be a virtual notice board where community service organisers can advertise events and activities relating to physical activity and healthy eating. Information on healthy eating will be provided based on the Cancer Council Australia's nutrition guidelines which supports the recommendations in The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (developed by the Australian Government, Department of Health and Ageing). Participants are free to use (or not use) the program at their discretion. Adherence will be monitored by number of logins to the website and follow-up telephone calls every 2 weeks during the intervention.

Health measures such as height, weight, blood pressure, waist and hip girth will be collected. Participants will also be asked to fill out questionnaires relating to their physical and psychological health.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be a waitlist control. They will receive a pedometer for the first 12-weeks, and will then be given access to the intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased physical activity levels (increased number of steps per day) as measured by sealed pedometer readings at baseline, end-program (week 13) and three month follow-up. Step data entered by participants onto the step log during the program will also be assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 13</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved QOL outcomes. Physical and psychological wellbeing will be assessed with SF-36, self-efficacy and motivation will be assessed with the PAMA (physical activity maintenance assessment).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 13</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved dietary habits (increased consumption of core foods and decreased consumption of non-core foods) as measured by the Cancer Council Australia's food frequency questionnaire.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of an online resource to increase physical activity (primarily walking) and improve diet among cancer survivors living in South Australia. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have any type of cancer (except skin cancer) treated with curative intent. You need to be a permanent resident of South Australia, and you should not be undergoing any active treatment. You will also require access to the internet. Trial details Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in the intervention group will take part in a 12-week lifestyle program during which they will wear a pedometer and use an online resource. The main focus of the online resource is a step log where participants enter their daily step counts, perception of exertion and feeling daily. Based on this information they will be emailed weekly step count goals. The website will also include an interactive forum that links participants to other cancer survivors. There will be a virtual notice board where community service organisers can advertise events and activities relating to physical activity and healthy eating. Information on healthy eating will be provided based on the Cancer Council Australia's nutrition guidelines which supports the recommendations in The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (developed by the Australian Government, Department of Health and Ageing). Participants are free to use (or not use) the program at their discretion. Participants in the other group will receive a pedometer only for the first 12 weeks, after which time they will be offered the full program. Health measures such as height, weight, blood pressure, waist and hip girth will be collected from each patient at the start and end of the program, and 3 months after program completion. Participants will also be asked to fill out questionnaires relating to their physical and psychological health.</summary>
