  <interventions>
    <interventions>2 parallel groups.  

Group 1 - Weight loss alone.  Participants will undergo 12 weeks of weight loss followed by 4 weeks of weight maintenance.  Over the 16 weeks, each participant will meet with a dietitian face-to-face every 2 weeks (each session approximately 30-60minutes) for professional dietary advice.

Group 2 - Weight loss plus Fish Oil.  Participants will undergo 12 weeks of weight loss followed by 4 weeks of weight maintenance.  Over the 16 weeks, each participant will meet with a dietitian face-to-face every 2 weeks (each session approximately 30-60minutes) for professional dietary advice. Throughout this 16 weeks period, participants will also be provided with n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (Fish Oil) oral supplementation (4g/day) to be consumed daily.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the effect of n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters oral supplementation on Very-Low-Density-Lipoprotein (VLDL) transport in the background of weight loss.  VLDL transport will be determined through blood analysis and compared between the two groups.  All analysis will be carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).  Associations will be examined using simple regression method.  Paired T-tests will be used to assess changes within both treatment groups for all variables.  Differences between the groups prior to randomistation will be determined by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  Compartmental analysis will be used to develop and fit models to lipid and lipoprotein tracer data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>VLDL transport time points are baseline, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 mins, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours following administration of D3-Leucine stable isotope and vitamin A capsules on 2 occasions. i.e. the beginning and end of the 16 weeks treatment period.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine the effect of weight loss plus oral supplementation of Omacor (Fish Oil) on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein transport in obese subjects.  We hypothesis that in obese subjects, triglyceride production will be further reduced with Omacor oral supplementation in addition to weight loss in the postprandial state.  All eligible participants will be on a weight loss period for 12 weeks followed by a weight maintanence period of 4 weeks.  During these 16 weeks, each participant will be randomised into either weight loss alone (Group 1) or weight loss plus Omacor oral supplementation (Group 2).</summary>
