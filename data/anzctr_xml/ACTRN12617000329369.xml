    <designfeatures>A single centre three-arm open-label randomised controlled trial with participants allocated to Arms 1, 2 and 3 in a ratio of 2:2:1.

The study would not be strictly blinded, in that investigators and participants will be aware of which treatment dose is being administered. However treatment allocation will not be known to microscopists evaluating follow-up slides or laboratory staff performing parasite PCR. Therefore the major study outcome measures should be free of potential for bias. 
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Primary endpoint therapeutic efficacy analysis:  

This will compare rates of P.vivax recurrence in each treatment arm based on time-to-event analysis over the 6-month follow-up period. The following approaches will be utilized:

* The primary comparison of therapeutic efficacy (ie between the AL+PQ arm and the DP+PQ arm) will be defined as the proportional difference in the P.vivax recurrence incidence rates based on Cox-regression (assuming proportional hazard). 
* P.vivax recurrence incidence rates will be calculated as the number of participants in each treatment arm with recurrent P.vivax parasitaemia divided by the total duration for which they are at risk of recurrence  with this denominator equating to the total number of person-years of follow-up.
* For each individual, the total measured duration at which they are at risk will depend on duration for which they are actively followed-up in the study. This will vary between 1 and 154 days (from the final PQ dose) and will depend on the following:
a)	Any individual meeting criteria for the microscopy endpoint will be considered to have met the study endpoint. So no further data will be collected in any individual following a documented P.vivax recurrence. Therefore participants will effectively be removed/ censored once they reach the study endpoint (recurrence or 6 months follow-up, whichever comes first). 
b)	Any individual who is re-treated with PQ for reasons other than a documented P.vivax recurrence (eg inadvertent re-treatment due to initial misdiagnosis of P.falciparum) will be censored from the time of PQ treatment onwards. 
c)	Participants who are diagnosed and treated for P. falciparum malaria during the follow-up period will be excluded from time at risk for 3 weeks following their AL re-treatment (based on estimated period of post-treatment schizonticidal prophylaxis). 
d)	The approach to missing data (due to missed scheduled visits or complete loss to follow-up) will be as follows:

Primary analysis will be per-protocol, meaning that participants lost to follow-up will effectively be censored from the time of their last follow-up.

When one or more scheduled follow-ups are missed and followed by a successful follow-up, the microscopy result during the missed visits will be assumed to be the same as on that of the next successful follow-up. For instance for a participant who is seen on Day 56 and has a negative blood slide, then misses the Day 70 visit and is seen on Day 84 with a negative blood slide, then the assumed blood slide result on Day 70 will be negative. If the Day 84 blood slide was positive, then the Day 70 result would also be assumed to be positive. 

Further sub-analyses based on the primary endpoint will include the following:

1.	Intention to treat analysis based on worst case scenario. This assumes that any participant lost to follow-up had a P.vivax recurrence at the time of their next scheduled follow-up.
2.	Intention to treat analysis based on a best case scenario. This assumes that any participant lost to follow-up remained free of P.vivax recurrence for the entire 6-month follow-up. Together with (1), this provides a sensitivity analysis around the per-protocol estimate. (Karunajeewa HA, Mueller I, Senn M, Lin E, Law I, et al. (2008) A trial of combination antimalarial therapies in children from Papua New Guinea. N Engl J Med 359: 2545-2557.) P.vivax recurrence incidence rates documented in the delayed PQ control arm (Arm 3) will be used to re-calculate an estimate of radical curative efficacy in Arms 1 and 2 according to the formulas:

Radical curative efficacy Arm 1=  1  P.vivax recurrence incidence rate Arm 1/
				       P.vivax recurrence incidence rate Arm 3

Radical curative efficacy Arm 2=  1  P.vivax recurrence incidence rate Arm 2/
				       P.vivax recurrence incidence rate Arm 3

3.	Recurrence incidence rates in each treatment group will be stratified by genotypically derived activity score (AS)
4.	In order to explore a range of factors that may contribute to treatment failure, binary logistic regression will be conducted, using P.vivax recurrence (yes/no) as the dependent variable and the following independent variables:
a.	Genotypically-derived CYP2D6 activity score (ordinal variable 0-4)
b.	Age
c.	Sex
d.	Treatment arm (1, 2 or 3)
e.	Baseline parasite density
f.	Baseline temperature
g.	Baseline Hb concentration (g/dL)
h.	Met-Hb level at day 7

Analyses of secondary endpoints:

1.	PCR endpoint (alternative parasitological/ treatment efficacy endpoint)  will use exactly the same methods as set out for the primary efficacy analysis, except that when a participant has a negative blood slide but a positive P.vivax PCR at a given time-point, this will be regarded as a recurrence, meaning that they will be considered to have reached the study endpoint and all data from subsequent follow-ups will be censored. 
2.	 Genotypically-corrected PCR endpoint (alternative parasitological/ treatment efficacy endpoint)  will use exactly the same methods as set out for the primary efficacy analysis, except that when a participant has recurrent P.vivax parasitaemia with genotype that is discrepant with their baseline sample (consistent with a reinfection) then for the purposes of this analysis, this result will be re-classified as a negative blood slide. 
3.	Met-Hb levels and Hb concentrations at specified time-points will be compared between treatment arms using either independent T tests or (if non-normally distributed data) Mann-Whitney-U tests. 
4.	Incidence of adverse events (including haemolytic anaemia) would be compared between the treatment arms using Chi Squared testing. 
5.	Per-treatment group estimates of primary and secondary pharmacokinetic parameters would be determined by applying mixed non-linear effects modelling using NONMEM population pharmacokinetic modelling method.

All non-pharmacokinetic statistical analyses will be performed using STATA.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a clinical trial designed to answer a specific question regarding the possibility that a drug-drug interaction (DDI) between two commonly used treatments for malaria may compromise effectiveness of curing the now dominant species causing malaria in the Solomon Islands, Plasmodium vivax. This hypothesis is supported by existing knowledge regarding the biology of how these drugs work and by observations that cure rates for vivax malaria are very low in other South Pacific countries (like Vanuatu) that are using the same drug combinations as in the Solomon Islands. The research is intended to help decide on the most effective malaria treatment to use in the Solomon Islands and this question has fundamental importance to strategies for eliminating malaria in the Solomon Islands and the other malaria-endemic countries of the Melanesian South Pacific. 

The research will be a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) of patients with clinical P.vivax infection in the Solomon Islands. It will compare the radical curative efficacy of the drug primaquine (PQ) when co-administered with the current standard treatment of malaria in the Solomons, artemether-lumevantrine (AL) versus PQ co-administered with an alternative malaria treatment (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP).

The research will be conducted in the Tetere region by enrolling patients (both adults and children) through local health centres who are sick with vivax malaria (both male and female, aged 1 and over). Inclusion criteria will include a positive diagnosis of vivax malaria. Exclusion criteria will include infancy (aged &lt;1), pregnancy, a positive G6PD test (performed on all prospective participants  a positive test indicates susceptibility to drug side-effects) and inability or refusal to provide informed written consent.
