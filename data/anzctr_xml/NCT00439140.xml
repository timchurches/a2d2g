Treatment: drugs - Normal Saline (Placebo)

Experimental: botulinum toxin Type A 200U - Botulinum toxin Type A 200U injection into the detrusor on Day 1 followed by a repeat botulinum toxin Type A 200U injection after a minimum of 12 weeks (if applicable).

Experimental: botulinum toxin Type A 300U - Botulinum toxin Type A 300U injection into the detrusor on Day 1 followed by a repeat botulinum toxin Type A 300U injection after a minimum of 12 weeks (if applicable).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) - Spirometry was conducted according to American Thoracic Society standards. A spirometer was used to measure FVC, the maximum amount of air exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible, at Baseline and Week 6. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 6</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) - Spirometry was conducted according to American Thoracic Society standards. A spirometer was used to measure FEV1, the maximum amount of air exhaled in one second, at Baseline and Week 6. The highest value at each time-point was recorded. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 6</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in FEV1/FVC Ratio - The FEV1/FVC ratio was calculated by dividing the FEV1 value by the FVC value representing the portion (or ratio) of FVC exhaled in one second. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 6</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes - The number of urinary incontinence episodes or leakage occurring over the previous 3 days was recorded in the patient bladder diary at Baseline and prior to Week 6. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement (less incontinence/leakage).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Maximum (Amplitude) Detrusor Pressure (MDP) - MDP was measured at the first involuntary detrusor contraction using urodynamic testing. A catheter was inserted into the bladder at Baseline and Week 6 and the pressure [measured in centimeters water (cm H20)] was determined as the bladder filled. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement (less Detrusor pressure).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC) - MCC (the maximum amount of urine the bladder could hold) was measured using urodynamic testing. The amount of urine collected was subtracted from the total volume infused measured as milliliters (mL) of urine. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement (fuller bladder/ less incontinence).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
