    <studytitle>Recharge: an app-based intervention for young men to improve wellbeing. </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In young men (aged 16-24 years) does a phone app-based intervention targeting the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, compared to phone apps monitoring mood or providing health information, improve wellbeing?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>A phone app-based intervention targeting the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. The participant sets target sleep, wake and exercise targets that encourage them to wake within 2 hours of sunrise and set a bed time 16 hours after this time. In addition, early morning daylight exposure, morning physical activity and overall increased physical activity are encouraged and monitored (with feedback) during the intervention. Participants are encouraged to use the app 4 times a day with an overall daily use of approximately 10 minutes. However, they are able to use the app as frequently as they choose. The intervention duration is 6 weeks, with 4 weeks of active intervention and a 2 week maintenance phase. Participants are provided with a unique login to the app and adherence is monitored using event logs and post intervention questionnaire items. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be randomly allocated to a phone app designed to monitor and chart subjective mood ratings or a phone app providing health information. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measure for the study is the SPHERE-12. Estimates of sample size were based on the expectancy that 65% of subjects using the experimental condition (Recharge app) would have a successful outcome (based on SPHERE-12) compared to 25% of those using the control app conditions (mood monitor app; health information app). Primary statistical analysis will be conducted with all participants who complete randomisation. Mixed models repeated measures ANOVA, with measurement occasion as a within groups factor and intervention condition as a between groups factor will be used to examine primary measures of outcome. Planned contrasts will be used to compare intervention and control groups immediately post intervention and at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up. Logistic and linear regressions will be used to examine differences between conditions on baseline variables, and logistic regressions will be used to assess the effect of the intervention on participant dropout as well as to investigate predictors of missingness (completers/non-completers) post intervention and at follow-up. </statisticalmethods>
