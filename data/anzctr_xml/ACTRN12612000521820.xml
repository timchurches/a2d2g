  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete 6 online lessons in 8 weeks. The online lessons take approximately 30 minutes to read through, with homework exercises taking a further hour per day. The lessons are based on current best practice cognitive and behavioural techniques and include exposure and response prevention, and cognitive techniques. Exposure and response prevention involves gradually confronting feared situations whilst resisting the compulsive behaviours that would normally be used to reduce anxiety. The cognitive techniques are aimed at reducing the common cognitive biases seen in OCD and are aimed to help the participant to reduce their overestimation of threat and responsibility, reduce the need to control their thoughts and understand the misinterpretation of the meaning of these thoughts. The cognitive techniques also aim to help people to reduce their need for certainty and perfectionism.</interventions>
