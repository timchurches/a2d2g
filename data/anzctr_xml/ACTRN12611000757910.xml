  <interventions>
    <interventions>Manipulation of the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic organs and their associated supportive ligaments, connective tissue and fascia. In addition, joint manipulation, specific exercise and functional exercise prescription included in treatment. Treatments will be administered 1-2 x week for a maximum of 12 treatments over 6 weeks. Treatment sessions will last 30 mins and will be administered by an experienced physiotherapist with specialist training in joint manipulation and visceral manipulation. This frequency will be determined according to need.</interventions>
    <comparator>Joint manipulation, specific exercise and functional exercise prescription as per intervention group. Sham/placebo manipulation of thoracic, abdominal and pelvic organs and their associated soft tissues. Sham manipulation consists of a light touch around the abdomen with no real intention to cause any motion or effect. The area chosen for sham treatment will have no ligamentous, neural or functional connection to the subjects symptomatic presentation. It is planned that both control and active group participants will attend for roughly the same frequency and duration of treatments. However, as this RCT is taking place in a private clinic, with subjects paying as per non-RCT patients, we cannot fully control these variables.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>When a patient organises an initial appointment to see one of the treating physiotherapists, they are informed that they may be asked to participate in a trial. When they arrive, they fill in their baseline measurements. After the history and physical examination, if the therapist is assured all the criteria are met, the patient is asked if they would like to participate in the trial. Any questions are answered. Once approval is gained from the participant, the next sealed opaque randomisation envelope is opened. The participant is treated according to the protocol for the group they are allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random number generator in excel was used to generate the randomisation sequence. This was done by a researcher not involved in patient recruitment or treatment</sequence>
