    <interventions>The Distinct Pilot Trial is a Phase III pilot study to determine the efficacy of the skin preparation, Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant, against standard treatment for IAD in critically ill patients in intensive care setting. 

The intervention product, Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant, is a liquid product which turns into a thin, waterproof, flexible, transparent barrier when exposed to skin and air using a product applicator. The active ingredients are hexamethyldisiloxane, acrylic tetrapolymer and  2-octyl cyanoacrylate. The intervention product is designed to both prevent and treat IAD by maintaining skin integrity and promote an environment for healing. The product is contained in a vial with applicator. Once the vial is broken, the product can be distributed over the skin with the applicator sponge. Each vial contains enough product to cover 650 square cm of skin and the product dries completely within 60 seconds. Further information about the intervention product can be found at (http://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/All-3M-Products/Health-Care/Medical/Skin-Wound-Care/Barriers-Creams-Lotions/?N=5002385+8707795+8707798+8711017+8711098+8711102+3294857497&amp;rt=r3) and (http://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Cavilon-Advanced-Skin-Protectant-5050?N=5002385+8711102+3291589704&amp;rt=rud)

Study participants who are randomised to be treated with the intervention product will be monitored for initially for 12 hours to determine any sensitivity to an intervention product test patch (3 x 3 cm on the upper thigh). The product will then be applied 3 times a week to the participants perianal area, buttocks and thighs by the Research Nurse following the bed bath while the patient remains within the ICU. The intervention product will be continued to be applied to participants who have IAD at discharge from the ICU while they remain in the hospital until their IAD resolves.

Study protocol for intervention participants also comprises of skin cleaning by the bedside nurse during daily bed bath with the use of a low pH no rinse liquid cleanser containing 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) with warm tap water and soft cloths or a prepackaged wash cloth containing 2% CHG and following each incontinence episode where the exposed skin will be cleaned with tap water, soft clothes and gently dried. 

Skin assessments of the presence and severity of IAD and pain assessments be performed 3 times a week by the research nurse during patient turns until the participant is discharged from the ICU or the IAD resolves.

Bedside and research nurses will receive training in product application before the commencement of the study. The research nurse will receive training for skin and pain assessments before the commencement of the study. Training will be given by the investigators, Professor Coyer and Jill Campbell, who are both recognized clinical and research experts in IAD. All training will be provided face to face. Further general study information sessions will be provided at the hospital site for all clinicians.  
Bedside nurses will complete a bed bath check list to show adherence to protocol for both study groups with the Research nurse evaluating the protocol fidelity.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Study participants who are randomised to be treated with the standard treatment will be considered the control group in this trial. Study protocol for control participants comprises of skin cleaning during daily bed bath with the use of a low pH no rinse liquid cleanser containing 2% CHG with warm tap water and soft cloths or a prepackaged wash cloth containing 2% CHG. Next a soft cloth/wipe impregnated with 3% dimethicone will be applied to the participants perianal area, buttocks and thighs after each daily bed-bath. Following each incontinence episode the exposed skin will be cleaned with tap water and soft clothes and gently dried and for participants with IAD, a soft cloth/wipe impregnated with 3% dimethicone will also be applied to the affected area.

Skin assessments of the presence and severity of IAD and pain assessments be performed 3 times a week by the research nurse during patient turns later on in the day until the participant is discharged from the ICU or the IAD resolves.

The bedside nurse will receive training in product application before the commencement of the study. The research nurse will receive training for skin and pain assessments before the commencement of the study.

      <outcome>The primary outcome is the development of IAD. The primary outcome will be assessed by direct clinical examination of the skin surrounding participants perianal area, buttocks and thighs. Diagnosis of IAD will be made using the IAD Severity Categorisation Tool (Beeckman D et al. (2015). Proceedings of the Global IAD expert Panel.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations was performed for a Chi-Square test based on a change in the rate of IAD from 32% of control participants to 16% for the larger, follow-on parent study. Approximately 242 persons or 121 persons per group (inclusive of 10% attrition) with average ICU stay of 5 days and exposure to the causative factor, faecal incontinence, will be required to detect a 50% reduction in incidence with 90% power and significance of p&lt;0.05.

Sample sizes in pilot study are recommended to be 10% of the larger parent follow on study and thus the sample size for the pilot study will be 30 participants, 12.45% of the predicted sample size for the larger, follow-on parent study. 

Data will be analysed according to the principle of intention to treat. Descriptive data, including clinical and feasibility outcomes, will be analysed using frequencies, means as percentages as appropriate for continuous and categorical variables. 

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be used to compare time to new IAD events between groups. 

Prevention of IAD, will be  measured by IAD scores in subjects whose IAD re-epithelialized and who continued on the investigational product.  The proportion of participants who have no progression of IAD, while still experiencing incontinence, will be estimated. 

Study data will be used to confirm the sample size calculation for a larger, follow study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Incontinence associated dermatitis (lAD) is a preventable skin condition in the bottom and genital area due to exposure to moisture and other irritants. lt is characterised by patchy inflammation of the skin and eventually leads to skin erosion. The patient may experience itching or burning sensations and/or pain and can suffer a decrease quality of life. lAD results in complications including increased risk of developing a pressure injury or a skin infection. As a result, lAD associated complications can be expensive for healthcare services. This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of 3M Cavil on TM Advanced Skin Protectant to prevent, delay and/or reduce the severity of lAD, in critically ill patients in the intensive care setting. This pilot study aims to enroll  30 eligible study participants who have been appropriately consented and screened. The interventional product will be administered three times a week, with the control product (standard treatment) administered daily whilst the participant is in the intensive care setting. Study participants will be assessed at baseline, Day 1 then daily or three times a week with evaluations including demographics, product application, skin assessment and completion of questionnaires. In addition the incidence and severity of adverse events and performance of the interventional product will be documented.</summary>
