    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Erlotinib, escalating dose
Treatment: drugs - Erlotinib, standard dose
Treatment: drugs - Gemcitabine

Active Comparator: Gemcitabine, Erlotinib Standard Dose - Participants received erlotinib, 100 milligrams (mg), orally (PO), once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants also received gemcitabine, 1000 mg per (/) square meter (m^2), intravenously (IV), on Days 1, 8, and 15 of consecutive 4 week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Experimental: Gemcitabine, Erlotinib Escalating Dose - Participants received erlotinib, beginning at 150 mg/day, PO, once daily, and increasing in increments of 50 mg every 2 weeks up to a maximum of 250 mg/day, until development of a grade 2 rash, or occurrence of other, non-rash, dose-limiting toxicity; treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal. Participants also received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m^2, IV, on Days 1, 8, and 15 of consecutive 4 week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Died Assessed From Point of Randomization - Overall survival (OS) assessed from the point of randomization was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause.

The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death as Assessed From Point of Randomization - Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed from the point of randomization was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death due to any cause. For target lesions (TLs), PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started. For non-target lesions (NTLs), PD was defined as unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Participants who had neither progressed nor died at time of analysis were censored at the date of last tumor assessment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to RECIST - BOR was defined as a confirmed CR or PR for at least 4 weeks. CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline (BL) SLD. The 95% CI for one sample binomial was determined using Pearson-Clopper method.</outcome>

PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of the TLs, taking as a reference the BL SLD SD was defined as neither sufficient decrease in SLD to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in SLD to qualify for PD. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare the efficacy and safety of escalating versus standard doses to rash
      of Tarceva, in combination with gemcitabine, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
      During a 4 week run-in period, all patients will receive Tarceva 100mg/day po plus
      gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 iv on days 1, 8,15 and 22. After 4 weeks, patients who have not
      developed rash, or only develop grade 1 rash, will be randomized to one of 2 groups. Group 1
      will receive a starting dose of Tarceva 150mg po daily, increased in steps of 50mg every 2
      weeks up to a maximum of 250mg/day po, until development of grade 2 rash or other
      dose-limiting toxicity. Group 2 will continue to receive Tarceva 100mg/day po. All patients
      will continue to receive gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 iv on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 4 week cycle.
      The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample
      size is 100-500 individuals.</summary>
