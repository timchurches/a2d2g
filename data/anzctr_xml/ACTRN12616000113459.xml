  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a crossover study assessing acute physiological responses, including brain and arm blood flow and systemic haemodynamics, to low (40% VO2peak) and moderate (60% VO2peak) intensity water-based exercise and matched intensity land-based exercise. This will involve one endurance capacity assessment to determine VO2peak and one exercise session per participant, where they will take part in both land and water-based exercise in a randomised order, in the same session, with a 20-30minute break between sessions, until measured variables return to baseline. 
Participants will exercise with their arms supported at heart level and will be doing a high knees style aerobic exercise (similar to fast marching on the spot), with intensity monitored by a heart rate monitor (band across the chest and corresponding wrist watch), and VO2 (via mask) during the session. Participants will exercise for approximately 5 minutes at 40% of VO2 peak and 5 minutes at 60% of VO2 peak, before having a recovery period and seated rest for approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on baseline readings. After resting participants will take part in the same protocol for the other condition (wet or dry). Sessions will be supervised by a physiotherapist and exercise physiologist.  
</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a crossover study, so all participants will undertake both the water-based and land-based exercise conditions. Land-based exercise is treated as the control condition here, as it is where conventional cardiac rehabilitation programs currently take place.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims:
The aim of this project is to assess the acute effects of water-based exercise in people with stable heart disease. This study is conducted in conjunction with a water-based training study to investigate the effects of water-based exercise training in people with stable coronary heart disease. 
Justification:
Exercise is an important component of rehabilitation and preventing recurrent heart problems in people with heart disease.  However, exercise participation is sub-optimal in this population and increasing the range of exercise options for people with heart disease may increase exercise participation. For example, water-based exercise may be more appealing to people with heart disease who have other health issues, such as arthritis or obesity, which may make land-based exercise difficult or painful. Furthermore, preliminary research suggests that water-based exercise may have additional vascular and brain benefits due to the effects of water immersion on blood flow.  However, this has not previously been investigated in people with heart disease. 
Participants:
Patients who have had a heart attack or bypass surgery at least six months prior to enrolment, or documented blockages in the arteries of their heart based on the results of an angiogram (a scan of the heart) will be recruited to the study. Participants must be medically stable prior to participation and not be undertaking a formal exercise program. 
Design and methods:
This crossover study will compare the acute responses to low and moderate intensity exercise in the water with matched intensities on land. This will involve one endurance capacity assessment and one exercise session in 15 participants. The order of conditions will be randomised. Study A will acutely assess blood flow to the arm and brain, along with assessing systemic haemodynamics.
