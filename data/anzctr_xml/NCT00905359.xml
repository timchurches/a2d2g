  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in Physical Function at 1 Year Follow-up Using the Patient Completed Zurich Claudication Questionnaire - ZCQ is a validated outcomes instrument specific to lumbar spinal stenosis, and captures data in 3 distinct domains: Physical function (PF), Symptom Severity (SS), and post-treatment Patient Satisfaction (PS).PF score is the mean score of five physical function questions of ZCQ, ranging from 1 to 4. A lower score represents a better outcome/condition. Mean percentage change from baseline in Physical Function at 1 year follow-up was reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>

      <outcome>Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in Physical Function, Using Patient Completed Zurich Claudication Questionnaire - ZCQ is a validated outcomes instrument specific to lumbar spinal stenosis, and captures data in 3 distinct domains: Physical function (PF), Symptom Severity (SS), and post-treatment Patient Satisfaction (PS).PF score is the mean score of five physical function questions of ZCQ, ranging from 1 to 4. A lower score represents a better outcome/condition. Mean percentage change from baseline in Physical Function at 14 days, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 24 months was reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Percentage of Change From Baseline in Symptom Severity of the Patient Completed Zurich Claudication Questionnaire - ZCQ is a validated outcomes instrument specific to lumbar spinal stenosis, and captures data in 3 distinct domains: SS, PF, and post-treatment PS. SS Score is based on seven questions (overall pain, pain frequency, pain in the back, pain in the leg, numbness, weakness, and balanced disturbance) in ZCQ. The first 6 questions are scored 1 to 5. Balance disturbance is scored in a 1-3-5 scale. The SS score is the mean of all answered items in the questionnaire, ranging from 1 to 5. A lower score represents a better outcome/condition. Mean percentage of change from baseline in Symptom Severity is reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14days, 6 week, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Satisfaction (PS) Scores of Zurich Claudication Questionnaire - PS score is the mean score of 6 questions of ZCQ, ranging from 1 to 4 if the number of responses exceeded four. A lower score represents a better outcome. Patients with PS score less than 2.5 at postoperative evaluation were considered positive, which implied that patients were satisfied with their treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days, 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Percentage Change of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) From Baseline in Leg Pain - Patients rated their leg pain using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from 0 to 10, higher values represents a worse pain. Mean percentage change of VAS scores from baseline in leg pain is reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days, 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Percentage Changes From Baseline in Quality of Life Using the Patient-completed SF-36 Questionnaire - The SF-36 questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life. The SF-36 results were summarized into two components, a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). The score for PCS and MCS is between 0 and 100, with higher scores denoting better quality of life. Mean percentage changes of SF-36 PCS and MCS from baseline are reported.</outcome>

    <summary>The objective of the NICE study is to provide clinical evidence proving that the Aperius
      PercLID System is safe and non-inferior to standalone decompressive surgery with regards to
      clinical outcomes in patients suffering from Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis with
      Neurogenic Intermittent Claudication, relieved by flexion.</summary>
