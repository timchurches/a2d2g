  <interventions>
    <interventions>Manipulation, soft tissue procedures, rehabilitation exercises.
The active therapeutics include a combination of manipulation, soft tissue therapy and rehabilitation exercises (multimodal therapy)
Manipulation involves a high velocity low amplitude procedure directed at either the low cervical spine, upper thoracic spine, glenohumeral or acromioclavicluar joints dependent on clinical finings i.e. detection of manipulable lesion or fixated joint.
Soft tissue therapy includes ischaemic pressure massage administered to tight or spasmed muscles and tight muscle stretches.
Rehabilitation exercises including isometric followed by isotonic strengthening exercies directed at the rotator cuff muscles. These exercises are to be performed at home by the participants.
The duraion of each treatment session is between 15-20 minutes.
Each participant will recieve a total of 8 treatments at a frequency of 2 times per week for 4 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group is treated with therapeutic ultrasound set at a zero setting.
The control group will recieve a sham intervention where the ultrasound unit is switched on but with zero (non therapeutic settings on the unit).
The clinician will still use aquasonic gel and will move the transducer head over the area of the shoulder to be treated for a total of 15 minutes. 
The treatment frequency is the same as the active therapeutic; total of 8 treatments, 2 times a week for 4 weeks.</comparator>

      <outcome>Orthopaedic range of motion
All ranges of motion of the glenohumeral joint and cervical spine will be measured. 
Measurement will be conducted by a blinded research assistant with a hand held goniometer and pleurimeter.

    <concealment>Enrollment via newspaper advertisments
Prescreening telephone interview to determine suitability for the trial and the presence of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Allocation of participants to treatment groups performed by the blinded research assistant, all the names of the participants were placed in a sealed envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was accomplished
by utilising 45 folded sheets of paper
(15 marked multimodal, 15 marked manipulation group and 15 marked control group) thoroughly
mixed together to assure discontinuity
and then placed in a hat. At each participation randomisation
timepoint, the hat was held so that
all folded slips were completely obscured.</sequence>
