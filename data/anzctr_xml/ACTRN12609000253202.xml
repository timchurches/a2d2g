  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be dosed in 28-day treatment cycles by IV infusion of Combretastatin A1 Diphosphate (OXi4503, CA1P). Subject will have up to 6 cycles of treatment. Dosing will commence at 8.5 mg/m2 and escalate to 11.0, 13.5 and 15.5 mg/m2 and then increase by an additional 25% of the preceding dose level thereafter.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: To determine the safety and tolerability of OXi4503 in subjects with relapsed or refractory carcinomas with hepatic tumor burden. The assessments will include collection of adverse events [as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0], laboratory (blood)tests and physical examination.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At each clinic visit through-out the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of OXi4503, which will be the dose used in the phase 2 part of the study. The assessments will include collection of adverse events [as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0], laboratory (blood) tests and physical examination.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At each clinic visit through-out the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 3: To determine the Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile for OXi4503 and its major metabolites in subjects with hepatic tumor burden.  The assessment will be by analysis of blood concentration levels.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At each clinic visit through-out the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine progression-free survival (PFS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At each clinic visit through-out the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the proportion (%) of subjects with stable disease (SD),</outcome>
      <timepoint>At each clinic visit through-out the study</timepoint>
