          -  Are available for at least 72 weeks.

          -  Patients may be eligible for 1 of the 2 substudies if they:

          -  Are at least age 16 and have written consent of a parent or guardian if under 18.

          -  Have had HIV infection for more than 1 year and have a CD4 cell count greater than 500
             cells/mm3, or do not have HIV infection but are at risk of getting HIV because of
             their lifestyle, such as sexual activity or injection drug use.

          -  Have never had hepatitis B infection or a hepatitis B vaccine and they are available
             for 28 weeks (hepatitis B vaccine substudy only).

          -  Have not received a tetanus shot in the past 5 years, have never had an allergic
             reaction to a tetanus shot, and are available for 8 weeks (tetanus shot substudy

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether these powerful combinations of anti-HIV
      drugs are safe and effective for use in patients in the early stages of HIV infection and to
      find out how patients' immune systems react to HIV and anti-HIV drugs.

      Doctors generally treat patients in the early stages of HIV infection with the same anti-HIV
      drugs taken by patients who have had HIV for a long time. These drugs lower the level of HIV
      in the blood. However, doctors do not know whether patients who take anti-HIV drugs in the
      early stages of HIV infection actually live longer or have fewer AIDS-related diseases. This
      study will help doctors answer these questions. In the main study, doctors will look at how 2
      different anti-HIV drug combinations affect the immune system. In the 2 substudies, doctors
      will look at how the body reacts to the hepatitis B vaccine and the tetanus vaccine. These
      substudies may help doctors learn how HIV-infected patients respond to new infections.</summary>
