  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group: Patients in the intervention arm will receive a single dose of inactivated influenza virus vaccine by the intramuscular route. The antigen composition and strains used for the 2007 pilot study will be
A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)- 15ug haemagglutinin per dose
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-15ug haemagglutinin per dose
B/Malaysia/2506/2004- 15ug haemagglutinin per dose</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To quantify the impact of influenza vaccination on the incidence of recurrent ischaemic events in high risk patients aged 40-64 years, Intention to treat analysis will be used, comparing the rate of study endpoints in the vaccine and placebo groups. The arms will be compared to clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to ensure there is no bias in the sample. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Actively monitored once a month for 12 mnths</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The extent of undiagnosed influenza in patients aged 40-64 years admitted to hospital, and its contribution to precipitation of acute ischaemic events are quantified as follows: subjects will be followed for a period of 12 months following enrolment, with monthly phone calls. They will also be asked to record on a diary card, whether any endpoints occur. The endpoints include  influenza like illness,  heart attack, stroke or mini stroke.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>If an influenza like illness is reported, follow up serology will be obtained, and if the patient is still symptomatic, a nasal and throat swab will be taken for influenza. If death, ischaemic events or hospitalisation occur, the study team will review hospital medical records and liaise with the relevant general practitioner to obtain detailed information. Validation will be sought from hospital or GP medical records.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Influenza is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly during the annual winter epidemics. There is indirect epidemiologic evidence that influenza also contributes to all-cause mortality and to cardiac, stroke and respiratory hospitalisations. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are the single largest contributor to disease burden in Australia, accounting for 18% of the total disability-adjusted life years lost.  
Given the observational data which suggest that influenza is a precipitant for ischaemic events, prevention of influenza by vaccination may have an important role in reducing the burden of ischaemic events. Our study aims to quantify the impact of influenza vaccination on the incidence of ischaemic events in high risk patients aged 40-64 years</summary>
