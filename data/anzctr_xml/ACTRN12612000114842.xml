  <interventions>
    <interventions>An experienced operator will place all interscalene catheters (ISCs). Intravenous midazolam 2 mg, alfentanil 0.5 mg and cephazolin 1 g will be administered 5 min prior to interscalene catheter placement. Catheters will be placed following either the administration of a superficial cervical plexus block (SCPB) or after the induction of general anesthesia depending on patient preference. ISCs will be placed using a combination of ultrasound and nerve stimulation as previously described (Fredrickson et al. Anesthesiology 2010; 112:1374-1381, ANZCTR12609000347268). Patients will then be randomised (using a computerised random number generator) to an single hole, triple hole or 6 hole perineural catheter. 15 mL ropivacaine 0.375% will be administered via the catheter. At the end of surgery under general anaesthesia, an ambulatory infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% at 2 mL/h with PRN on demand 5 mL boluses. The infusion will be continued for &gt; 48 hours after surgery (Total duration = 2-5 days).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We intend to compare 3 different orifice configurations for perineural catheters administered for nerve block for pain relief after shoulder surgery. We will be primarily assessing the frequency of pain in recovery. We will also assess the effectiveness of the pain relief, analgesic consumption, side effects and patient satisfaction.</summary>
