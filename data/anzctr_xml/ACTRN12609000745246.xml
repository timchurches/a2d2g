  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ropivocain (a form of local anaesthetic) infusion (10mL/hr) at the surgical incision site using fine bore catheter inserted at the time of wound closure. Infusion commences upon application of the wound dressings and continues until postoperative day 3. At this time the catheter is to be removed by nursing staff on the ward 72 hours after the infusion started.
Laparoscopic procedures are best known as keyhole procedures and involve using long instruments to manipulate the organs within the abdomen through very small incisions. Colonic resection refers to the removal of a part of the large bowel for a variety of indications although the most common indications are sepsis due to local perforation and malignancy.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The surgeon booking the patient for procedure (who will perform the surgery) will inform patient about the trial and seek their agreement to participate. The research assistant (who is unaware of the outcome of group allocation) also attends to discuss further any questions the patents have - subsequent phone contact (1 week later) is made with patient to see if they are interested in participating. Upon consent to participate contact made with research coordinator who will uses a computer-based random number generator to determine allocation to treatment or control. Only the surgeon performing the operation will be aware of the treatment the patient is receiving - the patient and the research assistant who attends data collection will remain blinded as will anaesthetic and nursing staff involved in the administration and charting of analgesia. It is important to note that the operating surgeon was the person who decided if a patient was eligible for inclusion in this study - however the entire process of informing the patient and obtaining their consent is completed before the patient is entered formally into the study and before the treatment arm for that patient has been determined. The surgeon needs to be aware of the treatment arm to which a patent has been allocated as they are the operator who places the catheter and loads it with the appropriate solution.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine if the use of local anaesthetic infusion into the surgical incision is effective in reducing pain following laparoscopic (keyhole) colonic resections (removal of sections of large bowel). It difficult to predict the outcome of this paper as laparoscopic surgery uses only small incisions which will generate a smaller proportion of the total postoperative pain felt compared to the pain generated from the intraabdominal surgical site which has not been altered through this technique.</summary>
