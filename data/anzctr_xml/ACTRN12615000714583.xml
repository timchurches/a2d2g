  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eight, group delivered 2 hours sessions (1 per week) of either:

(1) mindfulness meditation - various mindfulness meditation techniques are taught as means to reduce stress and improve coping and management of pain.

or

(2) cognitive therapy - exercises such as cognitive restructuring are taught to change unhelpful ways of thinking and responding to pain to improve pain management.

or

(3) mindfulness-based cognitive therapy - both mindfulness meditation and cognitive coping techniques are taught to improve adaptive pain coping and management.

Each participant receives all 8 sessions for one of the above three interventions only. Between session practice is encouraged and recorded via participant self-report. All interventions are group delivered by a clinical psychologist.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Up to 80% of Australians experience back pain and 10% have significant disability as a result. There is a critical need for the development and evaluation of innovative treatments that have the capacity to target the multidimensional nature of chronic low back pain. This study will compare the effects and mechanisms of Mindfulness Meditation, Cognitive Therapy, and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for chronic low back pain. Results will ultimately lead to streamlined interventions designed to efficiently maximise benefit.</summary>
