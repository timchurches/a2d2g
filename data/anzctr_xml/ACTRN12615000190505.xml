  <interventions>
    <interventions>Hypofractionated (shortened course) radiotherapy.
All patients will be treated with one of two hypofractionated radiotherapy schedules. The treating physician determines which schedule will be used.
Intermediate performance status patients will be treated to a dose of 46Gy in 20 fractions with gross disease boosted to 52.5Gy in 20 fractions (4 week total treatment time) with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). 
Poor performance status patients will be treated to a dose of 33Gy in 6 fractions over three weeks (treatments on Mon &amp; Thurs or Tues &amp; Fri). Patients may be treated with 3-D conformal RT, IMRT, Tomotherapy, VMAT, electron or kV / orthovolt radiotherapy.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Prospective study with one of two hypofractionated radiotherapy treatment options.
The results will be descriptively compared between both groups (dose comparison) and also will be described in the context of historical data (TROG 96.07 study, Publication Poulsen M et al, JCO 2003).</comparator>

Time to loco-regional progression (TTLRP), time to distant failure (TTDF) and overall survival (OS) curves will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. 
Incidences of grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity will be reported as the proportions of patients developing these conditions; 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the true incidences will be calculated.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will determine the safety and efficacy of a risk adapted hypofractionated (shortened course) of radiotherapy for treatment of elderly and/or fragile patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 60 years or above, have been diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, are fragile and deemed unfit for a long course of radiotherapy or radio-/chemotherapy. 
Study details: Participants in this study will be included in either one of two groups according to their performance status. Participants with intermediate performance status will receive 46Gy - 52.5Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, whilst participants with poor performance status will receive 33Gy in 6 fractions over 3 weeks. Patients may be treated with 3-D conformal RT, IMRT, Tomotherapy, VMAT, electron or kV / orthovolt radiotherapy at the discretion of their treating physician. Participants will be followed-up for up to 36 months post-treatment, in order to determine time to loco-regional progression, toxicity, survival rates and quality of life.</summary>
