    <interventions>Synthetic injectable bulking agent, PTQ (Uroplasty BV, Geleen, The Netherlands), a silicone based implant. A one-off treatment as a day-case under either sedation or general anaesthetic. Agent is injected into the anal sphincter by a surgeon using an 18 gauge or similar. The procedure itself takes approximately 15 minutes.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are various agents used as injectable bulking agents for the the treatment of faecal incontinence. They are usually injected into the submucosa of the anus or at the site of sphincter defect   . The aim of this randomised control trial is to compare the effectiveness of two of those agents, namely PTQ (Uroplasty BV, Geleen, The Netherlands), a silicone based implant, and Durasphere (Carbon Medical Technologies, St. Paul, MN), a pyrolytic carbon. As yet the two treaments have not been directly compared.
The effectiveness of each technique will be assessed with pre- and post-proceedure incontinence scores (Wexner) and quality of life scoring (SF36)
The results of the trial will indicate which of the two agents is more effective in the treatment of faecal incontinence.</summary>
