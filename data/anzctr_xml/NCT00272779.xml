    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral effects of
      atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) versus a combination drug of lopinavir (LPV) plus RTV.
      A combination drug containing tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) will also be taken by
      participants in both arms.</summary>
