  <interventions>
    <interventions>Health coaching via telephone to support a physiotherapist provided physical activity program. The intervention phase will last 6 months.

Health coaching: Three health coaches will provide the telephone coaching for the study. The health coaches will all have a qualification and experience in nursing and will have been trained in health coaching by Health Change Australia. Participants will be called a minimum of 6 times and a maximum of 12 times during the 6-month treatment phase. The health coach will determine how many additional telephone coaching sessions are needed based on the participants preferences, their confidence and their success in achieving the desired behaviour changes. The duration of telephone coaching sessions are expected to average around 20 mins with considerable variability. The initial calls are likely to be longer (up to 45 mins) with call duration reducing over the treatment phase.

Physiotherapy: Each participant will visit the physiotherapist five times, and each session will last for 30 minutes. The treatment program will include three components:
1.	Structured exercises to address presenting impairments
2.	Increasing overall levels of physical activity
3.	Information and education</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common and costly chronic musculoskeletal conditions world-wide and is associated with substantial pain and disability. Many patients also experience co-morbidities such as obesity and cardiovascular disease that further add to the OA burden.  
	Interventions that foster appropriate lifestyle behavioural change, particularly in the area of physical activity, are important for chronic diseases such as OA. Physical activity, encompassing both structured exercise and incidental physical activity, is recommended by OA and general health guidelines because of its positive impact on disease outcomes and health status. Both muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise are effective in reducing pain and improving function in the short-term in patients with knee OA. However, benefits are generally not sustained because adherence declines over time. Interventions are therefore needed to facilitate sustainability of physical activity behaviours in patients with knee OA in order to achieve longer-term clinical improvements and to reduce the risk and impact of associated co-morbidities. 
	Evidence-based strategies to improve uptake and adherence to physical activity and/or exercise interventions for people with chronic musculoskeletal conditions include incorporating face-to-face visits with a health professional, support from telephone coaching, refresher or booster sessions, exercise and physical activity plans based on patient preference and individual goals, an educational component, and optional strategies including log-book recording of participation and step counting. Telephone coaching is a relatively inexpensive intervention using widely available technology. It has been shown to improve physical activity behaviours in older adults and in those with other chronic conditions, particularly if combined with face-to-face visits with a health professional. Thus telephone coaching aimed at changing physical activity behaviours may achieve longer-term improved patient outcomes in those with knee OA but there is limited research in this area.
This pragmatic trial will investigate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of a 6-month physical activity intervention on pain and function in people with knee OA. The intervention package incorporates 5 physiotherapy contacts together with 6-12 telephone coaching contacts. The intervention will be compared to a physiotherapy only condition.</summary>
