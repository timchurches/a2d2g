  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study, the Nintendo Wii Fit games and balance board system will be utilised as an exergaming intervention.  A trained physiotherapist will conduct the balance exergaming in a set-up exergaming room at the School of Physiotherapy. 

The balance board which measures 8.5 x 6 x 2 is an accessory for the Nintendos Wii video game console. It has a white top and a grey bottom, shaped like a weighing scale. The balance board is a wireless console that can support up to 300 lbs. The balance board contains several multiple pressure sensors that measure a players centre of balance and the body mass index (BMI). The balance board will be calibrated before the commencement of the study.

Participants will perform balance exercise for 45 to 60 minute, three times per week for an eight-week period. The games will include Table Tilt, Soccer Heading and Penguin Slide. These games were chosen due to their focus on weight shifting which is a component of postural balance. To monitor adherence, participants will be followed-up through phone calls.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is evidence of increasing number of falls in adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The increased risk of falling in individuals with knee OA may be due to balance impairment and disease-related symptoms. Exercise is recommended as one of the first lines of choice in the conservative management of knee OA.  Doing exercise in a supervised group, practising Tai Chi, and participating in physical activities such as walking has been proven effective; however, there are alternative treatments that can be used that may provide possible therapeutic and rehabilitative effect in a novel and engaging way such as exergaming (exercise + gaming). The majority of published articles investigating the use of exergaming included healthy and patient population where the latter are mostly neurologic conditions such Stroke, Parkinsons disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. Several exergames have been developed to increase physical fitness and balance, yet it is also unclear to which degree of usability, safety and acceptability of this exergaming programme in a knee OA group. This research aims to conduct an exergaming intervention using Nintendo Wii Fit games in individuals with knee osteoarthritis. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of implementing an exergaming balance intervention. Also, the study aims to estimate changes in the outcome measure scores mainly for balance and risk of falling. Participants with knee osteoarthritis and history of falling will be recruited from Dunedin through community advertising. Individuals with knee OA and history of falling will be recruited following a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Recruitment will be from September 2017 to Dec 2017. Eligible participants will participate in 16-week study programme: eight weeks of usual care and three times per week of exergaming for eight weeks.  Participants will also have to attend three assessment sessions (baseline, eighth-week, and 16th-week). A focus group discussion will be conducted after the intervention to explore participant's perceptions and experiences. During the assessment, participants will be asked to answer some questionnaire, survey, and perform standard tests for balance, strength and physical function. All the assessment and intervention sessions will be done at the Balance Clinic of School of Physiotherapy and in a set-up exergaming room, respectively. The duration of both assessment and intervention will be approximately 60 minutes. The proposed project will be an essential preliminary step towards investigating the usability of Wii Fit exergaming as a balance intervention and as part of a fall prevention program for individuals with knee OA. Findings from this study will inform the design of the future intervention protocol and explore the acceptability of the exergaming intervention in this patient population.</summary>
