  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two interventions used.

1. A phospholipid emulsion drop (Systane Balance, Alcon)

2. A phospholipid liposomal spray (Tearsagain, Biorevive)

All participants will use both interventions and placebos during the study period which is 4 separate phases (4 x 14 days). The dose used for drop is 0.05 ml thrice daily for 14 days and for spray is 0.05 ml thrice daily for 14 days. The drop is applied directly to the eye with contact lens wear and the spray is sprayed on to the closed eyelid margins with contact lens wear. To monitor adherence a patient check list will be provided for the participants. The washout period between each treatment is a minimum 48 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two placebos used.

1. A saline drop (Saline contains unpreservative sodium chloride in water 0.9%, (weight/volume)) 

2. A saline spray

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated to determine a significant difference of 36 g/m^2h between repeat measurements at the 5% level of significance corrected for multiple comparisons and with 80% power. The within subject standard deviation of 34 g/m^2h used in this calculation was based on a pilot study. The expected difference of 36 g/m^2h was based on the observed change with contact lens wear from the pilot study.

A linear mixed model will be used to compare the clinical, functional and biochemical variables of the contact lens wearers during use of intervention or placebo. Associations between different variables will be assessed using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient where appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tear film lipid layer plays an important role in maintaining tear film stability and ocular comfort. Contact lens wear compromises ocular surface equilibrium by disrupting the lipid layer which results in lens related ocular dryness and discomfort. The troublesome symptom of the contact lens wear often leads to discontinuation of lens wear and hence is critical for the researchers to design ways to overcome the challenge. Artificial tear supplements have been used to increase ocular comfort. This study aims to understand tear film lipids of contact lens wearers and also to evaluate the effect of exogenous lipid supplements on different aspects of tear film lipid layer.
Hypotheses:
1. Improved contact lens comfort is associated with a thicker lipid layer and decreased lipid degradation resulting in reduced tear evaporation.
2. Use of an exogenous tear lipid supplement increases lipid thickness, reduces lipid degradation, increases tear stability, reduces tear evaporation and consequently improves contact lens comfort.
