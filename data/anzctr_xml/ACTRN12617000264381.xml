  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial will be conducted in Dunedin, New Zealand. Participants in the intervention group will be asked to:

1. Register with a local volunteering agency within 3 weeks of their baseline testing session. The researcher will provide specific details on how to do so via a 10-minute consultation at the end of the baseline testing session. During that consultation, the researcher will provide and talk through a booklet listing all relevant volunteering organisations, the types of volunteering they offer, and their contact details. 

2. Engage in at least 2 hours of formal volunteering each week for 6 months. Formal volunteering is defined as unpaid, non-compulsory work that is done through an organisation, and for the benefit of people outside the participants household. It does not include caregiving for friends or family members (International Labour Organization, 2011). Aside from that definition, there are no restrictions on the type of volunteering participants can engage in.

3.  Self-manage their engagement in volunteering (with the help of the organisation they've signed up with) and record their volunteering hours and type via self-complete weekly diaries.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to test whether engaging in formal volunteering benefits older adults' cognitive functioning. To test this idea, 200 65 to 75-year-olds will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group for 6 months. Those in the intervention group will register with a local volunteering agency and engage in at least 2 hr of volunteering each week for the duration of the trial. Those in the control group will continue their usual lifestyle. Cognitive performance will be measured before and after the 6 month trial. Understanding whether formal volunteering benefits cognitive functioning in older adulthood will provide information about a relatively simple activity older adults can engage in to improve their everyday functioning and quality of life.</summary>
