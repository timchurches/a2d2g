  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will wear a commercially available peroneal nerve stimulator (NessL300) for 8 weeks. The first 3 weeks will consist of training and acclimatisation to the device, starting at 15 minutes per day, building up to 8 hours of use per day. They will then continue to use the device as an orthosis for the next 5 weeks using it for 8 hours per day. All participants will be provided with a 3 week training sheet that explains how long they wear the device for each day.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>6 Minute Walking Test
The subject will then undertake a modified six-minute walk test (6MWT). This is a variation of the original American Thoracic Society Script ("ATS statement: guidelines for the six-minute walk test," 2002). This involves the subject walking unaided up and down a 12m straight walkway for six minutes with the use of a modified script that aims to maximise effort and test endurance (Goldman et al., 2007). Distance will be measured every minute, as well as subjects rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using the modified Borg scale (Borg, 1982). Subjects are permitted to slow down, stop and rest as necessary. Heart Rate will be continually monitored throughout the 6MWT.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>10 Metre Walking Test
This part involves the subject walking along a 10m designated path 6 times. The walk will be timed as the 10 metre Walk Test (10MWT). Information will be automatically collected with video, 3D analysis and force plate data. The subject will do this with the FES device on, and repeat with the Functional Electircal Simulation Device off.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Timed Up and Go
The timed get up and go test is a measurement of mobility. It includes a number of tasks such as standing from a seating position, walking, turning, stopping, and sitting down which are all important tasks needed for a person to be independently mobile.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Static Balance Analysis
The experiment will begin with the subject standing on a force plate while measurements are taken under 4 conditions; feet together (~0.5cm apart) eyes open, feet together (~0.5cm apart) eyes closed, feet apart (~10 cm apart) eyes open, feet apart (~10 cm apart) eyes closed. For safety there will be a close standby throughout this procedure and each block will consist of 30 seconds data collection. Data will be obtained from a reflective marker on C7 vertebra as well as the force plates. The order of these balance conditions will be randomised and each condition will be assessed three times (Ramdharry, Marsden, Day, &amp; Thompson, 2006).</outcome>

      <outcome>Muscle strength of Quadriceps and Dorsiflexors
The subject will be seated, and a strain gauge will be strapped to their shin at one end and attached to the back of the chair at the other. They will be asked to extend their leg as hard as they can. The strain gauge will record the strength of the movement. The subject will then have their foot strapped into a foot rest, with a strain gauge attached. They will be asked to raise their foot by bending their ankle. The strain gauge will again record the strength of the movement. Each of the two strength tests will be repeated 3 times, with a one minute rest between each attempt.</outcome>
