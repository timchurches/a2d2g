  <interventions>
    <interventions>Stepping training using the modified Dance Dance Revoluation (DDR Konami) videogame 3 times a week for 3 months. Participants will perform 15 minutes of stepping practice per session and speed of stepping will be systematically increased to maintain challenge at home. Participants will receive 1 initial home visit from the physiotherapist to set up the videogame system and another home visit within a week to ensure that they are using the system safely. Participants will be provided with all equipment during the 3 month exercise period as well as a booklet containing safety precautions and instructions. Participants will be contacted by a study physiotherapist by phone once every two weeks to monitor adherence and answer any questions or concerns raised by the participant. Participants who have internet access will also be invited to participate in the online blog. If they wish to participate in the online blog, they will learn how to access, log-in and use the online blog to share their experience of using the stepping videogame with other participants. The researchers will monitor the blog daily and contribute to the blog. An additional home visit will be provided at 6 weeks to monitor progress. A final home visit will occur on completion of the 12 week program. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive usual care and will be instructed to continue with their usual activities. Specifically, usual care includes any routine medical, nursing or allied health care.  Usual activities included any regular physical activities undertaken by participants on entry to the study, such as regular walks or exercise sessions.</comparator>

An intention-to-treat approach will be used. Calculations of statistical power based on scores from our previous work in people with PD suggest 60 participants (30 per group) will be sufficient to detect a 20% between-group difference in choice stepping reaction time (assuming a control group mean is equal to 36 seconds and SD is equal to 10) with 80% power at the 5% alpha level, a correlation between pre- and post measures of 0.8 and 15% dropouts. An estimate of the effect on falls will also be calculated, to inform sample size calculations for any future trial to determine the effect on the intervention on fall rates.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reduced balance and gait are debilitating impairments associated with PD. A home-based interactive stepping videogame has been shown to be an enjoyable and effective form of training in the general older population. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to determine if a home-based, interactive, stepping videogame for people with PD is effective in improving balance and gait. Secondary aims are to determine the effect on muscle power, mobility, fear of falling and freezing of gait, and to provide data that will establish an effect size for fall rates to inform the design of future trials. The use of the online blog to enhance participation and engagement in the training, as well as gauge acceptability of the interactive stepping videogame program, will also be evaluated. Since poor balance is a major risk factor for falls in people with PD, the development of effective, sustainable and engaging exercise programs to improve balance is an urgent research priority. </summary>
