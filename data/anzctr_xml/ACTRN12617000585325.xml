      <outcome>Recurrence of UTI in the 6 months duration of trial

If a participant reported symptoms suggesting UTI (See below for Diagnosis of UTI), a clean mid-stream urine sample for culture and sensitivity will be collected. If UTI was diagnosed based on the criteria described below, then the appropriate antibiotic therapy will be commenced with a follow up sample urine to confirm complete treatment of the UTI. A UTI during the trial phase will not lead to exclusion from the study. Patients will continue the treatment to which they were assigned in the beginning of the trial. 

We will collect midstream urine samples with patients not voiding for at least 3 hours earlier and after washing the genital area with a sterile water wipe. We define diagnosis of UTI based on 1000 or more colony- forming units (CFU) in 1 ml of clean voided midstream urine, and at least two of the following lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS): dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, nocturia and hematuria. </outcome>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We calculated the sample size for this non-inferiority study using an estimate of 60% success for the nitrofurantoin group and a 15% non-inferiority limit. With 5% alpha and 80% power, we therefore require 264 patients (132 in each group).

The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis approach, supported by the per-protocol approach, will be adopted to make inference on the possible non-inferiority of the Hiprex arm, compared to the nitrofurantoin arm, in terms of 6-month freedom from UTI recurrence. The proportions of patients with at least one UTI recurrence (with 95% CIs) in the 2 study arms will be calculated. Logistic regression with treatment group as the only covariate will be employed to draw inference on the possible non-inferiority of Hiprex treatment compared to the nitrofurantoin treatment. The odds ratio (with 95% CIs) will be calculated with the nitrofurantoin arm as the reference group. Appropriate parametric or non-parametric statistical techniques will be employed to analyse the data for secondary aims of the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bladder infections (urinary tract infections or UTI) are amongst the most common infections in women. It is estimated that almost 50% of women will experience at least one episode of UTI in their life time and almost 44% will experience a recurrence within 6 months. These infections can be very troublesome and cause issues like burning sensation when urinating or going very frequently to pass urine, lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tiredness, days lost from work and sometimes admission to hospitals. 
While treatments are available to treat these infections, some women will experience several UTI during a year. These women may benefit from preventive treatments. In this study, we are planning to use Methenamine Hippurate or Hiprex which breaks down to a specific chemical in the bladder which can stop the bacteria growing in the bladder; it is not an antibiotic. 
The rationale in using this medication is that to date there has been no bacterial resistance reported to Hiprex and generally it is a well-tolerated medication with a low side effect profile. In this study, we will compare Hiprex to nitrofurantoin, an antibiotic used for many years to treat and prevent UTI. While effective, nitrofurantoin has the same implications as other antibiotics when used long-term which are resistance and side effects.</summary>
