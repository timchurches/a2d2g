Experimental: WallFlex Biliary RX FC Stent System - The WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered Stent System is being evaluated for treatment of benign biliary strictures.


Treatment: devices: WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered Stent System
Temporary placement of a biliary stent as a treatment of biliary obstruction resulting from benign bile duct strictures. The stent is fully covered with a silicone polymer to reduce the potential of tissue ingrowth into the stent. The stent is removed after 5 months (±1 month) after stent placement in Post-Liver Transplant patients and after 11 months (±1 month) in Chronic Pancreatitis and Post-Abdominal Surgery patients.
