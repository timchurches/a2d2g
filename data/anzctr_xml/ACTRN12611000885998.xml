  <interventions>
    <interventions>The adolescents will randomly assign to two groups: gain-framed message and loss- framed message. Each group of adolescences will read the respective pamphlets. The gain-framed pamphlet contains six positive messages with three related full-color images(6.1 X 4.5). Similarly the loss-framed pamphlet contains six negative messages with threerelated full-color images (6.1 X 4.5). The gain-framed pamphlet, entitled The Benefits of good oral hygiene", emphasizes the benefits of brushing, and flossing, whereas the loss-framed pamphlet, entitled The disadvantages of poor oral hygiene, emphasizes the costs of not brushing and flossing. the adolescents only read the pamphlets once and are then followed up later.</interventions>
