  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study consists of three test groups.
1. A gel mixture containing of 1% Tocopheryl Phosphate Mix (TPM) and 5% Oxycodone;
2. A reservoir patch system containing 1% Tocopheryl Phosphate Mix (TPM) and 5% Oxycodone and;
3. A matrix patch system containing 40mg Tocopheryl Phosphate Mix (TPM) and 200mg Oxycodone.
Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive only one of the above (or comparator) treatments.
Those allocated to the above groups will receive a total of 200mg Oxycodone applied topically to the upper thigh area once for a 72 hour period.
The matrix patch is made of a solid film polymer whereas the reservoir patch is made of TPM gel enclosed in a semi-permeable membrane.</interventions>
    <comparator>20 mg Oxycontin tablet to be taken orally once.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the tolerability and safety of oxycodone in novel formulations containing TPM.
This will be assessed by regular vital sign checks, and participants will be asked if they are experiencing any Adverse Events throughout the duration of the study.
Some adverse events that may be associated with the study drug include; confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, restlessness, mood changes, impaired breathing, decreased frequency in passing urine and decreased urine volume, abdominal pain, constipation, loss of appetite, dry mouth, vomiting, headache, sweating, flushing, itching of skin, pupil constriction, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, faintness and in severe cases circulatory failure and respiratory and cardiac arrest.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During Screening, Dosing Period and Follow-Up visit (10-14 days after participant has checked out from clinic).
This outcome will be monitored continuously throughout the entire duration of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the relative bioavailability of a gel, reservoir and matrix system containing TPM compared to a commercially available tablet.
This will be assessed through blood and urine sampling/analyses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected within 15 minutes prior to dosing (0hr) and at the following times thereafter for groups 1, 2 and 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 82, 94, 106, 118, 130, 142 and 154 hours post-dose.  For group 4 blood samples will be collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 60, 64, 72 and 96 hours post-dose.  A maximum of 29 blood samples will be collected from each subject during the entire study.

10mL samples of every urinary output will be collected, including a pre-dose sample, and the total urine volume at each urinary output will be recorded.</timepoint>
