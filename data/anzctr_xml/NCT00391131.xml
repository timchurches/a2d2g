               -  Patients who have within 30 days priors to the study screening visit,

                    -  Albumin &lt; 25 g/L

               -  Patients who are suffering from an acute or chronic medical condition, other than
                  PID, which may, in the opinion of the Investigator, affect the conduct of the
                  trial.

               -  Patients who are not willing or are unable to comply with protocol.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Ig
      NextGen 16% in people with antibody deficiency currently being treated with IntragamP. Ig
      NextGen 16% is a liquid immunoglobulin (antibody) preparation manufactured using
      predominately chromatographic techniques. Eligible patients will switch from monthly
      intravenous IntragamP therapy to weekly subcutaneous Ig NextGen 16% treatment. Initial
      hospital training will be required for subcutaneous administration and then the patient will
      perform the infusion in their own home, returning once a month for a supervised infusion.
      Patients will be monitored on the study for up to 10 months to assess blood IgG levels and
      rate of serious bacterial infections.</summary>
