  <interventions>
    <interventions>Modified darn repair: 
The procedure started by taking the first stitch on the pubic tubercle using O polypropylene. The thread was passed through the inguinal ligament and the internal oblique fascia fibres in a continuous tension free manner. Suturing was proceeded from medial to lateral in a crisscross pattern with 1 cm interval between each suture. On reaching the cord at the deep ring, care was taken to pass the sutures around the cord with no pressure, then the sutures are ligated 2-3 cm lateral to the deep ring. Security sutures (2-O monofilament polypropylene) were taken in a continuous manner starting at the pubic tubercle and passing through the edges of the repair at the inguinal ligament and the internal oblique fascia fibres and through the loops of the previous sutures. Procedure duration is about (60 - 120 minutes)</interventions>
    <comparator>Lichtenstein procedure; polypropylene mesh is applied over the fascia transversalis after herniotomy and narrowing of the deep ring. mesh is then fixed to pubic tubercle, internal blique fascia fibres and inguinal ligament. laterally, a small openning is made in the mesh through which the cord passes then the mesh is resutured laterally to create another deep ring. Procedure duration is about (60 - 120 minutes)</comparator>

    <concealment>closed envelope technique</concealment>
    <sequence>a total number of 152 envelopes were divided into 76 modified darn repair and 76  Lichtenstein Procedure. Envelopes are completely sealed and shuffled. An investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial and is blinded to the procedure chooses one envelope just before the surgery and inform the surgeon with the procedure to be done.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Randomization was done immediately before performing the precedue. so the surgeon knows the procedure just before the operation</designfeatures>
