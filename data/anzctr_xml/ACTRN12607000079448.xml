  <interventions>
    <interventions>During the state of nature (without any treatment or intervenes), 15 children with ADHD aged 11-16 years old, were asked to carry out a cued target detection task, in which participants were asked to respond to a white dot target, which could or could not be preceded by a star cue, during fMRI. The task lasted about 20 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>During this observational study, we measured the activation in frontal, parietal lobe and putamen during 20-minute alerting tasks in ADHD and normal control groups and compared the change of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in these areas between two groups.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In this observational study, we measured the correlation of the ADHD symptoms severity for inattention and the change of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the right precuneus in ADHD during 20-minute alerting tasks. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the alerting functions deficits in children with ADHD using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the state of nature. We expect that the parietal lobe of ADHD showed lower activities than normal controls and the ADHD symptoms severity for inattention maybe correlate with the activities of parietal lobe in children with ADHD. This study will help us to further understand the pathology of ADHD.</summary>
