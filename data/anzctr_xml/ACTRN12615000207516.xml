  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single 1 hour pre-operative counselling session with a sexologist.
Sexual counselling primarily involves assessment and education, to support women, to discuss their sexual wellbeing and to encourage them to talk about any sexual concerns which they may be experiencing as an individual or in their relationships. A one hour long counselling session may address the following issues:
*Potential effects of surgery on sexual function and physical changes
*Potential changes to intimacy
*Loss of sexual self-esteem related to body image changes, menopausal symptoms and confidence
*Changes to sexual response such as reduced arousal, loss of libido, difficulty reaching orgasm
*Menopausal symptoms related to treatment including hot flushes/night sweats, disturbed sleep, poor memory and weight gain, all of which may impact on ones sexual self esteem, sexual functioning and general wellbeing (quality of life)
*Loss of confidence and anxiety or fear about resuming sexual activity following surgery and the impact of this on their partner
*Some women experience a reduction in physical and emotional intimacy within their relationship
*Communication about sex can be difficult for couples, especially if they have never broached the subject previously, and this silence can often be mistaken as a lack of interest or rejection.

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed in consultation with a biostatistician and will use the Intent-to-treat principal and per protocol analysis. ANCOVA Generalised Linear Models will be used to compare the test for differences between groups in terms of questionnaire scores. Multivariate logistic regression will be used to test the odds of sexual dysfunction and poor quality of life between groups and test for association with known risk factors and variables such as menopausal symptoms, relationship status, age, cancer fear, satisfaction with surgery and androgen levels. All parameter estimates will be presented with appropriate 95% confidence intervals. We will use an alpha level of 0.05 for all statistical tests, and also report exact p-values. The data analysis will follow CONSORT guidelines.  
We are planning a study of a continuous response variable (FSFI score) from independent control and intervention subjects with 1 control per experimental intervention subject.  In a previous study (Rosen R, Brown C, Heiman J, et al. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI): A Multidimensional Self-Report Instrument for the Assessment of Female Sexual Function. J Sex Marital Ther. 2000; 26 (2): 191-208) the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation of 6.  If the true difference (delta) in the experimental and control means is 5 (for FSFI score), we will need to study 24 experimental intervention subjects and 24 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental intervention and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.880%.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is p=0.05. Therefore, we intend to recruit at least 24 patients per group. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine the effect of pre-operative sexual counselling on sexuality and quality of life after risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in women at high risk of ovarian cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, at high risk of ovarian cancer and have decided to undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. Study details Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive a single pre-operative counselling session with a sexologist to discuss the potential effects of surgery on sexual function and physical changes, potential changes to intimacy, loss of sexual self-esteem related to body image changes, menopausal symptoms and confidence, changes to sexual response such as reduced arousal, loss of libido, difficulty reaching orgasm, menopausal symptoms related to treatment including hot flushes/night sweats, disturbed sleep, poor memory and weight gain, all of which may impact on ones sexual self esteem, sexual functioning and general wellbeing (quality of life).
While participants in the other group will receive routine care which is the initial consultation with your gynaecologic oncology specialist who may or may not discuss such issues with you. Participants will be followed-up for up to 12 months post-surgery to determine the effect on sexual function, the prevalence and severity of sexual difficulties after RRSO, and any other factors that significantly affect sexual function and quality of life. Serum testosterone levels will also be tested to determine whether there is a correlation with sexual function after RRSO.</summary>
