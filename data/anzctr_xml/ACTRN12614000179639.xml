    <interventions>Verify the impact of the self-perception of hearing loss and tinnitus on the quality of life of the elderly with Tinnitus Handicap Inventory questionnaires and audiological exams with the EP-25 Interacoustic audiometry. Participants will need to complete the questionnaires and audiological exams once only. The participants completed all the required questionnaires and audiological evaluations/exams in one day.   The duration required for participants to complete the required questionnaires and audiological exams is one hour. All the participants will complete all the required questionnaires and audiological exams in 12 months. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this trial is that there is a correlation between changes in hearing the elderly and poor quality of life, which contributes to decreased socialization of this subject. To this end, sixty-six elderly without neurological, psychiatric and / or hearing / Vestibular disorders underwent audiologic evaluation using EP-25 Interacoustic audiometry, They also answered Questionnaires both SF-36 and HHIE and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). The survey was Conducted in only one day for each participant. All data collection will take place at 1-year period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The tonal audiometry and the handicap and SF-36 and THI questionaries were performed on only one day for approximately one hour. The examinations of 66 patients, ie the complete sample was conducted during one year. This outcome will be assessed at 12 months from baseline.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>There is a correlation between an increase in the perception of hearing loss and poor quality of life The total score of the questionnaires was observed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data analysis was performed at 6 months after all participants have completed the trial's questionnaires.

    <statisticalmethods>Data were tabulated and processed by microcomputer application PASW Statistics data editor, version 19.0. To a description of the data made use of tabular presentation of the mean, median, the standard deviations of percentages and frequencies.
The normality of the samples was observed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Kruskal-Wallis for comparison between the elderly who complain of difficulty in understanding speech and those who did not report such a complaint were used. The bivariate correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the scores of each questionnaire, and aspects of these questionnaires among themselves. The level of significance was set at 0.05 and the alpha value of 0.1 was accepted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: Among the changes that affect individuals who are aging, hearing loss is considered one of the most incapacitating. This sensorial privation prejudices communication, daily activities and social life of the elderly. Objective: To verify the impact of the self-perception of hearing loss on the quality of life of the elderly; specifically, to correlate items of both questionnaires The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE); and to compare these aspects on subjects that reported difficulties to understand speech with individuals who didnt have this complaint. Method: This study was approved by ethics committee on research involving human beings of the Prof. Joao Cardoso Nascimento Jr. Health Campus of the Federal University of Sergipe. Sixty-six elderly without neurological, psychiatric and/or hearing/vestibular disorders underwent audiologic evaluation, they also answered both questionnaires SF-36 and HHIE and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory - THI. Sort of Study: Contemporary, cross-sectional cohort study. </summary>
