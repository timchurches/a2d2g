  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm. 1 - Group 1 (neurodynamic techniques treatment) - gliding and tension neurodynamic techniques of median nerve, one-direction proximal and distal glide mobilisation and one-direction proximal and distal tension mobilisation.
a.	neurodynamic techniques for medial nerve  position supine, neurodynamic sequence: arm adduction 90 degrees and external rotation, wrist and finger extension, forearm supination, elbow extension; one-direction proximal  glide mobilisation (movement  elbow extension large amplitude of motion), one-direction distal glide mobilisation (movement  wrist extension large amplitude of motion), one-direction proximal  tension mobilisation (movement  elbow extension small amplitude of motion et the end of the movement), one-direction distal tension mobilisation (movement  wrist extension  small amplitude of motion et the end of the movement).
Standard protocol consisted of three series of 60 repetitions of glide and tension   neurodynamic techniques separated by inter-series intervals of 15 s, twice a week for 10 sessions.
The therapy will be performed by physiotherapists with more than 10 years of experience in neurodynamic techniques. The study will be performed in 2 medical clinics in the Silesia province of Poland. Approximate duration of each session  15 minutes.

Arm. 2 - Group 2 (placebo treatment)  sham gliding and tension neurodynamic techniques of median nerve, one-direction proximal and distal glide mobilisation and one-direction proximal and distal tension mobilisation.
a.	neurodynamic techniques for medial nerve  position supine, without neurodynamic sequence  upper extremity in neutral position; one-direction proximal  glide mobilisation (movement  elbow extension large amplitude of motion), one-direction distal glide mobilisation (movement  wrist extension large amplitude of motion), one-direction proximal  tension mobilisation (movement  elbow extension small amplitude of motion et the end of the movement), one-direction distal tension mobilisation (movement  wrist extension  small amplitude of motion et the end of the movement).

    <statisticalmethods>The basic parameters will be compared between groups using the independent t-test (age, body mass, height, BMI  kilograms per square meter) and the chi2 test (gender distribution, side of hand dominance etc.). A one-way ANOVA for repeated measurements (independent factor was group: experimental versus control, and repeated factor on time: before therapy versus after therapy) will be used in order to evaluate the differences in neuropathy symptom score, nerve conduction study (sensory, motor conduction and latency), two point discrimination sensation, sensation threshold, kinaesthetic differentiation of strength, kinaesthetic differentiation of range of motion,  pain score, overall health status. For significant differences in the main effect for group, time or interaction (group x time), post hoc test will be used. The results will be presented as the mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). For all analyses, the threshold of the P value considered as significant will be set at &lt;0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>
The purpose of this study is to evaluate  the use of neurodynamic techniques  compared with placebo treatment, no treatment and healthy volunteers. We hypothesized that the use of neurodynamic techniques would be more effective in the treatment of CTS patients  than placebo treatment or no treatment.
