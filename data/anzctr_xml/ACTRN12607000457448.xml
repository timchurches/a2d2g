  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study involves an adolescent group Psychological intervention using an Interpersonal Psychotherapy approach.
Participants will be adolescent with diabetes aged 13-17 yrs and meet for two hours each week over a 10 week period to complete the You Beat-It program.
The purpose of the program is to help adolescent address the psychological problems associated with their diabetes.
Treatment will follow an Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) approach which was originally designed for the treatment of adult depression.
IPT attempts to bring about change in interpersonal relationships by simplifying them into four core problem areas (Interpersonal Disputes, Role Transitions, interpersonal Sensitivity and Loss-Grief). In providing a simplified means of understanding these problems, it provides alternative pathways to resolve Interpersonal difficulties.Specific strategies are then used to aide in these 4 core problem areas (assertiveness, problem solving, role plays etc).</interventions>
