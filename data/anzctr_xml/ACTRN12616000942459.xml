  <interventions>
    <interventions>At recruitment, participants will be randomly allocated into one of two exercise groups using a computer generated schedule. At 2 month post-stroke, participants will undertake their respective exercise programmes. The exercise programme will occur 3 times per week for a duration of 8 weeks. Each exercise session will involve 1 hour of activities. The two exposure groups are:
* Balance-Strength Exercise Group: Warm up (5 mins), Balance activities (25 mins), Strength activities (25 mins), Cool down (5 mins).
* Balance-Strength-Aerobic Exercise Group: Warm up (5 mins), Balance activities (5 mins), Strength activities (5 mins)), Aerobic activities (i.e., activities that will raise heart-rate and breathing = 40 mins), Cool down (5 mins).

Exercise sessions will take place at a time and location convenient for participants. At each of these exercise sessions a qualified Exercise Physiologist or Physiotherapist associated with this study will be present to deliver the prescribed intervention and monitor adherence. The individual activities undertaken in each of the exercise programmes will vary depending on each participants fitness level and will be progressed over the 8 weeks to match any improvements made. The programmes have been established in accordance with an international framework for prescribing safe and efficacious exercise interventions to chronic stroke populations.

Participants will be aware of their group allocation based on the exercise programme they are administered. Investigators who are blind to participant group will conduct the pre- and post-exercise intervention assessments.

Participants will be asked to keep a daily activity diary that records participant
activity levels between assessment visits. Such diaries are common place as a part of
general post-stroke rehabilitation programmes and this is not expected to be an
inconvenience for participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>A Control group (i.e., No exercise) will not be directly sampled. This study has been designed to fit closely alongside the CANVAS trial timepoints (Trial ID: NCT02205424) so Control information can be captured from the existing CANVAS database.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a link between two major causes of death, disability, and reduced quality of life in our society: stroke and neurodegenerative dementia. We now understand patients who suffer stroke are more likely to experience a long-term decline in thinking ability and a reduction in brain volume. Exercise is a simple, yet effective, method of improving cardiovascular health. We will examine if exercise after stroke can modify risk factors that may lead to post-stroke brain atrophy and cognitive decline.

The aim of this project is to determine whether aerobic exercise has a positive impact on preserving brain volume and function, as well as general physical and psychological well-being. We hypothesise that participants who undertake prescribed aerobic exercise (i.e., exercise that increases heart rate and breathing) after a stroke will have preserved brain volume and neurocognitive performance, higher mood levels, and better end-organ disease well-being (i.e., less recurrent strokes, improved blood pressure, reduced cardiovascular disease) compared to participants who do not undertake aerobic exercise. 

Results from this study will provide unique information on the relationship between stroke, physical activity, brain health, and dementia. Our findings will establish whether post-stroke aerobic physical activity can prevent, or at least minimise, the impact of brain atrophy, cognitive impairment, and end organ disease state. A prescribed and tailored exercise programme could offer a simple and economically viable solution to patient care.</summary>
