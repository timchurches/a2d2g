  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised study of patients that have not shown early response to standard chemotherapy. All participants receive the standard treatment of a 21 day cycle of Cisplatin 80mg/m2 (intravenously infused over 2 hours) Day 1 and 5-Fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 (continuous infusion) Days 1-4. All participants are restaged at day 15 with Positron Emission Tomography (PET). If significant response then standard treatment is repeated over another 21 day cycle. However if no significant response, subjects will be randomised to receive either 2 x 21 day cycles of Cisplatin 60mg/m2 (intravenously infused over 2 hours) on day 22 &amp; day 50, Docetaxel 35mg/m2 (intravenously infused over 1 hour) on Day 22, 29, 36, 50 ,57 &amp; 64 &amp; 5-Fluorouracil 150mg/m2 continuous intravenous infusion for 6 weeks starting Day 22 OR Cisplatin 60mg/m2 (intravenously infused over 2 hours) on day 22 &amp; day 50, Docetaxel 35mg/m2 (intravenously infused over 1 hour) on Day 22, 29, 36, 50 ,57 &amp; 64 &amp; 5-Fluorouracil 150mg/m2 continuous intravenous infusion for 6 weeks starting Day 22 plus radiation 45Gy/25Fr starting Day 22. Radiation will be administered once daily, Monday to Friday on 25 occasions. All participants will have surgery in an attempt for complete resection, 4 - 8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy. The operation should aim to remove the tumour in total, with an adequate margin in each direction. This may be done as a subtotal esophagectomy with proximal gastric resection and a right intrathoracic oesophago-gastrostomy (IvorLewis procedure), a subtotal oesophagectomy with proximal gastric resection and a cervical oesophago-gastrostomy (McKeon procedure). This is a complicated surgery often taking more than 6 hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares the effectiveness of pre-operative treatment with cisplatin, 5 fluorouracil and docetaxel with or without radiotherapy in treating people who have shown a poor early response to standard chemotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and/or gastroesophageal junction. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have localised adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction which is due to be treated by surgery.

Trial details: 
After the first cycle of standard cisplatin/5-FU chemotherapy all patients will have a PET scan. Patients who have a poor response on the PET scan, will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive chemotherapy (cisplatin/5-FU with the addition of docetaxel) followed by surgery, and the other will receive chemotherapy (cisplatin/5-FU with the addition of docetaxel) and radiation followed by surgery. In both groups, the chemotherapy is given intravenously. In the group receiving radiation treatment, this will overlap with the chemotherapy treatment. The study aims to evaluate the response to the different therapy regimens, by comparing pathology samples, looking at the response on PET scans, toxicity, survival rates and quality of life.</summary>
