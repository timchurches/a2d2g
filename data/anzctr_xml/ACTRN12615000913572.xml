  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exenatide LAR 2 mg will be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection to indigenous people with diabetes in remote communities, in addition to their usual hypoglycemic therapy over a period of 20 weeks. The subcutaneous injection will be associated with usual care including weekly contact by a clinician. As the injections will take place in the clinic and administered by clinical staff, compliance will be determined according to the attendance records  </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will have usual care including a once weekly clinic appointment for review of their diabetes management. Usual care will include management of diabetes according to local guidelines and the current practice of the clinical service in the community. The control group will be offered exenatide LAR 2 mg treatment for 20 weeks following the initial 20 week period </comparator>
