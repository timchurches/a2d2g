  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) activities of daily living (ADL) sub-score - The primary endpoint will be measuerd before surgery and out to a minimum of 1 year after surgery. The KOOS is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 42 questions. The KOOS consists of 5 subscales; pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreational function and knee-related quality of life. Each question has 5 Likert-like response options. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to one year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the psychometric properties of PKIP - The Pre and Post-Surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) questionnaire is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 25 questions relating to the patient's awareness of their knee. Questions include the patient's self-confidence about the current status of their knee performance, stability, and overall satisfaction. Each question has a 5, 6 or 10 Likert- like response option.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the functional knee performance of Subjects
      who have undergone primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Data from Subjects who receive one
      of four contemporary knee configurations from different manufacturers will be pooled to
      establish a contemporary dataset.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the functional performance as measured by
      the activities of daily living (ADL) sub-score of the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score
      (KOOS) patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire of primary TKA at minimum one year
      post-operation. This will be carried out for all four implant configurations. The final
      endpoint is a 2-year evaluation.</summary>
