  <interventions>
    <interventions>Male subjects performed three bouts of exercise in which knee extension and leg press 45 degrees were executed in sequence. In low intensity sequence, 15 unilateral knee extensions were followed by 15 unilateral repetitions of leg press 45 degrees with 30% and 60% of one maximum repetition load (1-RM), respectively. In the high intensity sequence, the same order was used, but the load applied was 60% of one maximum repetition load (1-RM) for both exercises. One single set of 15 repetitions of leg press 45 degrees at 60% of one maximum repetition load (1-RM) was performed as control exercise. The bouts were performed in three different days with 48 to 96 hours between them. The surface electromyographic signal was recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle with a linear electrodes array during the multi-joint exercises.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The electromyographic signals, recorded with linear electrodes array (LISiN - Ot Bioelettronica, Italy) during multi-joint exercises, were analyzed by specific routines developed in the software Matlab 6.5 (Mathworks - Natik, USA). The root mean square (RMS) value was determined for each repetition of leg press 45 degrees and, from these results, a linear regression was calculated. The slopes of regression lines were normalized by their initial values to represent the percentual increase of the root mean square (RMS) value and then compared by the one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures performed on a computer using the Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS 13.0, Lead Technologies, USA). A higher percentual increase in root mean square (RMS) was observed when a single-joint exercise preceded the multi-joint exercise.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The bouts were performed in three different days with 48 to 96 hours between them. The electromyographic signal was registered during the execution of leg press 45 degrees of each bout and signal analyses were performed after the end of each test.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of repetitions executed during both single and multi-joint exercises was registered by the researcher. As not all the subjects were capable to execute the 15 repetitions proposed, the number of repetitions were also compared by the one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures calculated with the Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS 13.0, Lead Technologies, USA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The researchers spotted all the experimental procedure and registered the number of repetitions executed by the subjects during both single and multi-joint exercises of each bout.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose: To verify if the execution of a low intensity single-joint exercise for knee extensors is an efficient stimulus to increase vastus lateralis motor units recruited during a subsequent multi-joint exercise. Methods: Nine healthy male subjects (23.33 +/- 3.46 years old) performed three bouts of exercise in which knee extension and leg press 45 degrees were executed in sequence. In low intensity sequence (R30) 15 unilateral knee extensions were followed by 15 repetitions of leg press 45 degrees with 30% and 60% of one maximum repetition load (1-RM), respectively. In the high intensity sequence (R60), the same order was used, but the load applied was 60% of 1-RM for both exercises. One single set of 15 repetitions of leg press 45 degrees at 60% of 1-RM was performed as control exercise (C). The surface electromyographic signal was recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle with a linear electrodes array. The root mean square (RMS) value was determined for each repetition of leg press 45 degrees and a linear regression was calculated with these results. The slopes of regression line were normalized by their initial values and then compared by one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Results: The slopes observed in C were significant lower than the slopes calculated in R30 and R60 (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The results suggest a higher recruitment of motor units when a single-joint exercise preceded the multi-joint exercise.</summary>
