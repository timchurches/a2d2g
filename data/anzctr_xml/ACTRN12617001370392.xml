  <interventions>
    <interventions>44 patients whose spontaneous circulation returned by in-hospital CPR. The patients survived for at least 24 h and were discharged after the treatment in Konya Numune Hospital between June 2011 and June 2013. The CPC values of these patients were followed up for 2 years after discharge. Subjects who were younger than 18 years died before discharge from the hospital and hence were excluded from the study. 
In-hospital resuscitation for these patients was performed in accordance with current advanced life support protocols (2010 European Resuscitation Council Guideline). Demographic data, such as age and sex of the cases and clinical parameters related to CPR, were recorded.
Neurological results were assessed according to the CPC 13 by calling patients or their relatives at the 6th, 12th, 18th, and 24th months after discharge from the hospital. For the ones who did not give enough information, the follow-up information was obtained from the doctors who worked for "home health services." The information obtained from the doctors and patients relatives was evaluated by the neurology specialist. CPC 1 and 2 were classified as favorable neurological outcomes, whereas CPC 3, 4, and 5 were evaluated as poor outcomes.

    <statisticalmethods>The analysis of the study was made using the SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS, IL, USA). Continuous and categorical variables were presented in tables and graphs by subtracting descriptive measures. Continuous variables were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation and median (min-max), whereas categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentage ratios. Cross tables were prepared, and the chi-square test was used to determine the relation between categorical variables. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aimed to compare the cerebral performance category (CPC) scores of patients with the initial rhythm and resuscitation time for in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) during the 2-year period after discharge. A successful resuscitation should be in the form of both heart and brain resuscitation. The best postresuscitation measurement includes an evaluation of brain functions. </summary>
