  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People having major surgery say that it can cause temporary or long-term
changes in how they think and feel. By understanding these changes it may be
possible to improve outcomes for people having these procedures in the future.We would like to ask you some  questions before and after your operation and do a thinking and memory test. As we need to have  your individual baseline  the first series will be once you are confirmed on the waiting list. The second series will be four months later. This is to see if your baselines change over time  without surgery. This enables us to compare your post operative answers  to your baseline to see what differences the surgery makes. We will also do a series just before the surgery, just after your discharge after the surgery, at the time of your 6 week follow-up and  finally one year after the surgery. What we are looking for in the study is to see if there are any changes following the surgery and if so, when they reverse back to normal.  That is why we need to have the tests repeated  on the six different occasions.
