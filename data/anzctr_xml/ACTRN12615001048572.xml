  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Broken bones and thin bones are common in people with cerebral palsy.  This is due to a number of factors including reduced activity and standing, poor nutrition, use of medications for epilepsy and reduced sex hormones. Thin bones are becoming more of a problem as adults with cerebral palsy are getting older.


In older women and men with thin bones, there are good drug treatments available to reduce their risk of breaking a bone.  One such treatment is zoledronic acid, which is given as an intravenous infusion once a year.  This drug is currently being used and registered in Australia for treatment of osteoporosis (thin bones) in older women and men.

The aim of this study is to see if zoledronic acid can be used in adults with cerebral palsy to improve their bone strength and reduce their risk of breaking bones.  This drug has not be used in a study of adults with cerebral palsy before.</summary>
