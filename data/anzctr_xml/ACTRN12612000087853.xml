  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational trial.
We aim to retrospectively investigate outcome parameters (incidence of pulmonary complications postoperatively, length of stay in the recovery room/the hospital) and incidence of adverse airway events in the recovery room) in postoperative patients who received reversal of neuromuscular paralysis with either neostigmine or no reversal agent or sugammadex.

Data will be collected from patients' medical records, an electronic theatre management system (e.g. anaesthesia times, length of stay) and an electronic medical results system (ISOFT; e.g. white cell count and chest-xray reports). Data collection will include patients whose surgery took place from 1.3.11 until present. Data collection will include consecutive patients until the sample size per group has been achieved.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The drug sugammadex (Bridion) has recently been introduced into clinical practice at the Royal Perth Hospital (RPH). This drug provides the anaesthetist with a new and very efficient way of reversing the effects of amino-steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents. 
If not completely reversed, the residual effects of muscle relaxants are known to significantly impair postoperative patient outcome (Murphy et al. , Anesthesia and Analgesia 2010; 111: 120-8).
Unfortunately, when muscle relaxants are either not reversed or neostigmine is used, the incidence of such residual paralysis is extremely high (50-60% at RPH 2011, own pilot data)! This is at least partially due to a lack of appropriate monitors (already highlighted this matter to hospital and monitors are being bought) but also the lack of a reliable muscle relaxant antagonist. The latter may have changed since introduction of sugammadex in Australia in 2010. 

In a just completed audit we found strong evidence for a potential of sugammadex to result in better postoperative outcomes (lower incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade and lower incidence of postoperative pneumonia/atelectasis). However, the numbers investigated were too low to draw final conclusions. Based on this pilot data we will need to investigate at least 721 cases with the use of sugammadex and compare them with at least 721 control cases in whom no or a different reversal drug (neostigmine) has been used. This equals the investigation of data from patients intubated at RPH over approx. 12 months. 

 
The goal of this retrospective study is to build on our previous audit and investigate whether the use of sugammadex indeed resulted in beneficial patient outcomes over the last 12 months.


For this purpose, the data review will identify all eligible patients who received neuromuscular blocking agents and the mode of its reversal at the end of surgery. Main outcome data are adverse events in the recovery room, within 30 days after surgery (lung associated complications) and length of stay (recovery/hospital).</summary>
