    <interventions>Mindfulness meditation groups.
Mindfulness meditation involves skills for regulating attention with the aim of being in the present moment with a non-judgemental and curious attitude. The intervention consists of a pre-group orientation session for participants (90-min) followed by 7-weekly classes (2 hours duration). Groups will be open i.e. not of fixed membership where participants start and finish at different times. The group program is modified and adapted from Jon Kabat-Zinns Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) work.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment will take place at the Cancer Care Centre at St George Hospital. Consent will be sought from the radiation oncologists to contact their patients. They will also be given a list of the eligibility criteria for the study as well as a script if they wish to describe it to their patients. The usual treatment flow for RT patients is that newly referred patients to the Cancer Care Centre are seen by a radiation oncologist and are offered a simulation (planning) appointment usually 2 to 3 weeks before their RT commences and soon after seeing their radiation oncologist. At this appointment, Radiation Oncologists complete a Radiotherapy Booking Form for their patient. The form has a drop-down check box listing all the current clinical trials. The heading “psychology study” will be listed here with a “yes” or “no” option. The principal researcher will check the Radiotherapy Booking Forms on a weekly basis for all new radiation oncology patients. If the box is checked “yes” she will contact these patients the week after their appointment to discuss the trial. If they are interested a participant information statement and consent form will be mailed to them and an intake appointment arranged. Once eligibility is determined allocation to groups occurs. Allocation is concealed i.e. by central randomisation by phone/fax/computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Once eligibility is determined in the intake interview the participant will be randomised (this is done by the clinical trials unit at St. George Hospital). The participants will be randomisation and stratified according to tumour stream. This will be achieved by using blocked randomisation. The method of sequence generation will be a computerised random-number generator.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aims to investigate the effects on distress of a modified mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) program for patients about to undergo radiation therapy (RT) for the first time.

Research questions:
1. Do mindfulness groups significantly reduce the distress (anxiety, depressive symptoms) of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy?
2. What is the feasibility of routine delivery of an adjunctive psycho-oncology intervention (like the mindfulness groups) in the radiation oncology setting?
3. Are open groups (i.e. groups where members can start and finish at different times) an appropriate way for delivering mindfulness groups to this population?
4. If the mindfulness groups intervention is shown to be effective how can it be generalised to benefit a wider population e.g. significant others and carers of the patient, and patients who are receiving other treatments like chemotherapy.</summary>
