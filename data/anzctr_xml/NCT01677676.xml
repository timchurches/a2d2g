             completion ofthe Day 57 visit. Male subjects do not need to use contraception if their

             TGA combined with a barrier contraceptive through to completion of the Day 57 visit
             study and have negative results on a serum or urine pregnancy test done before
             administration of study medication (women who are postmenopausal [no menses for at
             least 2 years] are also eligible to participate)

             restrictions

          5. Ability to provide written, personally signed and dated informed consent to

          2. Current, chronic or recurrent disease (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine,
             renal, liver, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, immune suppression, malignancy or other
             conditions) that could affect the action, absorption or disposition of the IMP or
             could affect clinical or laboratory assessments.

             reactions, asthmatics, hay fever and eczema sufferers requiring medication which in

             in the opinion of the Investigator could interfere with evaluation of injection site
             local reactions, over the deltoid region of both arms as these will be the dose site.

         11. Donation of blood or blood products (e.g. plasma, platelets) within 90 days prior to
             or intention to donate blood during the entire study.

         12. Use of another investigational medicinal product within 90 days prior to receiving the
             first dose of IMP or intention to enrol in another clinical study throughout the
             entire study (up to and including Day 57), including the 6 month follow-up period for
             those subjects who consent to remain on study for this follow-up.

         13. Subject with suspected recent (=12 months) pre-exposure to the influenza A virus - flu
             like symptoms associated with = 2 days off normal daily activities

         14. Subjects who have received a flu vaccine in the last 12 months or who anticipate
             receiving it within the duration of the clinical phase of the study (ie up to
             completion of Day 57) or the period up to the 6 month safety follow-up telephone call,
             for the subjects who consent to remain on study for this follow-up.

         15. Any clinically significant abnormalities, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator
             or Co-Investigator, on electrocardiograms (ECGs), as assessed against the clinical
             site's reference range.

        In addition, for each subject, a completed medical history questionnaire will be taken as
        part of the consented study procedure.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different
      formulations of FP-01.1 as well as build on the data set from the first in human study
      FP-01.1_CS_01. It is anticipated that the results of this Phase I study will inform the best
      formulation of the vaccine to evaluate in efficacy studies.</summary>
