  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Injury to the kidney with loss of function is common after cardiac surgery especially in patients with previous kidney disease, old age, diabetes and the need for complex open heart surgery. The development of cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is associated with increased length of ICU and hospital stay and increased risk of death. The development of the novel biomarker Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) has proven to be an effective method for early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI). Early detection of AKI may facilitate early treatment, and may result in improved outcomes for patients with AKI. Standardisation of NGAL measurement has improved the reliability of serum NGAL as a marker of AKI. However the optimal timing for measurement of serum NGAL has yet to be fully elucidated, with different studies measuring NGAL at different time points. Accordingly we propose to study a group of 25 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, aiming to determine the optimal point or points at which to measure serum NGAL.</summary>
