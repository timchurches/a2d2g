    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the AcuFocus Corneal Inlay ACI 7000PDT will
      provide an effective method for the correction of presbyopia in patients who have normal
      distance vision but need a correction such as glasses or contact lenses to see clearly at
      near.</summary>
