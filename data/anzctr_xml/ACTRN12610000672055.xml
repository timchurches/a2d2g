  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three testing days with each day testing one type of switch: 1) standard OSLER-2 hand-held switch (requires a finger tap); 2) "Magic wand-pad" switch (requires a chin tap); 3) "jelly-bean" switch (requires a head tap). The order in which switches are tested will be randomised and counterbalanced. Participants taking the OSLER-2 test sit comfortably in a darkened room and press a switch in response to a small light presented for one second every three seconds for forty minutes. The OSLER-2 will be performed four times per testing day (9:30, 11:30, 13:30, 15:30). Each testing day is separated by 1-8 weeks. On the night before each testing day, sleep is restricted to a maximum of three hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The OSLER-2 is a common test which objectively measures daytime sleepiness. A limitation of the OSLER-2 test, however, is that it can only be performed by people who do not have hand or arm disabilities as it involves feedback to the presentation of a light via a hand-held response box. Our group has modified an OSLER-2 to accept responses from switches that do not require hand function, switches which are commonly used within the quadriplegia population. This research aims to examine the relationships between the modified switch OSLER-2 against the standard hand-held switch OSLER-2 as a measure of daytime sleepiness in able-bodied, sleep restricted people.</summary>
