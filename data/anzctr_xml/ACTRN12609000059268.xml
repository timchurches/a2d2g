  <interventions>
    <interventions>Epilepsy is one of the most common serious brain disorders in Australia. The fundamental characteristic of epilepsy is recurrent unprovoked seizures; a clinical manifestation presumed to
result from an abnormal and excessive discharge of a set of neurons in the brain. In this study people with newly diagnosed epilepsy will be assessed at three time points: 28 days (baseline), 4 and 12 months following first diagnosis for the associated psychosocial, educational and
economic sequelae of epilepsy.</interventions>

      <outcome>Psychosocial factors: Family functioning assessed by The Family APGAR Score; perceptions and social support (from Quality of Life in Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy Instrument (NEWQoL)); Carer and patient psychological distress assessed by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); Disability (World health organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-12)' Quality of Life (Visual Analogue Scale); Childhood behaviour (Childhood behabviour Checklist); Coping and Resilience (illness Perception Questionnaire).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline; 4 months; 12 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Economic Hardship: will be measured as a dichotomous variable based on a series of questions about failure to make household payments and whether there was help provided by any organistation or individual. A family reporting one or more failures to make payments or the need for help in making payments will be identified as a case of economic hardship. This will be measured at baseline for the 3 months prior to the diagnosis of epilepsy and at each follow-up visit. An advantage of this measure is that it is sensitive to the possibility that individuals do prioritise certain payments (e.g. default on power bills to pay rent). The basis for these questions is the US Census Survey of Income and Program Participation.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>SEISMIC is a population based incidence study of epilepsy to be conducted in the Sydney South West Area Health Service (Eastern Zone). It is a 3 year cohort study of people newly diagnosed with epilepsy and the associated psychosocial, educational and economic sequelae. Participants are enrolled over 24 months and they, or their carer/proxy/guardian, will be interviewed at three time points: 28 days (Baseline), 4 and 12 months following first diagnosis of epilepsy. The aim is to identify modifiable factor that enhance resilience and reduce vulnerability to the socioeconomic impact of epilepsy in an Australian population.</summary>
