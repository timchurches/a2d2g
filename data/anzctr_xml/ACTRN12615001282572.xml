This is a pilot study and our primary end point is similar to that used by Meduri et al (Chest. 2007;131:954-63); if we achieve similar kind of separation between the groups, with a power of 80% and  alpha of less than 0.05 we will require 18 patients per group. To allow for contingencies, we aim to enrol 20 subjects per group.





Baseline and outcome variables will be compared using Chi-square tests for equal proportion, Students t-test for normally distributed outcomes and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests otherwise. Multivariate models adjusting for baseline imbalances and known covariates will be performed using logistic regression. In order to account for the longitudinal correlated nature of variables Generalized linear and repeated measures modelling will used to analyse each of the outcomes (primary and secondary). Multiple imputations and mixed modelling will be utilised if there is missing data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of lung damage that follows a variety of insults, most commonly infection. This is characterized by lung inflammation and flooding of airspaces within the lung by fluid leaking from the blood vessels. Patients with ARDS usually require life support from a breathing machine (ventilator). 
About 34% of patients suffering from ARDS die despite best care. At any given point about 6% of patients in all Australian ICUs are suffering from this disease. 
There is growing evidence to suggest that higher salt levels in the blood may have protective effect on lungs in ARDS. Higher salt concentrations in blood have been shown to reduce inflammatory damage to the lungs, less flooding of airspaces and improved function. However, these data are from isolated cell studies or experiments in non-human lungs. There is an urgent need to explore the beneficial effects of high salt concentration in blood in a controlled study in humans.
As a first step towards investigating the beneficial effect of a high blood salt concentration, we will randomize 40 patients with ARDS to either receive usual care or usual care with additional treatment to increase the salt concentration in blood. Higher salt concentrations in blood will be achieved by administering fluids with higher salt content and will be maintained up to 7 days. Daily assessments of lung function and severity of illness will be performed along with close monitoring of any adverse effects of high salt concentrations.
