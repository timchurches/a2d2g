  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prospective observational study 3,6,12 and 18 months post discharge using quantitative surveys to assess health related quality of life and mental health followed by a limited number of semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients and relatives.

Patients will be surveyed once at 3,6,12 and 18 months after discharge. 
Relatives that participate in the interviews will be surveyed once at the time of the interview. 


10 interviews with patients and 10 interviews with relatives for approximate 1,5 hours each will be conducted 12 months after discharge from the hospital. Patients and relatives will be interviewed once only. Interviews will cover the experience of ECMO treatment before and after discharge.  </interventions>
