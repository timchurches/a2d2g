  <interventions>
    <interventions>A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled intervention trial designed to evaluate whether fish oil supplementation can positively impact on metabolic rate in overweight women. Forty volunteers will be recruited through public advertisements. Prior to the commencement of the study volunteers will complete a series of questionnaires and tests designed to assess general health, diet history and exercise habits. Participants will be randomly allocated to consume 5 x 1g capsules per day containing either vegetable oil (control group) or fish oil for the duration of the study. Participants in the control group will receive 5 x 1g capsules of vegetable oil. For participants randomised to the fish oil group, the amount of fish oil provided will be based on participants total body weight. Participants will receive 2-5 fish oil capsules (each capsule of fish oil contains 600mg of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA) with the remainder as vegetable oil, providing a total of 5 capsules per day. Possible combinations are therefore; Group 1: up to 65kg (BMI 25-27.5) --&gt; 2 fish oil, 3 placebo, Group 2: 65.1-75kg (BMI 27.6-30) --&gt; 3 fish oil, 2 placebo, Group 3: 75.1-85 (BMI 30.1-32.5) --&gt; 4 fish oil, 1 placebo, Group 4: 85kg and over (BMI 32.6-35) --&gt; 5 fish oil, no placebo. A supplement diary will be used to assess compliance. Participants will attend two study visits at baseline (week 0) and at completion of the intervention (week 6). During these visits each participant will have a series of non-invasive measurements taken which include height, weight, resting energy expenditure, fat oxidation and body fat. Blood samples will be collected at both visits and assessed for erythrocyte saturation of two key fatty acids, DHA and EPA</interventions>

    <concealment>An external party will be doing the randomisation and therefore coding the samples as A and B. The research administering the capsules will only know that the sample is A or B and will not know which treatment this pertains to. Therefore the individual administering the capsules will be blinded, consistent with a double-blind placebo controlled intervention. The first person eligible for the study will be randomised toeither A or B using a simple coin-toss. Subsequent persons will be allocated to treatment groups via the process of randomisation by minimisation, with BMI and age balanced between groups.

    <statisticalmethods>This study is a pilot study that will collect data that will be used for a power analysis for a subsequent study.  We plan to recruit 40 participants for this pilot study. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures will be used to determine the effect of the treatments, time of measurement and their interactions on the dependent variables. Where ANOVA will show a statistically significant main effect, pair-wise comparisons will be performed using Tukeys Honestly Significant Differences test to determine differences between means. 
Individual changes in fat oxidation, resting energy expenditure and body fat will also be correlated against changes in erythrocyte LCn3PUFA content using Pearson correlations.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The importance of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn3PUFA) in fish oil is widely recognised for its ranging health benefits. More recently, studies have looked at metabolic effects of fish oils. An early study indicated that dietary fish oil supplementation reduces body fat mass and stimulates fat oxidation in healthy adults. Whilst associations have been found between LCn3PUFA and body composition, there is inconsistency between studies looking at weight loss. Recent human studies have shown that provision of EPA and DHA from fish oil in a dose-dependent manner correlates strongly with an increase in the omega-3 index. However, no study to date has administered fish oil in a dose-dependent manner based on weight and examined the effects on resting energy expenditure, fat oxidation and body fat. Employing such a method may provide more substantial evidence to support an inverse relationship between fish oil supplementation and weight loss.</summary>
