    <interventions>High flow nasal prongs, direct extubation post cardiac surgery
When the patient meets the extubation criteria of the unit, the patient will be extubated as per unit protocol. The patient will then receive treatment as per Protocol A (control) or B (treatment).

Protocol B (Treatment)
*Patient extubated directly onto HFNP which are humidified to 37 degrees prior to application
*Starting Flow rate set to 35 litres/min and titrated up to a maximum of 50 litres as determined by patient comfort
*Starting FiO2 prescribed by Intensivist
*Patient to remain on HFNP continuously for 8 hours  breaks allowed for nasal care or mobilization
*Flow rate and FiO2 may be titrated to maintain SpO2 &gt; 95% during the treatment period
*HFNP will be removed at the end of the 8 hour period, or until no longer required as determined by the treating intensivist 
*Other treatments (i.e. Drug therapy, physiotherapy, upright positioning, and early mobilisation) will be conducted as per standard unit protocol in consultation with the treating intensivist and cardiac surgeon</interventions>
    <comparator>Protocol A (Control)
*Respiratory management as per treating intensivist (Hudson mask or Nasal prongs at low flow rates and FiO2 directed by intensivist) until transfer to the ward
*Other treatments (i.e. Drug therapy, physiotherapy, upright positioning, early mobilisation) will be conducted as per standard unit protocol in consultation with the treating intensivist and cardiac surgeon</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in atelectasis post cardiac surgery</outcome>
      <timepoint>Chest radiography will be performed on Day 1 and 5 post surgery and scored for severity of atelectasis using a validated scoring system (Radiological Atelectasis Score) by a radiologist who is blinded to patient identity and treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in hypoxaemia (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pao2/Fio2 will be calculated from any arterial blood gases taken as part of clinical care during the first 24hrs from return from surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in patient dyspnoea score</outcome>
      <timepoint>Dyspnoea Visual Analogue Scale - measured at 1, 8 and 12 hours post extubation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in Respiratory rate</outcome>
      <timepoint>Respiratory rate will be collected hourly from the patient's observation sheet for the first 24 hrs after surgery.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be enrolled prior to surgery and randomly allocated direct extubation onto high flow nasal prongs or standard treatment at 30-60 minutes prior to extubation. The randomised groups will be written in numbered ordered opaque envelopes prepared by the statistician. It will not be possible to blind the patient, clinical staff or study staff to the treatment allocation. The statistician and radiologist will be blinded to treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be achieved through a computerised random number generator. A randomised list will be created by the statistician (using Excel). The randomised groups will be written in numbered ordered opaque envelopes prepared by the statistician. Randomisation will occur within 30-60 minutes prior to extubation. At that point the nurse will open the envelope and prepare either the standard equipment or the HFNP.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Open heart surgery is being performed on increasing numbers of obese patients. Almost a third of patients undergoing open heart surgery are classified as obese. It is known that these patients are more prone to post operative complications, particularly lung collapse and that they recover more slowly from these complications. This increase in complications and slower recovery leads to longer intensive care unit and hospital stays. Our previous research has shown that high flow nasal prongs (HFNP) create positive airway pressure and that patients who are obese benefit even more from the positive effects of HFNP. Our study also showed that the patients' oxygen levels improved and their breathing felt more comfortable with the HFNP. Therefore, it is necessary that we further investigate the effects of HFNP on obese patients after cardiac surgery, in an attempt to reduce complications, particularly lung collapse.</summary>
