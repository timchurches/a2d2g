  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a multicentre (St Vincent's Melbourne, The Melbourne Clinic and The Albert Road Clinic) clinical study of patients with a DSM-IV TR MDD, who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of at least one antidepressant (SSRI or SNRI) or when ECT is the preferred treatment. 
Randomization will be into two parallel groups of 20 participants (outpatients and/or inpatients) each. 
One group will be treated with Quetiapine XR (flexible dose of 50 to 300 mg daily orally, with dose changes determined by CGI-I scores and tolerability) in combination with TAU (SSRI/SNRI not previously prescribed) and the other group with TAU. TAU is determined by the treating clinicians selection of monotherapy of a single antidepressant (SSRI/SNRI) at therapeutic dosage and not previously associated with failed response/poor tolerability.  The dose range of Quetiapine XR will be flexibly adjusted from 50mg to 300 mg orally. Changes in study medication dose are made according to clinical response (continuation of the current dose if HAMD less than or equal to 7 and CGI-I less than or equal to 3 and increase in dose by 100 mg if HAMD &gt; 7 and &lt; 15 and CGI-I &gt; 3) and tolerability (including as measured by SAS (Simpson and Angus, 1970) and LUNSERS (Day et al, 1995).The duration of treatment will be up to 6 months.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the magnitude of depressive symptoms is measured by the Hamilton Depresion Rating Scale (HAMD) score.
The primary objective will also be assessed by the prevention of depressive relapse, measured by the HAMD.   Depressive relapse is defined as HAMD greater than or equal to 15.</outcome>

    <concealment>Patient eligibility will be established before treatment randomisation.  Patients will be randomised strictly sequentially, as patients are eligible for enrolment/randomisation.  If a patient discontinues from the study, the patient number will not be reused, and the patient will not be allowed to re-enter the study.
This is an open-label study. The treatment allocation is based on random assignment of individual participants based on a computer-generated sequence. The randomization sequence/code will be concealed from all personnel, but the treatment thereafter will not.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is emerging that the medication, Quetiapine (trade name: Seroquel) is clinically useful in treating clinically significant depression (major depressive disorder) and in the augmentation of antidepressant medication in this condition and depression that occurs in bipolar disorder (manic-depression). Quetiapine is currently approved for  the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

This study will look at whether the addition of the medication Quetiapine XR (trade name: Seroquel XR) to standard antidepressant medication is better than antidepressant medication alone in keeping symptoms of depression to a minimum after a clinically beneficial course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within the previous 3 weeks for clinical depression (major depressive disorder). Participation in the study will occur after remission (disappearance) of clinically significant depression has occurred after treatment with ECT, when there has been failure to respond to an adequate trial of at least one antidepressant medication, or when ECT is the preferred treatment.

People will be invited to participate in the study if they: are aged 18-65 years ;have
been diagnosed as experiencing major depressive disorder; have had a course of ECT
completed within the previous 3 weeks, which has led to remission of depression
sustained over the last 2 ECT treatments of the ECT course, after failure to respond   to
an adequate trial of at least one antidepressant medication, or when ECT is the
preferred treatment.  People will not be able to participate in the study if they are: at
immediate risk to themselves or others;  dependent on  alcohol or other substances,
apart from caffeine or nicotine; or have diabetes mellitus that is not stable or well
controlled.  Women who are pregnant, or may become pregnant, or are lactating
during the course of the study, will also  not be able to participate in the study.

There will be 2 groups of 20 participants, each, in the study. One group will be treated with the medication Quetiapine XR in combination with an antidepressant medication. Another group will be treated with an antidepressant medication alone. The antidepressant medications, either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that has not been previously prescribed, or previously not helpful in preventing relapse of clinically significant depression, will be prescribed by treating doctors. The addition of Quetiapine XR to the antidepressant medication will be randomly determined, so that the study doctors or treating doctors will have no prior knowledge nor influence on whether this medication is added to prescribed antidepressant medication. The dose of Quetiapine XR will range from 50 milligrams to a maximum of 300 milligrams per day, with doses adjusted according to clinical response to, and tolerability of this medication. Psychiatric medications other than the prescribed antidepressant medication or Quetiapine XR, will not be prescribed or permitted during the course of the study. 

The duration of the study is 6 months, with weekly study visits for the first month and monthly, thereafter for the remaining 5 months. Participants will be asked questions about the presence of depressive symptoms and how they are tolerating their medication, as well as a physical examination as part of each study visit. Participants will have blood tests (clinical chemistry, haematology) prior to commencing the study, and at 1,2,3 and 6 months.  Participants will also have a fasting (not having eaten, or drunk anything other than water since midnight) prior to commencing the study, and at 3 and 6 months. Participants will also have a urine drug test and electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to commencement. Participants will be free to withdraw their consent at any stage without affecting or prejudicing their clinical care in any way.  In the event of depressive relapse (recurrence of clinically significant depression), participants will be discontinued from study, with alternative treatment arrangements made in consultation with their primary treating medical practitioner.</summary>
