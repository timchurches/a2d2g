  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each infant will have his/her temperature taken.  The axilla method will be used at care times as per usual.  All infants admitted to the neonatal unit will have a nasal or oral gastric tube inserted.  A new device which is a dual lumen NGT/OGT will incorporate a thermistor in the 2nd lumen, which will remain in situ throughout the infant enrollment in the study.  This will enable the nurse to have a continuous core temperature measurement which is fed into the computer at the baby's bedside, and the nurse will record each temperature hourly.  
Each infant will be enrolled in this study for a maximum of one week minimum duration can be one day.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Numerical data will be described using mean and SD or median interquartile range (IQR) depending on the distribution.
The Bland and Altman (1986) approach for comparing measurement devices will be utilised for individual comparison of each method used.
In order to detect a mean difference of 0.3C between the axilla and oesophageal and SD 0.6, with a power of 80% and 5% level of significance, a sample size of 90 was calculated.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will compare the oesophageal and axilla method of temperature taking and evaluate levels of agreement.
All infants who are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, who have parental consent will be eligible for enrolment.
Each infant will have an OGT/NGT inserted which incorporates a thermistor so the clinician can monitor core temperature on a continuous basis.
Infants will also have their axilla temperature taken at the relevant care times.
Each infant will be enrolled in the study for no longer than one week.
We hypothesise at the oesophageal method of temperature taking will be in agreement with the axilla method of temperature taking.</summary>
