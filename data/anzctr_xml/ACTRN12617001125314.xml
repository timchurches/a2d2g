  <interventions>
    <interventions>A new regional technique for analgesia of chest wall, called serratus anterior plane block catheter. Serratus anterior plane block is a fascial plane block achieved by injection of local anaesthesia into the fascia plane either just superficial to serratus anterior muscle or just deep to the serratus anterior muscle. The local anaesthesia will inhibit branches of intercostal nerves supplying the hemithorax. 

At the end of the surgery but prior to extubation, the anaesthetist will insert a catheter into the serratus anterior plane and bolus 50ml 0.2% ropivocaine (100mg). After extubation and being stabilised in Post Anaesthetic Care Unit, the PACU nurse will connect the catheter to a peripheral nerve infusion pump. For the next 48hours, the infusion pump will bolus 40ml 0.2% ropivocaine every 4hours. This is consistent with current practice of serratus anterior infusion catheter management at this hospital. </interventions>
    <comparator>Surgically placed paravertebral catheter. Surgeons can under direct vision during the operation open the paravertebral space and place a catheter into it. Local anaesthesia is injected into the paravertebral space to achieve anaesthesia of the hemithorax by blocking the spinal nerves. 


At the end of the surgery but prior to extubation, the surgeon will insert a catheter into the paravertebral space and bolus 20ml 0.5% ropivocaine (100mg ropivocaine). After extubation and being stabilised in Post Anaesthetic Care Unit, the PACU nurse will connect the catheter to a peripheral nerve infusion pump. For the next 48hours, the infusion pump will infuse 10ml 0.2% ropivocaine per hour. This is consistent with current practice of surgically placed paravertebral catheter management at this hospital. Over the 48 hour both groups will receive the same total dose of ropivocaine. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is analgesic effect of SAPB catheter is not inferior to sPVB catheter with the largest clinically acceptable difference being 150mcg fentanyl in first 24h post open thoracotomy. The approach we will use to analyse this trial is to first pre-define the smallest level of inferiority of the proposed treatment (150 mcg fentanyl), which, if surpassed, would be a clinically unacceptable difference. To conduct the actual analysis well construct the CI of the difference between treatments and observe if the span of the CI lies completely on one side of delta (in the more favourable direction for the new treatment). </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Aim 

The aim of this non-inferiority randomised controlled trial is to investigate a regional technique that is as efficacious in analgesia as paravertebral block (PVB) and thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) for open thoracic surgery using postero-lateral thoracotomy incision, but less invasive and easier to perform. 

Hypothesis

We hypothesise that Serratus Anterior Plane Block (SAPB) catheter provides non-inferior analgesia compared to surgically placed Paravertebral Block (sPVB) catheter in open postero-lateral thoracotomy, with the largest clinically acceptable difference of 150mcg fentanyl in first 24h post operatively. 

Specific objectives 

1.	To demonstrate that analgesic effects of SAPB catheter is not inferior to surgically placed PVB catheter in open postero-lateral thoracotomy
2.	To demonstrate that SAPB is a minimally invasive, safe and easy to perform alternative to PVB

Method 

This trial will be a single centre non-inferiority, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 2 parallel groups and 1:1 allocation comparing efficacy of analgesia of SAPB catheters to sPVB catheters for elective open postero-lateral thoracotomy. 

Significance 

Open thoracotomy is one of the most painful surgical incisions. Effective analgesia is imperative to good postoperative outcomes but it is difficult to achieve. A multitude of regional techniques have been developed however no one technique is safe and efficacious for all patients. The two current gold standard of post thoracotomy analgesia, PVB and TEA, are associated with significant barriers including side effects, complications, contra-indications and technical challenges. 

SAPB is a relatively new but promising technique that in healthy volunteers and cadaveric models was able to achieve paraesthesia of the ipsilateral hemithorax with few side effects. However the clinical efficacy of SAPB is not well established. SAPB can potentially provide similar analgesia to PVB and TEA for thoracic surgery but with improved safety profile and easier learning curve; this would represent a significant advancement in post thoracotomy analgesia. 

Likely benefits 

An effective yet minimally invasive regional technique with few side effects will be a safer alternative to thoracic epidurals and paravertebrals for thoracic surgery. Furthermore it may be particularly useful in ambulatory surgery and as a rescue technique.
