  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with acute pain with pain scores greater than or equal to 7 will be administered analgesia according to a standard protocol, either receiving the trial medication (a mixture of morphine and alfentanil) or the comparator, morphine alone.  The morphine-alfentanil mixture will be in premixed syringes containing 50mcg of alfentanil and 0.75 mg of morphine per millilitre.  Patients will be administered bolus doses of one to four millilitres at no less than three minutely intervals until their pain is adequately controlled, provided they do not experience adverse effects or need to be withdrawn from the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is a standard treatment for acute pain.  We will be using morphine in syringes mixed to 1 mg morphine per millilitre.  Patients will be administered bolus doses of 1 to 2.5 millilitres at no less than three minutely intervals until their pain is adequately controlled provided they do not experience adverse effects or need to be withdrawn from the trial.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be the time taken to achieve comfort, which has been defined as a pain score of less than or equal to four out of ten.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary timepoint is once the patient has achieved comfort.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome is the safety of the trial drug (alfentanil-morphine combination) as compared to standard treatment (morphine alone.)  This will be measured by comparing the number of adverse events (nausea, vomiting, pruritis, allergic reaction and opiate toxicity.)  The adverse effects will be based on a bedside assessment by the treating doctor and patient reporting of adverse effects.  The presence or absence of adverse effect will be recorded on a data sheet.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse effects will be monitored for throughout the duration of the study.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be patients admitted to the emergency department with pain scores greater than or equal to 7 out of 10 ( standard ED pain scoring system ), who meet the inclusion criteria detailed below and do not meet the exclusion criteria.

The issue of consent is complex.  Because participants will have significant pain at the time of enrollment in the trial, it may be unethical to delay access to effective analgesia for the purposes of obtaining informed consent.  Furthermore, patients in acute pain may not be unable to accurately understand the information provided to them and may not have sufficient time to ask questions about the study process prior to the need to administer medication.  Obtaining consent from a family member would not always be practical or possible given the time pressures of the situation, and the fact that many patients present without a family member or “significant other.” 

Once the patient's pain was adequately controlled the treating medical officer would approach him/her and explain that he/she had been given analgesia of recognized safety and efficacy in treating pain, but also in accordance with a clinical trial to determine relative benefits of the two drugs/ drug mixtures used in the trial. The medical officer would provide a patient information sheet and request consent to use the patient's data in the trial.

The allocation to the treatment groups will be determined by pharmacy supplying syringes of either an alfentanil-morphine mixture or morphine alone based on a computer based randomisation.  The treating nurse will administer the medication from the syringe, and will be blinded to the contents of that syringe by virtue of the syringes being identical to each other.</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomisation will be used to randomise patients to each arm of the study. 

Pharmacy will supply syringes containing either morphine or alfentanil-morphine mixture based on a computer-generated randomisation.  The syringes will be supplied in “batches” of a quantity predetermined by Pharmacy.  Supplying individual syringes will not be possible as a single patient may require more than one syringe to achieve adequate analgesia.  Supplying the syringes in “batches” will ensure that if a patient requires additional syringes he/she will continue to receive the same type of syringe. Batches are to be changed twice weekly (not alternated, but as determined by pharmacy to ensure randomization.)</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare the safety and efficacy of morphine-alfentanil mixture with morphine alone for the treatment of severe pain in the emergency department at the Lyell McEwin Hospital.  

Alfentanil is a short acting opiate with rapid onset, where morphine is a longer acting opiate which is slower in its onset of action.  It has previously been shown, in post-surgical patients, that a mixture of alfentanil and morphine can safely reduce the time to comfort when compared with morphine alone.  We hypothesize that within the emergency department, the alfentanil-morphine mixture will safely reduce the time to effective analgesia.</summary>
