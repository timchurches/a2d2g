         13. Patient cannot complete follow-up treatment due to co-morbid non-fatal illness or they
             are known to be a visitor to the city or any other known reason for which follow-up
             would be impossible (e.g. incarcerated in a federal prison).

    <summary>The ESCAPE-NA-1 study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of the
      neuroprotectant, NA-1, in reducing global disability in subjects with major acute ischemic
      stroke (AIS) with a small established infarct core and with good collateral circulation who
      are selected for endovascular revascularization.</summary>
