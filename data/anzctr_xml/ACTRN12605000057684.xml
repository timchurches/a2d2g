  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the most painful and debilitating side effects of chemotherapy is mucoisits.  Oral mucositis involves swelling, irritation, and ulceration of the lining of the mouth.  Good mouth care including mouthwashes has been shown to relieve symptoms.  Currently, there is no strong evidence to support the use of any mouthwash.  This is a pilot study to test the mouthwash, Biotene.  Patients (24) will receive either Normal Saline or Biotene mouthwashes.  The following data will be collected from each group: 1) severity of mucositis, symptoms experienced and 3) compliance with mouth care.  Patients will be randomly assigned and unaware of which mouthwash they are to receive.</summary>
