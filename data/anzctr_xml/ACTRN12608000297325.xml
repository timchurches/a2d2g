  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient controlled analgesia morphine cummulative requirement measured in milligrams of morphine required</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 hours post injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient controlled analgesia morphine cummulative requirement measured in milligrams of morphine required. There is only one primary outcome, being the 48 hour morphine requirement. This is because the sample size for the trial has been calculated using 48 hour morphine requirements. The morphine requirements at the other timepoints are secondary outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6, 24 and 72 hours post injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional Activity Score. This is a patient self-assessed score with the following gradings: 
1. no limitation - activity is unrestricted by pain 
2. mild limitation - activity is mild to moderately restricted by pain
3. severe limitation - the ability to perform the activity is severely limited by pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Verbal Pain Scores (VPS). Patients rate their pain from zero to ten, with zero representing no pain and ten representing worst pain ever experienced. Patients will be asked to note their VPS at rest and on movement or coughing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence and severity of nausea and vomiting. A patient assessed score with none, mild, moderate or severe symptoms recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or absence of pruritis (itch). A yes/no question answered by the patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence and severity of sedation. This is a score with the following gradings:
0 ALERT
1 MILD: Sometimes drowsy, easy to rouse and can stay awake once woken
2 MODERATE: Constantly drowsy, still easy to rouse, unable to stay awake once woken
3 SEVERE: Constantly drowsy (somnolent), difficult to rouse, severe respiratory depression</outcome>
      <timepoint>6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post injection</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential trial patients will be identified in the pre-admission clinic (PAC), and the trial discussed with them there by one of the researchers.  If they consent to participation, or express an interest in considering participation, a notifying page will be placed in the admission notes.  This will alert staff to the presence of a trial patient once they are admitted, and trigger a call to the Acute Pain Management Service (ACPM).  The ACPM nurse will then coordinate with the treating anaesthetist to facilitate trial inclusion.  The elective surgical lists will also be examined to find patients who will be having abdominal surgery requiring mid-line laparotomy in case the patient has not attended PAC.  Additionally, non-elective surgery patients will also be targeted if the urgency of the surgery or the clinical state of the patient does not preclude discussion of the trial.  
A recruitment log will be kept of all patients identified for participation.  
Randomisation Procedure: When a patient is recruited to the trial they will be assigned a unique five digit code. The first digit of the code will represent the hospital pharmacy preparing their test solution: 1 for Western Hospital and 2 for RMH.  The next three digits will represent the patient number for that hospital.  The last digit will be a check digit, being the last digit of the sum of the previous three numbers. This will allow a check that transcription of the code number from the test solution to the patient protocol has been accurate.  
Each hospital pharmacy will have a master list of all patient codes.  Each patient code will have been matched to one of two patient groups: ropivacaine or saline.  This randomisation will have been performed using a computer random number generator.  The pharmacy will use this list to prepare test solutions, labelled with the unique identifying patient code, and further marked with ‘one of two’ or ‘two of two’, on each of the patient’s syringes.  
After a patient is recruited, pharmacy will be notified to allow the designated test solution to be brought to theatre.  This will allow the TAP injection to be performed at the completion of surgery prior to waking the patient.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computer random number generator will produce a list of numbers between 0 and 1. Those numbers between 0 and 0.5 will be assigned ropivacaine. Those numbers between 0.5 and 1 will be assigned saline.</sequence>
