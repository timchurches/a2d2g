  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oguchis disease is a rare form of CSNB with autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by a typical clinical feature called the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon in which the golden yellow discoloration of the fundus disappears in the dark adapted condition and reappears shortly after exposure to light.
We will investigate the presence of TRPM1 (Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily m, member 1), GRM6 (glutamate receptor, metabotropic, 6), SAG (S-antigen- arrestin), and GRK1 (G-protein-dependent receptor kinase 1) mutations in the family members with Oguchi disease. one-off testing session lasting approximately 2 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will investigate the novel mutation of TRPM1, GRM6, SAGi and GRK1 in the affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family. This is a composite primary outcome.
Genomic DNA will obtain from peripheral leukocytes (10 mL of whole blood) of the siblings and parents by ammonium acetate extraction. DNA samples will quantified with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer prior to the PCR</outcome>
      <timepoint>31/08/2015.  All six family members will test for the mutation testing on this date.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A complete ophthalmological examination including visual acuity, applanation tonometry, biomicroscobic examination findings, dilated examination of the posterior segment, fluorescein angiography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, dark adaptation test, automated visual field examination, and Electroretinography will be evaluated. This is a composite secondary outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>31/08/2015, complete ophthalmological examination will be evaluated
All six family members will test for the mutation testing on August 31, 2015.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The 12-year-old boy (Case 1), 14-year-old  girl (Case 2), 16-year-old girl (Case 3), 19-year-old girl (Case 4), 41-year-old woman (Mother) (Case 5), and a 44-year-old man (Father) (Case 6) will be examined. 
The participants are all members of the same family.
A 41-year-old woman (Mother) and a 44-year-old man (Father) had a consanguineous marriage with a 4th degree relative (paternal cousin).
Cases 1-4 noticed night blindness initially 3-10 years previously. 
There were no history of problems with night vision in both father and mother. </inclusivecriteria>
