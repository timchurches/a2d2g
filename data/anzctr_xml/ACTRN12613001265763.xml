    <interventions>Arm 1 - Dignity Therapy

Dignity Therapy involves 3 interviews during which the new resident is given the opportunity to reflect on important aspects of their lives, and how these experiences may benefit others. The first interview is face to face, approximately 1 hour long and audio recorded. The second interview is face to face, approximately 30 minutes long and is when the resident is able to edit the information obtained in the first interview. The third interview is face to face and approximately 15 minutes long when the resident is given the final document. This document is then made available to staff. In this study we are asking that the staff may be allowed to access the document so that they can refer to it when planning and delivering care.

One in three transcripts will be randomly selected by principal investigators and reviewed using the Dignity Therapy Adherence form. This will ensure adherence to the Dignity Therapy protocol and document deviations.

Dignity Therapy Intervention series of guided questions about a person's past life and events that are important to them. The interview is recorded, then edited, with a printed transcript as the end result. This transcript is, the generativity document or legacy, is designed to capture the essence of the person who was interviewed. The content of the document is the outcome of the following questions being asked - 
"Tell me a little about your life history; particularly the parts that you either remember most, or are most important? When did you feel most alive?
* Are there things that you would want your family to know or remember about you?
* What are the most important roles you have played in your life (family, work, community service etc.)? Why were they important to you, and what did you accomplish?
* What are your most important accomplishments, and what makes you feel most proud?
* Are there things that you feel need to be said to your loved ones, or things that you would want to say again?
* What are your hopes and dreams for your loved ones?
* What have you learned about life that you want to pass along to others? What advice or guidance would you wish to pass along to your child(ren), husband, wife, parents, other(s)?
* Are there important words or instructions you would like to offer your family?
* In creating this permanent record, are there other things that you would like included?"</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2 - Friendly Visit 

Friendly Visiting involves the same number of visits as for Dignity Therapy but they are of shorter duration and do not consist of a formal interview. There is no document developed during the Friendly Visit.

    <statisticalmethods>Due to the small sample size for this pilot study analyses will be primarily descriptive, and any inferential statistics will be interpreted with caution as the study is not powered to detect clinically important effects. 
All the tools will be tested for their feasibility in this setting as this information could inform a larger study.
The potential effectiveness will be measured through the comparison of outcomes for the intervention and comparison group. 
Baseline levels will be used as covariates. Effect size estimates for both groups will be calculated. Mixed analysis of variance will be used to compare changes over time for the two groups. To measure acceptability, independent t-tests will be used to compare residents feedback on participating in the study. To measure feasibility, descriptive statistics will be used to report the number and percentage of visits by the research therapist, the time and duration of the therapy using means and standard deviations.
The IBM SPSS statistical software package version 20 will be used for data analysis.
Thematic analysis will be carried out to identify themes in the qualitative responses to open-ended questions, and management of the data will be undertaken using NVIVO software. 
One in three transcripts will be randomly selected by principal investigators and reviewed using the Dignity Therapy Adherence form. This will ensure adherence to the Dignity Therapy protocol and document deviations.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose of the study is to assess the usefulness and potential effectiveness of Dignity Therapy in reducing psychological and spiritual distress in newly admitted residents to Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs). The study will also assess the impact of the intervention on the service provider and care provision. 
The intervention entails interviewing residents using a series of guided questions about their past life and events that are important to them and producing an edited  document that could be shared with other family members and service providers.
A comparison group will receive another intervention (Friendly Visit).
