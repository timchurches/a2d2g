  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial is comprised of two study parts: 
Part A: Assessment of energy intake,
Part B: Assessment of blood glucose and gastric emptying,
following administration of 0g, 5g, or 10g L-phenyalalanine 30 min prior to a meal (Part A: ad libitum buffet style meal; Part B: standardised Ensure drink meal).
Although it will not be required, subjects will be invited to participate in both parts.

In each of Parts A and B, subjects will receive, in randomized, double-blind fashion, an intragastric bolus infusion (100ml) of i) 5g L-phenylalanine; ii) 10g L-phenylalanine; iii) saline (control). Subjects will receive one infusion per visit. Study visits will be separated by 3-7 days.

Part A:
For each study visit a baseline blood sample, and Visual analogue Scale (VAS) questionnaire will be collected (t = -31) . At t = -31 min the infusion will be administered over 1 minute using a feeding tube. At t = -20, -10, and 0 min, a further blood sample will be collected and VAS completed. At t = 0 min, subjects will be presented with a cold, buffet-style meal. Subjects will be allowed 30 minutes to freely consume the buffet meal until comfortably full. At t = 30, and 60 min further blood samples will be taken, and VAS administered,

Part B:
For each study visit a baseline blood sample, VAS, and breath sample will be collected (t = -31). At t = -31 the infusion will be administered over 1 minute using a feeding tube. At t = -20, -10, and -1 min further blood samples will be collected and VAS completed. At t = -1 min, subjects will consume, within 1 minute, a mixed-nutrient drink (Ensure, 400 kcal, 300 ml) labeled with 100 mg of 13C-acetate for measurement of gastric emptying by breath sampling, and 3g 3-OMG for measurement of glucose absorption. Blood samples and VAS will be taken every 15 minutes, and breath samples will be taken every 5 min, over the next hour (t = 0 to 60 min). Over the following hour, VAS and blood samples will be collected every half hour (t = 90, 120), and breath samples collected every 15 min (t = 75, 90, 105, 120). </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally and is associated with serious co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. Once adipose tissue has been accumulated, and food intake is limited by low calorie diets, counter-regulatory mechanisms induce an increase in appetite and a decrease in energy expenditure, which makes weight loss very difficult to maintain. To combat the global burden of obesity and its co-morbidities, a major challenge lies in the development of effective therapies that increase fullness and satiety, and result in good blood glucose control, while lacking adverse effects that are often associated with current therapies. 

There is increasing evidence that nutrient stimuli in the gastrointestinal tract play a central role in the control of energy intake and blood glucose. Proteins, and their building blocks, amino acids, are of interest, since high-protein diets are very effective for weight loss, particularly loss of fat, rather than muscle mass, and for improving postprandial glycaemic control, in obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. There is some evidence that a number of amino acids (including L-phenylalanine) may also have effects on energy intake, blood glucose and gut function in humans. Thus, they are of special interest in terms of potential therapeutic approaches for obesity and type 2 diabetes.

This study will investigate the dose-related effects of intragastric administration of L-phenylalanine on gastric emptying, gut hormone release, glycaemic control, appetite perceptions and energy intake in healthy, normal weight and obese type 2 diabetic patients.</summary>
