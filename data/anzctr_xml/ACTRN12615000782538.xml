  <interventions>
    <interventions>The will investigate the efficacy of two cosmetic products, a  ceramide-dominant physiological lipid-based hydrating cleanser and moisturiser. The Cream will be applied liberally to the whole body twice a day, while the Cleanser will be used on the whole body once a day. Duration of use will be for 28 days.  Compliance will be monitored by weighing the products at each study visit. Both products are regulated as cosmetics, and as such do not have 'active' ingredients. Both products contain ceramides, cholesterol and physiological lipids in a 3:1:1 ratio.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo cleanser will contain a blend of surfactants, while the placebo cream will contain a blend of emulsifiers, fatty alcohols and thickeners. These placebo products are the intervention products with the ceramide components removed. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage change from baseline in EASI score at Day 28 for both the PP and ITT populations. The outcome to be assessed by the EASI score is eczema severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The percentage change from baseline in the EASI score. The outcome to be assessed by the EASI score is eczema severity.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7, 14 and 21</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The percentage change from baseline in trans epidermal water loss (TEWL). TEWL is determined by the use of a hand held Tewameter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7, 14, 21 and 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The percentage change from baseline in skin hydration. Skin hydration is determined by the use of a handheld Corneometer. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7, 14, 21 and 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The change in DLQI from baseline. The DLQI, Dermatology Quality Index Survey, will be used to assess changes in quality of life. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 14 and 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction survey. This survey has been designed for this study and will be used to assess subject attitudes towards the test products. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 14 and 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The amount of Zatamil Hydrogel used as rescue medication. The amount of Zatamil Hydrogel used will be determined by weighing the product at each assessment visit.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7, 14, 21 and 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Type of adverse events, and their relationship to the investigational products. The most common type of adverse events from topical cosmetic cleansers and creams is irritation. This may present as itch and/or rash. These will be assessed via subject self reporting and medical observation/queries at each clinical visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7, 14, 21 and 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of adverse events, and their relationship to the investigational products.  Adverse events from cosmetic cleansers and creams are rare. These will be assessed via subject self reporting and medical observation/queries at each clinical visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7, 14, 21 and 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of adverse events, and their relationship to the investigational products. Adverse events from cosmetic cleansers and creams are usually mild. These will be assessed via subject self reporting and medical observation/queries at each clinical visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7, 14, 21 and 28</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>To determine the number of subjects needed a power analysis was used. This power analysis has shown that assuming an alpha (a) of 0.05, power (1-ÃŸ) of 0.8, a difference between group means of 12% and a standard deviation of 20, approximately 50 subjects per group are required.

The Students t-test will be used to test if there is a statistically significant difference in EASI score, TEWL, skin hydration, DLQI and quantity of Zatamil Hydrogel used in the active and placebo groups.</statisticalmethods>
