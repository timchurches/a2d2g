  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary hypothesis is that ERN decreases plasma concentrations of both high and low molecular weight isoforms of apo by:
a)	decreasing the synthesis rate of apo(a)  
b)	decrease  of  apo(a) transcription 
c)	decreasing the assembly of Lp(a)

This will be asessed by plasma and urine  assays for Lp(a) and apo(a) isoforms</outcome>
      <timepoint>1,2 and 4  and 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary hypothesis is that ERN decreases plasma concentrations of both high and low molecular isoforms of apo by increasing urinary apo(a) secretion.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Approximately 30 participants will be recruited for this study.
As per the protocol all participants will have elevated Lipoprotein (a), already be taking lipid lowering medication, and be either male or female between 18 and 75 years of age.   It is expected that the ratio of recruitment will be unbalanced (male (60%) to female (40%) purely due to the incidence of disease in the community.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is one of the most atherogenic lipoproteins and consists of a glycoprotein called apo(a) which is covalently linked to an LDL particle. Lp(a) is mostly synthesized in the liver and metabolized both via the kidney and liver. A  size polymorphism of apo(a) (high and low molecular weight isoforms) exists that negatively correlates with plasma Lp(a) levels. We could previously show that  fragments of apo(a) are secreted into the urine and the daily secretion rate correlates with plasma Lp(a) concentrations.  Nicotinic acid (NA) and extended release nicotinic acid (ERN) are currently the only lipid lowering drugs that consistently reduce plasma Lp(a) by up to 30%. Since the mechanism by which ERN lowers Lp(a) is not entirely clear we aim to investigate this mechanism in vivo and in vitro.</summary>
