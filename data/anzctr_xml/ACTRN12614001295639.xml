    <interventions>Self-monitoring of blood glucose
Continuous glucose monitoring (carried out for 6 days at a time at each of the three timepoints illustrated below) and measurement of indices of glycaemic control at three timepoints throughout pregnancy (14-18 weeks gestation; 24-28 weeks gestation; 32-26 weeks gestation):
- HbA1c
- Fructosamine
- Glycated Albumin
- 1,5-anhydroglucitol

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The correlation of measures of glycaemic control (as assessed by glycated albumin, HbA1c, fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol values) obtained throughout pregnancy with maternal and neonatal outcomes, particularly the incidence of macrosomia. Maternal and neonatal outcomes will be assessed by reviewing medical records and routine clinical data following delivery.
Maternal outcomes to be assessed include:
- Method of delivery (e.g. induction of labour, caesarean section)
- Perineal lacerations
- Postpartum haemorrhage
- Complications in labour
Neonatal outcomes to be assessed include:
- Birth weight
- Gestational age at birth
- Incidence of neonatal death
- Shoulder dystocia
- Bone fracture
- Nerve palsy
- Admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
- Hypoglycaemia
- Jaundice and/or jaundice requiring phototherapy
- Respiratory distress
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-pregnancy/delivery date</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The correlation of glycated albumin, HbA1c, fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol values obtained throughout pregnancy with fetal hypoglycaemia in the first 24 hours after delivery. Fetal hypoglycaemia is routinely assessed as part of standard clinical care for babies born to mothers with type 1 diabetes in pregnancy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 hours after delivery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The correlation of glycated albumin, HbA1c, fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol values obtained throughout pregnancy with fetal indices of glycaemic control including cord blood glucose, insulin and c-peptide.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-pregnancy/delivery date</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The correlation between glycated albumin, HbA1c, fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol with continuous glucose monitoring indices of post-prandial glycaemic variability, including post-prandial glucose excursions (PPGE) and the post-prandial incremental area under the curve (iAUC).</outcome>
      <timepoint>14-18 weeks gestation, 24-28 weeks gestation, 32-36 weeks gestation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The correlation between glycated albumin, HbA1c, fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol with continuous glucose monitoring indices of glycaemic control including (a) the mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE); (b) the largest amplitude of the glycaemic excursions (LAGE); (c) the standard deviation of blood glucose; and (d) the M value defined as the mean value of the statistic values of all deviations in blood glucose values with respect to the patients' target blood glucose values.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Macrosomia remains a common and important complication of type 1 diabetes in pregnancy, with adverse consequences for both mother and neonate. Accurate determination of glycaemic control remains difficult due to limitations in the accuracy of indices of glycaemic control in pregnancy and ongoing controversy regarding the timing of self-monitoring of blood glucose. Continuous glucose monitoring provides accurate glycaemic data but is limited due to cost and availability. Furthermore its use has not consistently shown improvements in pregnancy outcome. We hypothesise that glycated albumin will be a useful clinical tool for monitoring glycaemic control in pregnancy and with the availability of a new automated assay, has the potential to be widely accessable and cost effective.</summary>
