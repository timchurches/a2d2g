  <interventions>
    <interventions>At 72 hours (end of day 3 of life), 240 hours (end of day 10), day 28 and 36 weeks infants will have blood NTpBNP levels measured and echocardiograms performed. Pulse oximetry data will be analysed for the time period  approximately 72 hours prior to these tests. 
Echocardiograms will be assessed for evidence of structural cardiac disease, cardiac dysfunction and evidence of raised pulmonary artery pressures. Pulse oximetry data will be analysed for time in target saturations, frequency and duration of hypoxic episodes and variability of oxygen saturation levels. Clinical data will be extracted by chart review. Respiratory health questionnaires will be sent to families at 1 and 2 years and clinical and neurodevelopment assessment performed at 2 years corrected age.</interventions>
    <comparator>The evolution of the NTpBNP levels from 72 hours to 36 weeks  will be compared across the recruited group of &lt;30 week GA  infants and compared to known reference ranges for preterm infants. There will also be subgroup analyses.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>There is very little published data on NTpBNP levels in preterm infants and the association with respiratory or cardiac outcomes. Based on the best available evidence estimates from standard power tables suggest that for this study to have 80% power to detect correlations in excess of 0.40 with alpha=0.05 we would require a minimum sample size of 45 infants. Allowing for potential sample loss due to failure to complete the full set of assessments we are aiming for a minimum target sample size of 50.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Infants born at &lt; 28 weeks gestation have an underdeveloped cardiorespiratory system. Premature birth disrupts the development of the lungs and lung vasculature. Many infants are able to recover from this with supportive intensive care and time allowing fro growth and development. However there is increasing evidence from animal and human studies that a subgroup are at risk of abnormal pulmonary vascular development leading to a prolonged need for respiratory support and increased risk of death in the first two years of life. At present we lack good screening tools to identify infants at risk of abnormal pulmonary vascular development.

There is evidence from studies on  animals, adults, children and term-born infants that B-type Natriuretic Peptide is elevated in the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Our hypothesis is that NTpBNP levels in extremely low gestational age neonates increase  with increasing severity of lung disease and that those with the highest NTpBNP levels have the highest risk of recurrent hypoxemia (low oxygen levels). We also hypothesise that those with the highest late NTpBNP levels will demonstrate more cardiac dysfunction with evidence of raised pulmonary artery pressures in the most severely affected.

NTpBNP levels may help doctors to stratify premature infants into low, intermediate or high risk categories for the development of pulmonary hypertension and allow clinicians to identify those infants in need of further investigation. NTpBNP levels may also help identify which infants may benefit from medications that lower pulmonary pressures. </summary>
