  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will initially be screened using standard questionnaires and assessment tools. Leg measurements will be taken so that the robotic device can be individually fitted. They will then be put on a 12 week wait list and reassess prior to the commencement of therapy.
The intervention will involve 2 sessions of exercise therapy per week for 12 weeks. Each session will be 1 hour duration and will consist of individualised therapy, prescribed and administered by a physiotherapist, including upright weight-bearing exercise facilitated by HELLEN (a REX Bionics Robotic Exoskeleton - "Hunter's Robotic Exoskeleton for Lower Limb Exercise and Rehabilitation") as tolerated by the patient. This may be a combination of: sit to stand practise, standing tolerance, weight shift, trunk control exercises, stepping practise, side stepping, squats, upper limb exercises and gait practice. Participants will also be provided with a home exercise program relevant to their treatment, which will be updated throughout the trial as required. This will include exercises relevant to each individual maximising their potential in therapy e.g. standing tolerance at a bench with upper limb exercises, squats, transfer practise etc. Frequency of the home exercise program will be 5 days per week, for 20-30 mins per day, and monitored by checking the completed box on attendance records throughout the therapy period of the trial. Measurements will be retaken after 6 weeks of the therapy, after 12 weeks of therapy, and a further 12 weeks after the completion of the program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be on a 12 week waitlist to determine their baseline level of function. Participants will be encouraged to continue with their regular therapy during this time, and will be advised that they can contact the researcher at any time should they have queries.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, will be calculated for demographic data. A linear mixed model will be used to detect a significant difference between outcome scores during each time period. The value of the baseline score at the start of the trial and after intervention will be used as a covariate, and analysis conducted to correct for differences in baseline scores and to ensure there is no effect of order. All analyses will conducted on an intention to treat basis, with missing follow-up data conservatively imputed using the last observation carried forward method. The MRI data will be analysed using customized software, Differences in metabolite concentration, ASL perfusion and rsfMRI data will be compared at the different time points.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For those with severe acquired brain injury, weight-bearing exercise can pose many challenges for both patients and their therapists. Due to physical demands and safety issues, those with severe mobility impairment are often denied the opportunity for weight bearing, task specific training.  This type of training is essential if the recovery of functional abilities such as independent transfers and mobility are to be achieved. 
Advances in robotic technologies have led to the development of wearable lower body exoskeletons. These can be used to assist sit to stand, weight bearing activities and gait. This research team is in the fortunate position to be provided access to an exoskeleton (HELLEN) to research its applicability in people with acquired brain injuries. This device has the potential to assist therapists to increase patient opportunities for weight bearing training at higher intensity and dosage to maximise their potential for recovery. 

This is ground breaking research with no previously published literature on this topic.
Our aim is to examine the potential health benefits and feasibility of using a lower limb exoskeleton as an adjunct tool for neurorehabilitation in those with severe mobility impairment due to acquired brain injury.

This is a Phase I, wait-list controlled trial with 20 participants. Baseline measurements will be taken on enrolment into the study followed by a 12week waitlist period. They will then receive 12 weeks of intervention, provided by a physiotherapist (Nicola Postol). This will involve two 1 hour sessions of individualised upright weight-bearing exercise facilitated by HELLEN, per week. Participants will be provided with a home exercise program, updated throughout the trial as required. Reassessment will occur after 6 and 12 weeks of intervention and after 12 weeks follow-up and will comprise of a battery of impairment, function and quality of life measures.
