  <interventions>
    <interventions>Potential subjects with pancreatic cancer may be identified at pre-admission or outpatient clinic by a clinician or VCB research coordinator, and if consent is obtained tissue, blood and/or urine sample will be collected. All patients will be treated as per standard of care. The only procedure beyond standard of care is the collection of tissue, blood and/or urine samples. 

Blood and/or urine samples will be collected at the time of other standard-care assessments (such as CEA) to minimise/eliminate the need for additional venipunctures. 

Blood (upto 60 ml) and urine (upto 60 ml) will be collected for research purposes on the following occasions:

1. Before and after surgical removal of pancreatic cancer (if applicable)
2. Before and after any chemotherapy regimen (if applicable)
3. Every 6 months while you are on active surveillance (if applicable)

Archival tissue specimens will be requested for each patient after enrolment. Where possible, current biopsy specimens (fresh tissue) will be collected by either Victorian Cancer Biobank or local pathology laboratories at the time of standard of care procedures,

Follow up will occur until the end of active surveillance, death or 5 years post enrolment, whichever occurs first.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This protocol aims to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers. The proposed study size includes 500 patients. Assuming alpha of 0.05, the number of patients enrolled into this protocol is sufficient to identify a biomarker that predicts for recurrence in greater than 40% of patients, with power of 0.8.

Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse data arising directly from this protocol study. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Mantel-Cox log-rank test will be used for survival analyses. Proportions will be compared using the Chi square method or Fishers exact test. For all analyses, two-sided p values of &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Multivariate survival analyses will use the Cox Proportional Hazards method.

Using multivariate analyses will allow for detection of prognostic biomarkers while minimising impact of selection and information biases. Selection bias for predictive biomarkers are minimised by the fact that only patients who have received each particular treatment will be included in the analysis, and in Australia, each treatment is only available at certain points during a patients disease course.

Further statistical methodology and calculations will be provided for each specific project that wishes to analyse aspects of this data and tissue set. The results of the various assays will be collated and analysed. The results of the biomarker studies will be examined statistically to determine the specificity and sensitivity of single or any combination of markers in detecting the presence of Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), predicting recurrence risk and response/resistance to treatment. As these studies are exploratory and observational with no treatment intervention, no formal statistical hypothesis will be tested.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease that is set to become the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide by 2020. Over 80% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.

Through data collection and correlation with analyses of archival tumour specimens and blood collections, this trial aims to identify and validate novel diagnostic and monitoring methods; novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers and to use these to inform studies of novel therapeutic opportunities that will improve the management of pancreatic cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have been diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Study details
This protocol aims to enrol at least 500 consecutive eligible patients over 10 years. Enrolled patients will undergo collection of clinical data and archival tumour specimens. Where applicable, patients will also undergo collection of blood and/ or urine at several time points. Once a sufficient cohort has been enrolled, selected molecular analyses will be conducted on each specimen, thus, allowing for batching of specimens.
Enrolled patients will undergo collection of clinical data and archival or fresh tumour specimens as part of routine clinical management, with all patients will be treated as per standard of care. 

When applicable, archival tissue samples from the primary pancreatic cancer, matched normal pancreas tissue and/or resected metastases will be obtained, upon enrolment. to study. Where possible, current biopsy specimens (fresh tissue) will be collected by either Victorian Cancer Biobank or local pathology laboratories at the time of standard of care procedures.

Patients that consent to the liquid biopsy (blood and urine collection) sub-study will undergo collection of blood/plasma and urine at the beginning and during each systemic therapy. Blood (upto 60 ml) and urine (upto 60 ml) will be collected for research purposes on the following occasions:

1. Before and after surgical removal of pancreatic cancer (if applicable)
2. Before and after any chemotherapy regimen (if applicable)
3. Every 6 months while you are on active surveillance (if applicable)

Follow up will occur until the end of active surveillance, death or 5 years post enrolment, whichever occurs first.</summary>
