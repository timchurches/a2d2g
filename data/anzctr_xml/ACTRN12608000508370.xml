  <interventions>
    <interventions>One structured interview and one complete standardized dermatological clinical examination: Interview included date of birth, age of rapid pubertal growth and/or weight gain(s) or loss(es) of more than 5 kg, age of striae appearence, history of traumata, surgery, relation to scars, medical history specially medication (cortisone), hernia. Dermatological examination included search for all visible skin manifestations having been described in literature as linked to Marfan Syndrome: striae, hypertrophic, hernia, large or atrophic surgical or post-traumatic scars, cutis laxa, elastosis perforans serpiginosa, fibroma, pterigion, poliosis, abnormal pigmentation, purpura, auricular dysplasia, or inter-digital membranes, number and localization of striae. Duration of interview and examination approximately 20 minutes. Patients were seen between april 2003 and november 2006.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Various skin manifestations have been reported in literature for MS without knowing their real diagnostic value and are frequently incompletely described. Some of them are common in the general population and physicians may miss their diagnostic significance. For the moment, only striae atrophica (stretch marks) without marked weight gain, pregnancy or repetitive stress and recurrent or incisional herniae are considered as skin and integument minor criteria for diagnosis of MS. As they are frequent, even dermatologists may miss MS diagnosis. On the other hand, the precise characterization of dermatological signs of MS is the first step to refine the definition of the expanding spectrum of MS-related disorders, whatever their biological origin (fibrillinopathies and TGFbeta signalopathies).
The main objective of this carefully designed prospective case-control study was to characterize precisely the diagnostic value of the dermatological signs reported to date as linked to MS, and specially the value of striae.</summary>
