  <interventions>
    <interventions>To determine the relative efficacy of web 2.0 in comparison to existing internet based interventions, the trial will consist of two intervention groups. Participants in both of these groups will receive a pedometer to monitor and record their daily coincidental physical activity regimen for the duration of the trial (eighteen months). The primary intervention group will receive access to an interactive website with web 2.0 content including streams, social media connectivity and other innovative content. 168 participants will be recruited to this group. The comparative intervention group will receive access to an existing website without web 2.0 content. Participants will be able to contribute to forums and record their steps to the website, but will not have access to social media or innovative content. 168 participants will be recruited to this group. Participants will be able to access the website allocated to their intervention group for the duration of the project. Time spent interacting with the website is self selected and internet engagement (number of hits, session duration) will be monitored and, combined with self reported physical activity patterns, used to support the utility of the site in promoting physical activity. Objective outcome measures (Weight, BMI and Physical activity) will be collected three times over the course of the study (3 months, 12 months and 18 months). To assess physical activity objectively, participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor during waking hours for 5 days during the outcome measurements. Upon completing recruitment for the RCT, an Ecological trial of the websites will be conducted in 2890 voluntary participants. This study will test the recruitment and retention capabilities of the two interventions and the effect on physical activity levels and has been registered separately.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive a pedometer but will not have access to online content. Controls will be encouraged to use the pedometer to monitor and record daily incidental physical activity for the duration of the trial (eighteen months). Objective outcome measures (Weight, BMI and Physical activity regimen) will be collected three times over the course of the study (3 months, 12 months and 18 months). To assess physical activity, participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor during waking hours for 5 days.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>More than half of the Australian population do not meet the levels of physical activity recommended to achieve health benefits. The Internet has become an increasingly important communication tool and Internet based physical activity interventions which include innovative technology have the potential to reach large groups of individuals and contribute to the promotion of physical activity and behaviour change. Each year there is a proliferation of health-related and health-promotion websites, yet virtually no work has been done to study the utility and effectiveness of these population-targeted websites. This study will develop a website featuring Web 2.0 applications and evaluate the efficacy and utility of the website to promote physical activity in comparison to a conventional (Web 1.0) physical activity promotion website and a control group. The study will initially test the efficacy of the intervention in this randomised control trial (RCT). The RCT will investigate the efficacy, adherence and behaviour change in a rigorous, controlled setting with high internal validity. 
Following the commencement of the RCT and an ecological trial (ET) will commence. The ET takes advantage of the unique 'real world' sample available to the research team through the existing 10,000 Steps website to evaluate engagement by users from the broader community. The ecological trial will be registered separately.
We expect that the current proposal will provide an increased understanding of the benefits of newer web-based technologies and applications in engaging and retaining participants on web-based physical activity promotion sites. This work has the potential to improve health outcomes from increased engagement/retention in physical activity.</summary>
