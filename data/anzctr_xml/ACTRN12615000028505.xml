  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oventus oral mandibular advancement device is worn during sleep. It is anticipated that the device will be worn between 6-8 hours per night every night for 2-6 weeks (determined by patient preference). Device fitting will take 1-2 hours during the initial fit and may be adjusted up to 4 times during the study which will take a further 30-60 minutes each adjustment.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI.)</outcome>
      <timepoint>There is no fixed primary time point for this study as the device is titrated until properly fitted. Titration is anticipated to take between 2 and 6 weeks. The design of the study allows for three follow-up polysomnography studies to be conducted after the initial fitting and up to four separate titrations. The primary time point is therefore between 2 and 6 weeks. 

</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in snoring grade. The snoring grade is recognised by healthcare professionals including the NHS (public health care system of the United Kingdom). The snoring grades are 
(1)	Grade One - Infrequent snoring that is not particularly loud and does not disrupt breathing.
(2)	Grade Two - Regular snoring with associated breathing difficulties that can affect the quality of sleep.
(3)	Grade Three - Snoring every night that may well be related to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary time point is expected to occur between 2-6 weeks depending on how long it takes to properly fit the Oventus device (titration of the device).</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants must be eligible for a mandibular advancement device.  Once eligibility is confirmed, the participant will have a baseline polysomnography study completed (sleep study) to verify obstructive sleep apnoea and collect baseline information. The participant will then be fitted with an Oventus oral appliance and return for up to 3 follow-up polysomnography studies.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>This is an exploratory pilot study aimed at determining the degree of benefit of the device on the AHI score at 1 month.  A benefit is measured as a greater than or equal to 50% improvement in the AHI. It is anticipated that, under usual care (weight loss etc.), the longer term reduction of greater than or equal to 50% (a 'success') for these patients in the AHI is at most 5%. An improvement of AHI to greater than or equal to 50% in 20% of the patients would be considered clinically worthwhile to warrant further investigation. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to reduce the symptoms of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and snoring using the Oventus oral appliance. Sleep apnoea is assigned an apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) number which indicates the severity of OSA. The aim of the study is to reduce AHI by at least 50% in at least 20% of the participants in the study.</summary>
