  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized, double blind, active control study of PRX-102 (pegunigalsidase alfa) in
      Fabry disease patients with impaired renal function. Patients treated for approximately 1
      year with agalsidase beta and on a stable dose for at least 6 months will be screened and
      then randomized to continue treatment with 1mg/kg agalsidase beta or to treatment with 1
      mg/kg of PRX-102. The identity of the enzyme will be blinded to the patient and the
      investigator. Patients will receive intravenous infusions every two weeks. Patients will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio of PRX-102 to agalsidase beta. Randomization will be stratified by
      urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of &lt; or = 1 g/g by spot urine sample. No more than
      50% of the patients will be female.</summary>
