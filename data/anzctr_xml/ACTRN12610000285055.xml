    <studytitle>The Nuts for LIFE (Lipids, InFlammation, Endothelial) Study: The dose-response effect of hazelnut consumption on blood lipids, inflammatory markers and endothelial function in overweight and obese individuals</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A 12-week randomised, parallel dietary intervention to compare the effects of consuming 30g or 60g of nuts per day, or no nuts (control) on biomarkers of chronic disease, including blood lipids, inflammation, endothelial function, and body composition in overweight and obese individuals.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a randomised, controlled, parallel intervention trial with three arms: no nuts (control group), 30g of hazelnuts per day, 60g of hazelnuts per day. The study will be carried out to assess the effects of incorporating hazelnuts at two different doses (30 g/d, 60 g/d) with a diet without nuts on blood lipids and lipoproteins, inflammatory markers, endothelial function, body composition and oral fatty acid sensitivity in overweight and obese people. A 2-week run-in period will be used to control for baseline effects of nut intake, in which all participants will be asked to minimise nut intake and keep a nut diary. Baseline measurements will be collected from each participant after the run-in period. After collecting all the baseline measurements, each participant will be randomly allocated to one of the three groups for a period of 12 weeks.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Endothelial function. This will be measured by using a SphygmoCor system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 12 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Plasma total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride concentrations will be measured by enzymatic methods using a Cobas Mira Plus analyser. Plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration will be calculated using the Friedewald formula.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body composition. This will be measured by using a bioelectrical impedance analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oral fatty acid sensitivity. This will be determined via triplicate sensory evaluations (triangle tests).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 12 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment will be used. This will be achieved through allocation being performed by the statistician who will have no involvement in the enrollment process and is located in another building. Once participants have been accepted into the study, sufficient details for allocation (study number, age, sex, BMI) will be sent to the statistician who will return group allocation codes once blocks are complete.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be allocated using random sequences of the three groups generated using SAS 9.1.3. Due to the strong possibility of age, sex, and BMI effects, groups will be balanced using 8 strata constructed using sex (M/F), age (18-40, 41-65), and BMI (25-29.9, &gt;29.9) categories. Allocation will be conducted by the "off-site" statistician.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Novel risk factors for heart disease have been identified, including inflammation and impaired blood vessel function. Nuts, due to their unique nutrient composition, could potentially reduce these risk factors when regularly incorporated into the diet. Current guidelines recommending the daily inclusion of 30g of nuts are largely based on their cholesterol-lowering properties. There is an absence of studies investigating optimal intakes of nuts for improvement in these novel risk factors. 

Therefore, the aim of the project is to compare the effects of incorporating hazelnuts at two different doses (30 g/d, 60 g/d) with a diet without nuts (control) on inflammatory markers, endothelial function, plasma lipids and lipoproteins, and body composition.</summary>
