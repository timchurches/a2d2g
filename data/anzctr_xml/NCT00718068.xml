    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Sterile Potassium Chloride Concentrate
Treatment: drugs - Sterile Potassium Chloride Concentrate

Experimental: Continuous - This group will receive potassium chloride by continuous infusion on a sliding-scale system based on serum potassium level.

Active Comparator: Intermittent - This arm will form the control group and receive potassium chloride by intermittent infusion as per conventional management


Treatment: drugs: Sterile Potassium Chloride Concentrate
Continuous infusion, 40mmol in 40ml, starting at 10ml/hr, rate altered according to serum potassium level checked 2 hourly

Treatment: drugs: Sterile Potassium Chloride Concentrate
By intermittent infusion, 20mmol diluted in 100ml 0.9% NaCl, administered over 60 mins, serum potassium level checked 2 hourly, and repeat doses administered as appropriate

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients in critical care often require supplemental potassium chloride if levels in their
      blood are below acceptable level. Common practice is to administer a single dose of potassium
      chloride under controlled conditions via a drip, before checking if a further dose is
      required. The purpose of this study is to ensure that it is safe to administer potassium
      chloride continuously with the dose varied according to patient needs.</summary>
