Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Zoledronic Acid - 5 mg/100 ml administered via a peripheral intravenous site as a slow infusion over 15 minutes. The intravenous (i.v.) infusion was delivered via vented infusion line (to allow constant flow) and 20-22 gauge angiocatheter, and preceded and followed by a 10 ml normal saline flush of the intravenous line for a total volume infused of 120 ml once a year.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 100 ml Placebo administered via a peripheral intravenous site as a slow infusion over 15 minutes. The i.v. infusion was delivered via vented infusion line (to allow constant flow) and 20-22 gauge angiocatheter, and preceded and followed by a 10 ml normal saline flush of the intravenous line for a total volume infused of 120 ml once a year.


Treatment: drugs: Zoledronic acid 5 mg iv
Zoledronic acid 5 mg iv given once a year.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With at Least One New Morphometric Vertebral Fracture Over 24 Months - Vertebral fracture (VF) was assessed based on morphometry. QM(quantitative morphometry) incident VF(QM positive) is defined by at least 20% decrease in vertebral height of at least 4mm. If participant had QM positive at any vertebrae at any visit, x-rays from visits for participants were evaluated using Genant semi-quantitative method for VF assessment: Grade1 Mild VF is defined as 20-24% decrease in anterior, middle, and/or posterior vertebral height. Grade2 moderate VF is defined as 25-40% decrease in vertebral height. Grade3 Severe VF is defined as more than 40% decrease in vertebral height</outcome>

If participant had QM positive at any vertebrae at any visit, x-rays from visits for participants were evaluated using Genant semi-quantitative method for VF assessment: Grade1 Mild VF is defined as 20-24% decrease in anterior, middle, and/or posterior vertebral height.

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With at Least One New Moderate or Severe Morphometric Vertebral Fracture Over 12 Months - Moderate or severe vertebral fracture (VF) was assessed based on morphometry. A QM (quantitative morphometry) incident VF(QM positive) was defined by at least a 20% decrease in any vertebral height (at least 4 mm). If a participant had a QM positive at any vertebrae at any visit,x-rays from all visits for participants were evaluated using Genant semi-quantitative (SQ) method for VF assessment. Grade 2 moderate VF was defined as a 25-40% reduction in any vertebral height.Grade 3 Severe: VF was defined as more than 40% reduction in any vertebral height.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With at Least One New or Worsening Morphometric Vertebral Fracture Over 12 Months - Worsening vertebral fracture (VF) was assessed based on morphometry. QM (quantitative morphometry) incident VF(QM positive) was defined by at least a 20% decrease in any vertebral height (at least 4 mm). If a participant had a QM positive at any vertebrae at any visit, x-rays from all visits for participants were evaluated using Genant semi-quantitative (SQ) method for VF assessment. A worsening fracture was defined as an SQ reading that was greater than the baseline SQ reading, which was at least 1 (prevalent fracture)</outcome>
