  <interventions>
    <interventions>On each testing day, participants consume six identical capsules containing either an inert placebo, 320mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) (CDRI 08) Bacopa Monnieri (BM) extract or 640mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) (CDRI 08) BM extract or 960mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) (CDRI08) BM extract. The Bacopa treatment used will be standardized. Bacosides A and B must be present and account for at least 55% of the product. Each capsule contains 160 mg BM extract.

Each participant is required to attend a total of 5 sessions (1 practice visit and 4 study visits) that will be conducted one week apart to ensure sufficient washout between each acute condition. Total amount of testing days is 5 weeks (inclusive of practice visit).

There will be four separate testing days where either the placebo, 320 mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) or 640 mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) or 960 mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) will be taken exclusively each day.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo capsules will match the Bacopa ones in almost every way; except it will only contain flour. Otherwise, their colour, smell, weight and size will all be matched with the capsules used in the other study arm.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants responded to advertisements. After successfully completing a telephone screen, they completed a practice session where they were introduced to the computerised test, passed a brief medical test and informed consent was obtained. They were then given a numerical identification number and was randomly allocated to a treatment series. Participants then returned for 4 testing sessions, receiving a different treatment each visit. The person who determined if a participant was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the participant would be allocated. Allocation was concealed by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the current study is to replicate a recent study conducted in our centre (Benson et al., 2013) in order to confirm these results and to provide further data on the acute cognitive effects of an extract of Bacopa (KeenMind). The secondary objective of the study is to extend upon the study by Benson et al. (2013) by examining a wider range of doses to ascertain whether there is a dose-response relationship between KeenMind and cognition.

The study will be an acute, 4-arm, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Participants will attend 4 testing sessions (and 1 practice session) where they will complete cognitive, mood and stress assessments, prior to and 1, 2 and 4 hours post supplementation. 

The participant group will be healthy adults aged between 18-55yrs, who are able to commit to five visits to Swinburne University to attend testing sessions. Participants will not be taking any supplements or medications and have no current medical or psychiatric diagnosis.

Participants will orally consume each treatment one occasion, directly after a light meal. Each treatment will be administered after a 1 week wash out period. 
Treatment 1  Placebo 
Treatment 2  320mg KeenMind
Treatment 3  640mg KeenMind
Treatment 4  960mg KeenMind
