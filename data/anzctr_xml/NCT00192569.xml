    <summary>Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C (ATAHC)

      A prospective non-randomised dual arm longitudinal cohort of newly acquired hepatitis C
      infection into which participants will be enrolled and then followed at 3 monthly intervals
      over a 3 year period.

      All participants will be offered a 24 week course of pegylated interferon alfa 2a which will
      be commenced within 12 weeks of screening (patients coinfected with HIV will be offered 24
      weeks with pegylated interferon alfa 2a plus ribavirin).</summary>
