  <interventions>
    <interventions>The physiotherapy intervention will be delivered to participants in two consecutive 12 week phases. Phase I physiotherapy treatment (week 0-12), will consist of 6x 30 minute face to face physiotherapy sessions delivered fortnightly. Participants will also attend one 45 minute supervised gym session per week. Gym sessions will be semi-standardised and reflect the same program tailored to suit the individual within the face to face physiotherapy session and will be supervised by physiotherapists. 
Physiotherapy face to face treatment and gym sessions will consists of:
i) manual hip mobilisation and stretching based on the persons clinical presentation addressing any assessed range of movement deficits in hip, knee and spinal joints; 
ii) hip muscle retraining tailored according to any assessed strength deficits with progression based on achievement of repetition and resistance goals in a semi-standardised strength program 
iii) trunk muscle retraining in same semi-standardised program
iv) functional, proprioceptive and sports- or activity-specific retraining tailored to assessed sport or occupational loads within same semi-standardised program
v) enhancing physical activity via a semi-standardised, 12 phase cardiovascular fitness program with progression based on achievement of training goal within set parameters for perceived effort and pain 
vi) education will be individualised and could include topics including exercise, weight loss if appropriate and appropriate stretching.
The physiotherapist will supervise exercises during each face to face session for 15 minutes. The same exercise program will be performed independently at home two times per week for 30 minutes per session. An information and exercise manual will be provided to each participant as well as access to a mobile phone app which contains the home exercise program. Participants will be asked to record both the number of exercises completed and any associated symptoms for each exercise. They may record this in the app or in a paper, self-report diary if they prefer. Compliance with the home program will be reviewed at each visit, as well as use of medications and additional activity undertaken. 
Phase II physiotherapy treatment (week 13-24) consists of three 30min face to face treatment sessions (monthly) and continuation of the exercise program by attendance at a community gym three times per week., Face to face physiotherapy sessions will address any participant concerns regarding symptoms or their program and advise strength, functional and cardiovascular exercise progressions for the unsupervised gym sessions. </interventions>
    <comparator>In order to control for the psychosocial contact inherent with physiotherapy treatment, the control group will receive the same number and duration of face to face treatments and gym sessions as the group receiving the intervention of interest. Treatment will be delivered in the same two consecutive 12 week phases. 
In Phase I (week 0-12), the control participants' face to face treatment will also include manual therapy tailored to any assessed range of motion deficits in hip or spinal joints.
However they will receive a standardised cardiovascular training program with one progression based on achievement of training goals within parameters of perceived effort and pain. 
The control participants will receive the same individualised health education sessions covering topics such as exercise, diet, weight loss and appropriate stretching.
Control participants will not do any hip or trunk muscle retraining or strengthening nor any functional proprioceptive or sports/activity specific retraining. 
Control participants will instead do a standardised stretching program which may be minimally modified by exercise selected if they cause discomfort.
The control participants will also be provided with an exercise manual (of stretches only) and access to a mobile phone app with the stretch exercise program on it. Control participants will also be required to complete a home program consisting of stretches and cardiovascular fitness only and record compliance in the app or in a paper self-report diary. Compliance with the home program will be reviewed at each visit, as well as use of medications and additional activity undertaken. Control participants will attend 3 monthly face to face sessions with the physiotherapist in Phase II (week 13-24) and attend a community gym 3 times per week to continue their cardiovascular and stretching program.</comparator>

The project coordinator will screen interested people via telephone to determine their eligibility to participate using inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above. If the individual has clinical impingement but has no hip x-ray, an x-ray investigation will be organised locally and assessed online to determine eligibility. Informed consent will be sought. If consent is given, the participant will then undergo baseline testing.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcomes measured at 24 weeks will include Perceived global rating of change score, plus change in IHot33 outcomes for quality of life and symptoms sub-scales.
Outcomes will be analysed using linear mixed regression models, including their respective baseline scores as a covariate, subjects as a random effect, treatment condition as a fixed factor and the covariate by treatment interaction. Participant characteristics (e.g. gender, age) will be included as covariates. We aim to detect the minimum clinically important improvement on this outcome as reported by Kemp et al.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Femoroacetabular (hip) impingement (FAI) is a painful condition that commonly affects healthy active younger adults. It can limit their ability to continue playing sport and perform normal daily activities. It can be related to extra bone formation at the hip joint known as a cam deformity. Physiotherapy is one treatment people may use to reduce their symptoms and improve their function. This double-blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare the effects of two different physiotherapy treatment interventions to reduce pain and improve function in people with FAI. </summary>
