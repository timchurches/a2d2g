    <interventions>Web-based self help Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program- includes 4 modules. Participants complete 1 module per week prior to intern year, then revisit the web-site at 4 time points during intern year. Modules provide education about CBT and CBT tools to employ for the prevention of depression</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants assigned to the attention control group will receive an email from investigators at the same 5 contact points as the intervention group. Email will contain information about depression and places to receive mental health treatment.</comparator>

    <concealment>subjects were sent an email briefly describing the study. If interested, they clicked on a link within the study which brought them to the informed consent. If he/she consented, they were then linked to an online battery of questionnaires. All consenting subjects who completed the questionnaires were then randomly assigned by investigators to the intervention or experimental condition. Allocation was not concealed from investigators or participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The point prevalence of depression among medical trainees increases from 4% pre-internship to 26% during the intern year and very few physicians seek mental health treatment due to barriers-to-care unique to this population (Sen, 2010; Guille, 2010). The purpose of the study is to overcome key obstacles to care with an intervention aimed at reducing the high incidence of depression among medical interns. We hypothesize that interns randomly assigned to the intervention will be less likely, compared to those not assigned to the intervention, to become depressed over the course of intern year.</summary>
