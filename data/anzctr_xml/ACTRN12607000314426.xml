  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Influenza (the flu) causes a lot of sickness in the winter, and can sometimes cause death. It causes more sickness and death than any other infectious disease in Australia. Current flu control measures include the flu vaccine and antivirals. Although it is believed that other measures such as hand washing/drying and wearing masks and/or gloves help to slow down the spread of the flu virus and other respiratory viruses, experts dont know how effective face masks really are. This is important to know to protect people both during the annual flu season and in the case of pandemic influenza.
By doing this study, we want to find how well face masks stop the spread of flu and other respiratory virus infections. We also want to know if there is a difference between ordinary paper face masks (surgical masks) and special face masks called P2 masks, which are thought to be (but not proven to be) more protective than ordinary paper face masks. We will be studying this question in health care staff working in the emergency department and wards of a hospital. 
Health care workers have a bigger chance of coming in contact with children suffering respiratory infections and contracting a respiratory illness as a result. The study will allow the evaluation of the mask as a protective measure against respiratory illness.</summary>
