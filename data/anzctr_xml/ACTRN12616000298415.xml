Identical volume of 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) infiltrated subcutaneously by surgeons at wound edges prior to wound closure.

    <comparator>Local anaesthetic infiltration subcutaneously by surgeons involving injection of identical volume of ropivacaine 0.475% along wound edges prior to wound closure, and ultrasound-guided placebo nerve block with 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) 0.2ml/kg in the plane between pectoralis major and minor AND normal saline 0.25ml/kg in the plane deep to pectoralis minor by the anaesthetist prior to general anaesthesia, in addition to standardised general anaesthesia. Note that the placebo nerve block will be performed in the exact same way as the Pecs 2 block (in terms of approach and endpoint of drug delivery as viewed on ultrasound) with the only difference being the used of normal saline instead of ropivacaine. Adherence is ensured by Pecs 2 block being performed by anaesthetists trained in Pecs 2 block. Surgeons will be notified of the protocol for wound infiltration. </comparator>

    <concealment>Patients will be enrolled after written and verbal consent are obtained at least 1 day prior to surgery. Before study commencement, a computer-generated permuted block randomisation schedule will be generated. The randomisation schedule will be stratified according to mastectomy or surgery not involving mastectomy. Study medication will be prepared by the hospital pharmacy into identical syringes containing either 0.9% normal saline or 0.475% ropivacaine according to randomisation schedule with details stored in a register. The syringes will be sealed and labelled with the name of the project, the investigators name, patientâ€™s hospital identification number and consecutive numbers according to a computer-generated block randomisation. The patients will receive these study solutions as Pecs II block procedure and surgical infiltration. Both ropivacaine and saline are clear, colourless, non-viscous, odourless solutions and are identical in appearance. The syringes will be labelled 'For anaesthetist', 'For surgeon', to indicate allocation of drug according to group allocation. </concealment>

    <designfeatures>Patients in Pecs II group: will receive total of 0.45ml/kg 0.475% ropivacaine as injectate for the Pecs II block (0.2 ml/kg in the plane between pectoralis major and minor; 0.25ml/kg in the plane deep to pectoralis minor) performed by the anaesthetist prior to general anaesthesia under light sedation and identical volume of normal saline as injectate for surgical subcutaneous infiltration at the surgical site just before wound closure. Patients in the Local Infiltration group: will receive 0.45ml/kg normal saline as injectate for the placebo block (0.2 ml/kg in the plane between pectoralis major and minor; 0.25ml/kg in the plane deep to pectoralis minor) performed by the anaesthetist prior to general anaesthesia under light sedation and identical volume of 0.475% ropivacaine as injectate for surgical subcutaneous infiltration at the surgical site just before wound closure. Both groups of patients will be given a standardised general anaesthesia regime and robust multimodal analgesia regime. Quality of recovery will be assessed by Quality of Recovery 15 (QoR15) questionnaire at 24 hours post operatively. Brief Pain Inventory Questionnaire will be administered at 3 months.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measure of the study is the quality of recovery as measured by the QoR-15. Stark has reported a QoR-15 score of 118 (20), mean (SD) for minor surgery, with the standard deviation (SD) ranging between 20 - 23 for surgeries categorized as minor, intermediate and major (Stark PA et al). A difference between groups of 10 could be expected and is considered clinically significant. The study by Stark and colleagues included a range of surgical types into each category (minor, major), however we are studying a homogenous surgical population, therefore a reduced standard deviation of less than 15 is expected (personal communication with developer of QoR P Myles, March 2015). The sample size calculation was made using Stata IC 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and using a statistical power of 0.90 and a type 1 error estimate of 5% (2-tailed alpha value of 0.05), a clinically significant effect of 10 and a SD of 14 we calculate that 42 participants will be required in each group. To allow for attrition and variability in parameters used to estimate sample size, we will recruit an additional 20 participants therefore the total sample size will be 104. Group baseline characteristics will be examined for confounding factors. Normally distributed data will be presented as mean (SD) and will be analysed with the Student t test. Non-normally distributed continuous and ordinal data will be presented as median (10th  90th percentiles) and analysed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables will be presented as number (percentage) and analysed using the chi-square test. Normally distributed data. For comparison of the primary outcome we will calculate the median difference and its 95% confidence interval (CIs). All statistical analyses will be performed using Stata IC 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). For all analyses, a p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>OBJECTIVES: To compare patient quality of recovery following breast surgery in those who receive pectoral nerve (Pecs) II blockade versus local anaesthetic infiltration by surgeons.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, triple-masked, randomised controlled trial of 104 female, adult, non-pregnant participants with an allocation ratio of 1:1. This will be conducted at St Vincents Hospital Melbourne and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Recruitment of participants is planned from March 2016 to January 2018. Patients, investigators and all staff caring for patients and those making postoperative assessments will be blinded to group allocation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients will receive: a) Pecs II block and placebo surgical infiltration or b) Placebo Pecs II block and local anaesthetic surgical infiltration. Both will receive a standardised general anaesthetic and multimodal analgesia technique. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure will be patient quality of recovery (QoR) using the QoR-15 questionnaire at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes include assessment of pain related physical and functional interference using the Brief Pain Inventory three months post surgery and opioid consumption presented as oral morphine equivalent (OME) in the first 24 hour post-operative period.</summary>
