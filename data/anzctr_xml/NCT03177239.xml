  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of new treatments for
      kidney cancer called Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. The study is in two parts; in the first
      instance patients receive nivolumab alone. If this treatment is not effective patients may
      move onto the second part of the trial, where they receive nivolumab + ipilimumab. There is
      no placebo.

      The reason to offer one treatment alone, followed by two treatments together is that it is
      thought that the double treatment may have more side-effects, but also may be effective in
      people in whom the single first treatment (nivolumab alone) has not helped.

      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are experimental treatments. This means that they are not an
      approved treatment for non-clear cell kidney cancer in Australia.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of Nivolumab
      (also known as Opdivo or BMS-936558) and Ipilumumab (also known as MDX-010 or Yervoy).
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies (a type of human protein) that are being tested to
      see if they will allow the body's immune system to work against tumour cells. The immune
      system is the body's defence against cancer, bacteria and viruses. The effectiveness of
      nivolumab and ipilimumab in cancer of the kidney will be assessed by measuring the size of
      patient tumours via CT scans.

      Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been used alone or in combination in many other cancers, and
      are licenced for use in other cancers like advanced melanoma and bladder cancer in Australia.
      They have not been tested in people with non-clear cell kidney cancer.

      About 85 participants with non-clear cell kidney cancer are expected to participate in this
      study, from Australia and New Zealand.

      This research study has been initiated by Dr. Craig Gedye, is being conducted in
      collaboration with the Centre for Biostatistics and Clinical Trials (BaCT) and sponsored in
      Australia by the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate (ANZUP) Cancer Trials
      Group Pty Ltd. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) is supplying the study drugs and grant funding for
      this research.</summary>
