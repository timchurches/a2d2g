    <summary>To confirm the non-inferiority of 75 mg risedronate tablets taken on 2 consecutive days per
      month as compared to 5 mg risedronate tablets taken daily in increasing bone mass in lumbar
      spine in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

      To confirm the efficacy of 75 mg risedronate tablets taken on 2 consecutive days per month in
      postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in increasing bone mass in proximal femur, femoral
      neck and femoral trochanter and decreasing bone resorption.

      To confirm general safety of 75 mg risedronate tablets taken on 2 consecutive days per month
      as compared to 5 mg risedronate taken daily.</summary>
