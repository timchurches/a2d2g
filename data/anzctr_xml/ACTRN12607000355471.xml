  <interventions>
    <interventions>CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module is a computerised universal prevention program delivered as part of the Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) Syllabus for New South Wales. This intervention is based on a comprehensive social influence model. The CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module consists of a six lesson harm minimisation program aimed at decreasing alcohol misuse and related harms. Each of the lessons is broken into two components. The first is a 15-20 minute computer module. The second part involves the choice of one or more interactive class based activities which have been prepared in a program manual. The control schools received PDHPE classes as usual. The alcohol prevention programs delivered in the CONTROL schools were also social influence programs based on a harm minimisation approach. Effectively, the content of the prevention program was the same content as was delivered in the CONTROL schools. The main difference between the two interventions was the mode of delivery (computer delivered intervention coupled with interactive class activities).</interventions>

Schools were invited to participate in the condition to which they had been allocated as determined by a random allocation schedule. The condition to which schools were allocated was not concealed from the schools. However, students were not informed about the use of a CONTROL versus INTERVENTION to ensure this did not bias responding.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of an evidence-based computer-driven alcohol prevention program for year 8 of high school. Currently, evidence-based programs do exist, but are largely not implemented in schools due to implementation (e.g., limited resources and teacher training) and dissemination failure. The aim of developing CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module is to overcome such concerns by developing a computer-driven intervention which would have the advantage of providing complete, consistent and flexible delivery on every occasion, without demanding excess teachers time, resources and training. CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module would also have the potential advantage of being an interactive program which would allow high-risk populations, who often do not seek help, to seek help with relative anonymity and confidentiality.</summary>
