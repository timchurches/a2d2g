  <interventions>
    <interventions>8-weeks of individualized exercise rehabilitation.  Patients are to have two supervised sessions per week with an experienced and trained exercise physiologist of approximately 1-hour duration.  The program is tailored to the individual based on interaction between the exercise supervisor and expert practitioner overseeing the intervention following a physical assessment with the patient.  Home based exercises are recommended to be performed up to 3 times per week (monitored with a training diary).</interventions>
    <comparator>8-weeks of general exercise rehabilitation.  Patients are to have two supervised sessions per week with an experienced and trained exercise physiologist of approximately 1-hour duration.  The program is a set series of exercise, the same for all patients in this group, which are based on general recommendations for the type of exercise low back pain patients should perform.  Home based exercises are recommended to be performed up to 3 times per week (monitored with a training diary).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is thought that any type of exercise is sufficient for the treatment of chronic low back pain.  There is a paucity of evidence examining a rigorous individualization approach to exercise prescription for low back pain patients.  This study will compare changes in pain and disability between individualized or general exercise advice for patients with chronic low back pain.  The hypothesis of this research is that individualized programming will elicit greater reductions in pain and disability.  Data from this study will be used for power calculations in a larger scale trial that will explore the 'why' of observed results.</summary>
