  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthmatic airways narrow too easily, a characteristic called airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). To understand the cause of asthma we need to understand the cause of AHR. Thickened airway walls could amplify airway narrowing and increase AHR. However, thick airway walls are also stiff, and stiff walls could reduce narrowing and AHR. This projnect will examine the relationships between AHR and airway wall thickness and stiffness during and after treatment that reduces airway wall thickness. Airway wall thickness will be measured by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest. Airway stiffness will be measured using a simple breathing test. Measurements will be made at baseline and after six and twelve weeks of treatment. Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids over twelve weeks will be used to reduce airway inflammation and airway wall thickness. These drugs are recommended in all asthma management guidelines for the treatment of asthma, and will be used in standard, recommended doses.</summary>
