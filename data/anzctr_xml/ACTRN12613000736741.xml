  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a cognitive behavioural therapy administered in small groups (4-5 participants at a time). It consists of 10 weekly sessions with an 11th booster session 4 weeks after the 10th session. Each session will go for about an hour. The interventions are aimed at helping individuals with autism spectrum disorders identify negative emotional states and symptoms of depression and learn strategies to manage and potentially reduce their levels of depressive symptoms. During each session, participants will engage in a variety of tasks, including some that promote the identification of emotions, challenging negative thinking, and learning effective emotion regulation strategies.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be randomised into two groups, one group will participate in the intervention immediately, while the other will be a waitlist group. Those in the wait-list group will receive the program as soon as the intervention group finishes, which will be roughly two months following the initial session. </comparator>

    <concealment>Allocations are conducted after participants have been deemed eligible to participate in the study.  Allocations will be made by a random sequence generator on the computer.  As allocations made by the random sequence generator will be conducted after the participants have been deemed eligible to participate, this would mean allocation is not known when eligibility to participate is being evaluated.  Therefore, allocation would be concealed at the time of evaluating eligibility.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>For a power of 80% and a medium effect size, a sample of 32 participants per group were needed. To account for a potential 20% attrition, 40 participants per group were required. The planned analyses include: 
To evaluate the intervention:
3 (time) x 2 (group) mixed factorial ANOVA (for BDI, DASS, TAS-20, suppression, and reappraisal).
To evaluate predictors of intervention success:
Correlations between intervention success and baseline measures will be conducted (including performance on a cognitive battery and a theory of mind task).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of  a cognitive behavioural therapy in reducing depression in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. We hypothesise that there will be a significant reduction in mean depression scores post-intervention relative to baseline depression, and relative to the wait-list control. </summary>
