Intervention: The hamstring muscles of the treatment leg will be stretched for 1 minute per day for three weeks.  </interventions>

    <concealment>A concealed allocation schedule was used.  Allocation involved the supervising physiotherapist contacting the holder of the allocation schedule, who was located at an "off-site" centre.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether a three-week stretching program can increase hamstring muscle extensibility or improve tolerance to stretch in patients with persisting pain.  Our hypothesis is that stretching will not increase the extensibility of the hamstring muscles, but rather, will increase the subjects' tolerance to an uncomfortable stretch sensation.</summary>
