  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Evidence of signed and dated informed consent/assent document(s) indicating that the
             subject (and/or his parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent aspects
             of the trial.

             Note: If the study candidate is considered a child under local regulation, a parent or
             legal guardian must provide written consent prior to initiation of study screening
             procedures and the study candidate may be required to provide written assent. The
             rules of the responsible Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee
             (IRB/IEC) regarding whether one or both parents must provide consent and the
             appropriate ages for obtaining consent and assent from the subject should be followed.

          2. History of exposure to ataluren in a prior PTC study in nmDBMD . Note: Patients are
             considered eligible only if they received ataluren during their participation in one
             or more prior PTC-sponsored studies of ataluren in nmDBMD. Note: Subjects who have
             participated in a prior or ongoing PTC study with ataluren in nmDBMD at a trial site
             in the US or Canada, but reside outside of the US and Canada, may be eligible for this
             study (with the approval of the PTC Therapeutics Medical Monitor).

          3. Male sex.

          4. In patients who are sexually active, willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or
             employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during ataluren administration and
             the 6-week follow-up period.

          5. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
             study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions. Note: Psychological,
             social, familial, or geographical factors that might preclude adequate study
             participation should be considered.</inclusivecriteria>

               2. Systemic aminoglycoside therapy

          5. Ongoing uncontrolled medical/surgical condition, ECG findings, or laboratory
             abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of
             the patient or make it unlikely that follow-up would be completed.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is
      caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining
      normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads
      to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type
      of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in
      approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
      investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.
      This study comprises a Phase 3, open-label study of ataluren in patients with nmDBMD who
      previously received ataluren at an investigator site in a prior PTC-sponsored clinical study.
      A separate open-label study (PTC124-GD-016-DMD) is being conducted for nmDBMD patients who
      previously received ataluren at an investigator site in the United States (US).</summary>
