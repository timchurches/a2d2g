  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Home oxygen therapy is considered an appropriate and relatively safe option for children with
      chronic respiratory problems such as chronic lung disease of prematurity, but the use of home
      oxygen therapy for children with acute respiratory problems is limited. With the recent
      establishment of a "Hospital in The Home" (HiTH) program at our institution, we sought to
      determine the safety, parental satisfaction and economic advantage of home oxygen therapy for
      children with acute bronchiolitis compared with traditional inpatient hospitalization.</summary>
