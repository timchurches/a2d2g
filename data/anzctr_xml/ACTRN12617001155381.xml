  <interventions>
    <interventions>A double blind two arm 12-month randomised controlled trial comparing usual care to a modified hearing aid fitting.  The modified hearing aid fitting "CogniAid" settings:.  The intervention group will receive processing with minimised signal distortion consisting of linear-slow processing (e.g. linear input-output processing, output limiting compression, non-adaptive manually selected directional microphone, moderate slow-acting noise reduction with manual program switching.  The participant and clinician will decide the brand, model and technology level best suited on the basis of a hearing needs assessment.  The aids will be programmed and matched to NAL-R linear hearing aid targets.  If acoustic feedback occurs the ear-coupling system used (domes, ear moulds) will be modified for tighter acoustic seal before digital feedback methods are employed.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive current best practice hearing aid selection and fitting.  The participant and clinician will decide the brand, model and technology level best suited on the basis of a hearing needs assessment.  The selected aids Digital Signal processing (DSP) will emphasise audibility of sound using WDRC and signal cleaning to remove noise using fast-adaptive processing.  The hearing aids will be programmed to the NAL-NL2 prescription procedure.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be the NIH toolbox age-adjusted composite cognitive score .  These measures will be obtained using the iPad based NIH APP.

      <timepoint>Continuous measurement for 12 months, the hearing aids record useage as hours or minutes, depending on model.  The measure is continuous, hours of use will be recorded at 6 and 12 months.</timepoint>

Persons with severe-profound hearing loss sufficient to make auditory cognition test materials inaudible will not be included.

    <sequence>The randomization will be blocked and stratified to ensure ethnicity and age-adjusted cognition score are balanced in the two groups. The randomization lists will be created using SAS 9.4.   Protocols will ensure adherence to allocation concealment.

    <statisticalmethods>Details of the individuals hearing loss, hearing aids and datalogging with participant details will be entered into NOAH databases (https://www.himsa.com/) at the participating clinics. The NIH toolbox generates a spreadsheet of data for each test undertaken.  This data will be duplicated and along with other test results and observations will be securely imported into an MS Excel database at the department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Auckland. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC).  Data analyses will be specified a priori in a statistical analysis plan prepared by the study statistician.  The primary hypothesis of a difference in NIH toolbox age adjusted composite cognitive score at 12 months post randomization between the intervention and control group will be analysed using a general linear mixed model with age adjusted composite cognitive score as the continuous outcome and ethnicity, centre, baseline cognition score, hearing and group as explanatory variables. The intention-to-treat principle will be applied for all those completing 12 month follow up. Other outcomes will be tested by using nonparametric techniques, logistic regression, linear regression, or generalized linear mixed model, depending on the distribution of the variable. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Untreated hearing loss speeds up age-related decline in our ability to process &amp; understand information. Hearing aids may slow or halt this decline. Some technology used in hearing aids requires fast thinking that can be impaired with age. We will undertake a trial comparing standard hearing aid settings to those that have been set for slower processing of sound. In a case of less is more when our own processing of information becomes slower hearing aid processing also needs to slow down.</summary>
