  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish pairwise pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity between BAT1706, EU Avastin and US-Avastin after a single intravenous (IV) infusion in healthy male subjects.
The primary PK parameters will consist of:
Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for analysis of serum concentrations of the study drugs will be collected at the following specified times to perform a comparison of PK similarity.

Pre infusion - 0 hour or within 1 hour prior to the start of the infusion.
Mid infusion -  at 45 minutes - relative to the start of infusion.
End of infusion - 1 hour, 2 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours from the end of infusion, and 24 hours (Day 2), 48 hours (Day 3), 96 hours (day 5), 168 hours (day 8), 240 hours (Day 11), 336 hours (Day 15), 504 hours (day 22), 672 hours (Day 29), 840 hours (Day 36), 1008 hours (Day 43), 1344 hours (Day 57), 1680 hours (Day 71), 2016 hours (Day85) and 2352 hours (Day 99) post start of infusion.


 </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAT1706 in healthy male subjects.

The expected adverse reactions for this study are asthenia, headache, nausea, or low grade fever, gastro-intestinal symptoms and increased blood pressure. The exclusion criteria has been selected to preclude the inclusion of subjects with a predictable predisposition to any of these conditions. It is expected that the dose will be well tolerated. 
The subjects will be dosed in a sequential manner, 3, subjects then 6 subjects and then 9 subjects and for each subject enrolled, prolonged clinical and laboratory surveillance will take place.</outcome>
      <timepoint>  The following assessments will be reviewed:
Vital Signs: Pre Dose, 30 mins and 60 mins post start of infusion. 15 mins, 30 mins,1 hour, 2 hour, 4 hour, 5 hour, 6 hour, 8 hour and 12 hour post end of infusion, Day 2 and Day 3, Day 5, Day 8, Day 11, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Day 36, Day 43, Day 57, Day 71, Day 85 and Day 99.
Full Physical Examination: screening, Day -1, day 3, day 15, Day 99.
Infusion site check: day 1
If clinically indicated a physical examination will be conducted at  Day 29, Day 43, Day57 and Day 71.
ECG: screening, Day -1, Pre Dose 45 mins, 1 hour post start of infusion, 4 hour and 12 hours post end of infusion, Day 5, Day 15, Day 43 and Day 99.
Adverse Events will be collected at each and every visit throughout the trial
Clinical Laboratory Tests: Screening, Day -1, Day 3, Day 5, Day 15, Day 43, Day 71 and Day 99.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the immunogenicity of BAT1706, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin after a single IV infusion in healthy male subjects.

Immunogenicity will be assessed by means of the occurrence of ADA, ADA titres, and the occurrence of neutralising antibodies.
ADA positive samples with be analysed  anti-bevacizumab antibodies.
Serum will also be tested for anti-VEGF antibodies.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood Samples taken at screening, Day 1, Day 15, Day 43, Day 71 and Day 99 will be assessed.
After the End-of-Study visit, subjects who are confirmed positive for anti-bevacizumab antibodies will be followed for 12 months after study drug administration.
Blood Sampling will be collected at 6, 9, and 12 months after study drug administration or until 2 consecutive samples have been negative for ADA, whichever comes first. 
At screening subjects will also be tested for anti-VEGF antibodies.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To further characterize the PK of BAT1706, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin after a single IV infusion in healthy male subjects.

The secondary PK parameters will consist of:
Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0-t); 
Maximum measured concentration (Cmax). 
Time to maximum measured concentration (tmax); 
Terminal half-life (tÂ½); 

These outcomes will be assessed using serum samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for analysis of serum concentrations of the study drugs will be collected at the following specified times:.

Pre infusion - 0 hour or within 1 hour prior to the start of the infusion.
Mid infusion -  at 45 minutes - relative to the start of infusion.
End of infusion - 1 hour, 2 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours from the end of infusion, and 24 hours (Day 2), 48 hours (Day 3), 96 hours (day 5), 168 hours (day 8), 240 hours (Day 11), 336 hours (Day 15), 504 hours (day 22), 672 hours (Day 29), 840 hours (Day 36), 1008 hours (Day 43), 1344 hours (Day 57), 1680 hours (Day 71), 2016 hours (Day85) and 2352 hours (Day 99) post start of infusion.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Avastin (Registered Trademark) is currently used in many countries for the treatment of certain cancers.
The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the similarities in the manner in which a new drug, BAT1706 is distributed around the body compared with European approved and USA licensed Avastin. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a healthy male adult from 18 to 50 years of age with a BMI of 19.0 to 29.0 kg/m2 and body weight of 65 to 100kg. Participants enrolled in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either the new BAT1706 drug, USA licensed Avastin or European approved Avastin. All participants will receive a single dose which is adjusted for their weight. Participants will have a number of blood samples taken until Day 99 after the dose and will be monitored for side effects for 99 Days. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide information regarding the similarity of drug distribution and safety of the new drug BAT1706 compared to currently used Avastin for the treatment of certain types of cancer.</summary>
