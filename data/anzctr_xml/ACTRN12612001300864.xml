  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each patient will be randomised on the first night of study to receive treatment with either 1-3% carbon dioxide or air. At the start of the night, the starting condition is that the patient will breathe from a circuit delivering air via a Douglas bag. The circuit will contain a 4-way Hans-Rudolph valve so that the patient can be switched rapidly to the test gas as desired. Once the first apnea is evident from the patient's ventilatory airflow signal, and from mask pressure and abdominal and chest respibands, the valve will be switched to a circuit delivering the test gas via another Douglas bag. The test gas will be continued for 10 minutes before the valve will be used to switch the patient back to the air supply. On the appearance of another apnea the valve will be used to switch the patient to the test gas for a further 10 minutes. This process will be repeated for the entire study night. 
One week or more following the first arm of the study, the patient will enter the second arm in which the alternate test gas will be applied for 10 minutes once an apnea is observed.  Patients will be studied as soon as practicable following the on e week washout period with a maximum of four weeks between studies.</interventions>
    <comparator>The patient will breathe air as the standard inspired gas throughout the study, but will switch to the intervention ( 1-3% carbon dioxide or air) whenever an apnoea is observed. The intervention will then continue for periods of 10 minutes, followed by a return to air until the next apnea is observed when once again the intervention gas will be switched on. The exposure to the intervention will depend upon the frequency of apnea during the night.

Any questions they have about the study will be answered.

Allocation will be concealed from the patient and those analysing the data.  It will not be concealed from those performing the randomisation who will also implement the selected intervention on the night of the studies. Administration of air versus carbon dioxide will be performed from an adjoining room with the patient unaware of the provided gas.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As many as half of all patients with heart failure exhibit Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR), a form of disordered breathing in which short periods (approx 30 sec) of regular breathing alternate with periods during which breathing stops (apnea). Patients with heart failure and CSR have a markedly poorer outcome compared to heart failure patients whose breathing is normal during sleep. While the reasons for the differential outcome are not fully known, it is likely that the direct consequences of CSR, which include increased sympathetic activity and frequent declines in blood oxygen level, contribute to impairment of cardiac function. When effective treatment causes CSR to revert to a continuous breathing pattern, the available evidence shows that patient condition and survival improve. However, the current front-line therapy, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ameliorates CSR in only 50% of heart failure patients. We plan to use a novel loop gain theory developed in our laboratory that enables us to calculate a precise level of inspired CO2 for each patient that will convert CSR into a continuous pattern. 

The work planned in this program will employ a manual method to deliver an optimised CO2 treatment for each patient during the night whenever the patient begins to exhibit CSR. In order to carry out our study, we will recruit patients with heart failure and suspected CSR for overnight sleep studies which involve measurement of respiratory, cardiovascular and sleep variables. Based upon our studies over the past two years in such patients, carried out at the Alfred and Monash Medical Centre, CO2 treatment will restore continuous breathing in all patients. In the current study we will determine how termination of CSR affects patients in terms of respiratory and cardiovascular function, as well as sleep architecture and quality (duration of sleep and time in its various stages). We anticipate that our proposed study will show that restricting the time a patient spends breathing with a periodic pattern while asleep will provide an acute benefit and justify a major program of device development to translate our technique into a home-based device for overnight patient use. Success in our program has the potential to benefit many of the approximately 25 million people world-wide with congestive heart failure, a condition that remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the western world and now constitutes the leading cause of hospitalisation in developed countries.</summary>
