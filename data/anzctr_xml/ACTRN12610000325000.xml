  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study we will continue to follow participants recruited to " A longitudinal study of caries prevention in children aged two to four years" HREC/09/QPAH/158, ACTRN12609000330246 who have undergone preventative methods of education, home visits and toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste, 0.2% chlorhexideine gel and CPP-ACP Tooth Mousse.  

The effectiveness of these strategies will be assessed through 
-microbial analysis for the presence of decay causing bacteria
- clinical dental examination data
- statistical analysis of data for case and control groups</summary>
