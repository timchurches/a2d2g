    <interventions>This project will establish the first web-based, multi-site Australasian Oncofertility Registry (AOFR) collecting data from cancer and fertility specialists. Outcomes generated from the study will provide meaningful translational data regarding uptake and utilisation of fertility preservation, future use and complications of assisted reproductive technologies as well as the potential for infertility following treatment for cancer survivors. The data from the registry and patient Medicare records will be used to perform a cost modeling health economics study.
The research study will be undertaken under five broad and interlinked themes. These themes include:
Themes 1: Awareness and referral for fertility preservation
Theme 2: Strategies, uptake, complications and quality of fertility preservation in cancer patients
Theme 3: Reproductive health following cancer treatment
Theme 4: Family planning and use of assisted reproductive technologies with pregnancy and birth outcomes
Theme 5: Health service utilisation and cost of fertility preservation programs for cancer patients in Australasia
Patients will be followed for a 20 year period to ensure that data on theme 3 and 4 can be captured.
Cancer survivors patients will be asked to consent to the research team collecting follow up data on patients fertility potential. For male patients this includes blood tests and semen analysis in year 1, 3 and 5 after cancer treatment. For female patients this includes blood tests and an ultrasound scan looking at follicle count annually.

Cancer patients that will be enrolled retrospectively from the previous two years - calendar years 2014-2016. Patient  Medical Records will be accessed to undertake a retrospective review of eligible patient demographics, cancer details, treatment protocol, blood tests and scan results. </interventions>

      <outcome>Themes 1: Awareness and referral for fertility preservation

The outcome is assessed directly by data in the AOFR by descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations, medians and inter quartile ranges for the variables and frequency distrubutions will be used to describe characteristics associated with a patients diagosis and referral for FP.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data for this outcome will be captured at diagnosis. Data will be collected prospectively at diagnosis for all patients as well as patients that were unable to be captured prospectively at the time of diagnosis, the FUTuRE Fertility research group have decided to retrospectively go back two years to capture patients onto the Registry. This will enable the research team to capture greater numbers of patients diagnosed with cancer, accessing fertility preservation, onto the Registry.
The outcome is assessed by descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations, medians and inter quartile ranges for the variables and frequency distributions will be used to describe characteristics associated with a patients diagnosis and referral for FP. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Theme 2: Fertility preservation uptake

The outcome is assessed directly by data in the AOFR:
Semi-parametric regression will be used to assess the trends in uptkae of FP and stratified by age and gender. Univariable and multivariable logist regression models will be used to determine the independent predictors of the prevalence for fertility preservation over time throughout Australia. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Data for this outcome will be captured prospectively at a number of time points: 1. Diagnosis prior to treatment 2. Following cancer diagnosis in the first 5 years 3. At diagnosis of relapse prior to treatment 4. Following cancer treatment in the first 5 years. 
Data will be collected prospectively at diagnosis for all patients 
For cancer patient's enrolled retrospectively onto the Registry, their Medical Record will be accessed. Eligible patients to be enrolled retrospectively will be two years from date of diagnosis.
The outcome is assessed by: Semi-parametric regression will be used to assess the trends in uptake of FP and stratified by age and gender.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Theme 3: Reproductive health following cancer treatment

The outcome is assessed directly by data in the AOFR:
Kaplain Meir survival analysis and Cox proportional regression models will be used to identify the factors associated with the time to return to normal reproductive function. 


</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data for this outcome will be captured annually from the end of treatment for the next 5 years.

      <outcome>Theme 4: Family planning and use of assisted reproductive technologies after cancer diagnosis

Method of assessment - Data collected on the registry ( natural or ART pregnancy, complication rates during ART, pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes).

The data is collected prospectively by the clinical team completing the registry form for a patient online or paper record. Patients consent to notes being reviewed for the purpose of ensuring a complete data set is collected and the notes will be reviewed if necessary by CRA staff.</outcome>

New novel statistical techniques such as semi-parametric regression will be used to assess the trends in uptake of fertility preservation (after a cancer diagnosis) over the years which will be stratified by age and gender. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models will be used to determine the independent predictors of the prevalence for fertility preservation and over the years in Australia. 

Kaplan Meir survival analysis and Cox proportional regression models will be used to identify the factors associated with time to return to normal reproductive function. Health economic strategies will be evaluated using a Markov decision model to conduct and compare the costs of FP strategies for cancer survivors

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will establish the first web-based, multi-site Australasian Oncofertility Registry (AOFR) collecting data from cancer and fertility specialists. This study is for cancer patients who are diagnosed with cancer who are aged under 45 years old.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 13 years or above and have been diagnosed with cancer or aged 0-12 years diagnosed with cancer who have been referred for fertility preservation only.

Study Details
This study will collect data regarding uptake and utilisation of fertility preservation, future use and complications of assisted reproductive technologies as well as the potential for infertility following treatment for cancer survivors will be collected. Patients will be asked to consent to the research team collecting the results of fertility tests following cancer treatment. In males (semen analysis and fertility hormone blood tests in years 1,3,5). In females fertility hormone blood tests and ultrasound scans looking at the number of follicles in the ovaries.

The research study will be undertaken under five broad and interlinked themes. These themes include: Themes 1: Awareness and referral for fertility preservation Theme 2: Strategies, uptake, complications and quality of fertility preservation in cancer patients Theme 3: Reproductive health following cancer treatment Theme 4: Family planning and use of assisted reproductive technologies with pregnancy and birth outcomes 
The data from the registry and patient Medicare records will be used to perform a cost modeling health economics study for theme. 
Patients who consent to being part of the AOFR study wil be asked to supply data at diagnosis, end of treatment and then annually for 20 years. 

Eligible patients or their parents/guardians/carers on behalf of the patient no longer being treated for their cancer at their cancer centre will be contacted retrospectively (2 years retrospectively from diagnosis) by the International FUTuRE Fertility Research Manager to explain the study and to determine whether eligible patients or parent/guardian/carer on behalf of their child would be interested in having their/their child's details stored on the registry. If a patient or parent/carer/guardian on behalf of the patient, is interested in having their/their child's Medical records reviewed in order to ascertain personal, cancer and fertility history then an information pack will be sent out to the patient/patient's family. The information pack will include study information details and patient consent forms.</summary>
