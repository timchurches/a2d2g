  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mixed meal tolerance test: A high carbohydrate (60g) and fat (20g) meal. Test food will be delivered in both a liquid drink and typical breakfast food. Blood samples (10ml) will be taken from a cannula pre meal and every 15-30 minutes for 2 hours, For the whole day the total volume of blood taken will be 250 ml, this is less than 1 cup and half the volume of a blood donation. This will occur at the clinic rooms at The University of Auckland and administered by the PI. 

 We will also collect respiratory samples and body composition measures prior to this meal. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fat rather than body weight is the greatest risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Body mass index (BMI: calculated by height divided by weight squared) is often used as a measure of body fat. However, in some people it does not accurately reflect the amount of fat. This is interesting because it has recently been found that people with a small change (variant) in a gene called CREBRF have a higher BMI, but a LOWER risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this study we are investigating whether people with a CREBRF gene variant have different lean (muscle) or fat mass, and we are trying to understand how this gene variant lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes</summary>
