    <interventions>Role of Exenatide injection in acute ischemic stroke. Exenatide injection will be administered in dose of 5 mcg twice daily subcutaneously to selected acute stroke patients within 12 hours of symptom onset. The drug will administered for the duration of in-hospital admission with a minimum period of 5 days and maximum period of 2 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in the levels of inflammatory/endothelial cell markes in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with Exenatide. C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-18, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TMF) alpha, Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) 9, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI) - 1 and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) will be assayed using ELISA technique from plasma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and at 1,3,5,7 and 14 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glycemic control in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving Exenatide. This will be done by measuring blood glucose levels at baseline and twice daily. Blood glucose level will be assessed by finger prick technique using a calibrated glucometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Twice every day during hospital admission</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of side effects, especially hypoglycemia, nause or vomiting. Hypoglycemia will be diagnosed by twice daily blood glucose estimations. Any symptoms which could be potentially related to hypoglycemia will be investigated by immediate blood glucose estimation in addition to the twice daily tests.  Nausea and vomiting will be assessed as mild, moderate or severe according to the level of patient distress by clinical judgement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During hospital admission</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exenatide which is a drug approved for use in Type 2 Diabetes has been shown in animal experimental models of stroke to have neuroprotective effect. Elevated blood glucose level during stroke has been shown to be a cause of bad outcome and this can be seen even in non-diabetic patients as a stress response to stroke. . Exenatide, when administered to stroke patients may control blood glucose levels effectively and reduce insulin resistance, which may help in reducing cerebral inflammation after stroke. On this background we have designed this initial pilot study of Exenatide use in 10 patients with acute ischemic stroke to see the changes in inflammatory level markers and also to look at the safety and feasibility issues before a larger randomized controlled trial can be conducted.</summary>
