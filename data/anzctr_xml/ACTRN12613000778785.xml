  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two study visits will occur from 12 months up to 3 years depending on the timing of the initial visit. At each visit clinical data will be recorded including: current symptoms, physical examination, weight, height, concomitant medications, spirometry, induced sputum collection and urine for matrix breakdown products and biomarkers of neutrophilic inflammation. Blood is collected routinely for review tests and will be collected and stored for inflammatory mediators. Health Related Quality of Life questionnaires and other standard measures of psychosocial health are completed and a bone density test (a DEXA), and a low dose chest CT scan will be done at the start and end of the study (again this is depending on the timing of the initial visit). </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Repeated measures of the FEV1 best annual values as SD-scores (z-scores) over the study duration using a calibrated spirometer. These data will have been collected at each clinic visit attended by the patient. </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CT scan scores. A low dose spirometer-controlled inspiratory and expiratory volumetric chest CT scans using a standard protocol will be performed without contrast at the start of the study and in the final year. </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Association between the measures of Quality of Life and psychosocial functioning. The tests used are CFQ-R for parents and children and LSAC,  . Parent social demographics, functioning and mental health (Brief COPE) will be done along with the Family Stress Scale. This is a composite primary outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to further improve outcomes in CF by developing a better understanding of the reasons for the decline in health status and lung function during adolescence, which is one of the key challenges facing clinicians. 
We hope to do this by looking at such things as the
1) pathology involved in CF lung disease, 2) long term risks of emerging organisms, 3)potential effects of early therapeutic interventions, such as P. aeruginosa eradication, 4) metagenomic profile identifying bacteria in respiratory samples, 5) psychosocial factors, and 6) relationship between early life events and outcomes between 9 - 17 years of age.</summary>
