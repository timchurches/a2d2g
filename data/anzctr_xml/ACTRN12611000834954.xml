  <interventions>
    <interventions>1 group: the standard home care program plus a 6 month
telemonitoring program and plus 6 month tele-education program; Telemonitoring involves: self blood pressure measurement and body wheight monitoring every day on routine basis, using GSM service; Tele-education program involves training on webbased education platform on individual risk  factors and its control;  Patients on tele-education have to complete 1 hour basic education program "SALUDA" and every 3 week period will receive educational messages on individual risk factors. Telemonitoring and tele-education programs are delivered simultaneously at the same time.

2 group: the standard home care program plus plus 6 month teleeducation program. Teleeducation program involves training on webbased education platform on individual risk  factors control.</interventions>
    <comparator>only standard home care. Patients on standard care will receive usual care provided by the hospitals, it means that patients receive 15 min consultation and reading material before leaving the hospital and next scheduled visit to the physician.
