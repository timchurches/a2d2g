  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single and multiple doses of LJPC-401 delivered subcutaneously by site staff. Planned ascending-dose cohorts at 4 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg per dose in single-dose cohorts. Planned ascending-dose cohorts at 2 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg per dose administered twice weekly for two weeks in multiple-dose cohorts (Days 1, 4, 8 and 11). A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised of the Principal Investigator (PI), the Sponsors medical representatives, and other site, sponsor, and contract research organization representatives, as applicable, to include at least one independent member, will meet prior to the start of each of the multiple-dose cohorts to review all treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and to make study-related decisions (i.e. escalation, dose level, etc.).  The DMC will meet after the last subject in the single-dose cohorts has completed their Day 8 visit.  The proposed doses have been tested in two previous clinical studies and are below the maximum tested dose of 30 mg. The DMC will also make study decisions regarding stopping, interrupting subject recruitment, or expanding enrollment in the study or cohort based upon review of the study data.</interventions>
