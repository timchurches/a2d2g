  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of children with resolution of the respiratory exacerbation (defined by return to baseline state of signs and symptoms). Baseline stat is determined by physician assessment of cough, sputum color and chest sounds at time of enrolment into study protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>21 days after initiation of treatment (Azithromycin OR Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Detectable difference in PC-QOL (Parent Cough-specific Quality of Life) measurement (minimum important difference between groups =0.9). This is a validated quality of life measure specific to paediatric cough, completed by the parent.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 21</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of exacerbation symptoms (symptoms of exacerbation are considered increased or changed quality of cough, increased sputum production or change in patient's normal sputum colour or purulence). This outcome is assessed by parental reporting of exacerbation symptoms (cough) and physician clinical review.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured from onset of symptoms of respiratory exacerbation until resolution of symptoms (return to baseline state, see primary outcome above).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Requirement for hospitalisation for respiratory exacerbations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at time of hospitalisation (if applicable) or resolution of symptoms. This outcome is measured from onset of exacerbation symptoms until resolution of exacerbation symptoms. Overall monitoring of exacerbation symptoms and requirement for hospitalisation is measured from enrolment for up to 18 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Detectable difference in serum laboratory assays: CRP, serum amyloid a, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10 (this outcome is only assessed where possible, i.e. not in all participants).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, and onset and resolution of respiratory exacerbations. Total duration of outcome assessment is from enrolment for up to 18 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence and prevalence of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens and antibioic (penicillin and macrolide) resistance of pathogens, on nasal swabs and sputum samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, onset and resolution of exacerbations (sputum); measured at baseline, onset, middle and end of exacerbations (nasal swabs). Total duration of outcome assessment is from enrolment for up to 18 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Aged less than 18 years.

Severe (hypoxic, dyspnoea or hospitalisation required) or recent exacerbation (in the last 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. Known hypersensitivity to macrolides or penicillins.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our national study aims to improve the management of bronchiectasis in children, a lung condition that is common in Indigenous people worldwide, and also occurs in non-Indigenous people. This study aims to discover whether treating respiratory exacerbations with one of two different oral antibiotics is more effective at resolving the exacerbation. The results of this study will impact on national and international guidelines and substantially advance knowledge on exacerbations of childhood bronchiectasis.</summary>
