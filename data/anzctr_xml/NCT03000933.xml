  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine HPV types - The primary outcome of interest will be the prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine types (6, 11, 16 and 18) among 16-20 year old MSM and comparison of these with non-quadrivalent vaccine HPV types which would be expected to remain high unless there is significant cross protection. Oral, penile, and anal HPV prevalence will be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Persistent HPV infection - Detection of same HPV type at the same site at both visits (day 0 and 7). The objective of repeat sampling at day 7 is to investigate whether this might distinguish transient HPV detection from infection. A brief questionnaire will be self-completed by participants at day 7 to ascertain whether there has been any sexual re-exposure between day 0 and 7 that might explain repeat HPV positivity at day 7.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7</timepoint>
