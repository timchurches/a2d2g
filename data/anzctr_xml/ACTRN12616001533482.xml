    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (40/320 mg) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria. Doses will be administered as 4 mg/kg dihydroartemisinin and 18 mg/kg piperaquine once a day for 3 days. The treatment will be given in tablets by oral. Eligible subjects will be treated for three days and followed up for 42 days. All treatments will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: the treatment failure rate to DHP in the area is assumed to be 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included in each arm in each site. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 42-day follow-up period, a total of 88 patients per arm (P. falciparum and P. vivax study) should be included in the study per site. 

Analysis of data
The WHO excel software programs and SPSS for windows will be used for data management and analysis. The data will be double entered and . Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 42, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 42, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.
7.	the proportion of patients with asexual parasitaemia on day 3

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in 2 sentinel sites in Indonesia.
Purpose: To assess the efficacy of the current first treatment policy
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria infections.
Study Sites: Papua Province and Bengkulu Province.
Study Period: December 2016 to November 2017.
Study Design: One arm prospective study. 
Patient population: Febrile patients aged between one year to 65 years old, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum or P. vivax infection. Young female of child bearing age (between 12-17 years) will be excluded due to culturally sensitive reasons.
Sample Size: A total of 120 patients (60 with P. falciparum and 60 with P. vivax malaria) will be enrolled in each site.
Treatment(s) and follow-up: DHA-PIP (containing 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine) tablets will be administered once a day for 3 days, administered as a weight per dose regimen of 2.25 and 18 mg/kg of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy.
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Secondary endpoints: The frequency and nature of adverse events.
Optional exploratory endpoints: 
1. to determine the polymorphism of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13).
2. to determine the blood concentration of piperaquine.
