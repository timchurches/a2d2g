  <interventions>
    <interventions>A double-balloon catheter for cervical ripening (COOK CRB) is used the first day (for a maximum of 12 hours) before inducing labor with misoprostol the second day.

Each participating hospital uses its own misoprostol regime.

e.g. the regime of the primary study unit:
First day: CRB (for a maximum of 12 hours)
Second day: OM 50 microg with repeat doses 4 and 8 hours later if necessary
Third day: OM 100 microg with repeat doses 4 and 8 hours later if necessary
Fourth day: misoprostol 100 microg vaginally with repeat doses 4 and 8 hours later if necessary</interventions>
    <comparator>Only the misoprostol regime. e.g. the regime of the primary study unit: First day: OM 50 microg with repeat doses 4 and 8 hours later if necessary Second day: OM 100 microg with repeat doses 4 and 8 hours later if necessary Third day: misoprostol 100 microg vaginally with repeat doses 4 and 8 hours later if necessary</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Induction of labor is a common obstetric procedure that is being more widely used nowadays than ever before. Pharmacologic and mechanical methods are used to induce labor. As there are different modes of action, a reduced induction-to-delivery time can be expected if mechanical and pharmacologic methods are used consecutively. 
The hypothesis is that mechanical dilation (CRB - a double balloon device) before pharmacological induction (oral misoprostol) improve the efficacy of labor induction. 
This hypothesis supposed to be checked in a multicenter trial with different misoprostol regimes.</summary>
