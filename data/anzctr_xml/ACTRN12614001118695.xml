  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Distal radius fracture (wrist fracture) is a common an injury and accounts for approximately 1/3rd of wall wrist injuries. These type of fractures can managed in several ways and are determined by several factors. In fractures that have not displaced or are stable once they have been set they usually do not require an operation and are kept in position by the use of an external plaster. This current method of keeping the fracture well positioned often delivers acceptable results. However, plaster can be inconvenient to the patient. Patients find it cumbersome, they often report problems like, itching, difficult to maintain hygiene, inability to use the limb. It often needs regular changing of plaster during course of treatment. The adjustable external splint (Zero-Cast) was designed to have similar clinical functionality as traditional plaster cast, however aimed to reduce the problems reported by traditional plaster immobilization. 
This research has been designed to assess whether the splint can maintain adequate fracture position and be more comfortable and manageable both for the patient and the Doctor/Technician managing the fracture.
