    <interventions>Sleep Restriction Therapy for Insomnia Disorder -
Initially, the first treatment session (one hour face to face with researcher at the Woolcock Institute) involves a managed reduction of time in bed in line with the average subjective total sleep time derived from a one week sleep diary. But with no less than five hours total time in bed. 

Participants are instructed to keep a stable bedtime and wake-up time for the length of the intervention. The researcher will come up with a "sleep window" that is approved by the participant. 

This sleep window will be evaluated  every week for six weeks via telephone. Time in bed may be modified at weekly intervals by the achievement of 90% sleep efficiency (SE) = Total sleep time / Time in bed * 100) from a one week sleep diary (15 - 30 minute session per week via telephone). 

If 90% SE is achieved on average for any week of the therapy then Time in Bed is expanded by 15 minutes (either at bedtime or  in the morning, depending on the participant). If &lt;85% SE is achieved Time in bed is reduced by 15 minutes (but not if it is at the minimum of five hours). If SE = 85-90% Time in bed is held constant. The intervention will end after six weeks of this treatment</interventions>

      <outcome>Changes in overnight measures of hourly cortisol secretion (22:00-06:00) via Venepuncture. We will collect blood half-hourly during an overnight sleep study before the intervention and again after the SRT intervention at six weeks. This will be achieved from a small catheter for measurement of Cortisol concentrations. The total amount of blood taken will be less than a standard blood donation.</outcome>

      <outcome>Changes in overnight measures of core body temperature (22:00-06:00) via an indigestible temperature monitoring pill device. We will collect temperature every minute during an overnight sleep study before the intervention and again after the SRT intervention at six weeks. This will be achieved from a small wireless core body temperature monitoring system.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to discover the contribution of certain mechanisms of action within sleep restriction therapy for insomnia disorder. Insomnia disorder can be treated by the use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Within this Sleep Restriction Therapy is considered a key component. Yet, a lack of evidence exists to determine the mechanisms of action within this treatment option. Therefore, this study will look to examine changes in the contribution of certain sleep-wake mechanisms. Namely, the circadian drives for sleep and the homeostatic sleep drive or pressure for sleep. In addition, we will also look to measure subjective changes in the perception of sleep through questionnaire response.</summary>
