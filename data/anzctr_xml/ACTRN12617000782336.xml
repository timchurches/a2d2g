  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be testing the point of care analyser against the current standard lab analyser in obtaining full blood counts for Haematology patients.  There will be an emphasis on low blood counts as this is where decisions are made.  The patient will have their regular venous blood test (standard care) and have and ADDITIONAL finger-prick blood test ('intervention').  The finger-prick test will take under ten minutes and will be peformed by a doctor or nurse trained to do so.  It will occur in the clinic that the patient would attend anyway, so that the patient would be minimally inconvenienced. </interventions>
    <comparator>There will not be a separate control group.  The same individual having the finger-prick blood test would also have had a venous blood test for the lab.  This would be obtained by venepuncture or from a catheter and performed either at the lab or by a nurse in clinic. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of full blood count (Hb, platelets, white cell count and neutrophils) between the finger prick (capillary) test and the lab (venous) blood test.  These will be compared using statistical analysis to obtain a coefficient of variance (closer to 1 = more similar results).  This is a composite primary outcome. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The venous blood test will be obtained prior to the clinic visit and the finger prick blood test will be obtained at the clinic visit (less than two hours after the venous blood test).  The data will be obtained and will be analysed over several weeks during and after the completion of the data collection phase of the study.  As the results will not alter patient care (although hopefully might enhance future patient care), the results do not need to be analysed in order to provide current standard of care.  The aim is for all data to be analysed by one year after the first patient is enrolled. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of patient satisfaction with comparison of the venous blood test and the finger prick blood test.  To assess this, patients will be provided with a brief questionnaire that has been designed for this study.  It will contain only 1-2 questions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following both interventions - either at the clinic or at the next clinic visit (the patients are usually seen daily). </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are conducting a study to compare the results available from a finger-prick blood test at the bedside or in the clinic room, to the standard lab blood test for full blood count testing.  The aim of the study is to find out whether the results obtained from both tests are similar enough that the finger prick test can be used instead of the lab test.  If this is the case, then in some situations, a finger prick test (with results available almost immediately) can replace the lab test.  We believe that the results will be similar enough and we also believe that the finger prick test will be preferred by patients due to the ease of the test and the rapid availability of results.  </summary>
