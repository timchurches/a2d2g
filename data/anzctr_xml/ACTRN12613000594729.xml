Levels of FGF23, associated blood and urine markers of bone metabolism and bone mass are being studied. The duration of observation in each participant is at a single time point.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparative mean or median (depending on the distribution of the data) intact fibroblast growth factor 23 and C Terminal fibroblast growth factor 23 levels in the 3 groups of men with iron deficiency, normal iron stores and iron overload. Previous studies have compared either geometric mean FGF23 levels or log transformed median FGF23 levels. FGF23 levels ( intact and C-terminal) will be assessed by serum assay. Iron studies will be assessed by serum assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the completion of analysis of results, once all the data have been collected, which is predicted to be approximately 10-12 months after the start of recruitment. This outcome will be assessed in each participant on one occasion only. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparative means or medians, depending on the distribution of the data, for associated markers of bone turnover and bone mass in the 3 groups of men with differing levels of iron stores - iron overload, iron deficiency or normal iron stores. The following bone markers will be assessed by serum or plasma assay: 25OH vitamin D, 1, 25 diOH vitamin D, PTH, P1NP, CTX, LH, SHBG, testosterone, EUC, CMP, CRP, LFTs, FE Studies, FGF23 intact, FGF23 C terminal. Full blood count will be assessed from this single blood sample. Tubular resorption of phosphate will be assessed on a single fasting urine sample. bone density will be assessed by DEXA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Again, as for the primary outcome, this will occur once all the data have been collected and analysed, which is expected to be within 12 months from the start of recruitment. These outcomes will be assessed in each participant on one occasion only. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparative means or medians of body composition markers of lean and fat mass by DEXA (dual X-ray absorptiometry) for the 3 participant groups, depending on the distribution of the data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>To be performed around the time that blood and urine samples are taken </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The study population will comprise males of age 35 years or greater who meet one of the following criteria:
1.	iron overload due to haemochromatosis with ferritin &gt;  300microg/l, the upper limit of the reference range or
2.	normal iron studies
3.	iron deficiency with ferritin &lt; 30 microg/l ie. below the lower limit of the reference range </inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Males</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1.	Intercurrent proven evidence of cancer  as this will affect ferritin levels and interpretation and may alter FGF 23
2.	Active infection- will affect ferritin levels and interpretation and may alter FGF 23
3.	Chronic kidney disease with eGFR&lt; 50 - as eGFR drops, FGF23 levels rise rapidly
4.	Current glucocorticoid use, 
5.	Hypercalcaemia 
6.	Vitamin D deficiency with 25OH vitamin D level &lt; 25 nmol/l

    <statisticalmethods>For data that are normally distributed, analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing will be used to determine if differences between the 3 groups are statistically significant. If data are not normally distributed then the Kruskal-Wallis test for non-parametric analysis will be used to compare values and assess for differences between the 3 groups.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a cross sectional case control study which will determine levels of FGF23, a phosphate regulatory protein produced by osteocytes in men with iron overload, using haemochromatosis as a model of iron overload, in men with iron deficiency and in men with normal iron stores. Associated markers of bone metabolism will be measured in blood and urine and bone densitometry and body composition studies will be performed by Dual X-ray absorptiometry.</summary>
