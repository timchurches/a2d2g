  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Pegylated interferon alfa 2b
Treatment: drugs - Ribavirin

Active Comparator: Standard Treatment Duration (24 weeks) - Subjects with detectable HCV RNA after four weeks of therapy will continue on PEG-IFN and ribavirin until week 24 and follow-up for an additional 24 weeks following treatment completion (48 weeks in total).

Experimental: Shortened Treatment Duration (12 Weeks) - Subjects with undetectable HCV RNA after four weeks of therapy will continue on PEG-IFN and ribavirin until week 12 and follow-up for an additional 24 weeks following treatment completion (36 weeks in total).


Treatment: drugs: Pegylated interferon alfa 2b
Pegylated interferon alfa 2b 1.5 mcg/kg/week to a maximum of 150 mcg/week administered subcutaneously once weekly directly observed.

Treatment: drugs: Ribavirin
Ribavirin - 800-1400 mg daily according to weight taken orally with food, self administered in split doses.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment Efficacy - The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks post end of treatment (SVR12) following directly observed PEG-IFN alfa-2b in combination with self-administered ribavirin for 12 weeks in participants with non-quantifiable (&lt;15 IU/ml detected and &lt;15 IU/ml undetected) HCV RNA or undetectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 of therapy and for 24 weeks in participants with quantifiable (=15 IU/ml) HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 of therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and Tolerability - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of directly observed PEG-IFN alfa-2b in combination with self-administered ribavirin for 12 weeks in participants with non-quantifiable HCV RNA or undetectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 of therapy and for 24 weeks in participants with quantifiable HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 of therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment Adherence - Evaluate the adherence (&gt;80 of PEG-IFN, &gt;80% of RBV, &gt;80% of time) to directly observed PEG-IFN alfa-2b in combination with self-administered ribavirin for 12 weeks in participants with non-quantifiable HCV RNA or undetectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 of therapy and for 24 weeks in participants with quantifiable HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 of therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment Response (ETR &amp; SVR24) - Evaluate the percentage with undetectable HCV RNA at end of treatment (ETR) and 24 weeks post end of treatment (SVR24) in participants treated with PEG-IFN alfa-2b in combination with self-administered ribavirin for 12 weeks in participants with non quantifiable HCV RNA or undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 of therapy and for 24 weeks in participants with quantifiable HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA at week 4 of therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Behavioral and Quality of Life - Evaluate changes in illicit drug use, opiate substitution therapy, depression, suicidal ideations and health-related quality of life in participants treated with PEG-IFN alfa-2b in combination with self-administered ribavirin for 12 weeks in participants with non-quantifiable HCV RNA or undetectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 of therapy and for 24 weeks in participants with quantifiable HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA at week 4 of therapy.</outcome>
