    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK932121; Rosiglitazone; Rosuvastatin

Experimental: Single Dose, Repeat Dose, Drug-Drug Interaction - GSK932121 or placebo will be administered as a single dose with or without food in a dose escalation manner. Once the results from the single dose is obtained and reviewed, GSK932121 or placebo will be administered as a repeat dose. The results from each repeat dose level will be reviewed prior to determining the next repeat dose level.
To better understand the effect of GSK932121 on rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin, a drug-drug interaction arm will also be investigated in this study. Rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin will be administered alone, then GSK932121 will be given as a repeat dose. Rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin will then be administered in combination with GSK932121.


Treatment: drugs: GSK932121; Rosiglitazone; Rosuvastatin
GSK932121 is the study drug that will be tested in all parts of this study as described above. Rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin will only be tested in the drug-drug interaction substudy.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug (antimalarial medication) is safe
      when given to healthy subjects as a single dose or as repeated doses, to understand the
      effect of food on single doses of study drug and to determine if the study drug has an effect
      on other approved medications such as rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin.</summary>
