    <interventions>The AGOG Epidemiology Study is a hospital-based family-case-control study of glioma, collecting estimates of lifestyle, constitutional, and environmental exposures and sampling blood for genotyping and future biomarker studies.  This is a retrospective observational study only - no intervention is being tested. Participants complete 3 questionnaires at one time and provide one blood sample.</interventions>
    <comparator>We will recruit an UNAFFECTED same sex sibling (or half sibling) closest in age to the case AND a spouse/partner. If this is unsuccessful, we will aim to recruit an UNAFFECTED same sex sibling (or half sibling) next closest in age AND a spouse/partner. The controls will complete the same questionnaires for comparison as the case and provide a blood sample.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The AGOG Epidemiology Study will study genes, lifestyle and environmental factors in people with and without brain tumours in order to identify who are at risk of developing these tumours. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 to 79 years and were diagnosed with glioma between January 2013 and June 2016. 
Study details This is an observational study, meaning that no treatment is given to participants as part of this study. Participants and up to two family members are asked to provide a blood (or saliva) sample and complete three questionnaires regarding their lifestyle and family history of glioma. Researchers will use this information, along with disease and treatment information from hospital records to identify patterns between patient lifestyles, family histories, genetics and disease treatment and outcomes. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide a research platform for further studies into predictive factors of glioma and glioma outcomes, and for the identification of future treatment options for glioma. </summary>
