  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-center, long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study for subjects with
      hemoglobinopathies (ß-thalassemia or severe sickle cell disease) who have been treated with
      ex vivo gene therapy drug product in bluebird bio-sponsored clinical studies. After
      completing the parent clinical study (approximately 2 years), eligible subjects will be
      followed for an additional 13 years for a total of 15 years post-drug product infusion. No
      investigational drug product will be administered in the study.</summary>
