    <interventions>Community-based care.

Participants allocated to the Intervention group will be followed-up by telephone for two years after discharge. Community-based healthcare workers will telephone participants each fortnight in the first year and each month in the second year. They will encourage participants to contact healthcare workers at the first signs of complications or as needed for support. It is conservatively estimated that 20% of participants will not be contactable by telephone. These participants will be monitored with more frequent home visits.

Each time the healthcare workers speak to participants, they will screen the participants for complications using purpose-designed interview scripts. Specifically, the healthcare workers will screen participants for the first indication of pressure ulcers, urinary tract infection, bowel impaction, bladder infection, depression, autonomic dysreflexia or respiratory complications. At the first indication of any of these complications, the healthcare workers will provide advice to participants and their families about management and then closely monitor them over the next few days or weeks until the complication is resolved.

The healthcare workers will also visit participants and their families in their homes. There will be two home visits in the first year and one in the second year. Participants who cannot be contacted by telephone will be visited more frequently: three times in the first year and twice in the second year. At each home visit, the healthcare worker will assess the participants home situation and provide advice as needed. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care.

Participants allocated to the Control group will receive the level of care currently provided by the Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed after discharge from hospital. That is, a healthcare worker will telephone Control group participants in the first month after discharge. On this one occasion only, the healthcare worker will provide the same advice to Control group participants as is provided to Intervention group participants on the first telephone contact with participants. Control group participants will not receive ongoing support although they will be free to seek any support they can access.</comparator>

    <concealment>Enrolment: People with recent spinal cord injury will be screened for inclusion by research staff prior to their discharge from the Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed in Bangladesh. 

Allocation: A secure random allocation sequence will be generated by independent researchers. Allocation will be stratified by level of injury (paraplegia or tetraplegia). The allocation schedule will be concealed from investigators, potential participants, and clinical and research staff in Bangladesh. A participantâ€™s allocation will only be revealed to the clinical staff administering the intervention. Randomisation will occur at the time of discharge from hospital.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Separate analyses will be conducted on each outcome. The primary effectiveness analysis will compare the rates of all-cause mortality in the Intervention and Control groups using the log-rank test (two-tailed alpha equal to or less than 0.05). Between-group comparisons of secondary outcomes will be conducted using logistic regression (for dichotomous outcomes) or linear regression (for continuous outcomes). In these models the outcome will be a linear function of a dummy-coded variable representing group membership (Intervention or Control group) and a dummy-coded variable for stratum (paraplegia or tetraplegia). For all continuous outcomes, baseline scores will be included in the model to increase statistical precision and statistical power.

A sample size of 30 is sufficient to demonstrate the feasibility of the trial protocol.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spinal cord injuries are four times more common in low income countries than in high income countries. In most low income countries, people who sustain a spinal cord injury are discharged home with very little access to support services. They often then develop life-threatening complications, and many die within years of discharge.

It is not clear if a low-cost and sustainable community-based model of care for people who have returned home after spinal cord injury can prevent complications following spinal cord injury.  We will investigate the effectiveness of a model of care which involves regular monitoring and provision of ongoing education and advice by telephone, together with a limited number of home visits, for patients and their families and carers. The service will be provided in the first 2 years following discharge when patients are most vulnerable to complications.

A pragmatic randomised controlled trial will be undertaken to compare a model of community-based care with usual care for people discharged home following recent spinal cord injury in Bangladesh. The primary aim is to determine whether a low-cost community-based model of care reduces all-cause mortality of people with spinal cord injury in Bangladesh. The secondary aims are to determine whether this model of care reduces the incidence of complications, enhances quality of life and independence, and is cost-effective.</summary>
