  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single subcutaneous injection of Methylnaltrexone Bromide (0.15mg/kg) at baseline.  If the injection has not been effective within 24 hours (ie no bowel action), the injection may be repeated (but the pharmacokinetic samples will not be repeated).</interventions>
    <comparator>No comparator.  Pharmacokinetic study.</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A pharmacokinetic profile of one dose of Methylnaltrexone Bromide in paediatric patients with opioid-induced constipation will be established from PK blood samples collected at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the time of injection.  The area under the curve will be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 hour pharmacokinetic sampling period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effectiveness of Methylnaltrexone Bromide in a paediatric population with opioid induced constipation will be assessed with the use of a bowel action diary.  The log features the Bristol Stool Chart to assist with categorising stool type, as well as space for completing day, time, amount, strain, pain, tummy ache and rectal bleeding.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The bowel movement diary will be completed any time there is a bowel movement from the time of injection up to 1 week post injection.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety of Methylnaltrexone Bromide in a paediatric population with opioid induced constipation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse reactions will be monitored and recorded at Time point 0hours, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours post injection and up to 1 week post injection.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of Methylnaltrexone Bromide is approved to treat adults with opioid-induced constipation, but it has not yet been test in children with opioid-induced constipation.  This study will see how safe and effective Methylnaltrexone Bromide is in children with opioid-induced constipation.</summary>
