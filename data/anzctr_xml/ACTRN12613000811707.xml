  <interventions>
    <interventions>SPARX is a self-help computerized cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) program. It consists of seven modules. It includes elements of fantasy gaming (learning by doing) and direct teaching and reflection on skills learnt in the game. Participants are encouraged to use SPARX weekly (1 to 2 modules a week). Each module takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. Participants will complete SPARX on a computer with an internet connection (at home if a participant has access to broadband connection or in a clinic on a computer designated for SPARX, as agreed by a participant with his/her clinician). SPARX will be provided with e-monitoring. E-monitoring allows clinicians to oversee the progress of patients who are completing SPARX (mood, risk and adherence) remotely (i.e. via an electronic dashboard and system of email alerts).</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The acceptability and satisfaction of SPARX paired with e-monitoring among young people and clinicians measured through a custom-made self-rated questionnaire.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effectiveness of SPARX online paired with the e-monitoring tool (we will measure the extent of change in depressive symptoms and compare it with the results of the original randomised controlled trial conducted by Merry et al., 2012). Depressive symptoms will be measured the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Rating Scale-2nd (RADS-2) and Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ; long version) at post-intervention.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effectiveness of SPARX online paired with the e-monitoring tool (we will measure the extent of change in anxiety symptoms and compare it with the results of the original randomised controlled trial conducted by Merry et al., 2012). Anxiety symptoms will be measured by Spence Child Anxiety Scale (SCAS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post treatment (week 6-8) and 6-week follow up (week 12-14)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The cost and service efficiency associated with delivering SPARX with e-monitoring (though full cost-benefit analysis is beyond the scope of this project). Cost and efficiency will be assessed by measuring the frequency and time clinician spend on e-monitoring each week vs. estimated (projected) face-to-face therapy time that would be spent with a given patient.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be eligible for inclusion if:
1. Present with low mood or depressive symptoms or if a clinician determines low mood/depressive symptoms to be the primary problem.
2. They are aged 12 to 19 years of age (on day of the consent);
3. Newly referred/presenting to the health clinic or existing clients interested in this additional intervention;
4. The consent process will follow usual practice at health clinic (and any other site that may be added to this study). Individual consent will be collected from all participants. Parental consent will be collected if a clinician deems it appropriate. 
5. They have sufficient English language ability to understand the program;
6. Can access a computer and Internet to use SPARX paired with e-monitoring. This may be a home computer but if the staff at the health clinic choose to offer SPARX online at the clinic, this will be available too.

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be ineligible in the study if:
1. They have severe depression, high suicide risk or other severe mental health issue which may mean that they are not safe to receive SPARX;
2. They have an intellectual disability or physical limitations that would result in them not being able to use the computer program
3.  Currently is or has been receiving (past 3 months) CBT, interpersonal therapy or antidepressant medication

    <concealment>We will seek participants/patients presenting with a primary problem of low mood and symptoms of depression, deemed to warrant treatment at a health clinic. Clinicians will recruit participants. Written consent will be collected from all participants. Parental consent will be collected if deemed appropriate by a clinician following usual clinical protocol.  All consenting participants will be asked to use SPARX at time and location of their choosing.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>This is a clinical implementation study that follows on from two successful randomised controlled trials of SPARX. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are kept to a minimum to increase the generalisability of findings and reflect the clinical reality. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This study is a clinical implementation study, thus the primary objective are to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and clinical utility. The power calculations relate to the measures of effectiveness only.
A sample size of n=40 will enable detection of changes within the study group with effect sizes of 0.40 or more as statistically significant (a=0.05) with 80% power. Additionally, n=40 will enable detection of differences in changes between the proposed study and the published RCT results with effect sizes of 0.55 or more as statistically significant (a=0.05) with 80% power. In terms of the primary outcome the change in RADS-2 scores an effect size of 0.40 equates to a change of approximately 4 units and 0.55 equates to a difference in the change of approximately 6 units.
Initial analyses will quantify the changes over time within the study group, using means and percentages with paired t-tests and McNemars chi-square tests used to assess the statistical significance of the changes. We will also directly compare the changes from baseline to post intervention in our key outcomes measures in this study between those results achieved in the previous RCT, using ANCOVA for continuous outcomes and logistic regressions and chi-square tests for diagnostic (presence/absence) outcomes. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be taken to indicate statistical significance. The comparisons of the changes will be summarised with 95% confidence intervals to establish the extent and potential importance of any differences in effects of SPARX between the original RCT and this study. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have developed an effective e­therapy for depressed adolescents, called SPARX. SPARX takes form of an innovative fantasy game that lets young people learn skills in a virtual world and apply them in real settings. We made SPARX available online and linked it electronically with clinicians to allow them to prescribe SPARX and monitor young peoples progress (via an e­monitoring system). This study will pilot SPARX online paired with the e­-monitoring system and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability and clinical utility. This study is in partnership with Kapity Youth Support (KYS, a multidisciplinary youth health clinic) and it is a clinical implementation study of an evidence­-based intervention.</summary>
