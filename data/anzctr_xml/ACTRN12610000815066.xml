  <interventions>
    <interventions>Administration of vitamin D3 and 1,25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D (calcitriol)
Calcitriol will be administered at a dose of 0.25 mcg daily, vitamin D3 will be administered at a dose of 1000 IU a day. Both will be administered orally, for a period fo 12 months following randomisation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group is patients receiving standard care, comparison is between control group and the two interventions groups. Standard care involves best practice management of chronic kidney disease. This involves the active management fo cardiovascular risk factors, mineral paramaters such as phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and ensuring optimal glycemic control where appropriate.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression and incidence of coronary artery calcification in patients with stage 3b and 4 chronic kidney disease over 18 months. This will occur at baseline, 9 months and 18 months. We will use a non-contrast, electrocardiograph-gated, 320-slice computer tomography (CT) to assess the coronary arteries.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed at baseline and 9 and 18 months following randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the impact of calcitriol and vitami D3 therapy on progression of markers of chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) in particualr parathryroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). This will be assessed with serum biomarkers; phosphate, FGF-23 and PTH as well as bone mineral density measurements obtained from the computed tomography (CT) reconstructions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These will occur three times during the study period; at baseline, 9 and 18 months following randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effect of calcitriol and vitamin D3 supplementation on arterial compliance as measured by pulse wave velocity</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will occur 3 times during the study period; at baseline, 9 and 18 months following randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effect of vitamin D3 and calcitriol on the degree of proteinuria. This will be assessed through a 24-hour urine collection assessing the protein excretion over 24 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will occur three times during the study period: at baseline, 9 and 18 months following randomisation.</timepoint>

After randomisation patients will be allocated to of two interventions, or ongoing standard care. The recruiting person will not be aware as to which arm the patients has been randomised to. The medications will be dispensed by pharmacy, however as there is no placebo arm and patients are not blinded there is no allocation concealment procedures.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 10-15% of the population in developed countries. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the greatest risk faced by CKD patients compared to the general population, with an increased mortality that parallels the decline in renal function. Traditional strategies to reduce the risk of CVD, such as lipid lowering and blood pressure control, have had limited impact in the CKD population. This is likely because much of the excess risk of CVD has been attributed to non-traditional risk factors such as anaemia, inflammation and accelerated vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness, related to abnormal phosphate and calcium metabolism in this population.

Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to vascular calcification in epidemiological studies. Our aim is to assess as to whether vitamin D supplementation can delay or decrease the progression and incidence of vascular calcification in this population.  At this stage there have been no clinical trials assessing the impact of vitamin D therapy on improving CV outcomes or altering the natural progression of surrogate CV markers such as VC and arterial stiffness in the CKD population.</summary>
