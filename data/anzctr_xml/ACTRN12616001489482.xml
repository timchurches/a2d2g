  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) managed by the Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) are currently administered midazolam for their drug management. The QAS are replacing midazolam for droperidol in the drug management of ABD. We want to study this change in practice by QAS of these 2 drugs on there effectiveness and safety for the management of ABD. 

Date for implementation for the change over to droperidol is 15th November 2016. The audit period will run from this date until we have collected 130 patients who have received droperidol. It is expected that this will be reached by the 15th June 2017.

The source of the data for the study will be from a combination of the standard reporting form for QAS (eARF) and a purpose built audit form. 

The regimen for droperidol is 10mg intramuscularly (IM) which can be repeated if the patient has not settled after 15 minutes to a total of 20mg. For patients &gt;65 years the dose is 5mg IM which can be repeated if the patient has not settled after 15 minutes to a total dose of 10mg. The definition of settled is a reduction in the sedation assessment tool (SAT) score to 0 or lower or a reduction of 2 if the SAT score is 3. 

The follow up period once the patient has settled is for 1 hour to assess the requirement for any re sedation. </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group are patients with ABD who are receiving midazolam. The pre-implementation audit period with midazolam still in use will take place using a study audit form and standard ARF reporting from May 26th to November 14th 2016 will occur.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with adverse events comparing those given midazolam and those given droperidol. Adverse events are defined as:

1.	Airway obstruction requiring an airway maneuver i.e. chin lift/jaw thrust through to LMA/Intubation.
2.	Oxygen saturations &lt; 90% on room air and/or respiratory rate &lt; 12/minute

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.  Time to sedation defined as the QAS arrival time at patient until the SAT score decreases by 2 points or more or there is a score of zero. This is reported on the study audit form and/or the eARF by QAS paramedics.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the one hour after the drug has been given.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The requirement for additional sedation, defined as any medication administered for the purpose of sedation within 60 minutes of achieving sedation defined in secondary outcome 1 above. This is reported on the study audit form and/or the eARF by QAS paramedics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the one hour after the drug has been given.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of drug administrations used to sedate patients with midazolam and droperidol. This is reported on the study audit form and/or the eARF by QAS paramedics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the one hour after the drug has been given.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of injuries to patients and QAS staff. This is reported on the study audit form and/or the eARF by QAS paramedics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the one hour after the drug has been given.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prehospital time defined as QAS arrival time at patient to time of arrival at destination (receiving hospital). This is reported on the study audit form and/or the eARF by QAS paramedics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the one hour after the drug has been given.</timepoint>

For primary outcome - chi square or Fisher's exact test.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) is changing its drug management of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) from midazolam to droperidol based on the research undertaken by the chief investigator (Page) and one of the principle investigators (Isbister) in the emergency department setting. New South Wales ambulance service has undertaken this change in 2015. Auditing to date of the QAS ambulance report form (ARF) use of midazolam demonstrates poor use of sedation scores, missing information &amp; adverse effects from midazolam. It is therefore planed to audit this change over in drug management with an audit form in addition to standard reporting (ARF). This will be a prospective observational study, as part of a quality assurance monitoring process of this changeover looking at effectiveness and safety of both agents. Possible outcomes will hopefully be a more effective and safer management of this condition.
