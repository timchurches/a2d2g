    <statisticalmethods>Based on an assumed rate of 40% nausea associated with oxycodone and a rate of 20% associated with tramadol, we calculate that a sample size of 79 in each group is needed to detect a 50% reduction in nausea with a power of 80%. Allowing for a 15% attrition rate, we aim to recruit 93 participants in each group. 

Analysis
Analysis will be as intention to treat. Data will be summarised using means and standard deviations or medians, interquartile ranges and ranges for continuous data and frequency distributions for categorical data. Univariate comparisons will be made using independent t-tests for continuous outcomes and Chi-square or Fisher exact tests for categorical comparisons. We plan to conduct a multivariable logistic regression analysis for the nominal primary outcomes, adjusting for the variables below. All tests will be two-sided and a p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant for the overall analysis.  

Variables
The following factors will be adjusted for
-	Age (&lt;65 compared with 65 or older)
-	Mode of surgery (open or laparoscopic)
-	Use of TAP blocks in the peri-operative period
-	Use of PCA in the post-operative period
-	Amount of opioid use prior to discharge
-	Malignant or benign pathology

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of tramadol/paracetamol combined dosing compared with paracetamol and oxycodone for pain management following major surgery in gynaecology oncology patients. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or more who is planned for major surgery for either benign or malignant tumours in gynaecological oncology.

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will take oral Tramadol/paracetamol for post-operative pain management in the week following hospital discharge. Participants in the other group will take oral paracetamol and oxycodone in the week following discharge.

All participants will be followed-up for 28 days in order to evaluate post-operative nausea, constipation, adverse events, hospital re-admission rates, and efficacy of pain relief. We hope to determine whether Tramadol / paracetamol is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated option for post-operative pain management.</summary>
