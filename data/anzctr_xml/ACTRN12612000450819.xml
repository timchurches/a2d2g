  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the ManUp UWS intervention group will be invited to partake in a 12-week online physical activity intervention where they will be able to set physical activity challenges, interact with other study participants, and track their progress using online tracking tools. Participants in the intervention group will have full-time access to the online intervention for the duration of the 12-week program where they will be able to utilise the ManUp UWS website and tools at their discretion (as much or as little as they like).

Participants will be required to wear an accelerometer to measure physical activity and sedentary time (for one week each time) at three time points (week zero - baseline, week 12  end of formal intervention, and week 24  follow-up). 

Participants in the intervention group will receive email prompts to use the online intervention and generic printed materials on physical activity and health at four time points (week zero, week three, week six and week nine).</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive only generic printed materials on physical activity and health at four time points (week zero, week three, week six and week nine). The generic printed materials will be used at the participants discretion.
