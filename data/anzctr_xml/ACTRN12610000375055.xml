  <interventions>
    <interventions>a home-based inspiratory muscle training: the training sessions consist of 30 minutes daily, five times per week over eight weeks with the threshold device regulated at 30% of the subjects maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)values. Every other week (bi-weekly), one session was performed with physiotherapy supervision to measure the MIP and adjuste the load and also to check the information about the training and resolve any doubts. So, in one week the participants train five days on their own and on the other week four days on their own and one day with physiotherapy supervision.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>inspiratory muscular strength: assessed by manovacuometer with operational intervals of 300 cmH2O, in deep inspiration from residual volume against an occluded airway with a minor air leak (2 mm). The highest pressure of three measurements was used for analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and after eight weeks of intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>inspiratory muscle endurance: an incremental test in which participants breath continuously through a mouthpiece connected to a Threshold Inspiratory Muscle Trainer with an initial load of 30% of Pimax, and increments of 10% of Pimax added every 2 min until the participant is unable to continue breathing. The greatest inspiratory pressure that the subject is able to sustain for at least 1 min is considered according to Martyn et al, 1987.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and after eight weeks of intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>functional performance: incremental cycle ergometer test, protocol according to American College of Sports Medicine for persons with stroke consisting of stages of 2 minutes with incremental load calculated individualy using the Wasserman's formula.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study were first aproved as a case study and considering the results it was improved as a randomized control trial. Stroke survivors with maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) lower than 90% of the predicted values, randomly allocated in the control and treatment groups. 
Intervention: The intervention is based on Threshold training, bi-weekly adjusted to 30% of the MIP. The control group with the same protocol, without the threshold resistance valve. Both groups receive home training 30 minutes daily, five times/week, during eight weeks. 
To study the hypothesis that the treatment will improve MIP, inspiratory muscular endurance (IME), quality of life, and functional performance.</summary>
