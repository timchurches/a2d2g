    <exclusivecriteria>-  Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for immune-related adverse events

          -  Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the PD-1/PD-L1pathway

          -  Prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor

          -  Prior treatment with other immune-modulating agents within fewer than 4 weeks prior to
             the first dose of REGN2810, or associated with immune-mediated adverse events that
             were = grade 1 within 90 days prior to the first dose of REGN2810, or associated with
             toxicity that resulted in discontinuation of the immune-modulating agent. Examples of
             immune-modulating agents include therapeutic vaccines, cytokine treatments, or agents
             that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), 4-1BB (CD137), or OX-40.

             4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810
