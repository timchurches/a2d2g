  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy using a drug called Creon at a dose of 25,000 international units per capsule. This medication will be taken at an initial dose of 2 capsules with meals, and one capsule with snacks each day, continuously whilst on the study. This equates to approximately 9 capsules per day, depending on the number of meals taken. Reassessment of symptoms at one months may lead to a dose escalation up to 3 capsules with meals and/or two capsules with snacks, in the presence of symptoms suggestive of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, such as bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea. The dose escalation equates to approximately 12-15 capsules per day, depending on the number of meals taken.

The medication will be continued for at least 2 months, and until the participant does not tolerate it, or elects to discontinue study assessments, or the participant dies.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be given a participant information and consent form after they have been identified by an investigator or delegated person. They will undergo screening to ensure eligibility criteria are met, and be randomised. The person who will determine if a subject is eligile will not be aware which arm the will be allocated to.
All study personnel will be blinded to the intervention apart from the pharmacist. The study pharmacist will hold the allocation schedule at a central administration site, and will dispense study medication to be given to participants. The allocation will be concealed to the patient and to all study personnel.
The intervention capsule will be identical to the placebo capsule.</concealment>
    <sequence>A list will be generated by a statistician using permuted block randomisation in a 1:1 ratio to assign participants, which will be kept by pharmacy. No personnel other than pharmacy wil have access to the allocation list, unless a participant requires emergency unblinding.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a randomised controlled trial for patients with metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic cancer, comparing a drug named Creon - which acts as a pancreatic enzyme supplementation - to placebo, in order to determine its influence on change in weight. We will also look at the drug's effect on quality of life, nutrition and survival, with our expectation being that Creon will decrease the rate of weight loss, improve quality of life, nutrition and length of life. This study is being performed due to previous research showing a benefit to pancreatic enzyme supplements in patients with pancreatic cancer with a bile duct stent in place to relieve a blockage caused by the cancer. It is known that pancreatic cancer causes weight loss, and thought that poor absorption of nutrients may contribute to that weight loss. This study aims to assess whether aiding the aborption of nutrients leads to better nutrition, weight stabilisation, improved quality of life and improved survival.

Trial details

In this study you will be randomly assigned to either the active medication (the Creon drug made of pancreatic enzyme), or to an identical, but non-active placebo capsule. In either group, you will take 2 capsules of Creon/placebo with meals, and one capsule with snacks every day. After one month and depending on how you have tolerated the drug, the dosage may be increased to 3 capsules with meals and/or two capsules with snacks, depending on whether you are feeling bloated, flatulent and/or have diarrhoea. Overall, you will continue the treatment for at least 2 months.

During the study will be assessed by study personnel including the doctor, nurse and dietitian. The assessments are weight measurement, questionnaires about nutrition, symptoms and quality of life. These visits will be monthly for 2 months, then every three months while you and other participants remain on the study. 

Who is it for?

You may be eligible for this study if you have metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic cancer and aged 18 and over. Full details of whether or not you can participate can be found in the Inclusion Criteria section of this record.</summary>
