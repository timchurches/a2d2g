  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individuals who are referred to the Strength2strength (S2S) Program are offered the opportunity to take part in a 12-month follow up study once they have completed the initial 12-week S2S program. 
Following completion of the 12-week S2S program, participants are allocated into one of three treatment groups - Usual care, telephone counselling or Activity tracker. 

Usual care
Participants are asked to self-report their activity levels via a follow up questionnaire 3, 6 and 12 months post program completion.  Participants are asked to report if their activity levels have increased, decreased or stayed the same and the reason for decrease if applicable.  They are also asked to report on their sitting time and to rate their confidence and motivation to continue to participate in physical activity.  Participants also attend the S2S clinic at 3, 6 and 12 months post program for assessment and functional testing. 

Telephone counselling
Participants receive a total of fifteen (15) calls throughout the 12 month follow up period.  For the first 3 months participants receive fortnightly calls.  This is increased to monthly calls for the remaining 9 months.  All telephone calls are conducted by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) with training in motivational interviewing techniques.  A protocol is followed by the AEP for each phone call to ensure consisted information is collected.  The AEP is able to provide advice regarding exercise prescription and assist participants to overcome any barriers that may be preventing them from being physically active.   Participants also attend the S2S clinic at 3, 6 and 12 months post program for assessment and functional testing. 

Activity Tracker
Participants are asked to wear a Jawbone(TM) activity tracker for the 12-month follow up period.  Each participant is provided with training on how to use the activity tracker and how to synchronise the device with the tablet provided.  
Participants are asked to synchronise their step data at the end of each day.  Failure to do so prompt an automatic text reminding the participant to synchronise and charge their activity tracker.  Participants are provided with specific feedback regarding their activity levels.  Additionally, participants receive real time feedback in the form of a vibrotactile alert from the device itself following a set period of inactivity.  Individual goals for each participant are set by the AEP following the completion of the 12-week S2S program.   Participants also attend the S2S clinic at 3, 6 and 12 months post program for assessment and functional testing.

    <concealment>At the time of initial assessment to take part in the S2S program, one of the study investigators outline the nature of the study and invite the participant to take part in the study.  Participants are made aware that participation in the study is optional and their decision of whether or not to take part in the study will not affect their eligibility to take part in the 12-week S2S program. 
Once a participant has been recruited, they complete the 12-week S2S program as per usual. 
At the time of discharge, participants are randomised into one of the three intervention groups (Usual Care, Telephone Counselling or Activity Tracker).  The randomisation is recorded in a sealed opaque envelope.  Each envelope was opened sequentially at the completion of the S2S program to reveal the allocated intervention.  </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation is completed by a third party not directly involved in the delivery of the S2S program.
In the event that there are multiple participants from the same household, they are randomised to the same intervention to maintain the integrity of the intervention.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Power Calculation
A preliminary power calculation was performed based on an observed increase of approximately 450 MET.min of physical activity per week in a small group of participants following the completion of the 12-week S2S program with a SD of the change.  Sample size was calculated based on a predicted maintenance of 100% of additional physical activity in the feedback groups and decrease of 50% of additional physical activity in the usual care group over the 12 month intervention (MD=225 MET.min/week) with SD of the change of 350 MET.min/week (roughly 1.5 times the mean change in line with S2S data).  The sample size calculation indicated that to obtain a power of 80%, at least 38 participants were required per group.  To allow for potential withdrawals 50 participants per group will be recruited.
All statistical analyses were performed using STATA statistical software (Stata 13; Statistical data analysis; Stata Corp; College Station; Texas, USA).  Baseline and descriptive data between the groups was analysed with one way ANOVA.  Binary categorical data was analysed for variability between the groups using logistic regression.  Parametric longitudinal data was analysed using mixed effects linear regression with unstructured covariance, corrected for repeated measures.  In the event that assumptions of linear regression (heteroskedascity, skewness, kurtosis or non-linearity) were violated, those analyses were repeated using repeated measures ordinal logistic regression.  p-values were corrected where appropriate for multiple comparisons using the Holm test. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to determine the effect of different types of ongoing feedback regarding maintenance of physical activity levels post completion of the 12-week strength2strength exercise treatment program.  
It is hypothesised that activity trackers will be as effective as telephone counselling for assisting participants to maintain their activity, however will be a more cost effective method.
