  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Prismaflex system (Gambro-Hospal) was used for predilution continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).  Prismocitrate 10/2, running at 2500ml/h, was the main predilution replacement.  8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution was infused at 50ml/h in the first 2 hours, and then at 30ml/h, via the Heparin port of the circuit (pre-filter).  10% calcium gluconate was infused via a separate central venous catheter to achieve an ionized calcium (iCa) level of 1-1.2mmol/L.  The fluid withdrawal rate was adjusted to achieve the desired fluid balance.  The circuit was run for 72-hours, unless there was filter clotting, requirement of transportation outside ICU for intervention/ imaging, or the patient did not require further CRRT</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) for continuous renal replacement therapy is associated with longer filter-life and less bleeding events.  Complexity of the regimen is the major hurdle preventing its wide spread applications. Our intensive Care Unit has been using a concentrated citrate containing solution for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for more than ten years already. We have been using another proprietary product of diluted citrate solution (Prismocitrate 10/2, Gambro) for predilutional continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) since 2009.  This is a retrospective case review for patients received this diluted citrate solution (Prismocitrate 10/2, Gambro).</summary>
