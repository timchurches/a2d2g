  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Smoking is the leading cause of lost healthy life years in New Zealand. Although smoking prevalence has been slowly declining in recent years (2002/3: 23% in adults, 2006/7: 19% in adults4), it remains particularly high in Maori (2007: 40% Maori women, 35% Maori men) and additional options for smokers who want to quit are needed. Although a variety of methods are available to help people stop smoking, many of them are expensive, have side effects, and despite their use most quit attempts still fail. There is some evidence that progressive reduction in the level of nicotine in cigarette tobacco can reduce the level of nicotine dependence in smokers, without any compensatory smoking9.  Furthermore, evidence suggests that the use of NRT in combination with nicotine-free cigarettes may have an impact on the signs and symptoms of withdrawal and cessation rates.  

The proposed trial will test the balance of benefits and risks of a new strategy for people to overcome nicotine addiction, namely the combined use of nicotine-free cigarettes and NRT immediately after quitting.  If the study confirms that the intervention in question is an effective time-limited smoking cessation strategy, then further research can be undertaken to determine the implications of these research findings on current policy and practice.  If proven safe and effective this strategy is likely to have substantial public health benefits.</summary>
