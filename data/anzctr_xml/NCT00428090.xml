      <outcome>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean ADAS-Cog Total Score at W24 as a Function of APOE e4 Status in Apolipoprotein epsilon4 (APOE e4) Negative Cohort - The 11-item ADAS-Cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech. Items were evaluated by tests and clinician ratings on a 5-point scale. Scores ranged from 0-70 with higher scores indicates more dysfunction. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline is defined as value at W0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups. There was no adjustment for the donepezil versus placebo comparisons, which were included to assess the sensitivity of the trial to detect a treatment effect.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score at W8, W16, W24 - The NPI assessed behavioral disturbances comprises 10 dimensions: delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, apathy, euphoria, disinhibition, aggressiveness and agitation, irritability, anxiety and aberrant motor activity. The par. caregiver asked about behavior in the par. If "Yes", the informant then rates both the severity on a 3-point scale, 1: mild to 3: severe (total range: 0-36) and the frequency using a 4-point scale, 1: occasionally to 4: very frequently. The total domain score was frequency × severity. The distress was scored on 5-point scale, 0: no distress to 5 - very severe or extreme. A total NPI score can be calculated by adding all domain scores together; NPI total score: from 0-144 and NPI distress score: from 0-60, all with higher scores indicating more severe behavioral disturbance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested and is approved as a treatment for type II diabetes
      mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body ineffectively uses glucose. RSG XR, the
      investigational drug, is an extended-release form of RSG. This study tests whether RSG XR
      safely provides benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). RSG XR is a
      new approach to AD therapy and this study tests whether one's genes alter the effectiveness
      of RSG XR. Glucose is used by cells to make energy that they need to live. Changes in the
      ability of cells to use of glucose can lead to diseases like diabetes. Glucose levels may be
      lower in the brains of AD patients, and their brain cells may also use glucose less well than
      in unaffected people. The proper function of brain cells may be critical to memory and
      thought. If brain cells use glucose poorly, this might impact AD. Drugs that help brain cells
      properly use glucose may help a person maintain normal memory and thinking. Data suggesting
      that RSG may help AD patients was first seen in a small study at the Univ. of Washington and
      then from a larger international GSK study. In the first study, those receiving RSG once
      daily for 6 months scored better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not
      receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that benefited most from therapy with RSG XR had a
      specific genetic pattern. They lacked the gene that caused them to produce apolipoprotein E
      e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent,
      or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE
      e3 version of the gene from one parent. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained
      fairly stable while those with two copies of APOE e4 continued to worsen during the 6-month
      treatment. This study will directly test the effect of RSG XR on people who either have or
      lack the APOE e4 gene.</summary>
