  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute Phase: It is hypothesized that ZS (zirconium silicate) is more effective than placebo
      control (alternative hypothesis) in lowering S-K levels in subjects with S-K between 5.0 -
      6.5 mmol/l versus no difference between ZS and placebo control (null hypothesis).

      Subacute Phase (randomized withdrawal): It is hypothesized that ZS once daily is more
      effective than placebo control (alternative hypotheses) in maintaining normokalemic levels
      (3.5 - 4.9 mmol/l) among subjects completing the Acute Phase versus no difference between
      each ZS dose and respective placebo controls (null hypotheses).</summary>
