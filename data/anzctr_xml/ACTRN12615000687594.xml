    <interventions>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments using Autologous, Non-Expanded, Adipose Derived Stem Cells (stromal vascular fraction, SVF), platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) and peptides on patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Patients are assessed using inclusion and exclusion criteria, in order to determine whether they are eligible for an Autologous Stem cell transplant. If eligible, patients are prescribed, three proprietary peptide injections (growth factors) (dosage- 0.1 - 0.2 ml each, daily self-injection, 5 days/week for 4 weeks prior to liposuction procedure. The peptides are derived from those that are present naturally throughout the body and are critical to cellular processes particularly growth and regeneration. The ongoing maintenance dose of the peptides via injection is necessary due to their short half-life and most effective circulation and absorption. One injection continues for 5 weeks post-procedure while the other 2 injections continue for the trial duration) and specific Vitamin D3 dietary supplement (dosage- 4 capsules (1000 IU per capsule) per day starting 3 weeks prior and up to stem cell collection procedure).
The procedure commences with extraction of whole blood (60 ml) followed by preparation of PRP (approximately 7 ml) which is later combined with the SVF preparation for injection. Within the SVF, there will be an approximate minimum of 10^6 viable, nucleated cells deployed per kg body weight. Liposuction using local anaesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen (50 ml) for subsequent processing to isolate the SVF. SVF and PRP are filtered and irradiated. This preparation is administered with saline solution intravenously. Following the procedure, standard supportive measures including antimicrobial prophylaxis are followed as per clinic protocols. The duration of the day procedure including extraction, processing and injection is ~ 7 hours. This procedure and treatment is administered only once. Any adverse events are monitored at procedure and at 1 week follow-up visit. Monitoring is continued remotely for the trial duration. Condition specific validated questionnaires and physiological tests are applied at subsequent interviews at 3, 6, and 12 months via telephone and internet utilities. Data will be compared with previous medical history and baseline measurements taken before procedure.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent research and clinical evidence indicates that Human adipose-derived stem cells are safe for use in Humans. Researchers suggest that the treatment may alter the operation of the immune system to ameliorate degenerative activity. In a conducive environment supported by a combination of growth factors and certain peptides, stem cells can also be stimulated to differentiate into a range of different cell types when transported to the site of degradation. This trial is investigating to what extent an injection of the Stromal Vascular Fraction obtained from the participants own fat tissue and Platelet-Rich-Plasma, and in combination with proprietary peptides reduces the progression of disease and improves quality of life. The peptides are derived from those that are naturally present throughout the body and are critical to cellular processes particularly growth and regeneration. Age and disease conditions can reduce the levels and effectiveness of these peptides which normally promote healing. This study involves patients with neuro-degenerative disease specifically, multiple sclerosis of all categories.</summary>
