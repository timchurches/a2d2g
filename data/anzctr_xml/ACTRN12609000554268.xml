Participant progress is also followed up after their return home.  The study intervention will be given for 24 months from the date of randomisation into the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Current Standard Care: participants follows the current patient flow patterns through hospital visits.  Care plan advice is given directly to patients, prior to the discharge of the patient from hospital, regarding appropriate  community health provider assistance upon discharge from hospital.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients flagged by the emergency department's admissions database as being eligible for Care Navigation who are capable of providing written, informed consent (at clinician's discretion) will be given information about the study. Those who give consent will have baseline information collected. The trial staff in the emergency department will contact the off-site randomisation officer who will register the patient to the trial. Once registered, the participant will be allocated either the Care Navigation or Current Standard Care intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>The trial statistician will generate a randomisation list using a permuted block design. This randomisation list will provide the trial number and intervention for sequentially-registered trial participants. This list will be kept at the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, who will provide an IVRS-based randomisation service.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial hopes to improve the quality of life of patients whose age, heart or respiratory condition means that they regularly attend the emergency department. It aims to reduce the number of times patients come to hospital by improving the patient's home-based care plan. To do this, hospital staff will contact the patient's GP and other community-based health providers to discuss the best care plan. The outcomes of these patients will be compared to patients who do not receive this extra care planning.</summary>
