  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be a single treatment arm. Patients will donate 250 - 300mL of blood, from which T cells will be isolated and expanded. A minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6 intravenous infusions of 1-2 x10e7 /m2 autologous ex vivo expanded, polyclonal, bulk, CMV-specific T cells will be given at weeks 0,2,4,6,10 and 14. The number of infusions may be limited by the number of cells generated.</interventions>

    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Safety: The primary measure of safety of CTL adoptive transfer is via adverse events reporting. These will be represented and assessed as follows. 1. Line listings of individuals with clinical and laboratory adverse reactions. 2. Summaries of adverse clinical events including graft versus host disease by severity and relation to adoptive transfer of CMV-CTL 3. Shift tables for laboratory parameters. 4. Graphical representation of selected laboratory values over time. Sample Size: Given 30 participants with 6 exposures per participant the study has a 0.999 probability of observing at least one participant experiencing an adverse event if the probability of that event occurring is assumed to be 0.2 and every exposure produces the AE in those people who are susceptible. Equivalent probabilities for observing AEs which affect 1 in 10 people and 1 in 15 people are 0.958 and 0.874 respectively. Alternatively, using exact (binomial) confidence intervals, if 0 of the 30 participants experienced a particular AE, we would be 95% confident that the population rate for this AE lies somewhere in the range 0% to 11.6%. If 1 of the 30 participants experienced a particular AE, the corresponding 95% confidence interval is 0.08% to 17.2% and for 2 of 30 the 95% confidence interval is 0.08% to 22.1%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study involves participants who have undergone solid organ transplantation and are either experiencing human cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease or are at risk of developing it. The study is assessing the feasibility of generating T cells (a type of white blood cell) that target CMV, and the effect of these cells when infused into participants.  Eligible participants will donate 250-300mL of blood to expand CMV-specific T cells which will form their treatment. Participants will receive 2-6 intravenous infusions of T cells. The effects of the treatment will be studied by monitoring signs and symptoms and by blood tests.  Total length of involvement in the study will be no longer than 10 months.</summary>
