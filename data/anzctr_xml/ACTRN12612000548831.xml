    <studytitle>Waikato Follow-up Study of People Admitted to Hospital with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have abnormal cardiac biomarkers, compared to those who do not have abnormal cardiac biomarkers and those who do not receive ventilatory support, do the abnormalities of cardiac biomarkers normalise when the patients are in stable COPD, do they reflect underlying abnormal cardiac function and do they have higher morbidity and mortality rate?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>In patients with exacerbation of COPD, the levels of cardiac biomarkers will be measured during hospitalisation, before and after non-invasive ventilation (in those who receive non-invasive ventilation) and during 30-day follow up. Those with abnormal cardiac biomarkers will have cardiac functional assessment to see if they have any correlation. They will also be followed up for a year for morbidity and mortality. We also compared levels of cardiac biomarkers in patients who received nebulised bronchodilators, frusemide, oxygen supplementation, who had acidaemia, hypercapnia and hypoxaemia and according to severity score, to determine factors for abnormal cardiac biomarkers during exacerbations of COPD.</interventions>
    <comparator>In patients receiving non-invasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure, the trend of cardiac biomarkers will be compared to those patients who non-invasive ventilation is not indicated.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>COPD is very common and carries significant health and socioeconomic burden. Blood markers of impaired heart function are found to be raised in some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study is looking at the abnormality in the blood levels of these markers in COPD exacerbations and during stable period, to see if they are related to impaired heart function and the factors that might contribute to the abnormality. Heart function will be assessed by MRI scan of the heart. Those having acute severe worsening of their disease will require assisted breathing with a mask attached to a ventilator, named non-invasive ventilator (NIV), which is also in heart failure to reduce the work load of the heart. This study is also trying to find out if the level of these blood markers changes after NIV. This would suggest that there is an underlying impairment in heart function in patients with COPD which is not normally looked for. The outcome of this study will improve the treatment of COPD.</summary>
