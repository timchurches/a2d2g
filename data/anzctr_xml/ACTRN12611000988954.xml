  <interventions>
    <interventions>Alpha galactosyl epitopes are synthesized on lymphoma and pancreatic carcinoma cell membrane with alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase in vitro. Subsequently, the processed cancer cell membranes in the presence of human natural anti-Gal IgG, result in the opsonisation of the effective phagocytosis by dendritic cells which are co-cultured with the newly differentiated T/CIKs (cytokine induced killer cells) from bone marrow stem cells to generate tumour specific immune responders ex vivo. The lymphoma and pancreatic cancer patients receive the first injection on the third day of finishing the radio- or chemotherapy, and the subsequent doses are given every week. The first single dose is initiated at 2X10(9) cells iv injection. If no side-effects, iv injection dosage increases to 10X10(9) on the second week, and escalates to 20x10(9) cells on the third week. The total injections are 3-6 times depending on the avaibility of tumour sample. The safety and effectiveness are investigated. For example, the phenotype (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD19, CD45RO and CD56) and interferon-gamma expression in the peripheral blood lymphocytes are measured before injection and one week after the third injection.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effectiveness: 1. Survival time; 
2. The measurement of tumour specific immune responders, e.g. The tumour-specific cytotoxicity will be measured by interferon-gamma ELISPOT( enzyme-linked immunospot assay) and the phenotype of the peripheral blood lymphocytes in the studied group will be analysed using flow cytometry before and one week after the third injection.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dendritic cell (DC) and cytokine induced killer cell (CIK)-based therapy can induce specific antitumor T cell responses. This clinical pilot study examines feasibility and outcome of the tumour specific treatment for patients with advanced lymphoma and later stage pancreartic carcinoma. Procedures: Alpha-gal epitopes are synthesized on pancreatic carcinoma and lymphoma cell membrane with enzyme(alpha galactosyltransferase) in vitro. Subsequently, the processed membranes in the presence of human natural anti-Gal epitope IgG, resulted in the opsonisation of the effective phagocytosis by dendritic cells (DCs) which are co-cultured with cytokine induced killer cells (CIKs) to generate pancreatic carcinoma and lymphoma specific immune responders ex vivo.</summary>
