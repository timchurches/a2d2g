  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pethidine - intravesical, 1 mg/kg, as required up to every 4 hours post-operatively for bladder spasm until spasm resolved. Interventional drug to be administered by nursing staff and as such adherence will be monitored. Decision on whether drug to be given also made by nursing staff and/or clinician if available.</interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain Score. All patients will be assessed for pain (bladder spasm and wound scores)  using standardised pain scores and pain assessment tools depending on their age and intellectual abilities by the ward nurses as well as by the research team. eg. Visual Analogue Scale, FPS-R (Faces Pain Scale - Revised),</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed for pain scores 2 hourly during the day and 4 hourly at night throughout the duration of their hospital admission. If the study drug (or placebo) is given they will be assessed: immediately prior to the instillation of the drug, during the installation of the drug, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 min after the instillation. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of episodes of breakthrough pain from bladder spasm. To be documented by nursing staff at time of episode.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During hospital admission post-operatively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall analgesia requirements. Opioid consumption (via the fentanyl infusion) as well as the use and doses of rescue analgesia will be recorded at each assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Throughout hospital admission post-operatively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intensity of bladder spasms.  To be documented using standardised pain scores and pain assessment tools depending on their age and intellectual abilities by the ward nurses as well as by the research team. eg. Visual Analogue Scale, FPS-R (Faces Pain Scale - Revised),</outcome>
      <timepoint>During post operative admission in hospital To be measured immediately prior to the instillation of the drug, during the installation of the drug, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 min after the instillation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim:
The aim is to assess the efficacy of intravesical pethidine in controlling bladder spasm in children after ureteric reimplantation surgery.

Hypothesis:
Children receiving intravesical pethidine will have less episodes of bladder spasm requiring therapy, lower pain scores and lower intravenous opioid requirements compared with children receiving placebo (saline) following ureteric reimplantation surgery
