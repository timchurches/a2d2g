    <designfeatures>Participants will be assigned to different dosages or placebo depending on which cohort they are enrolled into. This study will be performed in adult healthy volunteers (up to 36 subjects in 6 cohorts). The study will commence with Cohort 1 and progression to subsequent cohorts will be subject to review of safety and tolerability data generated from the previous cohorts. In general, each cohort consists of an eligibility/screening period of up to 3 weeks, a treatment period involving administration of a single dose of ATYR1923 (study drug) or placebo and a 4-week follow-up period.</designfeatures>
