  <interventions>
    <interventions>Obese subjects will undergo a 12-week period of dietary restriction which will entail a 30% reduction of total energy intake, using a macronutrient-balanced (15% protein, 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat) diet.  A standard 6000, 7000kJ and 8000kJ dietary intake using Lite and Easy menu structure will be utilised. Lean individuals will only be studied during a 4-day period of dietary restriction.  During this time subjects will be given a complete meal plan to follow on a day-to-day basis and a meal check list to ensure they comply with the diet.  The meal plan will contain a variety of foods for the subject to consume to ensure a varied diet.  Compliance with the diet will be checked regularly throughout the study by a dietician, and subjects will be provided with all study food, including all meals and snacks, to facilitate adherence to the diet. Obese subjects will attend the laboratory on 4 days and lean subjects will attend on 2 days, to evaluate the effects of the dietary manipulations on GI motility, hormone release, appetite and energy intake in response to intraduodenl infusion of fat (Intralipid) at a rate of 2.86 kcal/min for 120 min. At the end of each study day, oral fatty acid taste thresholds will also be determined in each individual.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Antropyloroduodenal motility -
During the 120 minute infusion antropyloduodenal motility will be assessed via changes in the pressures within the antrum, pylorus and duodenum which are captured by sensors on the catheter, and connected to a computer-based system, running commercially available hardware (Flexisoft)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 min during the infusion period on each study day.
Study days for:
Obese - days 1 and 4 and weeks 4 and 12
Lean - days 1 and 4</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hormone release -
Cholecystokinin (CCK) and Peptide YY (PYY). Blood samples were drawn from subjects every 15 minutes until t=120, and then once more at t=150. Radioimmuno assays were used to determine the concentration of these hormones in plasma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 and 150 min during the infusion period on each study day.
Study days for:
Obese - days 1 and 4 and weeks 4 and 12
Lean - days 1 and 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake-
At t = 120 min the infusion will be discontinued, and the subject extubated and offered a cold buffet-style meal (t = 120 - 150 min). The meal will be weighted before and after consumption to for the assessment of energy intake using Foodwork</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 120 min after the infusion period on each study day.
Study days for:
Obese - days 1 and 4 and weeks 4 and 12
Lean - days 1 and 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oral fatty acid taste thresholds -
Taste thresholds were determined by 3 ascending forced choice procedure</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 210 min one hour after comsumption of the buffet meal on each study day.
Study days for:
Obese - days 1 and 4 and weeks 4 and 12
Lean - days 1 and 4</timepoint>
