  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate how 3 new types of drug formulations are absorbed by the body.
      This study is termed 'open-label', which means volunteers will be aware of which treatment
      they are receiving. The study involves all volunteers receiving all 3 different formulations,
      as a single dose, and there is no placebo (dummy-drug; no active ingredient) in this study.
      Volunteers will also receive a single dose of a formulation used in previous trials
      (reference formulation), so as a proper comparison with the new formulations can be made. One
      of the new formulations will also be administered along with food, to assess if the drug
      performs or is absorbed differently.</summary>
