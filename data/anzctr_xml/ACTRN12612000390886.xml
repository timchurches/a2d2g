  <interventions>
    <interventions>14-hour Youth Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) course which teaches adults who care for or work with teenagers, the skills needed to recognize the early signs of mental illness, identify potential mental health-related crises, and assist teenagers to get the help they need as early as possible.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants were enrolled via online registration and prompted to choose a date for a telephone survey for themselves and their teenager. Following completion of the online consent form, the parent was prompted to select 2 course dates from a list of courses displayed in two columns. One column contained YMHFA courses, the other contained First Aid courses but columns were not labelled. After selecting one course from each column, the parent was sent an automatic email listing both course dates. Immediately on conclusion of their course selection, the parent was randomized into one of their chosen courses, but not advised as to which course they were randomized into at this stage. Allocation was concealed from the Trial Manager, by computer. Randomization was carried out by a random integer generator programmed on the trial website to give values of 1=Youth MHFA and 2=First Aid (see http://php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php). Participants’ demographics including course randomization were downloaded by the Trial Manager in batches of approx 10 and emailed to the Social Research Centre (SRC) for baseline interview, prior to the parents’ course attendance. At the conclusion of the telephone interview, the parent was advised of their course type and date by the Telephone Interviewer. This was confirmed by email by the Trial Manager.</concealment>
    <sequence>Software which generated a random integer of 1=YMHFA or 2=First Aid (see http://php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php) was installed on the trial website. The program ran immediately after the parent selected their 2 courses. Course selection was allowed only once (i.e. participants could not change their course dates themselves).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial is being led by Professor Anthony Jorm from the School of Population Health, Population Mental Health Group at The University of Melbourne. One thousand families in Victoria are invited to participate, consisting of one parent and one teenager (aged between 12-15 years) per family. Parents will be randomly assigned to either a 14 hour Youth Mental Health First Aid course or a 15 hour Australian Red Cross Apply First Aid course. The study will assess whether parents who are trained in physical or mental health first aid respond differently to teenagers who develop physical or mental health problems. Telephone surveys will be conducted on both the parent and teenager before the parent can attend their free training course. Parents will be asked about their knowledge about mental and physical first aid, confidence in supporting a teenager with a mental or physical health problem and self-reported supportive behaviours if their teenager or someone they know develops a mental or physical health problem and perceptions of their own mental health. Teenagers will be asked about their intentions to seek help and actual help-seeking from family and professionals for mental health problems depicted in vignettes, perceptions of support from the parent if the teenager develops a mental health problem and perceptions of their own mental health and general social support from the parent. Both telephone surveys will ask about stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness. One year after the initial telephone survey, parents and teenagers will be asked to complete another telephone survey. This will continue on an annual basis, for possibly up to ten years, subject to funding being available. The project has received ethics approval (ID: 1135679) and is funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council Australia Fellowship.</summary>
