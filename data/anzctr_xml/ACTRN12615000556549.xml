    <interventions>EpiNet-First Trial 2: patients with generalised seizures for whom sodium valproate is suitable will be randomised (1:1) to receive levetiracetam or sodium valpoate.

Levetiracetam. Oral medication. Duration of treatment administration = 2 years. Dose to be determined by investigator according to usual clinical practice. The range of doses will vary from 250 mg to 4000 mg (oral tablets) daily in two divided doses and will be determined as considered clinically appropriate by the investigator. Adherence will be assessed by the investigators checking regularly with patients whether they are taking the drug as prescribed. Serum drug levels are not required as part of the study, but will be monitored as determined by the investigator and considered appropriate for good clinical care.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint for the EpiNet-First trial 2 is time to 12 month remission from seizures; The outcome is assessed by self-reporting of seizures by participants</outcome>
      <timepoint>The duration of the study is expected to be 5 years, with a 3 year recruitment period and a minimum 2 year follow-up period for each participant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite secondary outcome. Proportion of patients who achieve a seizure free 12 month remission by 18 months AND who have not changed to a different AED. This outcome is assessed by self-reporting of seizures by participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomisation to 18 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to treatment failure, due to either inadequate seizure control, or due to unacceptable adverse events. Treatment is deemed to have failed when the investigator changes the randomised anti-epileptic drug to a different anti-epileptic drug. Unacceptable adverse events may be either side effects (e.g. dizziness, fatigue, inablitlity to concentrate) which the participant and investigator agree are sufficiently incapacitating to warrant changing the drug, or abnormalities on examination or laboratory investigation (e.g. blood tests) that the investigator considers are sufficiently severe to terminate treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomisation to treatment failure. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 2 years up to 5 years post enrolment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Time to treatment failure due to inadequate seizure control. Treatment is deemed to have failed when the investigator changes the randomised anti-epileptic drug to a different anti-epileptic drug. </outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomisation to treatment failure due to inadequate seizure control. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 2 years up to 5 years post enrolment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to treatment failure due to unacceptable adverse events. Unacceptable adverse events may be either side effects (e.g. dizziness, fatigue, inablitlity to concentrate) which the participant and investigator agree are sufficiently incapacitating to warrant changing the drug, or abnormalities on examination or laboratory investigation (e.g. blood tests) that the investigator considers are sufficiently severe to terminate treatment. There are no study-specific tests which are mandated in the protocol; tests will be at the clinical discretion of the investigator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomisation to treatment failure due to unacceptable adverse events. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 2 years up to 5 years post enrolment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to first seizure. This outcome is assessed by self-reporting of seizures by participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Randomisation to first seizure. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 2 years up to 5 years post enrolment.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>From randomisation to 24 month remission. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 2 years up to 5 years post enrolment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serious Adverse events attributed to the trial medication or other anti-epileptic medication. These are as follow: result in death
are life-threatening* (subject at immediate risk of death)
require in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; **
result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or
consist of a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Other important medical events***

*life-threatening in the definition of serious refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
**Hospitalisation is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalisation is a precautionary measure for continued observation. Hospitalisations for a pre-existing condition, including elective procedures that have not worsened, do not constitute a Serious Adverse Event.
***Other important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalisation may be considered a serious adverse event / experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

      <timepoint>From randomisation to onset of SAE. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 2 years up to 5 years post enrolment.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life as assessed by the QOLIE31 and QOLIE48 questionnaires. These are validated, and are widely used in epilepsy research.</outcome>

    <concealment>Patients will be approached at emergency departments and outpatient clinics, (including 1st seizure clinics, epilepsy clinics). Once consent has been obtained participants are randomised via the EpiNet database. Block randomisation is being used, with stratification for age (&lt; 18, &gt;=18 yr), sex, and country. Allocation concealment is obtained by means of central randomisation by computer using block randomisation and variable block sizes.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The EpiNet-First Trial 2 Recruitment rate will be reviewed regularly, and annual progress reports regarding patient recruitment will be prepared and forwarded to the Independent Advisory group and appropriate ethics committees.
No interim analysis is planned.
Statistical analyses will be performed on EpiNet-First Trial 2, using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC). Trial data will be collected using the EpiNet web-based database, and extracted into SAS for data quality checks and final statistical analysis when all patients have a minimum two year follow-up data at the end of the trial.
The primary analysis of time to 12 month remission from seizures will be on an intention to treat (ITT) basis including all randomised patients regardless of whether they actually satisfied the entry criteria, the treatment actually received, and subsequent withdrawal or deviation from the protocol. Secondary per protocol (PP) analyses will also be undertaken to assess the robustness of ITT analyses. This analysis will include all randomised patients who have taken the prescribed study drug and who do not have major protocol violations. All statistical tests will be two-sided and a 5% significance level maintained throughout the analyses. Confidence intervals for all point estimates will be two-sided 95% intervals. For EpiNet-First Trial 2, the proposed sample size will provide 90% power at 5% significance level (two-sided) to identify a 10% or greater difference in 12 month disease-free survival at 2 years between the groups, allowing for 10% loss to follow up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Levetiracetam is being compared with  sodium valproate in patients with new-onset epilepsy who have generalised seizures. Four other closely related trials are being conducted, with the entry criteria for each trial determined by the seizure type that the patient experiences. Sustained seizure freedom (at least 12 months seizure free) is the primary endpoint</summary>
