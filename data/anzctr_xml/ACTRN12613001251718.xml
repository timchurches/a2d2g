Pre-study power calculation yields a sample size of 13 patients, to have 90% power (at alpha equals 0.05, two sided test) to detect a 10% difference, assuming a minimum difference of 100 mls between treatment groups. To be conservative, 15 patients will be included. FEV1 and FVC are highly reproducible in most patients, with differences between highest and lowest values of less than 6%, and these data are applicable to LAM patients. The advantage of a double blind crossover design is that variation is minimized. When considering the degree of change in FEV1 that is considered clinically meaningful by the regulators, a change of 510% from baseline values is usually considered to be clinically important, or an increase of FEV1 of greater than 12% or 200 mls. However, in this trial we are selecting for subjects who do not have bronchodilator reversibility so only a small lung function change is anticipated. In LAM, both FEV1 and DLCO have been reported as predictors of progression but a change in DLCO is not expected to change in this short-term trial, so this measurement is a secondary rather than a primary outcome variable).</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary outcome, the FEV1 response measured in milliliters per week over the course of 2 weeks (the FEV1 change), will be analyzed as the difference in the FEV1 slope between the placebo group and the indacterol group. Differences in FEV1 will be analysed by a students matched pair t-test.
For categorical outcomes, the data will be compared using Fisher's exact test or the chi-square test, as appropriate. For continuous variables, the medians will be compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. p values of less than 0.05  will be considered to indicate statistical significance. All reported p values will be two-sided, and unadjusted for multiple testing. All analyses will be performed with the use of SPSS software, version 4.0. .Data will be presented for the complete intent-to-treat population (all patients having taken at least one dose of study medication) as well as the per-protocol population (all patients who completed the study without major protocol deviations). 

FeNO values will be log transformed and analysed using paired t-tests. ENA analysis will take place using appropriate statistics. Smellprints using the Cyranose 320 will be analysed using on-board learning software. SavitzkyGolay filtering (which performs a local polynomial regression (of degree k) on a series of values) will be utilised to process the sensor response data and baseline corrections will be applied to improve signal-to-noise ratio. To reduce the data from 32 individual sensors to a set of principal components, principal component analysis (PCA) will be used. This determines factors that capture the largest variance in the data. PCA factors will be then used to perform a linear canonical discrimination analysis for the construction of a pattern recognition algorithm. This will be achieved by enhancing the ratio of pooled within-class scatter to between-group distance. A cross validation value (CVV%) will be calculated, to give an estimate of error, or in other words, the accuracy in distinction between the smellprints from different subject groups. The Mahalanobis distance (M-distance) between group means, in units of standard deviation, will be calculated. This will be used to quantify the discrimination between sample groups, providing a measure of dissimilarity between two samples. Thus, M-distance and the ability to discriminate are directly related, so that values greater than 3 will be indicative of a high probability of discrimination (p less than 0.01).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease restricted to adult women. This may occur either sporadically (s-LAM) or in association with tuberous sclerosis (TSC-LAM). The lungs of patients with LAM are infiltrated by smooth muscle cells (LAM cells).There is a very limited evidence base for treatment of LAM and it is only recently that the first randomised trials have been initiated. The LAM clinic at St Vincents follows the largest number of women with LAM in Australia, currently approximately 40 patients. The first ever trial into the efficacy of doxycycline in LAM was completed at St Vincents LAM clinic, and this new study aims to assist the breathlessness associated with this disease and evaluate the mechanisms underlying this.
Indacaterol is a novel, inhaled, once-daily, ultra-long-acting beta 2-agonist for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Bronchodilator agents are frequently prescribed in LAM but have never been the subject of a clinical trial. Long acting beta2-agonists have been described as having anti-proliferative effects on smooth muscle in vitro as well as in vitro, but these agents have not yet been investigated in LAM. It is theoretically possible that women with LAM will respond clinically, and it is also possible that indacaterol might have a beneficial effect within the airway. This trial will evaluate indacaterol in LAM using a classical study design ie. a double blind placebo controlled trial, in 15 women with LAM.</summary>
