  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants with ABI will be randomly allocated to participate in either six week of: (A) computer-based memory training, (B) compensatory memory rehabilitation (Memory Skills Group) or C) waitlist control group. Participants will complete memory tests and questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention and 6-week follow-up. 

A) Computer-based memory training: Participants will complete Lumosity (computer-based memory games) at home for 30 minutes per session, five times per week for six weeks.. LumosityTM offers memory specific training designed primarily to assist in the domains of working memory, visuospatial memory, processing speed, attention, cognitive flexibility and problem solving. Participants can flexibly decide upon which days and times to train . There are 13 different memory games that form part of the training which were selected by the researchers. These games include Face Memory Workout, Familiar Faces, Follow that Frog, Memory Lane, Memory Match, Memory Match Overdrive, Memory Matrix, Moneycomb, Monster Garden, Pinball Recall, Rhyme Workout, Rotation Matrix, and Tidal Treasure. The order in which the games were presented was varied across sessions in order to maximise engagement and the order was set by the researchers. The  Researchers will be in regular contact with participants throughout the 6 week training period to address any concerns or technical complications. Frequency of training will be monitored electronically by researchers. 
B) Memory Skills Group: Participants will complete the 6-week, Memory Skills Group which focuses on practical training of internal and external memory strategies and education. The 2-hour sessions will be weekly for six weeks, at Epworth HealthCare Camberwell, Richmond or Brighton, and will be facilitated by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a trained clinical neuropsychologist, speech pathologist and occupational therapist. Staff will be trained to facilitate the Memory Skills Group. Sessions will be video recorded and randomly reviewed for treatment consistency across sites. Groups provide participants with education surrounding the impact of brain injury on memory and cover a number of strategies that aim to minimise the impact of these changes on daily functioning. Strategies taught include ways of remembering names, conversations and finding your way around. Some of the strategies taught include internal strategies such as repetition, association, visual imagery and attending to detail, and external strategies such as diaries, calendars, note-taking and using electronic devices. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Memory problems are among the most common cognitive difficulties after acquired brain injury (ABI), and can significantly compromise an individuals ability to perform day-to-day tasks and quality of life. Computer-based training and compensatory approaches are two therapeutic approaches used to improve memory difficulties. The evidence to support the effectiveness of either approach is limited. This study will compare the efficacy of computer-based training versus compensatory memory rehabilitation approaches with regard to improving 1) memory and 2) performance in day-to-day tasks. Participants with ABI will be randomly allocated to participate in either six week of: (A) computer-based memory training, (B) compensatory memory rehabilitation (Memory Skills Group) or C) waitlist control group. This study will establish which approach to memory rehabilitation is most effective and which approach maximises daily functioning and quality of life for individuals with ABI.</summary>
