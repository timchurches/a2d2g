  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a dose finding study to assess the efficacy of increasing doses of colestipol hydrochloride in patients on haemodialysis.  After a successful screening procedure, eligible patients undergo a 2 week washout period when all current phosphate binding medications are stopped. After this washout period all patients with a serum phosphate that reaches 1.7 mmol/L or greater will be started on orally administered colestipol treatment.  The starting dose of colestipol will vary depending on the phosphate level at the end of the washout period.  Those with a phosphate level of 2.5mmol/L or higher will start on two, 1 gram tablets three times a day.  Those with a phosphate level below 2.5 will start on one, 1 gram tablet three times a day.  This dose will be up-titrated at two week intervals for patients who fail to achieve a target phosphate of less than 1.7mmol/L.  Each increment in dose will be of one 1g tablet three times a day.  The treatment period will last for 8 weeks, with three potential up-titrations, and a maximum dose of 4g three times a day.  After completion of the treatment period, patients will undergo a second 2 week washout period to see if any changes in phosphate level revert to first to pre-treatment levels.
Compliance is to be monitored by returned pill counts and weekly visits and managed with protocol deviation logs.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no direct comparison group but active treatment is preceded and followed by a washout phase of previous phosphate  binder treatment, in accordance with usual trial design for this type of intervention.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Over 2000 New Zealanders suffer from end-stage kidney disease and require ongoing dialysis treatment. Because high phosphate levels are common in kidney disease and contribute to complications, phosphate binding drugs are needed in dialysis patients. Calcium and aluminium based drugs are most commonly used but have significant limitations, and other alternatives are expensive. Colestipol is a drug used for high cholesterol, but also may work as an alternative inexpensive phosphate binder. This trial is intended to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of colestipol as a phosphate binder in haemodialysis patients.</summary>
