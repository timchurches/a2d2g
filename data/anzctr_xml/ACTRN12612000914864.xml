  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In order to reach the governments goal to have a smokefree New Zealand by 2025, radical changes need to be made at both the policy and practical level as the business as usual approach to smoking cessation will not achieve the goal.  A nicotine reduction strategy is one approach that may help reduce the level of nicotine dependence in smokers, resulting in a greater chance of quitting. However, insufficient data exist on what would happen if a nicotine reduction policy was implemented, or what form such a policy should take.</summary>
