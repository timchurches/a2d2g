    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - RO7062931
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Part 1: Single-Ascending Dose (SAD) - Healthy volunteers will be enrolled in up to 8 cohorts with doses starting from 0.1 mg/kg and escalating sequentially after review of safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data.

Experimental: Part 2: Multiple Ascending Dose - Participants with Chronic Hepatitis B will enrolled in Part 2. In Part 2a, participants will receive two monthly injections of either 3 doses equivalent to a multiple of the saturation dose or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. In Part 2b a dose selected from Part 2a based on HBsAg decline or the max dose well tolerated, will be administered to participants randomized in 2 parallel cohorts where they will receive either the full dose every two weeks (3 doses), or half the dose weekly (5 doses). Each of the two cohorts in Part 2b will include participants receiving active drug or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.


Treatment: drugs: RO7062931
Administered subcutaneously in Parts 1 and 2. Part 1 will be administered in single-ascending doses after 0.1 mg/kg starting dose. Subsequent doses of 0.3, 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg may be administered based upon tolerability. In Part 2a, participants will receive two monthly doses of either 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 times the saturation dose or placebo. In Part 2b a dose selected from Part 2a based on HBsAg decline or the max dose well tolerated, will be administered to participants randomized in 2 parallel cohorts where they will receive either the full dose every two weeks (3 doses), or half the dose weekly (5 doses).

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Part 1 cohorts: active drug vs placebo 4:1. Part 2a 4 parallel cohorts of 3 active drug doses and placebo in 1:1:1:1. Part 2b active drug vs placebo in 3:1 in 2 parallel cohorts.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized study will be conducted in two parts to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of RO7062931. Part 1
      will include only healthy participants and Part 2 will include only participants with chronic
      hepatitis B (CHB). Part 1 is an adaptive, single-ascending dose study with an adaptive
      dose-escalating schedule to determine the best dose to be evaluated in participants with CHB.
      Part 2 is an adaptive, parallel multiple-dose study comprised of two sub-parts which will be
      used to further refine the dose and dosing regimen.</summary>
