             steroids are not included in this exclusion criterion.

          -  Anticipated to receive oral or injected antibiotic therapy within the 72 hours prior
             to the study blood draw. Topical antibiotics or antibiotic drops are not included in
             this exclusion criterion.

          -  Suspected or known hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components.

          -  Thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder contraindicating intramuscular (IM)
             vaccination.

          -  Parent or legal guardian unable or unwilling to comply with the stu dy procedures.

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial in the 30 days preceding
             enrollment, or participation in another clinical trial involving the investigation of
             a drug, vaccine, medical procedure, or medical device during the subject's trial
             period.

          -  Diagnosed with any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a
             health risk to the subject or interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine.

          -  Received any vaccine in the 30-day period prior to receipt of study vaccine, or
             scheduled to receive any vaccination other than influenza vaccination and
             hyposensitization therapy in the 30-day period after receipt of any study vaccine.
             Hyposensitization therapy and influenza vaccination may be received up to 14 days
             before or 14 days after receiving the study vaccines.

          -  History of seizures, including febrile seizures, or any other neurologic disorder.
