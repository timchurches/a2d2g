  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomised to receive either the intervention described below plus standard care, or to standard care only. The intervention is a one-off session in addition to standard care. A nurse uses the PREDICT computer programme in an individual session (30 minutes) with hospitalised acute coronary syndrome patients to go through personal risk factors and calculation of personal cardiac risk. The nurse explains the computer printout of personal risk to the patient. PREDICT is the registered trademark of the computer programme.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group receives standard care only. In standard care, patients receive a visit from a cardiac rehabilitation nurse who provides pamphlets on heart disease and invites patients to attend community rehabilitation classes.</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Rehabilitation</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accuracy of patients' understanding of their personal cardiac risk. Accuracy is assessed by patients' estimation of personal level of cardiac risk compared to clinical risk estimate by software. </outcome>
