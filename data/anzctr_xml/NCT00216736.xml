  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to determine if a single dose of oral dexamethasone at the time of
      discharge from the emergency department (ED) [after successful treatment] prevents rebound
      headache.

      Hypothesis: That single dose oral dexamethasone 8mg reduces the proportion of patients who
      suffer rebound headache after treatment for migraine in the ED.</summary>
