  <interventions>
    <interventions>Currently stage 3-4 CKD patients attend a renal clinic to see a nephrologist every 3-4 months. Patients allocated to the intervention group will attend a renal clinic and be seen by a CKD nurse. The clinic will be held at the same time as the current renal clinic and enrolled patients will be seen one on one by a CKD nurse. Each clinic visit will take 30minutes.  Patients will be seen by the CKD nurse once every 3-4months for a period of 2 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator group will be patients who continue to attend the usual clinic run by a nephrologist.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The care of stable Stage 3-4 CKD patients reviewed every 3-4 months in a clinic run by a CKD nurse will not be inferior to the care of these patients having 3-4 monthly reviews with nephrologists.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be seen by a member of the study group (usually their treating doctor who may be one of the researchers) who will explain the project to them. All potential participants will be provided with a copy of the patient information sheet and allowed sufficient time to consider the information and seek other advice. Potential participants will also be informed that they may choose not to participate in the study without this affecting their ongoing medical treatment. Participants will be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudicing their usual medical care.
Allocating group: master randomisation list was created by an independent staff member not on the study team. Secure randomisation envelopes are then opened in numerical order once a patient has consented.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the increase due to the rising incidence of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, leading to an increased demand on the healthcare system. 

Currently, the management of a patient with chronic kidney disease involves 3 - 4monthly review with a kidney specialist.  However, we are aware that nurses play a vital role in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease and studies in Canada and South Australia have demonstrated that the regular monitoring of these patients can be safely managed by a nurse who specialises in this area.  The nurse discusses the investigation results and patients ongoing management with a kidney specialist and liaises with the family doctor.

Patients allocated to the CKD nurse group will be seen at the renal clinic by a CKD nurse every 3-4months for a period of 2 years.</summary>
