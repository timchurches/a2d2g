  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants receive Traditional Thai Massage by a physiotherapist on one occasion only. Each upper extremity is massaged for 15 minutes.  The left upper extremity is massaged first, followed by the right upper extremity. Participants left and right hands are randomised to one of two treatment options: 

1. Massage on hand (with out glove) 15 minute, then thermography test and a nylon fabric glove is worn on the hand for a 10 minute, then remove glove for the last thermography test.

2. A nylon fabric glove is worn on the hand during the 15 minute massage (massage together with glove: control treatment) and remove glove for thermography test (hand thermal imager), then wearing glove back agian 10 minute, then remove glove for the last thermography test.

Massage started with left hand and continually go along side with right hand. All process take a time about 40-45 minute.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control treatment: A nylon fabric glove is worn on the hand during the 15 minute Traditional Thai massage (group 2, mentioned above, which group is the control treatment) and then remove fore thermography test, then wearing glove again 10 minute, then  remove fore thermography test.</comparator>
