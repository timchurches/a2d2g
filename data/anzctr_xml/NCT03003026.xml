Experimental: Novel task-specific program - Intervention arm - see detailed intervention group description below

Active Comparator: Parent-led home-based program - Comparison arm - see detailed comparison group description below


Other interventions: Novel task-specific bike skills training program
Participants randomised to the intervention group will participate in a novel task-specific bike skills training program. The intervention involves seven key components: it is group-based, intensive (2 hours per day for 3 days plus a home program for the remaining days of the one week period), task-specific, goal-directed, and therapist led, with parent involvement and conducted in an ecological setting. Each program will be run by a physiotherapist and allied health assistant during the school holidays.

Other interventions: Parent-led home-based bike skills training program
The comparison group will involve a parent-led home-based bike skills training program. Parents of children randomized to the comparison group will receive written information and telephone support from a physiotherapist on training bike skills. They will be encouraged to work with their child towards their bike skills goals for at least 30-45 minutes per day over a one week period during the school holidays in home and community environments.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Goal attainment at 1 week post the intervention period as measured by the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) - The GAS is a criterion referenced tool for individualized and collaborative goal setting between the child, family and therapist. Two to three individualized goals specific to two-wheel bike riding per participant will be set at the baseline visit with six potential outcomes specified for each goal from (-3 (deterioration), -2 (equal to start), -1 (less than expected), 0 (expected), 1 (somewhat more than expected), 2 (more than expected)). For each goal, attainment is defined as a score of zero or above on the GAS. The primary outcome, goal attainment, will be defined as attainment of at least one goal to an expected (score of zero) or greater level.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An assessor blinded multi-centre randomized controlled trial will be conducted in which 60
      participants will be randomized to either a novel task-specific approach to training bike
      skills or a parent-led home program comparison group. Baseline assessment will take place
      within 6 weeks prior to starting the intervention (T0) and outcomes will be assessed within a
      week following (T1); and at 12 - 14 weeks following (T2) the week long intervention. The
      primary outcome is attainment of individualised two-wheel bike specific goals at T1. All
      statistical analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Logistic regression
      will be used to assess the effect of providing the novel intervention compared to the
      parent-led home program on bike-specific goal attainment.</summary>
