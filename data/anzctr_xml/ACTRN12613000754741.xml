  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study, the ASPREE Knee Sub-study, is a sub study of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly study (ASPREE, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01038583, website www.aspree.org). ASPREE is a double blinded, randomised controlled trial of low dose daily aspirin, 100mg oral tablets versus placebo, taken daily for a mean of five years in healthy participants aged 70 and over, followed over a mean of 5 years for the primary outcomes of dementia-free survival and disability-free survival. It is a primary prevention study. 

The ASPREE Knee Sub-study will involve a subset of newly enrolling participants in the parent ASPREE study. 

Prior to enrollment in the ASPREE parent study, those considered likely to be suitable attend a screening visit where baseline examination and testing is organised and run-in medication (placebo) is prescribed. One month later, if entry testing and compliance with run-in medication has been satisfactory (and the GP has authorised participation) each participant is randomised and enters the ASPREE parent study. 

All ASPREE participants are contacted three-monthly by phone in order to maintain compliance.</interventions>
    <comparator>The constituents of the placebo tablets are: calcium hydrogen phosphate dehydrate, cellulose (microcrystalline), citric acid anhydrous, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, maize starch and silica (colloidal anhydrous). </comparator>

    <concealment>Enrollment into the parent study ASPREE is through general practitioner co-investigators. Informed consent for participation in ASPREE is obtained by ASPREE research staff. Enrollment into the ASPREE-KNEE Sub-study takes place after the second baseline ASPREE visit, after  randomisation to either aspirin or placebo in ASPREE.

Randomisation takes place through the parent ASPREE study. All staff remain blinded to treatment allocation through the randomisation procedure.

The randomisation list is generated by an independent statistician using the STATA "ralloc" procedure with randomisation stratified for site and age (&lt;80 yrs and &gt;80 yrs).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health problem. It develops over many years, with progressive loss of articular cartilage. In people over 70, even without radiographic OA, most will have cartilage damage. Loss of cartilage is associated with pain and reduced function. Thus in an older population, it is important to reduce knee cartilage loss, and prevent structural progression.
Low dose aspirin, used in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, may also affect cartilage by a variety of mechanisms. We have pilot data in 2 independent studies suggesting that low dose aspirin may reduce cartilage loss by more than 50%.
The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE,  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01038583, website www.aspree.org) study is a current 5 year randomised placebo controlled trial testing whether low dose aspirin in healthy adults &gt; 70 years prevents cardiovascular disease, cancer and functional decline. 
Within this larger study (ASPREE parent study) we will examine in the ASPREE Knee Sub-study whether the use of low dose aspirin reduces change in knee cartilage volume in older adults.
