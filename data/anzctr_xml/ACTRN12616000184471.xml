  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be provided with website content (in printed format) and a pamphlet about a clinical pathway for screening for anxiety and depression. The clinical pathway was developed by a working group led by PoCoG at the University of Sydney and has been published in Psycho-Oncology. Participants will participate in either a focus groups or semi-structured interview with the aim to collect feedback on the website content and pamphlet, and the participant's understanding of clinical pathways more broadly. Participants will be given the materials at least 2 weeks prior to the focus group or interview date. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews will be conducted by the lead investigator or research officer.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess understanding of a clinical pathway for anxiety and depression screening and treatment in cancer patient.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have a confirmed diagnosis of cancer.
Study details
Participants in this study will all receive website content (in a printed format) and a pamphlet which contain information about a clinical pathway for screening and treatment of anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Clinical pathways provide evidence-based recommendations to guide best practice and consistent care for specific patient concerns. This clinical pathway provides a pathway for screening, assessment, referral and treatment of anxiety and depression in cancer care. It was developed by a working group led by PoCoG at the University of Sydney.
Focus groups and/or semi-structured interviews will then be conducted 2 weeks after participants receive the review materials. The focus groups and semi-structured interviews will collect feedback and assess participants understanding of clinical pathways.
In this study, we will collect feedback so that we can improve the website content and pamphlet as well as determining patient understanding of a clinical pathway.</summary>
