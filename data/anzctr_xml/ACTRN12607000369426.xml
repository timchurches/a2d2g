  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a workstation balance training and weight-bearing exercise program on balance, strength and bone mineral density (BMD) in osteopenic women. As fracture risk has been related to poor balance, strength and BMD in previous literature it was foreseen that improvements in these measures would benefit women at increased risk of fracture through osteopenia. The intervention developed and utilised in this study is aimed at risk factors that are specific for fracture, falls prevention and the population of osteopenic women, it targets a condition that is of high prevalence in the community and uses outcome measures that are mostly easy to assess by clinicians. 

Our hypothesis in this study was that a 20 week program of structured balance training and weight-bearing exercises delivered via workstation format would provide beneficial effects on three factors associated with fractures: balance, strength and bone density, in community-dwelling women with osteopenia.</summary>
