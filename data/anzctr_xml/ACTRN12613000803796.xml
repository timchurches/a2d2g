  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Stepping Stones Triple P - Positive Parenting Program (SSTP) is a system of interventions for parents of children with a disability. SSTP is a form of behavioural family intervention. There are 5 different levels of SSTP, which vary with regards to delivery mode, intensity and breadth of intervention, and amount of practitioner contact. Parents are able to choose the level/s of the program most suited to their needs.

The five levels of SSTP are:

Level 1: Public health media campaign - a broad, multimedia, parent education campaign to raise awareness of the challenges of parenting a child with a disability and to encourage participation in parenting programs.

Level 2: SSTP Seminar Series - Three, 2-hour large group seminars providing information on positive parenting principles. Parents can choose to attend as many of the three seminars they feel are appropriate for their needs.

Level 3: Primary Care SSTP - Brief individual program (4 x 15-30 minute sessions) with a trained practitioner providing strategies on managing specific, parent-identified challenging behaviours. Sessions are conducted weekly. The final session is delivered as needed.

Level 4: Group or Standard or Self-directed SSTP. All programs focus on broad parenting strategies related to a variety of challenging behaviours. Group SSTP is run with groups of parents over 6 x 2.5 hour sessions conducted weekly. Standard SSTP is an individual program offered over 10 x 1 hour sessions conducted weekly. Self-directed SSTP is a parent-completed work book with 10 weeks of parenting exercises or Triple P Online an 8 module program.

Level 5: Enhanced Triple P - Four individual modules with 3-10 individual sessions for parents who have previously completed a different SSTP level and would like extra support. The 1-hour modules cover topics such as parent mental health or family conflict. Sessions are conducted weekly.

Practitioners delivering the SSTP programs will complete a session checklist to track treatment fidelity. This includes checking that parents have completed their homework. Practitioners will also track session attendance by parents and caregivers. This regular monitoring will be given to the research team and used to measure parent outcomes.
</interventions>
    <comparator>A lag sequential design is employed. The target population is parents and caregivers of children aged 2-12 years with a disability. A sub-sample of this population will be randomly assigned to a standard treatment care-as-usual waiting period of 4 weeks or a variable waiting period of between 4 and 8 weeks. During this time participants may access any services or supports from the community as part of standard care. The sub-sample will consist of 900 parents/caregivers of children aged 2 to 10 years with an intellectual disability and experiencing some emotional or behavioural difficulties. Participants in the sub-sample will act as their own controls with a lagged introduction to the intervention after variable waiting periods, in accordance with the experimental design.

There is no control treatment for professionals in the study.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Stepping Stones Project aims to address the significant, unmet mental health needs of young people with disabilities and their families. This project will raise awareness of the importance of early intervention for emotional and behavioural problems in young people with disabilities and improve access to the evidence-based positive parenting intervention, Stepping Stones Triple P. As part of the study, parents and caregivers of children with a disability aged 2-12 will be able to access free Stepping Stones Triple P parenting programs. Professionals will be able to access free training in Stepping Stones Triple P. Stepping Stones Triple P programs will gradually become available across Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. It is expected that participating in Stepping Stones Triple P parenting programs will lead to individual and population-wide reductions in child behavioural and emotional difficulties and parent stress, and improve access to evidence-based parenting programs in the community.</summary>
