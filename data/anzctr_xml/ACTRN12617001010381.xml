  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a phase 2 clinical trial building upon Biobelly, the phase 1 pilot trial (ACTRN 12615001057572). This is the second human study for the intervention of soluble dietary fibre from seaweed. Participants will be recruited and randomly assigned in a cross over design  to 2g or placebo controlled group for soluble extract from seaweed . This is to be ingested daily for 6 weeks and blood and faecel samples will be tested before and after the intervention. Then participants will be crossed to the other treatment arm for a further 6 week intervention, with blood and faecal samples tested again after the second 6 week intervention. Therefore each study participant will be giving blood and faecal samples at 3 time points 6 weeks apart. There is no washout period between the 2 interventions as this is unnecessary. Participants are provided with a calendar sheet to provide daily adherence. Participants will receive more than the requisite amounts of supplements, this will vary accross participants and any unused supplements will be returned at the end of each 6 week intervention period. The record of intake (calendar) and the left over supplements will be monitored as a measure of compliance.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The two boxed treatments are allocated a code A or B by an independent person. 
Numbers 1-80 are randomised using statistical randomisation software and allocated to treatment A or B, treatment jars are then labelled with the same numbers by the independent person. 
The excel spread sheet with the treatment key is printed and locked in 3 independent files at the University of Wollongong. 
The jars are sorted in numerical order and provided to the participants as they sign up to the project. </concealment>
    <sequence>This project uses a simple randomisation to generate a sequence of numbers 1-80 which will be allocated to two treatments. The software used is http://www.randomization.com/ as advised by the University of Wollongong Statistical Consultancy Service. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size calculation was completed using the data from Biobelly our pilot trial. Using a two sided test, with 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05 we calculated that 30 people per group would be sufficient to obtain significant results for our plasma lipid measures. However, because we may encounter participants dropping out during the study period we will recruit up to a maximum of 80 participants to ensure the study is adequately powered. 

The statistical methods used for our study data include t tests to determine the difference between our two treatment groups and the difference in the change of study outcomes between the two groups.
Gut microbiome data will be analysed using multivariate permanova.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to test the effectiveness of a seaweed dietary fibre extract on gut and metabolic health and, consequential effects on inflammatory related Palmoplantar / psoriatic Keratoderma symptoms. This study will follow the initial Bio-Belly Study 1, where we have already found significant outcomes in an overweight population. Improvements were seen in plasma cholesterol, inflammation and insulin, as well as a case study, anecdotal improvement to a psoriatic skin disorder. Therefore, we aim to demonstrate repeated efficacy of the seaweed extract in an independent sample population, and to increase the power by restricting it to overweight participants only, and not obese, as there was a larger effect size in the overweight population. In addition, we would like to recruit to test the anecdotal effect of improvement to psoriatic skin disorders found in the initial trial. We propose to undertake a randomised placebo controlled crossover trial, with two six week treatment arms. Therefore the trial in its entirety will last 12 weeks. </summary>
