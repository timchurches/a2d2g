  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12 - FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose. The analysis included baseline FEV1 measurement, baseline inhaled corticosteroid use (Yes/No), FEV1 prior to inhalation of short-acting ß2 agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 min post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) at Week 26 - The TDI measured changes in dyspnea from baseline during treatment and included 3 domains: Functional impairment (activities of daily living), magnitude of task (intensity of activity), and magnitude of effort (difficulty breathing). Each domain was rated from -3 to 3 (major deterioration-major improvement). The total score ranged from -9 to 9; minus scores indicate deterioration. The analysis included the same covariates as the primary Outcome Measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 26</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health-related Quality of Life (QoL) Assessed With the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at Week 52 - The SGRQ contained 51 patient-rated items divided into three components: Symptoms (respiratory symptoms, their frequency, and severity), Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness), and Impacts (social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease). A total score for the 3 components was calculated and ranged from 0 to 100. Higher values indicate greater impairment of QoL. The analysis included the same covariates as the primary Outcome Measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Moderate or Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation During the Study (Baseline to Week 52) - Time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation was calculated as the number of days from baseline to the day on which the patient experienced the first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation. A COPD exacerbation was considered to be moderate if treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotic was required. A COPD exacerbation was considered to be severe if treatment for moderate severity and hospitalization was required.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 52 (patients with no moderate or severe exacerbations who completed the study were censored at the final visit date, which may have exceeded 52 weeks)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Number of Puffs of Rescue Medication Taken During the Study (Baseline to Week 52) - The number of puffs of rescue medication taken in the previous 12 hours was recorded in the Patient Diary in the morning and evening. The mean daily number of puffs of rescue medication taken was calculated by dividing the number of puffs of rescue medication per day over the 52 weeks of the study by the number of days with non-missing rescue medication data. Rescue medication data recorded during the 14 day run-in period was used to calculate the baseline. The analysis included the same covariates as the primary Outcome Measure. A positive change score indicates more puffs taken.</outcome>

      <outcome>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 1, Week 26, and Week 52 - FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Day 1, Week 12, Week 26, and Week 52 - Trough FVC is defined as the average of the post-dose 23 h 15 min and the 23 h 45 min FVC values. Just prior to FVC measurement, patients performed normal tidal breathing. The patient was given a few breaths warning before being told "At the end of the next normal breath out, take a deep breath all the way in"; they were then verbally encouraged to make a maximal effort before relaxing. The analysis included the same covariates as the primary Outcome Measure.</outcome>
