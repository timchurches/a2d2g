  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare kallikrein-kinin cascade mRNA and protein expression in neutrophils harvested from blood and SF of patients with arthritis (RA, PsA, gout, OA).
Immunocytochemistry: Expression of the kallikrein-kinin cascade proteins in will be assessed using labelling techniques. Immunolabelling will be performed on blood and SF neutrophils using fully characterised specific antibodies. Visualization of the images will be by immunofluorescence, confocal, and phase-contrast microscopy, with quantitation by image analysis. 
Flow cytometry: Neutrophils will be harvested from blood and SF and analysed on a FACScan instrument using specific fluorescently labelled antibodies. 
mRNA expression: Total RNA will be extracted from blood and SF neutrophils (RNeasy Kit, Qiagen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA. mRNA for KLK1, KLKB1, KNG1, BDKRB1 and BDKRB2 will be detected by real time PCR using highly specific TaqMan primer/probes (Applied Biosystems). Steady-state mRNA levels will be normalized to the levels of 18S rRNA and differences in gene expression will be evaluated by the Ct method. Results will be analyzed for statistical significance using t tests or one-way ANOVA.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess whether activation of kinin B1 or B2 receptors by their respective endogenous agonists increases the expression and release of MMP-2 and -9 from neutrophils harvested from blood and SF of patients with arthritis (RA, PsA, gout, OA).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of metalloproteases 2 and 9 will be performed using TaqMan? Gene Expression primer/probes (Applied Biosystems). 
Kinin levels in plasma and SF will be determined by ELISA. 
Neutrophils will be pre-treated ex vivo with cytochalasin B (20 g/ml for 10 min) and then stimulated with bradykinin or Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin (1, 10 and 100 nM). Degranulation of neutrophils and release of matrix metalloprotease-9 and myeloperoxidase into the medium will be measured using ELISAs.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A study of proteins involved in the inflammation and pain associated with arthritis of the knee 
The study involves inviting people with a diagnosis of arthritis of the knee to participate in the study. The treatment for their arthritis will not be altered in any way. Participants will be asked to attend a single appointment, which will take about 2 hours and the following will occur: 
Questions about their health and specifically their arthritis and about any medications they are taking. This will be followed by a physical examination by the doctor (including weight, height, abdominal and waist circumference, BP) 
Questionnaires about pain, and difficulties/disability caused by the arthritis and associated pain.
The knee joint will be examined by a doctor and undergo an ultrasound examination of the knee.
The fluid in the knee will be withdrawn through a needle.</summary>
