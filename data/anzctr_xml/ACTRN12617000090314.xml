  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention period is 6 months at each hospital. 

The key component of the intervention is the evidence-based No CAUTI bundle:
N - NEED for catheter assessed  refer to indications, scan bladder, consider alternative, document reason.
O - OBTAIN patient consent, OFFER patient education including hygiene.
C - COMPETENCY  clinicians who insert catheters must have documented competency.
A - ASEPSIS  maintain asepsis &amp; hand hygiene during insertion and while catheter is in place.
U - UNOBSTRUCTED  flow - No kinks or loops, catheter secured, bag below bladder level and off the floor.
T - TIMELY catheter removal  and documentation  May be nurse initiated.
I - INFECTION RISK   daily periurethral hygiene.  Collect urine specimen only when clinically indicated.

The No CAUTI bundle will be displayed on posters within the hospitals. 

To support implementation of the No CAUTI bundle, the following resources were developed as part of the intervention: 
-	IDC insertion criteria guidelines
-	Indications for IDC specimen collection
-	Nurse-led IDC removal guidelines
-	Educational resources and compliance auditing tools 

The distribution and standardised use of a cost-effective, generic IDC insertion pack forms part of the intervention. The insertion pack includes all equipment required for catheterisation, documentation stickers, and securing devices.  

Routine assessment of clinician competency in urinary catheter insertion will be introduced as part of the multifaceted intervention.

Implementation strategies include: 
- Education (train-the-trainer workshops and ward inservices)
- Monitoring and feedback (compliance audits and feedback, and feedback of point prevalence of IDC usage and CAUTI)
- Resources (No CAUTI bundle posters and badges, and catheter insertion DVDs)
- Facilitation (competency assessments and champions)

Implementation strategies are detailed below: 
All intervention components will be delivered in participating facilities. The intervention will be delivered in all adult inpatient wards, emergency departments, and operating theatres in all four hospitals. 

Train-the-trainer workshops: Train-the-trainer workshops will prepare nurse educators to present the No CAUTI bundle to ward-based staff, and to train educators to complete urinary catheterisation competency assessments. Mode-of delivery will be face-to-face (group), and workshops will be delivered by clinical nurse consultant  urology. 1x 2-3 hour workshop will be delivered at each hospital at the start of the intervention. 

Ward in-services will be delivered to familiarise staff with the No CAUTI bundle and nurse-initiated removal flowchart, and to identify champions on each ward. In-services will be delivered face-to-face (group) by nurse educators, to an audience of nurses and medical officers from adult inpatient wards, operating theatres, and emergency departments.  A minimum of 1x 20 minute in-service in each ward at the start of the intervention will be delivered. 

Compliance audits and feedback will take place to monitor compliance with No CAUTI bundle and provide strategies to support implementation of the intervention. Mode of delivery will be individual patient audit, and face-to-face (group) feedback to clinicians. Champions (clinicians previously identified in in-services) will deliver this component in all inpatient wards. Compliance audits will be conducted for the first two months of the intervention and then monthly for the remaining four months of the intervention period. 

Feedback of point prevalence indwelling urinary catheter usage and CAUTI: Face-to-face (group) and email feedback will be provided by research project staff to all clinicians at a ward, facility and district level. This will take place at baseline, 4 months, and 9 months. 

Resources: No CAUTI bundle badges and posters will be disseminated throughout participating hospitals to prompt awareness of the intervention. Badges will also help to identify ward champions. Posters will be displayed in all participating wards, and badges will be worn by clinicians and champions. This is a passive intervention component. Ongoing throughout intervention period. 

Resource  catheter insertion DVDs: DVDs to educate nurses about the correct catheterisation process will be made available on the intranet throughout the intervention period. This is a passive intervention component. 

Competency assessments: competency assessments will increase the proportion of clinicians that are competent in urinary catheterisation. This component will be delivered by nurse educators to nurses on an individual face-to-face basis. These are an ongoing component of the intervention. 

Champions: Champions will act as a resource for clinicians and promote the No CAUTI bundle to clinicians, and will also support implementation of the intervention. Nurses will act as champions, and will be an ongoing component of the intervention.

This is a pre-implementation control. There will be a 4-month control period for Central Coast Local Health District. 

Statewide clinical practice guidelines for urinary catheterisation exist, however there are no implementation strategies in place for the guidelines. Local clinical practice guidelines are out of date and incomplete. </comparator>

    <designfeatures>Multiple pre-post control intervention design
Implementation of the intervention across four acute care hospitals will be staged, with multiple clusters in each of two implementation stages. Pre and post point prevalence data comparison will occur within all hospitals pre and post intervention, as well as between the two Health Districts.
Two hospitals in the first Local Health District will commence intervention, and then 4 months later intervention will commence in the second Local Health District, providing a contemporaneous control. 
The phased implementation of the intervention allows for a control between the two Health Districts. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size calculation has indicated that 500 patients per health district would be sufficient to detect a 40% fall (15% to 9%) in relative IDC insertion rates with a power of 0.8 and alpha 0.05. This is based on a 50% (39.5% to 14.6%) reduction observed in the pilot study. Estimated bed numbers of 860 in Health District 2 and 610 in Health District 1 should thus be more than adequate to provide sufficient power to detect a significant change.  Further power will be obtained through having baseline control data from Phase 1 and from stratifying the analysis by hospital wards.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is possibly the most preventable healthcare associated infection. This study will implement a care bundle to reduce urinary catheter use and CAUTI in four acute care facilities in NSW, Australia. The care bundle includes evidence-based recommendations of: appropriate indications for catheter insertion, patient consent, clinician competency, asepsis, unobstructed flow, timely catheter removal, daily periurethral hygiene, and collecting urine specimen only when indicated. Implementation strategies used will include education, audit and feedback, and champions. Point prevalence will be used to evaluate changes to rates of catheterisation and CAUTI. A phased non-randomised pre-post design will be used, providing a contemporaneous control. </summary>
