  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls and injuries resulting from falls are a major concern to New Zealand Health providers and the population in general. The consequences of falling in older age can be devastating to the individual and costly to health providers, such as ACC. We already know that interventions aimed at reducing risk factors for falls in frailer older adults can be effective, and the results of the Otago Exercise Programme support this. However, we dont know how effective ACC funded Tai Chi programmes are in reducing falls. This proposal seeks to clarify the effectiveness of ACC funded Tai Chi programmes as a means of reducing the incidence of falls in older adults. It will also aim to determine if the frequency of practice of Tai Chi is an important determinant of effectiveness. Clarifying if Tai Chi programmes, as delivered in New Zealand, reduce falls and fall related injuries, and clarifying the frequency of delivery and the longer term effects of the programmes would be of significant benefit to older individuals who are at risk of falling, to ACC as a major funder of falls prevention programmes, and to the health industry in general. An economic evaluation of the Tai Chi programmes would be of benefit in enabling ACC to plan and implement future cost effective programmes.</summary>
