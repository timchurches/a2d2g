  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following enrolment, each subject will be studied on two occasions, separated by at leaste 7 days, in a double-blind, randomised order. On each study day, following correct positioning of the intraduodenal catheter, 4 baseline samples will be drawn (at t = -45, -30, -15 and 0 min), followed by an intraduodenal infusion of either isotonic saline (300mOsm) or hypertonic saline (1500mOsm) at a rate of 4 ml/min for 45 min (t=0-45 min).  Blood samples will be collected for another 3 hours (at t = 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 and 180 min). At t = 180 min, the intraduodenal catheter will be removed, and a cold buffet meal will be given for evaluation of energy intake.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The human gut secretes a number of hormones to regulate food intake and blood sugar. Ghrelin is a hormone secreted from the stomach before meals, which promotes food intake. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted from the small and large intestines after meals, and is known to suppress food intake and improve blood sugar control. In this trial, we want to investigate whether saline solutions administered into the small intestine will affect the secretion of ghrelin and GLP-1, and the sensation of hunger and satiety.
