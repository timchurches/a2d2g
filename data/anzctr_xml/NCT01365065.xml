    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effect of vorinostat on HIV transcription in CD4 T-cells. - The primary (efficacy) endpoint of this study is to evaluate the effect of vorinostat on HIV transcription from latently infected CD4+ T-cells as measured by HIV unspliced RNA in CD4+ T-cells.</outcome>
