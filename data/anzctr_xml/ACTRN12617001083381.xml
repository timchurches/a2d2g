  <interventions>
    <interventions>12-week fundamental motor skills intervention for preschoolers aimed at improving motor skills and increasing physical activity.  The intervention will consist of games designed to enhance the participants motor skills using equipment such as a variety of sports balls, witches hats, and jumping sacks. The intervention will run in the UNSW Early Years Childcare centres 5 days/week for 40 minutes with children to attend on the days they are present at the centre (between 1 and 5). The intervention will be run by an accredited exercise physiologist with assistance from 4th year exercise physiology practicum and research  students. </interventions>
    <comparator>The wait-list control group will initially receive their normal childcare curriculum: what the centres have developed as their curriculum based on the NSW government structures. They will receive the program following the 24-week from baseline follow-up assessment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will involve a FMS program that will be implemented at the UNSW Early Years Childcare Centres. PLAYFUN will be a cluster randomised controlled trial in preschool aged children to be conducted over a 12-week period with fundamental motor skill testing to be completed at the beginning and end of the 12 weeks, with follow-up testing to be completed 12-weeks after the program has finished. If the program is shown to be beneficial, children in the control group will be offered the exercise program free of charge at the end of the study. Therefore, initially the control groups will be allocated as wait list for the program.
The primary outcome measure will be FMS measured using the Test of Gross Motor Development 2 (TGMD-2). Secondary outcome measures include both perceived and actual physical activity (PA) levels and anthropometric data (BMI). </summary>
