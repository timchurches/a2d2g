  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patient were admitted to hospital for placement of a peripherally inserted central cannula (PICC) line. 
A terlipressin (Lucassin Registered Trademark ) infusion was commenced (1.7mg/12 hours via a syringe driver and subjects were observed in hospital for 24 hours to confirm tolerability. 
The following day they were discharged home on an ambulatory terlipressin infusion which was then continued for 28 days. 
Hospital-in-the-home nursing staff would visit each patient twice a day to exchange the terlipressin infusion syringe(1.7mg/12 hours)  and monitor for adverse events and ensure medication delivery. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite primary outcome: Safety and Practicality of administering a terlipressin infusion at home for a prolonged period of time in patients with refractory ascites. The safety of administration is based on the absence of adverse effects from the terlipressin infusion as symptoms suggestive of ischaemia as chest pain, abdominal pain or digit pain or discolouration. Practicality was based on answering a questionnaire,designed specifically for the study, of impact on mobility or personal activities of daily living. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Weekly for 4 weeks at each visit. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in volume of ascites drained  with terlipressin infusion. Patienst would have weekly ultrasounds to assess whether paracentesis can be performed safely and if so paracentesis would be performed to drain the ascites. The volume would be measured. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed weekly for 4 weeks at each visit. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body weight change with terlipressin infusion compared to baseline body weight. Patients were weighed using the same weighing scale in the ambulatory care centre during their weekly review. Weight would be measured prior to paracentesis. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although most patients with cirrhosis complicated by ascites initially respond to salt restriction and diuretics, as their liver disease progresses many lose diuretic responsiveness and develop refractory ascites, a condition for which there is no established drug treatment. Terlipressin is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin that causes splanchnic vasoconstriction, consequently improving renal blood flow and kidney function, and thus may ameliorate many of the pathophysiological changes that result in ascites formation. Its short half-life and bolus dose administration have previously precluded its long term use to treat ascites or other complications of cirrhosis. We performed a 4 week prospective trial of outpatient continuous terlipressin infusion in 5 patients with refractory ascites to examine its safety, practicality and efficacy in reducing ascites formation. </summary>
