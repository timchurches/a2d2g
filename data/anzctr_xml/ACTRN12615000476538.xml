    <studytitle>Collection and banking of fresh tumours for frozen storage for patients undergoing planned excision of tumours</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Patients with solid tumours that are accessible can bank their tumours in a dedicated tumour bank for long term fresh frozen storage conditions for the possible future production of an autologous cancer vaccine, the latter being a separate study. </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>There is no intervention. A sample of tumour will be taken from routine, planned tumour removal surgery. The sample will go into long term frozen storage. The tumour sample may be used in the future to manufacture an autologous cancer treatment vaccine. The tumour will be stored for an initial period of up to 3 years.   </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To obtain fresh tumour tissue during planned surgery in a safe &amp; ethical manner for long term frozen storage. Participants will have signed informed consent prior to their routine surgery; a patient registration form will be completed prior to surgery to arrange logistics support; a tumour requisition form will be completed to document the sample traceability, tumour banking process and final location of the tumour in the repository. Participants are identified by a tumour bank ID / barcode to ensure confidentiality and privacy compliance.     </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this project is to collect tumour tissue from patients undergoing elective surgery for the removal of primary tumour or metastases. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this project if you are aged 18 years or above and are planning to undergo surgery as routine treatment for cancer from which tumour can be sourced.

Study details:
Participants in this project will undergo routine tumour removal surgery as planned. A tumour sample is obtained from this surgery and put into long term frozen storage for up to 3 years. The tissue may be used for potential manufacture into an autologous therapeutic cancer vaccine for use within the same patient, at a time in the future should that patients medical oncologist recommend this treatment. This future treatment is a separate project.</summary>
