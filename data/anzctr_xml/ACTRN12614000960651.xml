  <interventions>
    <interventions>An online Managing Stress program, which is designed to teach students how to recognise the symptoms of anxiety and depression, develop skills in thought challenging, describe positive ways to cope with anxiety and depression, identify effective coping resources, master structured problem solving, and use skills and knowledge to act effectively to help themselves and others. The effectiveness of the course has been previously evaluated with junior high school students with positive results (van Vliet &amp; Andrews, 2009).

The course contains 6 lessons about managing stress (designed to be completed once per week for 6 weeks, which fits into one school term). Each lesson is to be completed at school under the guidance of the teacher. Each lesson takes on average 30 minutes to complete and is accompanied with worksheets and activities, which take on average 15 minutes to complete. The lessons are sequential, they must be completed in order of 1 to 6.</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait list control group:
The wait list control group complete the same questionnaires at the same time as the intervention group. They continue with their usual lessons instead of completing the online program. The wait list control group has access to the online course once they have completed the final set of questionnaires at 12 weeks, or the following school term (whichever fits in best with the school's schedule). </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We aim to recruit a minimum of 40 schools, totaling approximately 1,200 participants. This number of participants will enable MANOVAs to be carried out to investigate the variables of interest. It will also meet Cohens (1992) requirement of at least 393 for a study seeking to find small effect sizes.  As this is a cluster randomised study the intracluster correlation coefficient will be included in the analysis to account for the effective sample size. Similar research reports ICC values of between 0.01-0.02 (Shochet, et al. 2006).


The universal nature of the intervention makes it likely that the effect sizes will be small (similar studies of universal mental health programs found an effect size of 0.2, Barrett et al. 2006; Spence et al. 2003).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research suggests that there are an insufficient number of services available to help the large number of Australians who experience mental illness. Therefore the focus should be on prevention. The internet has been shown to be an effective way of delivering mental health education and prevention in schools. One such internet delivered intervention is the Managing Stress program (from THIS WAY UP Schools a sector of CRUfAD), which has previously been evaluated in a large RCT with an adolescent population (van Vliet and Andrews, 2009). The current research aims to address the need for early intervention by replicating van Vliet and Andrews (2009) study in evaluating the effects of the Managing Stress online program for children in year 5 of primary school.</summary>
