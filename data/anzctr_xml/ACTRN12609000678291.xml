  <interventions>
    <interventions>Total hip replacement using a 36 mm metal on highly cross-linked polyethylene articulation. This is a surgical procedure where the femoral head is removed and replaced by a metal prosthetic femoral head (which in this situation has a diameter of 36 mm), which is attached to a femoral stem inserted into the femur. The head then articulates with a plastic (highly cross-linked polyethylene) liner in a metal acetabular shell, which is inserted into the acetabulum. The duration of the operation is between about 45 minutes and 4 hours, depending on the complexity of the operation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dislocation of the total hip prosthesis. 
Patients complete a Hip Instability Questionnaire, which asks whether they have experienced a number of symptoms of instability or a dislocation. A Hospital Visit Questionnaire is also completed, which documents every admission or attendance to the Emergency Room of a hospital. 
A radiograph of the dislocated hip is required for confirmation of dislocation.</outcome>

    <sequence>A listing of all possible combinations of allocations in blocks of 2 to 8 was prepared (eg for a block of 4: 28,28,36,36; 36,36,28,28, 36,28,36,28 etc) and each combination was allocated a number. Then a random number generator was used to choose the combination sequence for the block sizes required in each stratum.</sequence>

    <assignment />
    <designfeatures>Patients are stratified for a number of factors that may affect primary and secondary outcomes (eg age, diagnosis).
Blocked randomisation is then undertaken within strata, with patients being randomised to receive a total hip prosthesis with either a 28 mm or 36 mm articulation.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial aims to determine whether a total hip replacement with a larger 36 mm diameter prosthetic femoral head significantly reduces the incidence of dislocation one year following total hip replacement, compared to total hip replacement with a standard 28 mm diameter prosthetic femoral head. The effect of the larger femoral head on both polyethylene wear and acetabular cup migration is also being assessed.</summary>
