  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be divided into 2 main cohorts for study purposes.

The first cohort will be a retrospective review of all total knee replacements performed within the last year (2011) at Cairns Base Hospital. It is hoped to recruit approximately 100-150 participants into this study. This cohort will not adhere to our multi-modal analgesic pathway. 
There will therefore be a wide array of anaesthesic modalities ranging from central catheter techniques such as spinals, epidurals, combined spinal-epidurals (CSE), to general anaesthesia (GA), to peripherally placed catheters such as femoral nerve blocks (FNB) or fascia iliaca blocks (FIB) applied to this cohort of patients.

The second cohort of participants will be a prospective review of all total knee replacements performed at Cairns Base Hospital from the date of ethics approval onwards for however long it is required to recruit approximately 100-150 participants into this cohort.

The second cohort of patients will strictly adhere to the multi-modal analgesic pathway described below. 
Participants will have either a GA or single shot spinal anaesthetic given at the discretion of the anaesthetist. Participants will also receive a single shot femoral nerve block prior to commencement of surgery while in the induction bay administered by the anaesthetist. During the surgery, the surgeon will inject local anaesthetic (Bupivocaine 0.2%/Ropivocaine 0.5% - 100ml) into the posterior capsule of the knee prior to commencement of cementing the knee. 

A Total Knee Arthroplasty is a lengthy procedure with complicated steps lasting approximately an hour and a half to 2 hours depending on surgeon skill, instrumentation and deformity of  the knee. 

After the patient has been anaesthetized,  the patient will be prepped &amp; draped, after which a midline parapatella approach is performed down to the knee joint. Osteophytes will be removed and the patella subluxated laterall to allow full access to the femur and tibia. The ACL is dissected out, and the osteoarthritic portions of the distal femur and proximal tibia will be resected. Specific jigs/guides will be utilised to allow for correction of varus/valgus or rotational deformity of the knee and to shape the femur and tibia to receive the definitive implants.

Trial implants will be inserted first to determine if any further correction is required before the definitive implants are placed. If adequate, the knee joint is thoroughly washed and depending on the implants utilised, cement may be used to hold the femoral component in place or there may be a specific hydroxyapatite coating on the femoral component allowing bony ingrowth. The tibial component is always cemented in place. A highly cross-linked polyethylene insert is then placed between the femoral and tibial components to allow gliding of the implants.

The knee is then washed again, and the retinaculum repaired over the knee joint, the wound closed in layers and a dressing placed over the wound.

Patients will then be placed on a Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) overnight and be reviewed by the Acute Pain Team/Service in the morning. 

Formal bloods and x-rays will be ordered and participants will be visited by the physiotherapist during the day. Mobility will be determined by whether patient achieved transfer from bed  chair whether with minimal/heavy assistance, and whether patient was able to mobilise with aid of a frame/rollator with guidance from the physiotherapist.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quadriceps weakness and mobility day 1 post operatively. 

This is assessed by the physiotherapist who visit the patient's everyday, specifically on day 1 post operative.

Quads weakness is assessed from a grade of 1-5, where 1 has not even a flicker of muscle movement through to 5 where there is normal power and movement against resistance and gravity.

Mobility will be assessed as to whether the patient can complete exercises provided by the physiotherapist in bed, then progress onto the transfer from bed to standing, and finally mobilization with aid of a forearm support frame/4 wheel walker/Hopper frame.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are multiple modalities of analgesia utilised by anaesthetists during an arthroplasty procedure, ranging from general anaesthetic (GA), spinal/epidural catheters, femoral nerve blocks, fascia iliaca blocks and patient controlled analgesia (PCA), either on its own or in combination.
Certain anaesthetists may decide to leave catheters in the patients so they may top up the local anaesthetic (LA) dose in the morning should pain increase, whether this may be through means of an epidural or FNB catheter. This is all based on expertise, experience and discretion of the anaesthetist.
	With such variability it is unknown which modality would be best for the patient in terms of outcomes post a total knee arthroplasty. A previous pilot study performed on patients undergoing total knee/hip arthroplasty at our centre revealed approximately 39% of patients were not mobilising day 1 post op due to ongoing complications following their surgery, either as an effect of their anaesthesia (hypotension, nausea, dizziness) or due to quadriceps weakness from the ongoing effects of either centrally/peripherally placed catheters. 50 out of our cohort of 201 patients did not mobilise till day 2 post op.
This potentially has prolonged the stay in hospital and affected the rehabilitation period of these patients. As a result of this pilot study, the anaesthetists and orthopaedic surgeons from our centre sat down to formally create a multi-modal analgesic protocol that would hopefully decrease the complications inhibiting patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty from mobilising with the hope this would improve patient outcomes from a perspective of decreased quadriceps weakness, shorter length of stay with improved pain control.
We know that there are various forms of multi-modal analgesic pathways out there that have been of proven benefit. Based on a literature review of the various forms of analgesia available, our multi-modal analgesic protocol will consist of either a GA/spinal for induction purposes, a single shot FNB performed after induction and injection of local anaesthetic (Bupivocaine 0.5% or Ropivocaine 0.75%) into the posterior capsule of the knee prior to cementing of the prosthesis.
	The aim of this research project will therefore be to determine the efficacy of applying this multi-modal analgesic protocol to patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty.</summary>
