             treatment, unless documentation of infertility exists

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study consists of two phases: The first portion of the study is a Phase 1 dose escalation
      study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the dose limiting toxicities of SB1518 when
      given as a single agent orally once daily in subjects with Chronic Idiopathic Myelofibrosis
      (CIMF) regardless of their JAK2 mutational status. The second portion of the study is a Phase
      2 study to define the efficacy and safety profile of single agent SB1518 at the recommended
      dose in subjects with CIMF.</summary>
