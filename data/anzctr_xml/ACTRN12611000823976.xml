  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project aims to develop a model for promoting and supporting children and adolescents with cerebral palsy, who are enrolled in Victorian specialist schools, to take part in aerobic fitness enhancing activities as a part of the school curriculum.  

Young people with cerebral palsy in the experimental group will complete a 9-week, three times per week aerobic exercise intervention of 30 minutes, conducted within normal school hours.  The exercise program will be designed and overseen by the priniciple researcher (a physiotherapist) and the school based physiotherapists.

Aerobic activities will be tailored to each participant's level of gross motor function and will consist of alternating activities such as, walking, running, arm and leg cycling, rowing, and aerobic style moves.  Participants will have their heart rates monitored throughout each session.

The aerobic sessions will be undertaken as a group, though individual assistance will be provided where necessary.</interventions>
    <comparator>Young people with cerebral palsy in the control group will participate in a social games and activity group, run during lunchtimes, three times weekly for 9 weeks.

A facilitator will administer the control group program, which will consist of a variety of activities such as music and song based games and fine motor tasks including arts and crafts.  Activities will be adapted accordingly to suit the ages and interests of those in the control group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome for this phase one randomised controlled trial will be an assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of the aerobic training program, in the specialist school setting.

Throughout the intervention adherence will be measured through thorough monitoring and recording of both attendance and level of participation once present.

Safety will be monitored through the use of a log book provided to participants and their families for recording of any adverse events or physical complaints experienced outside of school hours.  Comprehensive observation for adverse events by a physiotherapist will occur, through questioning of participants at each training session and review of log book.

Acceptance will be gauged through semi-structured in-depth interviews of participants in the aerobic exercise group, to gauge their experiences and attitudes toward the intervention.  Teachers, therapists and parents will also be engaged in interviews post-intervention.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants must be aged between 8-18 years, be able to follow simple instruction in English, and have a reliable yes/no response. Participants must be classified as between levels I-III on the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and be well enough to take part in an intensive exercise training program.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Young people with cerebral palsy will be ineligible to participate if they have poorly controlled epilepsy, or another medical condition, if they have participated in a strength or aerobic training programme in the six months prior, or if they have received lower limb botulinum toxin injections, serial casting or orthopaedic surgery any time in the six months leading up to their commencement of the trial.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by their school physiotherapists and their parents provided with information on the study.  Parents/Carers of potential participants will contact the principle researcher to clarify questions prior to signing of consent forms and enrollment in the study.

Consistent with the revised CONSORT recommendations for the conduct of parallel-group randomised trials only after the recruiter determines that a person is eligible for the study, the participant agrees to participate, they are enrolled and baseline assessment completed, will assignment to either the aerobic training or control group be made using the concealed randomisation method of opening the next envelope in the sequence. An administrative assistant who is unconnected to the study will be responsible for preparing and opening the sealed envelops.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated to either the experimental or control group using a concealed allocation, block randomisation method.  The block randomisation method will ensure approximately equal numbers in each group and is a suitable randomisation process for randomised controlled trials with relatively small samples. The order of the blocks will be generated from a random number table and assignments sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The physical impairments characterised by cerebral palsy, which make movement more difficult, put young people with cerebral palsy at risk of reduced habitual physical activity and increased sedentary time, the long term effects of which can include a greater risk of developing secondary health problems.  

We aim to complete a high quality phase one randomised controlled trial to establish if an innovative school-based aerobic exercise programme is both realistic and feasible in the specialist school setting, as well as being effective in increasing fitness, physical activity and participation for children and adolescents with cerebral palsy.</summary>
