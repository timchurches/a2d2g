    <interventions>Arm 1 pregabalin plus usual care.

Pregabalin is a drug to treat neuropathic pain.

Initial dose of 150mg/day, divided over 2 dosed and may be increased to a maximium dose of 600mg/day with gradual titration over a four week period. Discontinuation is to reduce the dose over &gt;7 days.

It is administered in capsule form.

The participants will be monitored over the 8 week treatment by a study doctor period.The study doctor will amend the dosage based on the patients adequate improvement to the study medicine. Adequate improvement is defined as a pain rating of 0 or 1 out of 10, for leg pain, for a minimum of 72 hours, with none or tolerable side effects.  If adequate improvement has not occurred, the study doctor may increase the study medicine dosage. If adequate improvement is reported, the dose can remain the same until the end of the study. The maximum tolerated dose for each participant will be maintained for 4 weeks or up to adequate improvementor if achieved before the 8 week standard treatment regimen is completed, early titration down to cessation. All patients will be titrated down to cessation to complete the study treatment period. 
 
In addition to receiving the study medicines and advice (patient reassurance, staying active and avoiding bed rest) participants will receive usual care. This can consist of physical or manual therapies and other analgesic medications (except adjuvant analgesics), if deemed appropriate by the study doctor.

The total invention time is 8 weeks. The follow up includes up to 9 participant consultations with the study doctor study to begin treatment, monitor progress and adjust the dose of the study medication. Outcomes measures will be collected at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52.

Adherence will be achieved through study doctor training, participant consultations, data collected from the participant by research assistants. Procedures for monitoring adherence include	Adherence to study medication will be documented through a self-reported daily medication diary and by counting the returned medicine, compared to the prescribed regimen as recorded by the study doctor. Participants will be asked to return unused medicines via a reply paid post satchel at the end of the 8-week treatment period.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo plus usual care.

The placebo capsule consists of
lactose, maize starch, purified talc, gelatin, titanium dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, colloidal anhydrous silica, red iron oxide CI77491.

Its duration, control and follow up is the same as the intervention treatment of pregbalin ( as described above)</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from patients in the community who consult a study general practitioner (GP) or medical specialist (e.g. orthopaedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, neurologist or rheumatologist). Other sources will be patients seeking care from physiotherapists and chiropractors, or patients who respond to a community advertisement. Potential participants are then referred to a study GP to complete screening and enrolment.

Allocating treatment- the study medication (pregabalin or placebo) will be prepared by the study pharmacy according to a randomisation schedule generated a priori, then sealed and supplied to the recruiting doctor (blinded). The doctor will provide each eligible and consenting participant with a sealed study medication pack, thus randomising them to either the treatment or control group.</concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher not involved in participant recruitment or data collection will generate a randomisation schedule a priori using a computer derived random number sequence. Study medication will be prepared according to the randomisation schedule by the study pharmacy, then sealed and supplied to the study doctors. Upon recruitment, the doctor (blinded) will provide the medication pack to the participant (blinded), thus randomising the participant to one of two groups: pregabalin with usual care or placebo with usual care. Placebo capsules will have an identical appearance to the active pregabalin capsules. The randomisation process will ensure concealed allocation and blinding of the doctor, participant and outcome assessor.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Treatment effectiveness analyses will be blinded and by intention-to-treat. A two-tailed p-value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Longitudinal linear models including all post-baseline measurements available will be used to assess the effect of treatment group on the primary and secondary outcomes with the baseline measurement and symptom duration as covariates. In case of significant missing data, sensitivity analyses will be conducted using multiple imputation, where reasonable. A secondary analysis will assess the presence of neuropathic pain features, measured by the PainDETECT questionnaire at baseline, as a modifier of treatment effects. 

Economic evaluation will be conducted in two ways. Firstly a cost-effectiveness study using leg pain intensity as a measure of effectiveness and secondly a cost-utility analysis where health state utilities (quality-adjusted life-years or QALY) will be based on measures obtained from the SF-12 and transformed into utilities via the SF-6D algorithm. The primary analysis will be conducted from the health sectors perspective, where healthcare services will be valued at standard rates published by the Australian Government (e.g. the Medical Benefits Scheme standard fees, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme costs). Private non-medical healthcare services (e.g. physiotherapy) will be valued at standard rates published by the relevant professional body or third party payer. An additional analysis will entail a societal perspective in which costs associated with the use of community services (e.g. community hydrotherapy classes) and work absenteeism due to sciatica will be included. Costs of community services will be based on the self-reported costs. Costs of absenteeism from paid employment will be estimated by the number of days absent from work multiplied by the average wage rate. Sensitivity analysis will test uncertainty in key parameters such as the selection of cost weights and statistical variation in quality of life scores. 

We have calculated the required sample size using a standard algorithm. The primary outcome is leg pain at week 8. A sample size of 204 participants (102 per group) will provide 90% power to detect a difference of 1.5 out of 10 units of leg pain on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale, assuming a standard deviation of 2.5, a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, and allowing for 10% of dropouts and 20% non-compliance. There is no robust evidence for the smallest worthwhile effect in pain reduction in sciatica. We have based the sample size calculation on a between-group difference of 1.5/10 in leg pain from previous trials of pregabalin for neuropathic pain. The sample size also has 90% power to detect a difference of 3 out of 23 at week 8 on our key secondary outcome, the Roland Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica. This is based on the between-group difference (3/23) and standard deviation from one of our previous sciatica trials (4/23) and the same assumptions taken for the primary outcome calculation. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with sciatica experience low back pain, with pain radiating into the leg and possible neurological deficits. Sciatica is associated with substantial pain and chronic disability. The lack of evidence supporting effective treatments for sciatica makes clinical management difficult.

The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy and cost effectiveness of adding pregabalin to usual care for reducing leg pain intensity in patients with sciatica.

PRECISE is a prospectively registered, double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial of pregabalin, in addition to usual care in people with sciatica. Participants will be recruited from patients in the community who consult a study general practitioner (GP) or medical specialist (e.g. orthopaedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, neurologist or rheumatologist) with moderate to severe sciatica. GPs and specialists will be recruited from the Sydney metropolitan area (Australia). Other referral sources include physiotherapists and chiropractors that may identify potential participants and then refer the patient to a study GP. Participant inclusion criteria include low back pain that radiates below the knee, neurological compromise, interference with normal daily activities and pain duration of 1 week to 1 year. Participants will not be eligible if they are scheduled for spinal surgery, have known serious pathology, are pregnant, have contraindications to pregabalin or taking certain prescribed medicines.  Participants will be randomised to receive either pregabalin with usual care (n=102) or the placebo with usual care (n=102) for 8 weeks. The medicine dosage will be titrated up to the participants optimal dose, to a maximum 600 mg per day. Usual care, if deemed appropriate by the study doctor may include analgesic medication or physical and manual therapy. Participants, doctors and researchers collecting participant data will be blinded. The primary outcome is leg pain. Secondary outcomes include back pain, disability and quality of life. Treatment effectiveness analysis will be blinded and by intention-to-treat. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. A parallel economic evaluation will be conducted from the societal perspective.
