  <interventions>
    <interventions>CanCOPE is a self directed program and consists of a videotape and guidebook, with no face-to-face contact with a professional during the program. Women and their support persons assigned to CanCOPE receive via the video and guidebook that provides a five-step training program in cancer specific coping and stress management skills, supportive communication, and problem solving. CanCOPE uses a combination of videotaped and written educational tools to teach the woman and her support person coping and mutual support skills. Their progress is reviewed during regular telephone sessions  with a psychologist. Dyads receive a total of 9 1hr phone calls over the 12 month period following diagnosis.</interventions>
