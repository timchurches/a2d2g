  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two six-weekly cycles comprising four weeks of oral sunitinib 50 mg once daily followed by two weeks rest, followed by five weeks of oral everolimus 10 mg once daily followed by one week rest are administered (12 week treatment intervention in total).

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients eligible to start their second cycle of therapy within 14 weeks of their first dose of therapy. Patients completing treatment with non-protocol specified modifications will not be counted as successes. The regimen would be considered feasible if 80% or more of patients were able to complete cycle 1 and proceed to cycle 2 without more than two weeks delay. The regimen would not be feasible if 60% or fewer patients were able to complete cycle 1 and proceed to cycle 2 without more than two weeks delay. Additional factors to be considered in terms of feasibility will include number of treatment cycles received, dose intensity, proportion of patients requiring dose modification, proportion of patients stopping treatment due to toxicity.</outcome>

8. History of hypertension requiring hospitalisation.
9. Other serious illnesses, e.g. active infection requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders.

11. Major surgery in the last 4 weeks, or planned in the next 6 weeks.
12. Radiation therapy in the last 2 weeks, or planned in the next 6 weeks. Any acute adverse effects of recent radiation must have resolved prior to registration. Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided there is at least one lesion that has not been irradiated or which has progressed following radiotherapy.

14. Any of the following in the last year: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism.
15. Pre-existing thyroid abnormality with thyroid function that cannot be maintained in the normal range with medication.
16. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE version 4.0 grade =2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) to &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females.
17. Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 X Upper Limit of Normal (ULN).
18. Pregnancy (negative pregnancy test required for women of child-bearing potential), lactation
19. Inadequate contraception. Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or use 2 reliable forms of contraception. Men must be surgically sterile or use a barrier method of contraception.
20. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to everolimus, sunitinib or iodine.
21. Medical or psychiatric condition that compromises the patient's ability to give informed consent.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of the chemotherapy drugs Everolimus and Sunitinib, used in sequence, in treating people with advanced renal cell carcinoma. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have renal cell (kidney) cancer that has spread to distant sites and is at an advanced stage. 

Trial details: 
Participants will all receive the same treatment. This involves six-weekly cycles comprising four weeks of sunitinib 50 mg once daily followed by two weeks rest The second cycle comprises five weeks of everolimus 10 mg once daily followed by one weeks rest. The study aims to see the effectiveness of treatment by looking at survival and disease progression in patients after six months.</summary>
