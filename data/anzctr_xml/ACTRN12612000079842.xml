  <interventions>
    <interventions>A cluster randomised school drug education trial will be conducted with 1746 junior high school students in 21 Victorian secondary schools (14 intervention, 7 control) over a period of three years. Both the schools and students have actively consented to participate in the study. The education program comprises ten lessons of approximately an hour in year eight (13-14 year olds) and eight in year nine (14-15 year olds) that address issues around the use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other illicit drugs. The lessons will be provided in a block each year at approximately weekly intervals by teachers within the school who have previously received training in their delivery. Control students will receive the drug education normally provided in their schools. Students will be tested at baseline, at the end of each intervention year and also at the end of year ten. A self completion questionnaire will be used to collect information on knowledge, patterns and context of use, attitudes and harms experienced in relation to alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other illicit drug use. Multi-level modelling will be the method of analysis because it can best accommodate hierarchically structured data. All analyses will be conducted on an Intent-to-Treat basis. In addition, focus groups/interviews will be conducted with students and teachers in 5 of the 14 intervention schools, subsequent to delivery of the year eight and nine programs. The student focus groups will be one hour in duration with a roughly even mix of six to eight males and females. Teacher interviews will be with either individuals, or small groups of two to three respondents. They will be one hour in length. These focus groups and interviews will provide qualitative data about the effectiveness of the lessons and the relevance of the materials.</interventions>

    <concealment>Twenty one Victorian government high schools agreed to participate in the study. The schools were then allocated to four strata: six schools to metro location, high SES; three schools to rural location, high SES; six schools to metro location, low SES; six schools to rural location, low SES. This approximated the proportion of Victorian secondary schools in each category. Within each strata the schools were then randomly allocated to intervention or control conditions on a two to one proportion to allow more precise statements about the effects of the intervention. Random allocation and allocation concealment were achieved by one member of the research team writing the names of each school on identical paper chits which were then folded to conceal the name. The same researcher also created seven chits with the word control and 14 with the word intervention. These were similarly folded to conceal the words. The chits with the school name and those designating allocation were placed in separate containers. A different member of the team then simultaneously drew out a chit with the name of a school and a chit designating either control or intervention allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>This is a nested design whereby the allocation of students is determined by the allocation of their school to either the intervention or control condition</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Young people are faced with numerous and powerful influences to use both licit and illicit drugs, and drug education can play an important counterbalancing role in shaping a normative culture of safety, moderation and informed decision making. The aim of this research is to develop and evaluate the harm reduction effect of a comprehensive, evidence based school drug education program for year eight and nine students in a large, representative sample of Victorian government high schools.</summary>
