  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mental Health Experience Co-design (MH ECO) is a structured process for service users (consumers), carers and mental health staff to come together to identify improvements to service planning and delivery and co-design the solutions to these improvements. The process is facilitated by trained researchers experienced in the use of co-design methods. 

The intervention will be implemented over nine months from 2014-2017 at up to eleven  participating mental health teams (clusters).  There are two main stages to MH ECO.  Stage one is information gathering through an open ended computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) and  focus groups and face to face interviews.  Stage two is a facilitated co-design process where collaboration and co-design groups are established and meet over five months.. 

The telephone interview is undertaken over six weeks with consumers and carers at each mental health team to identify the positive and negative experiences of services. Interviews take up to one hour to complete. Each team will have up to 30 consumers and 30 carers recruited. All 30 consumers and 30 carers who express interest will be invited to complete the CATI. Up to three positive and three negative touch points (experiences) are discussed in consumer, carer and staff focus groups to gain better understanding. Focus groups are held separately, for up to two hours, with 8-10 people participating in these. 

The second stage involves the co-design process. Consumers, carers and staff who express interest in the co-design process receive two training sessions over two weeks to build skills and confidence for working in group settings. Training sessions are up to two hours each.  Following the completion of training sessions, a collaboration group (8-10 people in each cluster) is established comprised of consumers, carers and staff members.. The collaboration group meets first (for up to two hours) to set objectives for achieving some changes around the identified negative touch points. 

This is followed by the establishment of up to three co-design groups (8-10 people in each cluster - there is one co-design group for each of the negative touch points). Co-design groups meet three times for up to two hours. Session one explores the negative touch point to brainstorm ideas for change, session two focuses in on what will change and session three is the development of an action plan for implementation. 

The action plan is returned to the second collaboration group meeting for implementation in month six.  A month one implementation period is scheduled where there is no contact with any clusters. </interventions>
    <comparator>The stepped wedge design means that the clusters not in receipt of the intervention act as the control group for the study. 

The usual care delivered to consumers comprises a comprehensive needs assessment and individual recovery plan developed, individualised support through focus on improving daily living skills, capacity for mental health selfmanagement and social connectedness, and support to access health and human services required through partnership and coordination delivered by key worker.	 </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Three clusters stratified by service provider will be allocated to each wave. Initially, the 12 possible combinations of the pair-wise clusters from the three different services were created to ensure that clusters from the same service provider are not allocated to the same wave. Using these pairs, 24 possible sequence allocation combinations of the paired clusters to the three waves were identified (8 combinations of three sets of paired clusters by three different possible starting times). One of the 24 possible sequence allocation combinations will be randomly selected by allocating a random number from the uniform distribution using Stata Statistical Software Packaging to each of the 24 sequence allocation combinations and selecting the sequence allocation with the smallest random number. The random selection of the sequence allocation will be conducted by a statistician blinded to the identity of the clusters and not involved in the assessment or intervention delivery. The pair of clusters and order in which they receive the intervention will be communicated to the trial coordinators. The two clusters allocated to the first wave will be notified of intervention commencement after the initial baseline period is completed. The remaining four clusters will be notified of the intervention commencement at the start of their allocated step/wave.  Staff, consumers and carers are not blinded to the intervention but they are blinded to the wave during which they receive it.  Research interviewers collecting outcome data will remain blinded to who is in receipt of the intervention. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation:
Overall, 1008 measurements from 252 consumers (42 per site) at each of the four waves (one for baseline and at each follow up time) from the six clusters will be sufficient to detect an effect size of 0.35 of 1 standard deviation for psycho-social recovery between the intervention and usual care waves with at least 80% power.. Sample size was based on the primary outcome of psycho-social recovery score with the following assumptions: intra-cluster correlation for the outcome of 0.1 and significance level of 5% for a two-sided test, probability that each individual will remain at the site at each wave (0, 0.2 and 0.6) and within-subject correlation of individuals that contributed to at least two consecutive waves (0.2 and 0.7). 

The study power was calculated as the proportion among all 2000 simulation runs of two-sided p-values for the estimated fixed treatment effect that reached a nominal value of less than 0.05. Two thousand replications for each set of parameter combinations were sufficient to estimate the power with a margin of error of 1.75%, assuming that the true power was 80%. The simulations were run using R version 3.1.1.  Given a fixed sample cluster size, power was the smallest when it was assumed that samples at each time point were independent (that is, probability of remaining at the next wave was zero) and that the study power increased as the probability of remaining at the site and within cluster subject correlation increased. Note the power calculations using the simulation study provided more conservative estimates of the power than the sample size calculations based on the formula provided by Hussey and Hughes. These differences may be due to different derivations of the estimated test statistic. Within the simulation procedure, a t-distribution with Satterthwaites approximation for degrees of freedom was employed, whereas the analytical approach suggested by Hussey and Hughes assumes a standard normal distribution for the test statistic which yields less conservative results. 

Statistical Data Analysis:

Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise the characteristics of staff, consumers and carers. The participants will be analysed in the group that the cluster was assigned to at each time point.  A linear mixed effects model will be used to compare the intervention and usual care periods for continuous outcomes and generalised linear mixed effects model for binary outcomes. The model will include intervention status and time as fixed effects and site and individuals as random effects. Organisational and individual factors strongly correlated with the outcome will also be included as fixed effects in the model.  These will include: recovery orientation of services and staff attitudes to recovery at baseline, age, gender, education level, work status, quality of life, medication and hospitalisation. The estimated intervention effect will be reported as mean outcome difference for continuous outcomes and odds ratio for binary outcomes between study groups, with respective 95% confidence intervals and p-values. A secondary analysis will investigate an interaction effect between intervention and time. Costs of the delivery of the intervention will be recorded but no economic evaluation will be undertaken. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis strategy will be used. Every effort will be made to minimise missing outcome data at each wave and reasons individuals are lost to follow-up will be recorded. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the missing data assumption made in the primary analysis. Analysis will be conducted using Stata software package 13.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of CORE is to test if a structured co-design method (Mental Health Experience Co-Design, MH ECO) optimises psychosocial recovery outcomes for people affected by mental illnesses. MH ECO is a purposefully designed process to engage consumers, carers and service providers of adult community mental health services in re-designing aspects of services. MH ECO involves talking with consumers and carers to identify the positive and negative aspects of service and care experiences. Focus groups and interviews are conducted with consumers, carers and service providers to explore these negative aspects of care and experiences in-depth. Collaboration and co-design groups comprised of staff, consumers and carers are formed to identify ways to improve services, develop action plans and implement these. CORE is designed as a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial (SWCRCT). This means that the intervention will be rolled out sequentially to participating mental health teams three clusters at a time over three waves. By the end of the trial though all clusters will have received the intervention.</summary>
