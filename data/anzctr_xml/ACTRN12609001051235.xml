  <interventions>
    <interventions>Visudyne treatment followed by an intravitreal injection of Lucentis 0.5 mg within 2 hours (visit 1; month 0). Patients will be reviewed again at 6 weeks (visit 2) and 12 weeks (visit 3) at which time repeat intravitreal injections of Lucentis 0.5 mg will be administered. Patients will be followed up again at 6 weekly visits thereafter for a total of 12 months.
Visudyne Treatment
Visudyne will be administered as an intravenous injection of 6mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) at baseline only a maximum of 2 hours prior to the Lucentis injection.
Dosage and Administration Visudyne treatment is a two step process.
The first step is a ten minute intravenous infusion of Visudyne at a dose of 6 mg/m2 body surface area, diluted in 30 mL infusion solution.
The second step is the light activation of Visudyne 15 minutes after the start of the infusion. For this, a diode laser generating nonthermal red light (wavelength 689 nanometre) is delivered via a slit lamp mounted fibre optic device and a suitable contact lens. At the recommended light intensity of 600 mW/cm2 it takes 83 seconds to deliver the required light dose of 50 J/cm2.
The Visudyne and Photodynamic therapy is performed once at the baseline visit.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in patients treated with combination therapy using Visudyne and Lucentis.
The BCVA of subjects will be measured consistent with the standard procedure developed for the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).  The following equipment is used: a set of three charts which are modified ETDRS charts 1 and 2, and a retro-illuminated box .
A distance of 4 metres is required between the subject's eyes and the visual acuity chart.  
Subjective refraction is performed to prior to the BCVA test</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, then every six weeks for 12 months.  A total of 9 time points.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean change from baseline in retinal thickness.  This is assess prior to the Ocular Coherence Tomography test (OCT).
This is a computerized imaging technique that uses laser light to make a 3-D image of the retina.  It is a simple test to perform.  Usually the pupil must be dilated and then the patient sits in front of a special type of camera and pictures are taken of the structures inside the eye.  It is painless and not uncomfortable.  For cooperative patients the test can be completed in a few minutes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, then every six weeks for 12 months.  A total of 9 time points.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our hypothesis is that with the combination of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) and Ranibizumab patient would need fewer intravitreal injections.  This would be of benefit to the patients in terms of reduced exposure to Ranibizumab as well as importantly a reduced risk of adverse events from the intravitreal injection procedure.  In addition, there would be a benefit to the community with a in terms of reduced cost.</summary>
