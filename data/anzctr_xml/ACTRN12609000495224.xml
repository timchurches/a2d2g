  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the splinting and electrical stimulation group will receive a 4-week programme of  an hour electrical stimulation to wrist and finger extensors plus 12 hours of hand splinting per day, 5-7 days a week. Customised hand splints will be used. The splints will be worn during electrical stimulation and generally at night. However, splinting time may need to be varied to minimise interference with hygiene and therapy. Wrists will be stretched to maximum tolerable extension while in a splint. Electrical stimulation will be applied using the Neuro Trac Sports simulation unit at a frequency of 50hz. The amplitude of stimulation will be set at a level to achieve maximum tolerable contractions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the splinting alone group will receive hand splinting 12 hours a day, 5 -7 days a week, over a 4-week period. Customised hand splints will be used. The splints will be worn generally at night. However, splinting time may need to be varied to minimise interference with hygiene and therapy. Wrists will be stretched to maximum tolerable extension while in a splint.</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential participants who fit the eligibility criteria or the persons responsible for them will be given the Participant Information Sheets. An investigator will explain the study protocol to them. No pressure to participate will be placed on them under any circumstances. They will be informed that participation in the study is entirely voluntary and they are free to withdraw from the study at any stage without any effect on their current and future treatment. Those who agree to participate will be given the Consent Forms to sign and participate in the study. After completion of the baseline assessment, participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups: splinting and electrical stimulation (experimental) and splinting only (control). The allocation sequence is computer generated by a person not involved in recruitment and concealed using consecutively numbered, sealed and opaque envelopes. The envelopes will be kept off-site in a centralised registry and only opened by a person not involved in the study after the participants have completed the baseline assessment.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the project is to determine the benefit of using a bi-modal approach for treating and preventing contracture in adults with acquired brain injury. A multi-centre randomised controlled study with concealed allocation and assessor blinding will be conducted. In this study, the wrist is selected as a model to assess if a bi-modal programme (splinting and electrical stimulation) is more effective than usual care (splinting alone). The participants are people with acquired brain injury admitted to the rehabilitation units of Royal Rehabilitation Centre Sydney, Liverpool Hospital and Balmain hospital.</summary>
