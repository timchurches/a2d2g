  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study of pracinostat vs. placebo
      with azacitidine (AZA) as background therapy in patients = 18 years of age with newly
      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia and
      cytogenetic low-risk AML, who are unfit to receive intensive remission induction chemotherapy
      due to age = 75 years or comorbidities. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of
      two groups: Group A (experimental group) to receive pracinostat plus AZA and Group B (control
      group) to receive placebo plus AZA. Randomization will be stratified by cytogenetic risk
      category (intermediate vs. unfavorable-risk, according to SWOG Cytogenetic Risk Category
      Definitions) and ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2). Treatments will be administered based
      on 28-day cycles, with pracinostat/placebo administered orally once every other day, 3 times
      a week for 3 weeks, followed by one week of no treatment and AZA administered for 7 days of
      each cycle. Study treatment should continue until there is documented disease progression,
      relapse from complete remission (CR), or non-manageable toxicity. A minimum of 6 cycles may
      be required to achieve a complete remission. Once permanently discontinued from study
      treatment, patients will enter the Long-term Follow-up phase of the study and will be
      followed for assessment of disease progression, if applicable, and survival every 3 months
      (±1 month) until death. The end of this study is defined when 390 events (deaths) have
      occurred and the study is unblinded for final overall survival analysis. Patients who are
      receiving study treatment at the end of the study may have the opportunity to continue to
      receive the study drugs to which they were randomized to (Post- Study Observation Period),
      until the Sponsor informs the Investigators of the appropriate course of action based on the
      study results. The Post-Study Observation Period is defined as the period starting from the
      end of the study for a maximum of 12 months.</summary>
