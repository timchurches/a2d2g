  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both intervention (EIG) and control (CG) groups will receive standard Physiotherapy input which typically consists of bi-daily intervention.

The EIG will undergo a prescribed resistance exercise program in their afternoon Physiotherapy session which will last for approximately 60 mins, three times per week. 

The resistance training program will be Physiotherapy-led and will comprise 3 sets of 10 repetitions of exercises for shoulders, biceps, triceps, quadriceps and lower limb complex at a load of 70% of 1 repetition max, as determined by pre-session strength assessments. 

The intervention period will continue for 4 weeks. There will be a break from intervention of at least 3 days following skin grafting procedures to allow for adequate wound healing. Assuming each patient will undergo one surgical procedure, we will aim for a minimum 10 exercise sessions for each patient during the intervention period. This may require addiditonal sesisons beyond the 4 week period to achieve 10 sessions.

    <comparator>The CG will undergo the same exercise program and movements three times per week without resistance or progression.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is known that survivors of burn injury often experience impairments in strength and functional ability for the rest of their life. This is a result of losses in skeletal muscle mass and strength. This study aims to investigate the effect of resistance training on the muscle mass, strength and quality of life of a burns patient.

It is expected that patients who undertake a structured resistance exercise training program will exhibit increased muscle mass, increased strength and an improved quality of life compared to the control group.
