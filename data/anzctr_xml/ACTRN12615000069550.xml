  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study hypothesis: Current clinical management of OSA is to use continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) as a first-line treatment, and CPAP is approved in Australia for this purpose. Some people find CPAP difficult to tolerate and sleep with, so other treatments may be useful. Oxygen therapy is one form of treatment that could potentially treat OSA patients with unstable breathing control as the key factor underlying OSA.

Primary purpose: The aim of this study is to test if oxygen therapy is an effective and acceptable alternative treatment to CPAP for patients with unstable breathing control underlying their OSA.</summary>
