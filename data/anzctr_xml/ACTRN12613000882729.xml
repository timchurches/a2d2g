  <interventions>
    <interventions>Primary total hip replacement using a tantalum trabecular metal coated acetabular shell. This is a surgical procedure where the femoral head is removed and replaced by a 28 mm metal prosthetic femoral head, which is attached to a femoral stem inserted into the femur. The head then articulates with a plastic (highly cross-linked polyethylene) liner in a metal acetabular shell, which is inserted into the acetabulum. Initial stability of the shell is achieved by press-fit fixation, without the use of screws. The duration of the operation is between about 45 minutes and 4 hours, depending on the complexity of the operation. 
During the operation tiny tantalum beads are inserted into the periprosthetic bone to enable determination of acetabular component migration using a highly sophisticated radiographic technique, namely radiostereometric analysis. </interventions>

    <concealment>A Registration Form detailing all inclusion and exclusion criteria is completed for every patient who is to undergo primary total hip replacement by one of the collaborating surgeons. All eligible patients are then given a Patient Information Sheet/Consent Form. Consenting patients are then stratified and randomised. An envelope with the allocation either to a tantalum trabecular metal or titanium fibre metal acetabular component is opened intra-operatively and, after intra-operative exclusion criteria have been assessed, the allocated acetabular component is inserted. </concealment>
    <sequence>Patients are stratified for a number of factors that may affect outcomes (eg surgeon, age).
A listing of all possible combinations of allocations in pre-determined block sizes was prepared and each combination was allocated a number. Then a random number generator was used to choose the combination sequence for the block sizes required in each stratum. 
Blocked randomisation is then undertaken within strata, with patients being randomised to receive a total hip prosthesis with either a tantalum trabecular metal or titanium fibre metal acetabular component. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size has been calculated on the basis of determining migration of the acetabular component from 0 to 2 years, using Makuch and Simon's method to show equivalence between groups. Specifically, a total sample size of 54 has been calculated as being necessary to show with 80% probability (1 - beta) that the two-sided 90% confidence limit (alpha) for the true difference in migration between the trabecular metal and titanium fibre groups does not exceed 0.20 (difference), assuming that 75% (p) of acetabular components will not migrate more than 1 mm at two years.
The sample size is increased to 64 to allow for attrition due to death and loss to follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial aims to determine whether a tantalum trabecular metal acetabular component in a primary total hip replacement prosthesis can achieve adequate initial fixation without the use of screws. This study utilises radiostereometric analysis, the most sensitive radiographic technique available to measure acetabular component migration in vivo. </summary>
