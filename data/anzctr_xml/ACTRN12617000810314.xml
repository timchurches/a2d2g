  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients attending the pre- Anaesthetic clinic will be asked to taste two carbohydrate rich drinks used to reduce starvation before an anaesthetic and asked which one they prefer. 
40 mls of either Drink A or B will be give and the patient in turn and they will be asked to rate the taste and if they will be asked if they think they could drink a full recommended volume of approx. 400mls.
They will then be given water to rinse the taste from their mouth.
40mls of the second drink will then be given to the patient and the same questions asked relating to the second drink.
The drinks are a 12.5% carbohydrate solution so a full 400ml drink is a load of 50g.  The 40mls will therefore be a total of 5g of carbohydrate.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will be given both drinks to try and asked which one they prefer.
The order in which the drinks will be tasted will be randomised.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Carbohydrate rich clear fluids were added to the pre-operation fasting guidelines at our hospital in January 2015 to reduce the time from last calorie intake prior to surgery.  20% of patients indicated they did not like the drinks during an internal audit after the introduction of the drink.  A new drink was launched in 2016 and we plan to ask our patients which drink they prefer with a view to increasing compliance.</summary>
