  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study compares the psychosocial outcomes of different management strategies for women
      with minor atypia (including HPV effect) detected on Pap smears: conventional management (a
      repeat Pap smear at 6 months) versus Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, a new method
      proposed for the management of minor atypia and the informed choice of either management
      supported by a decision aid.

      The study examines womens informed preferences for each of these options and compares the
      psychosocial outcomes in women who are or are not given the choice of management.

      HPV DNA testing offers considerable changes to the management of women with minor atypia and
      there is evidence from the USA which suggests that the use of HPV DNA testing as a triage
      strategy is effective for women within this group (Solomon et al 2001). The introduction of
      HPV DNA testing may bring both benefits and harms to women. These harms and benefits are not
      well understood. Examination of the psychosocial outcomes of HPV DNA testing compared to
      conventional management and womens preferences for each is needed to guide decisions
      concerning HPV DNA testing in cervical screening in Australia and also internationally.</summary>
