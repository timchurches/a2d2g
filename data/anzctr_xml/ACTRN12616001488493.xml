  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study undertakes further follow-up at 8 to 11 years of preschool age cohorts of children with Cerebral Palsy that were examined from 2 to 5 years as part of two previous overlapping, longitudinal studies (NHMRC 465128; NHMRC 569605, ACTRN 1261200169820). The participants may be observed at any time during the three year period, depending on their availability. Due to the nature of the study, which includes a 3Tmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan and a number of clinical assessments, the children will ideally be seen once over 1.5 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Children invited to participate in Predict-CP have taken part in two previous overlapping,  prospective, longitudinal Cerebral Palsy cohort studies (ACTRN 1261200169820, NHMRC 465128; NHMRC 569605), between 1.5 to 5 years of age. This data was collected between January 2006 and December 2014 by our research group at the University of Queensland. 
We will now be re-evaluating relationships between brain structure at 3T, health care utilisation, functional- and social-outcomes of the same participant cohort at 8-11 years.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All children diagnosed with CP, born between 1st January 2006 and 31st December, 2009 in Queensland that have participated in the CPChild study (ACTRN 1261200169820) a prospective longitudinal cohort study between the ages of 1.5 to 5 years who will now be invited to return at 8-11 years. For inclusion criteria Cerebral Palsy is defined as a permanent (but not unchanging) disorder of movement and posture that results from an insult to the developing central nervous system. The characteristic signs are spasticity, movement disorders, muscle weakness, ataxia and rigidity.</inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>A comprehensive database has been established for all data collection, including clinical measures, MRI scoring and questionnaires so that it is entered prospectively at the time of each assessment.  Summary reports are automatically generated from the database to report back to families and treating clinicians after each visit.  Our biostatistician will supervise the statistical methods proposed in this study, including analysis of binary outcomes in longitudinal studies using weighted estimating equations (e.g. presence of co morbidities); multilevel mixed-effects models of longitudinal binary outcomes (e.g. GMFCS levels), and generalised estimating equations for ordinal data.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Predict-CP cohort provides further follow-up at 8-11 years of two overlapping preschool-age cohorts examined from 2-5 years (NHMRC465128 motor and brain development; NHMRC569605 growth, nutrition and physical activity). 
This population based cohort study undertakes state-wide surveillance of 245 children with CP born in Queensland (birth years 2006-2009). Children will be classified for Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS); Manual Ability Classification System (MACS), Communication (CSFS) and OPD (EDACS). Outcomes include gross motor function, musculoskeletal development (hip displacement, spasticity, muscle contracture), upper limb function, communication difficulties, participation, parent and child reported quality of life and medical and allied health resource use.  These detailed phenotypical data will be compared to brain macro and micro structure using 3T MRI. Relationships between brain lesion severity and outcomes will be analysed using multilevel mixed-effects models.
