  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) Whole Body Vibration (WBV) uses high frequency stimuli which are generated by a vibrating platform transmitted through the body where they load the bone and stimulate muscle.
b) participants stand upright with knees either soft or locked. Participants will be randomized into one of the groups (ie locked kness ot soft knees) according to a randomisation plan generated from www.randomization.com by a researcher not directly involved in the study. The trainers will monitor the knee position throughout the training session. An overhead transparency drawn with the correct knee angle for soft knees will be used to enable the correct knee angle is maintained throughout each training session.
c) the duration and frequency of whole body vibration intermittent exposure is 20 minute (alternating 1 minute vibration, 1 minute off; 10 min total vibration exposure) sessions 3 times a week for 26 weeks.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle Function will be measured by:
a) muscle strength (leg and arm) using 1 Repetition Maximum (RM)
b) muscle power measure as the muscle force/time to lift a load at 20%, 40%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% 1 RM</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3 Months, and 6 months following commencement of intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Balance will be measured using static balance and dynamic posturography, which is measured on a Chattecx Balance Platform. The platform moves in an anterior-posterior (AP) direction (forward-backward) for 30 s under open and eyes closed conditions. The platform also moves in AP tilt (up and down). for 30 s under open and eyes closed conditions. Static balance is measure by single leg stand for 30 s under eyes open and eyes closed conditions.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>High frequency mechanical strain, as delivered when standing on a whole body vibration (WBV) platform, has been shown to have beneficial effects on weight bearing bone and muscle mass.  Improved bone health in older adults from the use of gently vibrating platforms may be possible, but more scientific investigations are required. The role of these devices is poorly understood. This study proposes to investigate the effect of six months of WBV training on BMD, bone geometry and muscle mass and function in older adults; and to examine the dose-response relationship between optimum vibration protocols and bone mineral, bone geometry and muscle mass. The study will be a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome measures will be BMD and muscle mass measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and bone geometry and muscle area of lower limbs measured using peripheral quantitative computer tomography (pQCT).</summary>
