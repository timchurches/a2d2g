  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interventions: The patients were randomized into 2 groups (30 patients each) to undergo peribulbar anesthesia. 
Group I: patients received 50 micrograms fentanyl and lidocaine 2% with hyaluronidase 15 IU/ml. Group II: patients received 100 nanograms naloxone, 50 micrograms fentanyl and lidocaine 2% with hyaluronidase 15 IU/ml. Preoperatively , no premedication was given and, intravenous cannula was inserted. The patients were monitored continuously for ECG, heart rate, pulse oximetery. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) was measured non-invasively every 5 minutes. Topical local anesthetic (benoxinate hydrochloride) was applied to the eye then, with the eye in the primary gaze position, a 25-gauge short bevel needle was inserted trans-conjunctivally at the junction between the medial two thirds and lateral third of the inferior orbital rim in a strictly posterior direction. Depth of needle insertion was limited to 25mm. The anesthetic mixture was injected after aspiration test and, the injection was continued until subconjunctival edema and lid fullness appeared. Intermittent digital compression was applied to lower the intraocular pressure until sufficient motor block occurred. 
   Pain was assessed during and after surgery at 30, 60, 90 minutes 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours post-operatively, using Visual Analogue Score (VAS). 0 = no pain, to 10 = maximum pain, 1-3 = mild pain, 4 - 6 = moderate pain, &gt; 6 = severe pain. Patients with moderate or severe pain received diclofenac sodium 75 mg intramuscular injection.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>    The primary outcome is the duration of analgesia indicated by the first time for rescue analgesic (measured from the time of local anesthetic injection to time of feeling of moderate or severe pain) as assessed using visual analogue score. </outcome>

We used an 18-point scale, which was the sum of six sub-scores for the four rectus muscles, levator palpebrae and orbicularis oculi from 0 to 3 (0 = no block, 1 = partial akinesia not sufficient for surgery, 2 = partial akinesia sufficient for surgery, 3 = complete akinesia)</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>For each group 26 patients were required for naloxone to increase the mean value of the first time for rescue analgesic by 20 % [30 minutes (0.5 hour)] based on a previous pilot study in our institute with 90 % power (a = 0.05 %) and standard deviation (SD) of 0.55.  We used 30 patients in each group for more accurate statistical analysis.
The data were analyzed using SPSS (version 20), quantitative data were expressed as mean +/- SD (for age, weight, duration of surgery, onset, IOP, total akinesia score, best akinesia score, total injected volume and first time for rescue analgesic) and analyzed using independent-t-test for comparison between the two groups. F Test was used for comparison of IOP within the same group and Tukey's test is used as post hoc test.  The VAS (did not follow the normal distribution was expressed as median (range) and Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison between the two groups. While, the sex, number of patients who needed supplemental injection, and complications were expressed as (number %). P&lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>
