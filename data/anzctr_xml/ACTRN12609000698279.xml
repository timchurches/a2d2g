  <interventions>
    <interventions>acupuncture treatment for chronic low back pain orally baclofen administration.The enrolled subjects randomly were divided to: (1) control (C) group,(2) acupuncture treated (AC) group,(3) baclofen treated (BA) group, and(4) acupuncture plus baclofen treated (BA+AC) group. Treatment procedures for all groups were continued for 5 weeks, which is a standard frequency of treatments for chronic pain .
(2)Acupuncture (AC) group:
Acupuncture treatment followed the Standard Recommendation in Clinical Trial of Acupuncture (STRICTA) (18). Subjects in this group received acupuncture treatment 2 times a week for 5 weeks by certified acupuncturist. Acupuncture protocol followed the modern approach to acupuncture which incorporates neurohumoral theories of acupuncture treatment mechanism.  Each patient, according to major acupuncture references, received needle in following selected acupoints: Shenshu (BL23), Dachangshu (BL25), Panguanshu (BL28) Ciliao (BL32), Kunlum (BL60), huantiao(GB30) and Yanglingquan (GB 34). Aseptic procedure and disposable, stainless, 30- gauge needles with electrical stimulation at 4-6 Hz with pulse duration of 0.5 ms were used (28, 29). Needles (0.2 mm Ã— 40 mm, Seirin Co Ltd) were inserted into the acupoints till the subject felt dull pain or de qi. At each session 10-12 needles were used and needles were left in place for 20-25 minutes. 

(3)Baclofen (BA) group:
The 30 mg/day orally administered dose of baclofen is recommended as effective dose in chronic LBP.  It is also known that at this dose required for pain relief, no motor impairment was observed (24). 

(4)Acupuncture plus baclofen treated (BA+AC) group:
These patients in A+B treated group received both baclofen (30 mg/day, orally) and, 2 times a week, 20-25 min acupuncture treatment (according to acupuncture method which mentioned above) for 5 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>(1)Control (C) group:
The control group did not receive any specific treatment for chronic pain and followed their normal life style. These patients asked to remain on their same life and not start new medications.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic non- specific low back pain (LBP) is a prevailing and multidimensional
problem, which different treatment methods were applied. Methods: 84
patients (men, aged 40-65 years) with non-specific chronic LBP were randomly
allocated in four groups. The baclofen group received only orally administered
baclofen (30mg/day); the acupuncture group received only acupuncture treatment at
selected acupoints for chronic low back pain; the acupuncture + baclofen group
received both acupuncture and baclofen treatments; and the control group followed
normal life with no pain reducing interventions. Treatments were applied for five weeks and the results followed till 10th week of treatment. Outcome measures were pain intensity in terms of visual analogue scale (VAS) and self-reported pain disability in terms of Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ).</summary>
