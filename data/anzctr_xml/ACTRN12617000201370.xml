  <interventions>
    <interventions>6 different kinds of test drinks are provided in duplicate: espresso-, instant, boiled and decaffeinated coffee, as well as water and sugar-sweetened milk. The details of the test drinks are listed below:

Espresso-coffee: 35ml of the beverage is made from 7g of grounded coffee powder using an espresso machine (Delonghi 680). Served with 50g low-fat cow's milk and 7,5g white sugar. Caffeine content in one serve of espresso drink is 115mg.
Instant coffee: made by adding 2g of instant coffee powder into 140ml of near-boiling water. Served with 50g low-fat cow's milk and 7,5g white sugar. Caffeine content in one serve of instant coffee drink is 110mg.
Boiled coffee: made by adding 9g of grounded coffee powder into 175ml boiled water. Simmer for 10 minutes and cool in room temperature for 3 minutes. 150ml of the coffee beverage is served with 50g low-fat cow's milk and 7,5g white sugar. Caffeine content in one serve of boiled coffee drink is 170mg.
Decaffeinated coffee: made by adding 2g of decaffeinated coffee powder into 140ml of near-boiling water. Served with 50g low-fat cow's milk and 7,5g white sugar. Caffeine content in one serve of decaffeinated coffee drink is 3mg.
Control: 140ml of near-boiling water. 
Sweetened-milk: 50g of low-fat cow's milk and 7,5g of white sugar is added into 140ml of near-boiling water.

The participant arrive in the morning with an empty stomach. He/she will give the first blood sample, then drink the test drink within 10 minutes. After 60 minutes, another blood sample will be taken. Then he/she will have to consume a standard breakfast made up of rice cereal, rice milk and glucose powder in 10 minutes. Investigators will make sure that the participant finishes the test drink and the standard breakfast.

There will be two sessions for each test drinks, thus giving 12 sessions in total for each participant. A washout period of three days is given between each session.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Coffee is a staple drink around the world and is mainly consumed for its arousing effect. Available in different types, including espresso, boiled and instant, coffee is becoming increasingly popular in Hong Kong. The protective effects of habitual coffee consumption towards several chronic diseases related to unhealthy lifestyles, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and metabolic syndrome, have been demonstrated. However these findings contradict with the results of acute feeding studies, which found that coffee is capable of impairing the body's own ability to control blood sugar level. This project aims at investigating the acute effect of consuming different kinds of coffee on the different biomarkers in blood. This project will be able to demonstrate the difference in effects upon consuming different types of coffee, which can lead to further investigation of the biological mechanisms involved. Long term consumption studies may also be carried out so that a comparison between the short-term and long-term effects is possible.

Four types of coffee will be studied, including espresso, boiled, instant and decaffeinated coffee. After overnight fasting, each participant will consume a cup of test drink and consume a standard breakfast 60 minutes later. Blood samples will be taken to track the changes of the different metabolites during the session.</summary>
