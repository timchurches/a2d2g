  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent research indicates that shoe inserts are effective in treating some individuals with knee pain. However, not all individuals benefit from shoe inserts and research to determine who is most likely to benefit is limited. Therefore, this study is aiming to identify predictors of individuals with knee pain most likely to benefit from shoe inserts.</summary>
