  <interventions>
    <interventions>For each Cohort, on a weekly schedule (Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36) patients will receive a single dose of Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) via intravenous infusion over 30 mins. These weekly doses will continue until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached.
The first dose on Day 1 is followed up concurrently 24 hours later with radiotherapy, which is fractionated daily (1.8 Gy daily dose) from Day 2-5, Day 8-12, Day 15-19, Day 22-26, Day 29-33, Day 36-40, &amp; Day 43. (5 fractions per week, 28 fractionated doses total), for up to 6 weeks only (if doses are tolerated).


Cohort 1: 25 mg/m2 - weekly dose / 6 weeks.

Cohort 2: 50 mg/m2 - weekly dose / 6 weeks.

Cohort 3: 75 mg/m2 - weekly dose / 6 weeks.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of concurrent Abraxane (Registered Trademark) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

When a dose-limiting toxicity is observed in any of the cohorts, up to three additional patients will be added to the cohort. If fewer than two of six patients in the cohort develop dose-limiting toxicity, escalation to the next cohort will proceed.
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be the dose below highest dose level at which fewer than two of six patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured from Enrolment, until completion of Cohort 4 (dependent on limiting toxicities).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Abraxane (Registered Trademark) used concurrently with EBRT.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed weekly from Day 1, looking for any toxicity from the treatment and graded according to CTCAE v4.0

on completion of chemotherapy (i.e. Day 36), a follow-up assessment will occur, then again 14 days after, and then 2 monthly for 1 year, 3 monthly for year 2, 4 monthly for year 3, 6monthly for year 4  5 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the efficacy of Abraxane (Registered Trademark) used concurrently with EBRT (response rate, duration of response, progression free survival, median and 1- year overall survival) in LAPC</outcome>
      <timepoint>on completion of chemotherapy (i.e. Day 36), a follow-up assessment will occur, then again 14 days after, and then 2 monthly for 1 year, 3 monthly for year 2, 4 monthly for year 3, 6monthly for year 4  5 years.

Patients will be followed up from enrolment for disease progression and death to assess for exploratory endpoints of progression free survival, 1-year survival and overall survival. This will be assessed both clinically, biochemically (tumour markers), and radiologically.

    <statisticalmethods>The MTD can be determined without statistical analysis. The toxicity will be reviewed as the frequency of adverse events as a percentage. We will look at the data for trends in toxicity with dose escalation, however the sample sizes will be too small for meaningful comparisons. We look at efficacy data with response rates as percentages, survival data with progression free survival, overall survival, and 1-year survival with Kaplan-Meir Curves and calculation of hazard ratios.  The data will be analysed for all patients who receive at least one dose of Abraxane (Registered Trademark) and one fraction of radiotherapy with an intention-to-treat model. No interim analysis is planned.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study we plan to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the drug Abraxane, which can be safely given to patients concurrently with radiotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have been diagnosed with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, which is not amenable to curative surgery. Study details Participants in this study will receive the chemotherapy drug Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) by intravenous infusion (i.e. directly into the vein) over 30 minutes on a weekly schedule, concurrently with radiotherapy for 6 weeks. The first participants will receive Abraxane at a dose of 25 mg/m2 and if this is tolerated the dose will be increased for the subsequent groups until the maximum tolerated dose can be determined. Participants will be regularly monitored for safety and tolerability throughout treatment. On completion of treatment they will also be followed up for up to 5 years in order to evaluate efficacy of treatment in terms of disease response and survival.
