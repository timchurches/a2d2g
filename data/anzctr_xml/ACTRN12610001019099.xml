  <interventions>
    <interventions>For the parents of the child with anxiety, they will go through group education sessions where they will learn skills like cognitive restructuring, exposure and reinforcements to help their child overcome their anxiety. 

The children with anxiety will undergo 6 sessions of social skills training concurrently. 

Parent education and child sessions are administered by a trained therapist and will be 1.5hrs per session for 6 sessions over 10 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Waitlist controls who will be offered the parent education sessions after the 6 months (as the parent education sessions have been shown in previous trials to be useful).</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Advertisements will be put up in preschools and interested parents will call. We will send out screening questionnaires to them to fill out. If they are eligible for the study, they will be randomly allocated to either treatment or waitlist control.

Allocation to groups is via cluster randomization by coin tossing prior to the clients being allocated to the group. The allocation was done by a research assistant while decisions of inclusion and exclusion were undertaken by the Primary investigator.</concealment>
