  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to receive the intervention will receive care according to the clinical care pathway and based on their projected risk.  The risk stratification is assessed by completing the clinical prediction rule completed online (online tool).   

Low risk: 
Participants stratified into low risk will receive a more minimal intervention comprising up to 3 sessions with their primary health care provider, providing guideline based advice (remain active and return to normal activities) and a neck specific exercise program based on guidelines.   The decision to provide 1-3 sessions is at the discretion of the primary health care provider, and may depend on factors such as symptoms, presenting impairments and logistics.  Primary health care providers typically provide these sessions individually, for 20-40 minutes duration on average. All sessions should be completed within 12 weeks after injury. Supporting information regarding the advice and exercises will also be provided as part of the online tool.  

Medium/ high risk: 
Participants stratified into medium or high risk will be referred to a specialist provider who has been trained specifically for this study. The clinical pathway of care recommends that this referral occur between 3 and 6 weeks after injury. The initial specialist assessment is anticipated to take 1 hour.  As per recommendations in the pathway, the specialist provider will complete a more detailed assessment of physical and psychological factors including sensory disturbances, motor and muscle function, post-traumatic stress symptoms, pain catastrophisation, anxiety and beliefs about the injury and subsequent recovery. 
The specialist provider (SP) will then undertake one of three actions: 
1.	Continue current care: monitored by specialist. 
This first pathway of care will be chosen when the results of the assessment indicate below threshold scores on psychological questionnaires and central sensitisation, and if the specialist provider identifies the patients original primary health care provider has appropriate expertise to provide the recommended care, A  treatment plan will be developed in conjunction with the patient and the patients primary health care  provider.  The SP  will provide specific advice about the optimal approach to future treatment, with the recommendation to modify the approach if necessary. The SP, in consultation with the patient and the primary health care provider, will  also identify the primary treatment goal and advise about anticipate outcomes for the remaining episode of care. Advice will also be provided about the duration of future treatment and the anticipated number of treatments required (eg 20-30 minute sessions provided by the primary carer as frequently as mutually agreed between the SP and the primary health care provider).  A critical component of this plan is separation or discharge planning with a view to ensuring the patient is confident and competent with self-directed, active management within an appropriate timeframe not exceeding six months from the time of injury.   The SP will review the patient at regular intervals. The frequency of the review sessions will be  agreed collaboratively after discussion between the specialist and the primary health care provider. Up to  3 review sessions (of up to 1 hours duration)  are anticipated to be provided and should be completed by 12 weeks after injury. The purpose of review sessions are to monitor the patients progress and to adjust the treatment plan as necessary. 
2. Specialist provides care: physical and CBT approach
The second pathway of care will be chosen when based on the more detailed assessment, results indicate moderate to severe symptoms and mild to moderate symptoms on psychological questionnaires. The SP will  provide care that addresses the physical and psychological characteristics identified in the more detailed assessment. The package of care will be exercise based physical therapy with psychologically informed therapy following a cognitive behavioral therapy approach. To date these interventions have the highest level of evidence in clinical guidelines for whiplash, with several RCTs underpinning these recommendations. Examples of therapy that may be provided in these sessions would be exercise therapy to rehabilitate impairments in  cervical motor control, sensorimotor control and  functional rehabilitation; psychologically informed therapy to address unhelpful beliefs identified such as pain catastrophisaton, fear avoidance, poor self efficacy and passive coping strategies. The provider will also work with the patient to negotiate treatment goals and anticipated outcomes for the episode of care. The SP will determine the number of sessions (up to 6 sessions of approximately 1 hour each)  and the duration of this episode of care as well formulating a discharge plan. The aim of this intervention is to ensure that the patient is confident and competent with self-directed, active management within an appropriate timeframe not exceeding six months from the time of injury.
 (3) Specialist refers for alternate care.
In the third pathway, based on the more detailed assessment, where results indicate moderate to severe symptoms, the specialist provider will refer  for interdisciplinary management as directed by the clinical guideline and pathway. For example, at present, clinical guidelines recommend referral to a psychologist if the Impact of Events Scale (IES) is above 46, indicating moderate to severe post-traumatic stress symptoms.  In addition if pain is high and not resolving or there are clear signs of central sensitization, the specialist provider may refer for pain management in accordance with the acute pain management guidelines (which has recently incorporated in the updated MAA (2014) whiplash guidelines.  The specialist will facilitate this referral in liaison with the primary health care provider. Once referred, sessions provided will be at the discretion of the practitioner who receives the referral.    

Whilst this intervention primarily is directed at providing appropriate care within 3 months of injury, the overall aim is to ensure that the patient is competent in self-directed active management not exceeding 6 months from the time of injury. 
As per the secondary aims of this study, adherence to the pathway including the number and nature of sessions provided in each pathway will be collected by way of patient log book completed every 2 weeks and clinical survey completed at 12 months.  

An online tool, developed specifically for this study, will be provided to support implementation of the pathway. The online tool comprises patient and practitioner resources (e.g. questionnaires/relevant assessment tools, exercise videos, case vignettes for specialist providers) that will facilitate progress through the pathway. The various steps will be automated and will provide practitioners with: the risk classification of patients; suggested management strategies; and schedule for review of outcomes. This tool will be available to patients, primary health care providers, and specialist providers in the intervention group for the duration of the trial (12 months) 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to control will receive usual care regardless of their risk category. Usual care will be provided by their primary health care provider who will not be informed of the risk category. Decisions regarding the number of treatment sessions, content of management (assessment and treatment), and referral to other professionals will depend on clinical judgment. No attempt to change usual care of participants will be made.</comparator>

      <outcome>Direct and indirect costs (costs per QALY saved)

The primary cost-effectiveness outcome will be cost per QALY saved. This will  be calculated using  utility weights  generated using  participants SF-12 responses, translated to SF-6D utilities using the Brazier et al. (2002) (Brazier, Roberts et al. 2002) algorithm or, if completed by the time this trial commences, the Australian algorithm that is currently being developed by Viney and colleagues (Viney 2012).
Secondary cost outcomes will be direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs (e.g. general practitioner, physiotherapy, chiropractor and pharmaceutical service) will be calculated using rebates taken from the Medicare Benefits Schedule, workers compensation schemes and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Direct health-care cost (e.g. consumer co-payments) and non-health care costs, which are not captured by these insurer payments, will be identified using patient cost diaries. Patients will be asked to complete cost diaries in order to capture the direct costs; for example, other professional care, transportation costs, medication costs  and time spent by family members or volunteers providing care.

The indirect costs associated with their injury include the patients lost economic productivity due to poor health. A shadow wage rate will be used to identify the opportunity cost of time spent away from work due to their injury. These costs will be calculated using income and employment data collected via a baseline questionnaire.

    <statisticalmethods>Data Analysis
The primary and secondary health outcomes will be analysed independently, using cross-sectional analyses, at 12 weeks, 6, and 12 months post-intervention using generalised linear models methods, with an appropriate link function, to test for an intervention effect adjusted for the baseline values. Effect sizes will be calculated for all measures with an effect size of 0.2 considered small, 0.5 medium and 0.8 large. Alpha will be set at 0.05.  If there is a statistically significant treatment effect, we will also calculate number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve recovery of function and 95% confidence intervals.

Professional practice outcomes will be analysed using both descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. Median scores will be calculated for ordinal data and frequency distribution will be reported. Codes or keywords will be identified from literature prior to analysis of the responses from the open-ended questions. Occurrences of the identified codes or keywords will be documented through frequency counts.

Effect modifiers: The group variable (low risk or medium/high risk) will be tested for its association with treatment effect by adding a predictor x treatment group interaction term to the regression equation.

Power Analysis
With the outcome being change in Neck Disability Index (NDI) pre-post, based on detecting a medium effect size (10% change on the NDI is considered clinically worthwhile, SD:18) in a 2 X 2 interaction with a power of .80 and  alpha of .05,  the required minimum is 196 participants.  Given that we expect 50% high vs low risk, this equates to 50 participants in each cell (High-Low risk, Usual Care-Intervention). Taking into account a 15% drop-out rate, we will recruit 236 participants. This sample size will be sufficient for the Global Rating of Change (GRC) outcome where the effect size is anticipated to be larger at 0.75 (clinically worthwhile change is 15%, SD: 20).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Over the last several years we have been working hard to understand recovery from whiplash injuries to help develop more effective treatments. We now believe that recovery may be facilitated if we change how care is delivered soon after their whiplash injury. We now need to test this process. 

In this randomised trial, people with whiplash will be allocated to two different processes of care.  In the first process, people with receive the treatment normally provided to individuals with a whiplash injury. In the second process, people will receive care based on a questionnaire that assesses their risk of recovery. Care will range from 1-3 sessions with their usual health care provider, to referral to a health care provider with specialist expertise in whiplash injury. This specialist provider will then undertake a more detailed assessment of physical and psychological measures. The specialist provider may either 1) continue providing people with treatment , 2) refer them back to their  own health care provider with advice on their  or 3) refer them to another practitioner for additional treatment. 

The outcomes will be assessed at the initial assessment and three follow-up assessments at:  3, 6 and 12 months after the first assessment.  Health outcomes assessed will questionnaires relating to how neck pain affects daily activities and in what way neck pain affects people personally. This study will uncover the best process to help people with whiplash recover.
