  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - temozolomide
Treatment: drugs - vincristine sulfate

Experimental: Treatment (carboplatin, vincristine sulfate, temozolomide) - Induction therapy: Patients receive carboplatin IV (175/m2) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; vincristine IV (1.5 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; and oral temozolomide (200 mg/m2) on days 43-47. Four weeks after the completion of induction therapy, patients achieving stable or responding disease proceed to maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy: Patients receive carboplatin (175/m2) and temozolomide (200 mg/m2) as in induction therapy and vincristine IV ((1.5 mg/m2) day 1 of weeks 10,11,12. Treatment repeats every 10 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Short Term Feasibility Success - Success is defined as the completion of induction plus one cycle of maintenance within 24 weeks of enrollment without more than a 25% reduction in either carboplatin or temozolomide dosage.
Failure to complete the induction and one cycle of maintenance within 24 weeks counts as a short-term-feasibility failure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Long Term Feasibility Success - Success is defined as the completion of induction plus four cycles of maintenance within 60 weeks of enrollment without more than a 25% reduction in either carboplatin or temozolomide dosage.
If the participant completes all therapy within 60 weeks the patient is a long-term feasibility success. As such, a patient who experiences short term feasibility failure can be classified as a long-term feasibility success.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence of Toxic Death - Primary safety endpoints are (1) the occurrence of toxic death, which is death during treatment that is not primarily attributable to disease progression, and (2) the occurrence of grade 4 allergy to carboplatin.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Grade 3 or 4 Thrombocytopenia and/or Neutropenia - Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia that results in more than a 3 week delay in instituting the next cycle of chemotherapy despite protocol-directed reduction of up to 25% in Carboplatin and/or Temozolomide during the first 60 weeks of therapy</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Preliminary assessments of treatment efficacy will be based on response to induction therapy, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free Survival (EFS) - Preliminary assessments of treatment efficacy will be based on response to induction therapy, 3-year event-free survival(EFS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Response Rate Categorized as Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, or Progressive Disease - Response as complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease using three-dimensional imaging measurements (preferable) or two-dimensional imaging measurements, as well as the response in the context of multiple lesions or disseminated disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide,
      work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving
      more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This pilot study is studying giving carboplatin and vincristine together with
      temozolomide in treating children with progressive and/or symptomatic low-grade glioma.</summary>
