      <outcome>McQuade test of trunk muscle endurance (measured in seconds), in which the participant holds their trunk isometrically off the floor in a side-bridge position until fatigue</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>To be eligible for inclusion in the trial, participants are required to have low back pain for at least 3 months, to be aged between 18 and 65 years, to score of four or more on the Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire at randomisation (UK Trial BEAM team 2004), and to not achieve flexion-relaxation in the lumbar muscles during trunk flexion (Neblett et al 2003).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria are clinical signs of radiculopathy, lumbar stenosis, fibromyalgia, spondylolisthesis, previous spinal surgery or Kinesio Tape therapy, corticosteroid treatment in the previous two weeks, and central or peripheral nervous system disease.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After eligibility is confirmed and baseline measures are recorded, participants are randomly assigned to experimental or control group. Allocation is concealed by using a computer-generated randomised table of numbers created before the data collection by an investigator not involved in the assessment or treatment of the participants. Individual sequentially numbered index cards with the random assignment were folded and placed in sealed opaque envelopes. On the day after the initial examination, the envelope allocated to the participant is opened by a second investigator. This investigator proceeds with the treatment according to the group assignment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random allocations are generated using a computer-generated randomised table of numbers created before the data collection by an investigator not involved in the assessment or treatment of the participants.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low back pain produces mobility restriction, long-term disability and quality of life impairment and is one of the main causes of work absenteeism. Kinesio Taping is a method of strapping tape application using special tape. The trial will examine whether the application of this tape over the lumbar spine reduces disability and improves other outcomes better than sham taping in people with chronic low back pain.</summary>
