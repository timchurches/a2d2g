    <interventions>Group 2: 
Chemotherapy: ECF  Epirubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 1, Cisplatin 60 mg/m2 IV day 1, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 200 mg/m2/d IV 21 day continuous infusion. 

Pre-operative chemoradiotherapy (CRT): Continuous infusional 5-FU- 200mg/m2/day, 7 days per week, throughout the entire period of radiotherapy via a continuous ambulatory delivery device (CADD) pump (or other infuser device depending on usual practice) through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Radiotherapy: 45 Gy of radiation in 25 fractions, five days per week for five weeks. 

Surgery: The acceptable resections are a total gastrectomy, a subtotal gastrectomy, and an esophago-gastrectomy (Ivor-Lewis esophago-gastrectomy for gastroesophageal junction [GEJ] cancers [Siewert Type II and Siewert Type III] invading up to but no more than 2cm of the lower esophagus). It is considered that the minimum extent of the operation should be a D1+ lymph node dissection but it is recommended that a D2 dissection should be performed or a D1+ for GEJ cancers requiring an esophago-gastrectomy. 

Treatment schedule: Patients randomised to Group 2 will receive 2 cycles of ECF at three-weekly intervals pre-operatively, then 2-4 week break between last cycle of ECF and chemoradiotherapy. Following chemoradiotherapy patients should have up to 6 weeks break between chemoradiotherapy and surgery and then 3 cycles of ECF should be commenced post-operatively between 4-10 weeks after surgery. 

If it is preferred by the clinician and patient, capecitabine (Xeloda) may be used in place of 5-FU during pre- and post-operative chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy. If capecitabine is used, the treatments will consist of the following: Pre- and post-operative chemotherapy: Patients may receive ECX in place of ECF. ECX consists of Epirubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 1, Cisplatin 60 mg/m2 IV day 1 and Capecitabine (Xeloda) 625 mg/m2 oral tablet twice daily, days 1-21. Pre-operative chemoradiotherapy (CRT): Capecitabine 825 mg/m2, oral tablet twice daily, days 1-5 of each week of radiotherapy (without weekends). Radiotherapy: 45 Gy of radiation in 25 fractions, five days per week for five weeks. Treatment schedule is as described above.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 1: 
Chemotherapy: ECF  Epirubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 1, Cisplatin 60 mg/m2 IV day 1, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 200 mg/m2/d IV 21 day continuous infusion. 

Surgery: The acceptable resections are a total gastrectomy, a subtotal gastrectomy, and an esophago-gastrectomy (Ivor-Lewis esophago-gastrectomy for gastroesophageal junction [GEJ] cancers [Siewert Type II and Siewert Type III] invading up to but no more than 2cm of the lower esophagus). It is considered that the minimum extent of the operation should be a D1+ lymph node dissection but it is recommended that a D2 dissection should be performed or a D1+ for GEJ cancers requiring an esophago-gastrectomy. 

Treatment schedule: Patients randomised to Group 1 will receive 3 cycles of ECF at three-weekly intervals pre-operatively. Surgery should be performed within 6 weeks of the end of the last ECF cycle. Following surgery, 3 cycles of ECF should be commenced between 4-10 weeks after surgery.

If it is preferred by the clinician and patient, capecitabine (Xeloda) may be used in place of 5-FU during pre- and post-operative chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival will be measured from date of patient entry onto the study to date of death from any cause. Following completion of study every 6 months from year 2 assessment until 5 years (date to be calculated from last day of last post-op ECF (or ECX) cycle)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Free Survival. Disease free survival (DFS), defined as the time from commencement of protocol treatment to disease progression or death without disease progression. Patients without an event prior to the study close-out date will be censored at the study close-out date or at the date of last contact if the patient is lost to follow-up. If a patient receives a subsequent anti-cancer therapy without prior documentation of disease progression, the patient will be censored at the date the patient was last seen for tumour assessment before starting the new chemotherapy. Notional significance will be 0.05 for comparisons of disease free survival.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following completion of study every 6 months from year 2 assessment until 5 years (date to be calculated from last day of last post-op ECF (or ECX) cycle)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity as measured by adverse events. Examples include febrile neutropaenia, nausea, vomiting and oesophagitis, which will be measured by clinician assessment and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Grading Scale v3.0 (NCI CTCAEv3.0).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following completion of study every 6 months from year 2 assessment until 5 years (date to be calculated from last day of last post-op ECF (or ECX) cycle)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pathological Response Rate. The definition of Patholigic response rate is the proportion of patients achieving a complete or partial pathologic response in each treatment group will be compared with the conditional binomial exact test.  The 95% confidence intervals for the treatment extimates and for the differences between arms will be presented.  With multiple logistic regressions modelling, the potential influence of patient baseline characteristics on these rates will be studied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Surgery should be performed within 6 weeks of the final radiation dose for Group 2 and within 6 weeks of the end of the last ECF (or ECX) cycle for Group 1.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Surgical R0 resection rate. This is complete macroscopic resection of gross tumour with negative surgical margins. The margins assessed include proximal (esophageal, gastric), distal (gastric for proximal resection or duodenum) and lateral margins (posterior cardia, GEJ, esophageal and nodal tissue on the lesser curve) of the specimen. The margin will be deemed involved (R1 resection) if there is carcinoma seen at or within 1mm of the margin. It will be deemed uncertain if there are malignant cells within 10mm of the margin and clear otherwise. The presence of carcinoma at a true serosal surface will be noted but not considered an involved surgical margin.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Surgery should be performed within 6 weeks of the final radiation dose for Group 2 and within 6 weeks of the end of the last ECF (or ECX) cycle for Group 1.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gastric cancer remains a significant global public health problem. Although in developed countries its incidence has dramatically decreased, on a worldwide scale it is still a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment for gastric cancer. Although the survival rates for patients with early stage disease (stage 1A and 1B) are good, this subgroup of patients constitutes only 20% of those undergoing resection. The majority of patients will have locally advanced or metastatic disease at presentation, which has an extremely poor prognosis. The current five-year survival rate for gastric cancer in Western countries is approximately 20-30%, a figure that has improved little over the past 30 years. The intervention arm in TOPGEAR consists of pre-operative chemotherapy, pre-operative chemoradiotherapy, surgery and post-operative chemotherapy. The control arm consists of pre-operative chemotherapy, surgery and post-operative chemotherapy. The primary objective of TOPGEAR is to investigate whether the addition of chemoradiotherapy to chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in the neoadjuvant setting by improving pathological complete response (pCR) rates in the first instance, and subsequently overall survival, in patients undergoing adequate surgery (D1+ dissection) for resectable gastric cancer.</summary>
