    <interventions>Use of 5% tea tree oil ointment as a nasal treatment instead of 2% mupirocin cream to eradicate nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus  in renal dialysis patients.  The mode of administration is 0.25g per nostril applied topically inside nostrils for both 5% tea tree oil ointment and 2% mupirocin cream and treatment time is daily for the first 5 days and then weekly for 26 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary endpoint will be the proportions of TTO and mupirocin patients that have a catheter-related infection within 26 weeks after entry into the study. Catheter related infections will be defined as according to standard guidelines-
1. definite exit site infection if purulent discharge is present , or 2 out of 3  of erythema, tenderness and duration with a positive culture of bacteria from the exudate
2. tunnel infection will be defined as 2 out of 3 of erythema, tenderness and duration &gt;2cm from the catheter exit site along the subcutaneous tract of a tunnel catheter, with or without concomitant blood stream infection
3. definite catheter-associated bacteraemia will be defined as a single positive blood culture together with a positive culture of the catheter tip or exit site with an identical organism
4. a probable catheter-associated bacteraemia is recorded if there are 2 or more positive blood cultures (or a single blood culture of Staphylococcus aureus) with no evidence of infection source other than the device
Cases with definite or probable infections will be classed as infections.  Comparisons between the two groups will be performed using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test depending on data distribution.  Differences in proportions will be evaluated by the Chi Square or Fisher's Exact tests</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of the study which is 26 weeks for those who have not had an infection and the time of infection (end of study) for those who have an infection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary endpoints will be infection-free survival between the two treatment groups according to Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves between the two groups will be evaluated using log rank test</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>"Golden staph" is carried in the noses of 20-50% of people at any given time. People who are having renal dialysis and who carry 'golden staph' in their nose are at a higher risk of infection than those who do not. To minimise this risk renal dialysis patients are given prolonged treatment with mupirocin cream which is applied in their nostrils to kill 'golden staph'. This has lead to resistant strains of 'golden staph' that are not killed by the mupirocin treatment. Tea tree oil ointment has been used to kill 'golden staph' in people's noses and prolonged exposure to tea tree oil has not lead to development of resistance in bacteria.  It also kills a wide range of bacteria and fungi, not just 'golden staph and so we believe that tea tree oil would be at least as good as mupirocin at protecting renal patients from infection.  So this trial is looking at the use of tea tree oil and comparing it to the use of mupirocin in protecting renal dialysis patients from infection with 'golden staph'.</summary>
