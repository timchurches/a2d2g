  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a long-term, open-label study of a new experimental drug called ambrisentan. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ambrisentan in a broad population of subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Secondarily, this study will evaluate the effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of PAH, long-term treatment success, and survival. Subjects will receive 5 mg ambrisentan each day by mouth for the first 24 weeks. Then, subjects may receive 2.5, 5, or 10 mg each day by mouth, based on investigator discretion as clinically indicated. Each day of study participation subjects will receive ambrisentan until the study is ended or the subject discontinues study participation. Subjects may continue to receive ambrisentan until such time as the investigator or subject chooses to stop ambrisentan treatment, the cumulative adverse event profile does not warrant continuation of the study, ambrisentan becomes commercially available, or Gilead Sciences, Inc., stops the study.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD).  The 6MWD is the longest possible distance that a subject can walk in a timed 6-minute interval.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The 6MWD will be assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 12 and 24.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Clinical worsening of PAH</outcome>
      <timepoint>Events that mark the natural history of disease progression. These events will be assessed when or if they occur for each subject, and the event outcome will be recorded at the time of occurence. The occurrence of these events will be monitored for the duration of subject participation, until the study is ended or the subject discontinues study participation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) Change from baseline in (i) World Health Organisation (WHO) functional class, (ii) SF-36 heath survey, (iii) Borg dyspnea index, (iv) B-type natriuretic peptide</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, again at Weeks 4, 12, and 24, and every 6 month thereafter from Week 24 until the end of the study or the subject discontinues study participation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3) Monotherapy treatment status</outcome>
      <timepoint>Events that mark the natural history of disease progression. These events will be assessed when or if they occur for each subject, and the event outcome will be recorded at the time of occurence. The occurrence of these events will be monitored for the duration of subject participation, until the study is ended or the subject discontinues study participation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4) Failure-free treatment status</outcome>
      <timepoint>Events that mark the natural history of disease progression. These events will be assessed when or if they occur for each subject, and the event outcome will be recorded at the time of occurence. The occurrence of these events will be monitored for the duration of subject participation, until the study is ended or the subject discontinues study participation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5) Long-term survival. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Events that mark the natural history of disease progression. These events will be assessed when or if they occur for each subject, and the event outcome will be recorded at the time of occurence.
