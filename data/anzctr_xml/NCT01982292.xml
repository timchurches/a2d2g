  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - RLX030 (serelaxin)
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: RLX030 (serelaxin) - Randomized patients received an IV infusion of 30 µg/kg/day of serelaxin for 48 hours at randomization and at Weeks 4 and 8

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Randomized patients received an IV infusion of placebo of serelaxin for 48 hours at randomization and at Weeks 4 and 8


Treatment: drugs: RLX030 (serelaxin)
RLX030 (serelaxin) was administered according to a weight-range adjusted dosing regimen at a nominal dose of 30 µg/kg/day as a continuous IV infusion for 48 hours.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Matching placebo of serelaxin was administered as a continuous IV infusion for 48 hours.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) Who Develop Anti-serelaxin Antibodies at Any Time Following Repeat Administration of IV Continuous Infusions of Serelaxin Administered for up to 48 Hours in 16 Weeks - A patient is considered antibody positive during the study if he/she had at least two infusions and had at least one evaluable measurement to test for anti-serelaxin antibodies after each infusion and all evaluable antibody test results were positive.
A patient is considered antibody negative during the study if he/she had at least two infusions and had at least one evaluable measurement to test for anti-serelaxin antibodies after each infusion and all evaluable antibody test results were negative. A patient's antibody status is considered to be undetermined during the study if it is not defined as positive or negative.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Chronic Heart Failure Who Develop Positive Anti-serelaxin Antibodies After a Single Infusion of Serelaxin Over Time up to Week 16 - A patient is considered antibody positive during the study if he/she had at least two infusions and had at least one evaluable measurement to test for anti-serelaxin antibodies after each infusion and all evaluable antibody test results were positive. Each time period is defined as the time frame from study drug initiation (or the visit if there is no infusion) to prior to study drug initiation of the next period (or the visit if no there is no infusion). n= The total number of subjects with evaluable antibody status during the defined period.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Chronic Heart Failure With Positive Antibody Status Who Develop Non-neutralizing Anti-serelaxin Antibodies Following 3 Repeated Infusions (i.e. at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12) - A patient is considered antibody positive during the study if he/she had at least two infusions and had at least one evaluable measurement to test for anti-serelaxin antibodies after each infusion and all evaluable antibody test results were positive.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events Such as Adjudicated Potential Hypersensitivity or Infusion Reactions - Incidence rate of special interest, indicative of hypersensitivity reactions which occur during and after administration of repeated infusions of serelaxin relative to placebo in subjects with chronic heart failure is reported. Hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions can be headache, nausea, fever, chills, dizziness, flush, pruritus, chest and/or back pain.</outcome>
