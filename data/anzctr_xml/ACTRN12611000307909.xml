  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is looking at the combination of the drugs Paclitaxel and Epirubicin used as neoadjuvant systemic treatment for women with locally advanced breast cancer in order to assess response rates

Who is it for?
You may take part in this study if you are a female aged 18 years or over and have a confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer (cancer that is considered inoperable by your treating surgeon). 

Trial Details

Participants in this study will receive Neoadjuvant (before surgery) chemotherapy with Paclitaxel and Epirubicin. The schedule of treatment will involve the drug Paclitaxel given at a dose of 175mg per m2 intravenously, and Epirubicin 90mg per m2 given intravenously given once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses before surgery (and an overall total of 12 weeks of treatment)

The aim of this study is to see how a combination of 2 chemotherapeutic drugs - Paclitaxel and Epirubicin, is tolerated in women with locally advanced breast cancer. We also expect to see how effective this combination is in the treatment of this condition.</summary>
