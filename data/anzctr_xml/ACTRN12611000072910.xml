  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a pilot study.
The e-learning application guides the woman to oberve and report her natural fertility symptoms each day. It interprets these symptoms according to the Billings Method, reports her fertility status in Billings Method chart format, and maintains a complete record.  After 100 days the particpant will submit her records to the investigators for analysis.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Women being able to enter their fertility symptoms adequately under the guidance from the application. Their descriptions of fertility symptoms will be deemed to be adequate if the pattern recognition algorithm in the e-learning application is able to recognise the Peak of fertiltiy (approximate time of ovulation) in an ovulatory cycle.

The outcome will be assessed by a qualified instructor of the Billings Method at the end of the trial period, using questionnaire, interview and analysis of the reports generated by the application.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuous during the trial</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Women being able to enter their fertility symptoms adequately under the guidance of the application and to learn to understand their cycles as effectively as they would if under instruction from a Billings Method fertility educator.
The woman will submit a questionnaire and be interviewed by a fertility educator at the end of the trial. An evaluation of her understanding of her patterns of fertility and infertility will be made.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis is that a woman can be guided by an interactive computer application to adequately recognise and record her natural fertility symptoms and that the application can use this knowledge to inform her about fertility awareness  according to the Billings Method of natural family planning.
 
Method:
Women in the age bracket 18-38 will be recruited by advertising.
Participants will download the application software to their PC and  follow the guidance system to make thier fertility observations  and receive feedback for the next 100 days.
At the end of the 100 day period participants will submit their fertility data for analysis and subsequent interview.
A pilot study involving about 30 participants will be initially undertaken.</summary>
