  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of the study was to use negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in patients with chronic venous leg ulceration.

Intervention:
Negative pressure wound therapy was provided by the Genadyne A4TM system. The system consists of three components: a negative pressure generating unit with a disposable canister, a pad with evacuation tube, and a reticulated, open cell sterile polyurethane or a dense open-pore polyvinyl alcohol foam dressing cut to fit the wound. The system unit is programmed to deliver controlled negative pressure ranging from 50 to 200 mmHg (in repeating cycles automatically by the device: in every 3 minutes the pressure increased by 10 mmHg). Treatment was continued until ulcer closure, sufficient granulation tissue formation for healing by secondary intention. NPWT dressing changes were performed every 48-72 hours, no less than three times per week.

Measurements:
During the wound dressing and compression changes the area of the ulcers was constantly measured. The procedure was as follows. At the outset, homothetic congruent projections of the ulcers were plotted onto transparent foil, after which planimetric measurements of the wounds were taken with the use of digitizer Mutoh Kurta XGT-1218A3. The area of the ulcer was determined once a week until the wound healed completely. 

All patients received also micronized flavonoid fraction (450 mg diosmin, 50 mg hesperidin), 2 tablets of 500 mg once daily (until ulcer closure, no stategies used to monitor adherence to the daily medication).</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Computer - generated random numbers were sealed in sequentially numbered envelopes and group allocation was independent of time and persons delivering the treatment. The physician allocating patients to groups had numbered envelopes, each containing a piece of paper marked with A and B groups. The physician would draw and open an envelope in the presence of a physiotherapist to see the symbol and direct the patient to one of the comparative groups accordingly.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The chi - squared independence test and non-parametric U-Mann Whitney analysis were used for comparing indicators, which characterized patients in all comparative groups. Outcome measurements were compared between the groups by matched pair Wilcoxon and U-Mann Whitney tests. Two sided P (level of significance) values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

We had to use non-parametric statistical methods, because number of patients in each group was smaller than 30, which was unsufficient for parametric analysis (t-test) and normal the Gauss distribution. To achieve study obcjectives the minimal number of participants was 20 in each group (and 20 ulcers, because we included only patients with one wound on the leg). Smaller number of patients were not enough from both statistical and clinical point of view (the smaller number of patients were not enough for reliable statistical analysis because of too large standard deviations due to different sizes of wounds). The reliable number of participants from wound diameters between 5 cm to 55 cm was estimated by Statistica 10 software, manufactured by StatSoft (licence of Academy School of Physical Education).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), also known as vacuum assisted closure (VAC), sub-atmospheric pressure dressing (SPD), vacuum sealing technique (VST), foam suction dressing, sealed surface wound suction (SSS), vacuum pack therapy and sealing aspirative therapy, is used in the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. The treatment requires a vacuum source to create a continuous or intermittent form of negative pressure inside the wound. Doing so removes fluid and exudates infectious materials to aid in wound healing and closure.
By 2003, NPWT was a commonly accepted therapy. Its use has recently been reviewed and results have been published for a wide range of wound types including diabetes foot ulcers, surgical wound infections, traumatic wounds, skin graft fixation, pressure ulcers and leg ulcers. It is thought that NPWT promotes wound healing through multiple actions, including the removal of exudate from the wounds to help establish fluid balance, provision of a moist wound environment, a potential decrease in wound bacterial load, a reduction in edema and third-space fluids, an increase in the blood flow to the wound, and the promotion of white cells and fibroblasts within the wound.
Literature data concerning application of this method for treatment of venous leg ulceration are scarce that is why the aim of our study is to present our own experience in using NPWT for treatment of chronic leg ulcers.</summary>
