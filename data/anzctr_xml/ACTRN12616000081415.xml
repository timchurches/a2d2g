  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cross-sectional survey. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire at a single time point, with no subsequent follow-up. They will have the option of completing the questionnaire using paper and pen, or online. This can occur at either the oncology clinic, or at home at a later time. The questionnaire has been designed specifically for this survey. It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. It asks questions about demographics, cancer diagnosis, treatment, and about preferences when considering a clinical trial. This will take the form of a discrete choice experiment, with ten scenarios per questionnaire. Participants will be asked to state whether they would join a clinical trial or continue with standard care, given the scenario presented.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Factors in this model can be quantitatively measured against each other, for example to measure how far a patient is willing to travel to participate in a trial for a new treatment vs not participating in a trial and keeping their usual oncologist. The dependent variable will be the hypothetical choice of trial participation vs not, and explanatory variables will be the listed attributes. The results will be analysed uncorrected and corrected for demographic and disease factors in a multinomial logit model, with different regression coefficients for different demographic subgroups separately, such as rural vs urban.

The design above yields a total of 96 different trial scenarios (3x2x4x2x2). Estimating a main-effects-only cumulative link model for a design of this size requires approximately 20 observations per scenario. We anticipate collecting data from 10 scenarios per participant, which implies a target sample size of 192 participants. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine, using a discrete choice experiment survey, the willingness of cancer patients to participate in a clinical trial, including travel, change in provider and type of clinical trial. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have a diagnosis of cancer for which you are attending a cancer clinic. 

Study details 
All participants in this study will be asked to complete a brief survey either online or using paper and pen, at the oncology clinic or at home at a later time. It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. It asks questions about demographics, cancer diagnosis, treatment, and about preferences when considering a clinical trial. This will take the form of a discrete choice experiment, with ten scenarios per questionnaire. Participants will be asked to state whether they would join a clinical trial or continue with standard care, given the scenario presented. 

This study will provide useful information on how willing cancer patients are to travel, or to be referred to a different centre to participate in a clinical trial.</summary>
