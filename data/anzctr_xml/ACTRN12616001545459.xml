  <interventions>
    <interventions>A skills based interventional package is posted to women, they complete it at home in their own time. The intervention is a anonymised version of "The Pink Kit for Birthing Better". The kit is sent out to women and contains 4 e-books, two audio CDs and a DVD. Women can choose when to read or listen to any of the content from 24 weeks gestation until full term. It is not personalised and participants will be asked what percentage of the course they think they used after the birth of their child.
Contents of the PInk Kit:
4 e-books:
1. Breath, language and 
touch skills
2. Teamwork and managing 
skills
3. Rationalization for basic 
skills applicable for every 
birth
4. Extra skills for 
specific situations
1 DVD and contents
Skills to manage birth 
process, eg:
    Directed breathing
    Map your pelvis
    Teamwork
Skills to keep the bodys structure relaxed and open, for example:
    Deep touch relaxation
    Cervical relaxation
    Hip lift
    Sit bone spread
    Pelvic clock
    Kates cat

2 CDs and contents
How to prepare the 
birth passage, eg:
    internal work
Skills for each phase of a contraction


The second intervention is a collection of birth stories put together by the researchers to act as an active control.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two control groups. Participants randomised to the Active control condition are sent a book of birth stories. These were stories collated by the researchers which represent first person accounts of births, both simple and complicated.
There is also a treatment as usual control group. This group filled in the questionnaires at the same time points but were not given any intervention or provided with any treatment. The intervention provides no treatment, intervention or information for this group.
Both groups continue with their planned childbirth preparation on their own.</comparator>

      <outcome>Family Life satisfaction was measured using the self-reported Family Life Satisfaction Scale. Groups are compared.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Midwives ratings.  These were made for the purposes of the study.
Comparative work-related stress was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS: 0 [much lower level of stress] -100 [much higher level of stress]) in response to the following questions. The questions were:

Comparative work related stress: Please use the following scale to rate how much less stress or how much more stress you experienced when caring for this client/patient and her partner compared to that you usually experience when caring for a client/patient and her partner by putting a stroke through the line.

Complications: Was there any expected physical issue (for example, breech position) or any other unexpected physical issue (only physical) which accounted for the stress you experienced?

Provision was also made for midwives to make comments.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>These surveys were posted to midwives after they had stopped caring for the women in the trial ie. at least 6 weeks post-birth.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised controlled trial examined a skills-based self-teach childbirth/childbirth coaching preparation programme. The trial examined whether there was an effect on birth satisfaction, and parenting self-efficacy, family life satisfaction, and postpartum depression at six months postpartum. A post hoc analysis treating data as a prospective observational study sought to determine which covariates were linked to birth satisfaction, and the three six months measures. Comments collected with the post birth questionnaire twere also analysed to deepen our understanding of the birth experience of both parents. Lastly, this research project examined whether the midwife benefited when clients undertook the skills-based preparation.
 A sample of 182 first time mothers and their partners was recruited from throughout New Zealand. Participants completed four questionnaires composed of established survey instruments between 24 weeks gestation and six months postpartum. One hundred and four midwives elected to complete a survey.
 A 3X2 repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the self-taught skills (Intervention) group changed differently over time, reporting a higher increase in childbirth self-efficacy and higher decrease in family life satisfaction for mothers compared to the Active and Passive Control Groups. An ANOVA analysis revealed that mothers and fathers in the Intervention and Active Control Groups reported higher birth satisfaction compared to the Passive Control Group.
A post-hoc regression analysis found there were many significant associations with the outcomes of birth satisfaction, parenting self-efficacy, family life satisfaction and postpartum depression. 
For mothers three major themes emerged from the phenomenological thematic analysis of the data. When she felt she owned her process, had good care/carers and support/supporters, and had a safe delivery, the mother reported higher birth satisfaction. For fathers four major themes emerged. When he felt confident of the safety of mother and baby throughout the process, that he was included and involved, that the mother coped well with childbirth, and that the birth and after met his expectations, the father reported higher birth satisfaction.
An ANCOVA determined that midwives in the Intervention Group experienced less stress than they generally experienced compared to the midwives working with the other two groups.
The skills-based preparation advocated in The Pink Kit Method for was effective in increasing mothers childbirth self-efficacy. </summary>
