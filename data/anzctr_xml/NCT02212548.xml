    <interventions>Treatment: devices - PEG Hydrogel (SpaceOAR)

Experimental: Hydrogel - The patient will be in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepared and draped. A transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) will be used for alignment of the needle and to ensure safe delivery. The hydrogel precursor and accelerator solutions will be mixed and connected to the Y connector that has been flushed with saline and to a syringe holder that ensures both syringe barrels are injected at the same time. After aspirating to ensure the tip of the needle is not intravascular, the perirectal space will be adequately dissected from the apex to midgland by injecting saline into the space between denonvilliers fascia and the anterior rectal space under TRUS guidance. Maintaining the needle position and angulation, the saline syringe is disconnected and the hydrogel system connected. After aspirating to ensure the needle tip is not in a blood vessel and under TRUS guidance, the 'PEG Hydrogel (SpaceOAR) is injected in a smooth, continuous technique.


Treatment: devices: PEG Hydrogel (SpaceOAR)
A single injection of PEG hydrogel (SpaceOAR) through the perineum under transrectal ultrasound guidance while under general anaesthetic.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase I prospective study of 30 patients to determine whether PEG hydrogel
      (SpaceOAR) reduces the dose of radiation delivered to the rectum during Image Guided
      Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) for prostate cancer, by increasing the space
      between the prostate and the rectum.</summary>
