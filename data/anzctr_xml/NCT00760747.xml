  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) Parent Version: Investigator Administered and Scored - Total Score at Week 10 Endpoint - Measures the 18 symptoms contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Individual item scores range from 0 (none/never or rarely) to 3 (severe/very often). Total scores range from 0 to 54. Higher score indicates greater severity of disease. Least squares means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</outcome>

Individual item scores range from 0 (none/never or rarely) to 3 (severe/very often). Total scores range from 0 to 54. Higher score indicates greater severity of disease.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Global Impression of Perceived Difficulties (GIPD) Rating Scale - Patient Total Score at Week 10 Endpoint - The GIPD scale is a 5-item rating of ADHD-related difficulties (overall difficulties perceived in the morning, during school, during homework, in the evening, and over the entire day and night). For each item, difficulties during the past week are rated on a 7-point scale (1 = normal, not difficult at all; 7 = extremely difficult) and the mean of the 5 items is reported. Least square means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) Rating Scale - Total Score at Week 10 Endpoint - The CGI- S is a single-item clinician rating of the severity of the participant's ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician's total experience of ADHD participants. Severity is rated on a seven-point scale (1 = normal, not ill at all; 7 = among the most extremely ill patients). Least square means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Child Health and Illness Profile Child Edition-Parent Report Form (CHIP-CE-PRF) - Domain Scores at Week 10 Endpoint - CHIP-CE-PRF consists of 76 items. The majority of items assess frequency of activities or feelings using a five-point response format. Standard scores (t-value) were established, with all domains and subdomains having a mean score of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. Standard scores are expressed in SD units. T-score=[(Score- Mean for the reference population [Ref Pop])*10/SD for the Ref Pop]+50. Higher scores mean better quality of life. Least square means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Treatment Satisfaction Preference Survey Mean Score at Week 10 Endpoint - The Treatment Satisfaction Survey consists of a five-question survey each rated on a 5 point scale (0=very satisfied/very likely, 4=very dissatisfied/not at all likely). The mean score over the items is reported.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who are not
      tolerating or not responding well to stimulant therapy will be included in this study. Two
      different strategies for transition from Stimulant to Atomoxetine will be used: Slow (10
      weeks) and fast (2 weeks). Changes in ADHD symptoms and tolerability of medication will be
      compared between the two different switching approaches.</summary>
