  <interventions>
    <interventions>Before the intervention, the practitioner will take preintervention measurement of the hardness of some muscles with a Myotonometer and the pressure pain thresholds with an algometer.
After the measurements,(40 minutes) the practitioner will apply a thrust technique to the first rib with the patient in seated position and the practitioner behind him. The technique has a duration of 90 seconds.The measurements will be taken again after the thrust technique, so the thrust technique will be applied only once to the patient.</interventions>
    <comparator>The same intervention will be made to the control group, but they will receive a sham- manual technique: the therapist will simule the manipulative procedure but without taking up the tissue tension or performing any thrust action. This position will be mantained for 15 seconds.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in the hardness of the following muscles: masseter, stercleidomastoideus, scalenus, trapezius, biceps and triceps in relaxed and contracted position.
To perform these steps it will be used a Myotonometer (R). These will be the preintervention measurements. After the intervention the measurements will be repeated (postintervention measurements).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Preintervention measurements will be taken immediately prior to the intervention. Post intervention measurements will be taken immmediately post the intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in pressure pain theresholds on the following points: a point through the path of the trigeminus nerve, a point  through the path of the median nerve, a point  through the path of the cubital nerve, a point at the trapezius muscle, at the biceps muscle and at the triceps muscle. These will be preintervention measurements 
These measurements will be taken with a surface algometer.  After the intervention the measurements will be repeated (postintervention measurements).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Preintervention measurements will be taken immediately prior to the intervention. Post intervention measurements will be taken immmediately post the intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Muscles show several changes after a traumatic event, such a whiplash. We will focus our study into changes in the hardness of a number of muscles in patients suffering from a whiplash. We will use a device called Myotonometer for this purpose. We will also measure changes in pressure pain threshold in these patients with an algometer.
The measures will be taken before and after the intervention. The intervention will consist of a first rib manipulation technique.</summary>
