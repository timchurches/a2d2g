Participants with unknown or missing response were considered as non-responders. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory disease assessment should have been performed no less than 28 days after the criteria for response were first met.

      <outcome>Pre- and Post-dose H-scores for Individual Participants in Part B - p-ERK and p-AKT, biomarkers in tumor biopsies, were assessed for participants with BRAF mutant colorectal cancer. The H-score, which is a composite score that comprises intensity and percentage of staining, is a method of assessing the amount of protein or phospho-protein present in a biopsy sample. The score is obtained by the formula: (3 * percentage of strongly staining nuclei) + (2 * percentage of moderately staining nuclei) + (percentage of weakly staining nuclei). The H-score ranges from 0 to 300, with a score of 0 representing the absence of any of the target protein and an H-score of 300 representing maximum staining and intensity of the target protein.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open-label, dose escalation study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 in combination. This
      study is designed in four parts. In Part A, the effect of repeat doses of GSK1120212 on the
      pharmacokinetics of single dose GSK2118436, will be investigated prior to evaluating
      combination regimens. In Part B, the range of tolerated dose combinations will be identified
      using a dose-escalation procedure. In Part C, different dose combinations of GSK2118436 and
      GSK1120212 will be evaluated, based on results from the dose escalation cohorts. In Part D,
      the pharmacokinetics and safety of GSK2118436 administered as HPMC capsules alone and in
      combination with GSK1120212 will be evaluated.</summary>
