    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Dasatinib
Treatment: drugs - Imatinib

Other: Dasatinib - All patients will begin the study on dasatinib treatment (SprycelÂ® 100mg once daily oral administration). Those who reach MR3.0 at 12 months (end of Study Stage 1) and achieve a confirmed result at 13 months, will switch to imatinib treatment (Imatinib-AFT 400mg once daily oral administration) for the next 24 months (Study Stage 2).
Patients who do not achieve a confirmed MR3.0 result at 13 months will not be eligible to switch to imatinib treatment and will remain on dasatinib treatment, as per Study Stage 1.
Patients will be assessed on a 3-monthly basis throughout the study. Those who discontinue dasatinib treatment during the study for reasons other than the planned treatment switch to imatinib at 13 months, will also be followed up every 3 months.


Treatment: drugs: Dasatinib
In order to test the study hypothesis patients need to stay on dasatinib (Sprycel) treatment for the first 12 months of the study (Stage 1).
Patients who do not reach MR3.0 at 12 months will remain on dasatinib treatment.

Treatment: drugs: Imatinib
Patients who reach MR3.0 at 12 months (and the result is confirmed at 13 months) will switch to imatinib (Imatinib-AFT) treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is due to a chromosomal abnormality in white blood cells
      which results in abnormal multiplication. CML in its earlier, slower growing chronic phase
      (CP) is well controlled by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug imatinib, which targets
      the consequences of the chromosomal abnormality, inducing a response and subsequent remission
      (as measured using molecular techniques on patient blood or bone marrow samples in the lab).
      Dasatinib, a newer TKI drug, similar in design to imatinib, gives a more rapid molecular
      response, however the long term side-effects are less known than imatinib.

      This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of a treatment plan for patients with
      newly diagnosed CML-CP, where dasatinib will be used to more rapidly induce a molecular
      response (MR3.0) within 12 months, after which imatinib will be used to maintain the CML in
      that remission. It is hypothesised that imatinib is safe and effective in maintaining MR3.0
      in patients with CML who achieve MR3.0 at 12 months following initial induction therapy with
      dasatinib.</summary>
