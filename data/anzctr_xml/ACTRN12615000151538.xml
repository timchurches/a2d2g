  <interventions>
    <interventions>All interventions will be condensed into a 90-minute group session. 

Within the imagery-rescripting group cognitive therapy (IR-GCT) protocol, participants will identify past negative social memories that are associated with current imagery in performance situations. Participants will be guided to rescript images associated with these memories by visualising the memory (1) from their child perspective, (2) from the perspective of their older self intervening to assist the child, and (3) from their child perspective observing their older self intervening. Following IR, participants will reflect on their affect and bodily sensations and will identify any shifts in meaning of the original event. 

The verbally-based group cognitive therapy (VB-GCT) intervention will address similar content to IR-GCT using traditional verbal-linguistic techniques (i.e., challenging evidence for and against meanings of the original event, challenging the overestimation of probability and consequences in performance situations) with no reference to imagery.

The waitlist control (WC) group will not receive an intervention until after the waiting period has lapsed.

All interventions will be provided by psychologists.</interventions>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1. Participants submit their consent form and initial screening measures

2. Participants will be contacted by the assessing clinician to set up an initial interview to discuss their participation in the study. Screening measures will include questions about anxiety symptoms, thoughts associated with performance situations, and self-beliefs. The initial assessment interview will provide participants with further information about the study and ask a series of questions about their current mood. Participants will also be asked to present a short video-taped speech task and rate their associated anxiety. During the speech task skin conductance and heart rate will be measured to indicate emotional arousal.

3. The assessing clinician will forward eligible participants’ details to a researcher who is separate to the treating team. This researcher will randomly allocate the participant to a condition and will then inform the treating team of the participant’s treatment condition.

4. The treating clinician will then contact the participant and schedule a group treatment session.

5. After treatment, the treating clinician will inform the assessing clinician, who will remain blind and will complete the post-treatment assessment.

6. The blind will only be broken after all data has been collected.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Hypotheses

H1a: There will be significant Group x Time interactions such that participants receiving the active interventions (IR-GCT and VB-GCT) will demonstrate significantly greater therapeutic changes in the following outcome measures between pre-test and post-test relative to participants in the control condition.
*Social anxiety symptoms (Social Interaction Phobia Scale)
*Positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule)
*Negative self-beliefs (NSPS)
*Imagery suppression (CAQ-Transformation subscale)
*Repetitive negative thinking (Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire)
*Superior therapeutic change will be demonstrated in the social interaction task by: greater reductions in physical arousal (skin conductance, heart rate variability), lower subjective anxiety (subjective units of distress scale, SUDS), increased willingness to complete another speech, and fewer overt anxious behaviours (Behaviours Checklist).


H1b: Participants receiving IR-GCT will demonstrate significantly greater therapeutic changes in these variables between pre-test and post-test relative to participants in the VB-GCT condition.

H2a: Participants receiving the active interventions (IR-GCT and VB-GCT) will demonstrate significantly higher peak arousal during the intervention than those in the control condition.

H2b: Participants receiving IR-GCT will demonstrate significantly higher peak arousal during the intervention than participants receiving VB-GCT.

H3a: Participants receiving the active interventions (IR-GCT and VB-GCT) will demonstrate significantly greater change in arousal during the intervention than those in the control condition.

H3b: Participants receiving IR-GCT will demonstrate significantly greater change in arousal during the intervention than participants receiving VB-GCT.

H4a: Participants receiving the active interventions (IR-GCT and VB-GCT) will demonstrate significantly greater accessibility of positive (relative to negative) memories (Memory Distress Scale) immediately following the intervention than those in the control condition.

H4b: Participants receiving IR-GCT will demonstrate significantly greater accessibility of positive (relative to negative) memories immediately following the intervention than participants receiving VB-GCT.

H5: The impact of IR-GCT on pre-post symptom change will be moderated by vividness of visual imagery (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, VVIQ). 


Analytic plan

Hypotheses 1-5 will be tested with a series of Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) as implemented through SPSSs (Version 22) GENLINMIXED procedure. The H1-H4 GLMMs include one nominal random effect (participant), one categorical fixed effect (group: IR-GCT versus VB-GCT versus control), one ordinal fixed effect (time: pretest versus posttest) and the Group x Time interaction. In order to optimise the likelihood of convergence, a separate GLMM analysis will be run for each of the outcome measures. Each of the four hypotheses predicts a significant Group x Time interaction. Tests of the simple main effects of time will be conducted to locate the source of the Group x Time interaction. Outcome measures will be grouped into conceptually related categories with Bonferroni adjustments applied to control for Type I error (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007). The H5 GLMM includes one nominal random effect (participant), one categorical fixed effect (group: IR-GCT versus VB-GCT versus control), one ordinal fixed effect (time: pretest versus posttest), two continuous fixed effects (pre-test symptoms, imagery vividness). H5 predicts a 3-way interaction (Group x Time x Imagery Vividness). If the 3-way interaction is significant tests of the simple 2-way interactions and the simple main effects will be conducted to locate the source of the 3-way interaction.

Each of the primary outcome hypotheses predicts a Group x Time interaction. The estimated the number of participants required for an 80% probability of capturing a moderate (i.e., f = .23) interaction between group (intervention, control) and time (pre-test, post-test) at the most severely adjusted alpha-level of .01 according to GPower (Version 3.1.2) is 60 (20 in each group).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Evidence suggests that mental imagery plays a causal and more potent role in anxiety disorders than verbal-linguistic activity. The proposed research will compare the efficacy of an Imagery Rescripting Group Cognitive Therapy (IR-GCT) protocol to traditional Group Cognitive Therapy (GCT) and waitlist control for social and performance anxiety. Participation will involve an initial assessment, completion of a 90-minute single IR-GCT, GCT intervention, or waitlist control, and post-treatment assessment. Comparison of treatment outcomes will identify whether imagery rescripting techniques are more potent than verbal-linguistic techniques in reducing performance/social anxiety. Analysis into potential mechanisms of change within both interventions may inform future treatment approaches.</summary>
