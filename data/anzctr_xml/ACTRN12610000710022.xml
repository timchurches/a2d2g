  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the DHA arm of the study will be given 2 tablets (260 mg/day) of supplementary DHA and patients in the EPA arm will be required to take 2 tablets or 360mg of EPA;  patients in the placebo arm will be required to take 2 tablets or 2000mg of sunflower oil. At the completion of the double-blind period (8 weeks) all participants will be switched to DHA (260mg/day) for a 6 week open label extension. In addition and where possible patients background antidepressant medication will remain as a fixed dose for the 8 week study period</interventions>
    <comparator>Omega-3 fatty acids include both DHA and EPA but it is unclear as to whether there are any differences in their potetial roles in treating depression.
The placebo arm is 2 tablets or 2000mg of sunflower oil taken daily in the a.m. for 8 weeks.
The comparitor is EPA - 360mg taken daily in the a.m.  for 8 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of DHA versus placebo and compare the difference 
between DHA and EPA on the symptoms of depression. Effectiveness will be measured by the mean change in 
total scores on the HAM-D from baseline to double-blind end point at week 8.  Patients with a 50% reduction in 
HAM-D scores or who have a score equal to or less than 8 will be considered to be in full  remission whilst
patients with a score of 12 or less  will be considered to have improved; (from baseline to Week 8 or dropout). 
A secondary aim of the study will be to compare the levels of BDNF at baseline and at the completion of the 
double-blind phase of the study in the patients treated with DHA versus the comparator EPA and placebo. 
An additional aim will be to measure the change from baseline in cognitive functioning using a brief cognitive battery which assess 5 cognitive domains.   
Mean change from baseline scores to week 8 will also be used to measure patients Global Assessment of 
Functioning, sleep and levels of suicidal ideation using Item 3 on the HAM-D.</summary>
