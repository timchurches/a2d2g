  <interventions>
    <interventions>novel teat that releases milk only when the infant sucks with sufficient vacuum to release valve. The teat was offered only when mother was not available to breastfeed and when a bottle feed was scheduled, until discharge from hospital. Mother's expressed breastmilk was the feed of choice. Pastuerised donor human milk was available for those infants &lt; 34 weeks gestation as an alternative and for those &gt; 34 weeks, gestation, preterm formula was used when mother's expressed breastmilk was not available.</interventions>

Sample size of at least 60 infants was determined based on the ability to determine a 3-day difference in length of hospital stay, p value&lt;0.05.
As per our ethics approval initially, we enrolled 30 infants (15 in each
arm) as an internal pilot study in the first 3 months of the study period.
 This data was be used to determine final sample size.  Pragmatically, we endeavoured to enrol all eligible infants admitted to the NICU to achieve a statistical power to detect a decrease in length of stay in hospital (primary endpoint) of at least 3 days for each infant.  Given that a total of 187 infants of &lt;33 wks GA were admitted during July-Dec 2010, we expected recruitment will be complete within 6 months.

Following the pilot study a sample size of 30 in each group, as determined by a power calculation, was required to show a difference in length of stay of 3 days.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of the novel teat to feed expressed breastmilk when mother not available to breastfeed preterm baby resulted in a shorter length of stay in hospital (2.5 days corrected for gestational age at discharge (p=0.026) and weight (p=0.006). Infants in the novel teat group had less formula feeding a discharge (novel 35%, control 16%, p=0.036) but otherwise did not differ in respect to feeding.</summary>
