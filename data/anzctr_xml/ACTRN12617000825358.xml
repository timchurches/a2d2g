  <interventions>
    <interventions>Experimental intervention: All participants will receive open-label cannabidiol (CBD) for 12 weeks.
Background intervention: All participants will be offered  biweekly cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) for 12 weeks (5 sessions). CBT will be administered as one-on-one sessions (1hr) by a qualified clinician at the study site (one of four headspace centres).  

CBD will be administered on a fixedflexible schedule beginning with 200 mg (oral capsule) per day and adjusted up to 800 mg per day by week 8. Until week 8, participants who are considered to have failed to improve using the CGI-I (operationalised as a score of &gt;=3) and who are tolerating the medication are eligible for dose increases at each assessment. Dose escalation can occur with 200 mg/day increments, with at least a 4-week gap between dose increments, except for the first dose increase (200mg/day to 400mg/day), which can occur at the end of week 1 after tolerance of the initial dose of the study medication has been established. Participants who receive 400mg/day after week 1 are also eligible for the next dose increase at week 4. Adherence to the trial medication will be assessed by pill count. </interventions>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Clinical Global ImpressionImprovement (CGI-I) scale, which ranges from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating more improvement, as compared with baseline. A score of 1 or 2 reflects a substantial, clinically meaningful improvement in anxiety severity.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating (HAM-A) is is one of the most used composite rating scales to measure anxiety in both clinical and research settings. It is clinician-rated and consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Quick Inventory Depression Symptomatology (QIDS) assesses the criterion symptom domains for DSM-5 major depressive disorder. The scale has been shown to be a reliable tool for assessing adolescent depression, making it one of the few depression scales that has been validated across adolescent and adult populations.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Social and Occupational Functional Assessment Scale (SOFAS) is a widely-used global rating of current functioning, ranging from 0 to 100, with lower scores representing lower functioning.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Affecting 15% of youth, anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in adolescents in Australia. These disorders are associated with significant morbidity and risk of suicide attempts and predict a range of psychiatric conditions later in life. Current treatments for anxiety disorders in this age group include cognitive-behaviour therapy and/or medication. However, only 50% of young patients with anxiety disorders show satisfactory improvements with these treatments. 

CBD is one of several components of the plant Cannabis sativa, Unlike other substances found in this plant, CBD is devoid of psychotropic effects (i.e. alterations in thinking and perception). There is evidence from experimental studies that CBD is safe in humans and effective in reducing anxiety in healthy volunteers (e.g. in simulated public speaking tasks). A systematic review of potential side effects in humans found that CBD was well tolerated across a wide dose range, up to 1500 mg/day. However, CBD has not been tested in young people with anxiety disorders.

The aim of the present study is to produce preliminary evidence for the safety and  anxiolytic effects of CBD in youth with anxiety disorders. 

This is a single-centre, 12-week open label trial of CBD in patients aged 12-25 (inclusive) who do not respond to current treatments for anxiety disorders. All patients included into the study will receive CBD on a fixed-flexible schedule, beginning with 200mg of CBD per day, which can be adjusted up to 800mg/day for participants who tolerate CBD. 

The study will be conducted at headspace centres funded through the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The headspace centres are located in the suburbs of Glenroy, Sunshine, Craigieburn and/or Werribee. Orygen manages the clinical governance of these headspace sites. Headspace centres focus both on youth mental health and early intervention, young people may present for care with varying illness severity (e.g. sub-threshold through to severe disorder, and mild to severely impaired functioning) across a range of mental health problems.
