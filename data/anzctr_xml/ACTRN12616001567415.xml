  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention components will be tailored to the factors influencing practice (barriers and enablers) and the specific needs of intervention sites. Currently a qualitative study of emergency and paediatric medical and nursing staff concerning the barriers and enablers to appropriate bronchiolitis management is being undertaken by the research team and will be analysed in October, this will help refine content and range of interventions.

To date, it is planned that the interventions will involve:

Local stakeholder meetings
- Central research team will meet with site Principal Investigator and potential staff to be champions (clinical opinion leaders) on two scheduled occasions to (i) check understanding of the study and capacity to be involved (ii) Negotiate implementation of the intervention with discussion of particular site related issues that are predicted. These meetings are important for engagement with the study team.  Key outcomes will be recorded on a site checklist.

Identification of nursing and medical clinical opinion leaders in each site in the ED and general paediatric area.
 - These people will be nominated by the sites according to a role description  provided by the central research team. It is requested to have an ED based nurse and doctor opinion leader and a General Paediatrics nurse and doctor opinion leader, details of each will be recorded.

A one-day train-the-trainer workshop (1 or 2 to be held depending on availability of staff and site recruitment dates)
- Site local opinion leaders from intervention sites will be invited to attend this one day training event. Two events may be held to capture groups in New Zealand and Australia. The day will have a workshop format of small interactive group sessions and lectures.  
Topics will be include: scientific evidence behind the PREDICT Australasian Bronchiolitis Guideline, evidence of how to change clinician behaviour, their role as a local opinion leader, content of interventions designed to change bronchiolitis management behaviour.  Attendance will be recorded. 

Standardised education and interactive workshops delivered by the site based clinical leaders/champions over a 3 month period of time to their departmental staff. 
- This will involve the use of standardised power point presentations of the evidence basis for bronchiolitis management delivered in small group presentations at the site.  Frequency of these sessions can only be determined by the site but this will be recorded as well as attendance.  Sites will be encouraged to complete training of 80% of their staff within the first 4 weeks.  The remaining staff will receive training as soon as possible.  Sites will choose whether this is done in small groups, on an individual basis or a combination of these methods.  All training will be recorded.

Provision of materials to increase the visibility of tools
- This may include provision of posters, clinical pathways, and standardised email reminders by the central research team to the site that contain highly visible reminders of desired bronchiolitis care. 

Non-specific reminders to optimise data collection
- The research team member associated with each site will be in regular (at least 2 weekly) contact (email or phone) with the local champions to provide support and answer any queries.  Discussion regarding data collection and offering assistance as required will be made.  All contact made with sites will be recorded.

Audit and feedback process undertaken at sites
- All sites will be recommended to undertake auditing of the care of 10-12 randomly selected bronchiolitis patients once per fortnight over the bronchiolitis season.  The required audit data to be retrieved from records and will be entered into an online database.  The blinded data will be presented to sites showing their performance in comparison to other sites.  It will also be encouraged that this audit and feedback information be used in training workshops to inform staff of their performance.

General support provided by the central research team.
- The central research team will contact each site on a 2 weekly basis from 1/5/17 to 30/11/17 to monitor progress and provide individualised support as issues arise.  The central research team will record this information in a site contact log. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculations took the nature of the outcome (binary variable outcome variable: guideline-conform treatment yes/no) as well as the issue of clustering (heterogeneity in estimated proportions between sites that exceed variability being explained by random sampling) into account.
The power calculations revealed a necessary group sample size of 1620 individuals, assuming an average cluster size of 135 patients (24 sites).  A total of 3240 patients will be required to detect a clinically meaningful absolute difference of 15% in the proportion of non-compliance patients between the two study groups (power of 80%, two-sided type I error level: 0.05).   These sample size calculations assumed (informed by preliminary data), an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of &lt;0.06 as well as a proportion relative frequency of the primary outcome of 50% in the control arm.


Staff survey data:
Data from the staff surveys will be coded and analysed using descriptive statistics to obtain frequencies, means and standard deviations for variables of interest.  Means scores will be compared pre and post intervention to determine change.

Process evaluation data:
Process data will be analysed using descriptive statistics to obtain frequencies, means and standard deviations for variables of interest.


The primary analysis will be on an intention to treat basis.
The principal analysis will examine compliance or non-compliance for each individual patient with the guideline in the acute care period, ED and as an inpatient with regards to key therapies/management processes known to have no benefit.
A Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) will be used to estimate the marginal difference in the proportion of bronchiolitis patients treated in accordance with the existing guideline between the study arms.  The GLMM approach will employ a logit link function and will include random effect terms for study site.  Based on the GLMM, risk differences with 95% confidence internals will be computed.  Missing outcome data will be imputed using multiple imputation models.
The details of the primary and secondary statistical analyses will be specified in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be finalised before study data base lock.  The SAP will detail covariates to be considered in the primary analysis model as well as subgroup and sensitivity analyses to be performed.  The SAP will also outline the multiple imputation strategy to handle missing data.

An economic analysis will be carried out with costs associated to the payer (hospital).  This will include: cost of ED presentation, cost of admission and cost of therapies/management known to be of no benefit.  Additionally, the costs associated with the development of the Australasian Bronchiolitis Guideline and the KT intervention development and implementation will be analysed.

Process evaluation will occur to assess fidelity in the delivery of the KT interventions (what was delivered, to whom and how) as well as staff questionnaires.  See section 9.  Mixed methods will be used including qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys.   </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine if tailored, theory informed Knowledge Translation (KT) interventions can increase the uptake of an Australasian bronchiolitis guideline in reducing the use of therapies/management known to be of no benefit in the management of infants with bronchiolitis.  This will be done by conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial - randomising hospitals to either intervention or control groups with focus on Emergency Department and General Paediatrics units.  Results from this study will influence the implementation of other guidelines and evidence based practise in paediatric settings.</summary>
