  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a well validated, standardized method of evaluating and monitoring psychotic symptoms. The PANSS assesses: positive (hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder), negative (blunted affect, abstract thinking and general symptomatology. The positive and negative subscale each consist of 7 items rated from 1(absent) - 7(extreme) with a minimum score = 7, maximum score = 49. The general subscale consists of 16 items with a minimum score = 16, maximum score = 112. A Total PANSS score (positive+ negative + general scores) has a minimum of 30 and maximum of 210. Higher scores represent more severity in symptoms.</outcome>

    <summary>OBJECTIVE:

      To test the use of adjunctive estrogen in a 8 week, three-arm, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in women with schizophrenia.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      That women receiving adjunctive estrogen will demonstrate significantly greater improvements
      in the symptoms of schizophrenia than women receiving adjunctive placebo.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      180 women will be recruited over a three-year period across three sites. Participant will be
      of potential child-bearing age (Pre-menopausal and Post-menarche) with a current diagnosis of
      Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, or Schizoaffective Disorder (not in manic
      phase)according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

      STUDY MEDICATION:

      Estradiol. One third of the participants (n=60) will be randomised to receive adjunctive
      100mcg Estradiol; one third of the participants (n=60) will be randomised to receive
      adjunctive 200mcg Estradiol n=60; and, one third of the participants (n=60) will be
      randomised to receive adjunctive placebo n=60). All patches will be covered with identical
      adhesive contact to ensure the "blind" is maintained.

      STUDY EVALUATIONS:

      Data will be collected over a two-month period for each participant. Visits will be performed
      at baseline, and then at weekly or fortnightly intervals. A total of six visits will be
      completed for each participant. The following evaluations will be performed:

      i) Inclusion/exclusion checklist. (Baseline visit only)

      ii) Informed consent. (Baseline visit only)

      iii)psychiatric evaluation to determine diagnosis. (Baseline visit only)

      iv) General clinical evaluation including medical history, current conditions and a
      non-invasive physical examination, body weight, vital signs. (Baseline and endpoint visits)

      v) Medication history. (Baseline and evaluation visits)

      vi) Demographics. (Baseline visits only)

      vii) The primary outcome measures will be the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),
      which will be taken at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 of the trial. Cognitive testing will take place at
      baseline and 8 weeks. Side effects will be assessed at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 to measure
      changes in subject's reported side effects during the trial.

      viii) Laboratory tests including; Serum levels of mood stabiliser, LH, FSH, Estrogen,
      Progesterone, Prolactin, DHEA,Testosterone and(Baseline and evaluation visits).</summary>
