  <interventions>
    <interventions>The diameter of the basilic, brachial and cephalic veins of both arms will be measured using ultrasound prior to PICC insertion. 
After vein measurement is complete the researcher will ask the participant to indicate their dominant arm. At this point the PICC inserter will chose the largest vein identified on ultrasound to insert the device and the vein used will be measured at the insertion site. PICC diameter will be obtained from manufacturer information to determine the vein occupation ratio. 
At approximately nine weeks post insertion, the unit record number of each patient will be used to gain access to medical records to gather treatment management information as well as be matched to DVT reports generated by the Radiology Department. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To test for an association between catheter/vein occupation ratio and rates of symptomatic DVT. Vein diameter will be determined using ultrasound, catheter diameter will be obtained from manufacturer information. Cases of DVT will be collected from Radiology reports.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records and Radiology reports will be accessed at nine weeks post-insertion</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether the diameter of the basilic, brachial and cephalic veins is larger in the dominant arm compared to the non-dominant arm of patients booked for PICC insertion in a public teaching hospital population. The diameter of veins will be measured using ultrasound.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The measurement of both arms with ultrasound will be prior insertion of a PICC</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research will explore the effect of arm dominance on vein diameter and whether vein occupation ratio is predictive of DVT. This will inform current practice and assist in the development of an evidence based protocol for vein assessment and choice to enhance patient safety.</summary>
