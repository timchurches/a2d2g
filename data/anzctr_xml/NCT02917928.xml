  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Oral Glucose Tolerance Test - After a 10-12 h overnight fast, participants will ingest 75g of glucose over 2 mins. Blood samples will be drawn at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min for plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. We will evaluate the area under the curve.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in HbA1c - Blood samples will be measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in lipid profile - Blood samples will be analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure - Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured using an automated oscillometric measurement system (Dinamap, USA) after a 30 minute rest.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in arterial stiffness and central blood pressure - Aortic (carotid-femoral) pulse wave velocity (aPWV) will be measured using the non-invasive Complior device (Alam Medical, French).</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in markers of endothelial dysfunction - This is done using non-invasive peripheral arterial tomography (PAT; endothelium-dependent digital pulse amplitude testing (EndoPAT), Itamar Medical Ltd, Israel), which records continuous plethysmographic signals of the finger arterial pulse wave. Finger plethysmographic probes are placed on each index finger; and after a 5 min equilibration period, a blood pressure cuff on the non-dominant arm is inflated to 60 mmHg above systolic for 5 min and then deflated to induce reactive hyperaemia. Measurements of post-occlusion changes (reactive hyperaemia PAT: RH-PAT) are continued for 10 min. Results are normalised to the non-occluded arm, compensating for potential systemic changes (RH-PAT ratio).</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and 14 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in heart rate variability - The Zephyr Biomodule BH3 (Black Sensor, produced by Zephyr Technology) will be used to measure heart rate and heart rate variability for three consecutive days.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in interleukins - Interleukins will be measured by quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassays (R &amp; D Systems Inc, USA).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigators hypothesise that carnosine supplementation will improve:

        1. glycaemic control

        2. cardiovascular risk factors

        3. cognitive outcomes

      in patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and this will be modulated by reduction in
      chronic low grade inflammation, oxidative stress and circulating advanced glycation end
      products levels.

      3. Aims

      To determine the potential of carnosine supplementation for 14 weeks to improve glycaemic
      control in type 2 diabetes, reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease and improve
      cognitive function as well as identify metabolic pathways involved, specifically by:

        1. Improving glycaemic control (HBA1c, fasting and 2 hour glucose and glucose area under
           the curve after oral glucose tolerance test)

        2. Reducing cardiovascular risk factors (lipids; arterial (aortic) stiffness; central blood
           pressure (cBP); endothelial function).

        3. Improve cognitive function (global cognitive score formed by a composite of 4 cognitive
           tests)

        4. Decrease the chronic low grade inflammation, oxidative stress, advanced glycation end
           products, and advanced lipoxidation end products, and increase detoxification of
           reactive carbonyl species (RCSs).</summary>
