      <outcome>Number of Participants Who Incurred at Least One Treatment Emergent Event - Safety and tolerability to AEM-28 were evaluated through the assessment of adverse events (i.e., seriousness, severity, relationship to the study medication, outcome, duration, and management), vital signs, 12-lead ECG, telemetry, clinical laboratory parameters, physical examination, and local response to each injection, and body weight (Part B only). Treatment-emergent adverse events were tabulated by treatment. Changes from baseline values in vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory parameters, physical examination, and body weight (Part B only) were evaluated.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the first part of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a
      single dose of AEM-28, an apolipoprotein E mimetic, in subjects with high total cholesterol
      who are otherwise healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AEM-28 will
      also be evaluated.

      The second part of this study will be a multiple ascending dose evaluation of AEM-28 in
      patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia.

      AEM-28 has demonstrated significant lipid lowering activity and positive effects on the
      artery wall. AEM-28 is being developed for the treatment of homozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia.</summary>
