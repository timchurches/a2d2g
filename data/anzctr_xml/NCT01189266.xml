  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EFS (Phase II) - Mean and standard deviation will be used to summarize continuous measures; log transformation may be considered when appropriate. Log rank tests will be used to explore the prognostic significance of a categorical factor on EFS. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to explore the effect of a continuous marker on EFS, and will be used for exploratory multivariate analysis examining the effect of the predictor of interest with adjustments for other patient characteristics or risk factors.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time to disease progression, disease relapse, occurrence of a second neoplasm, or death from any cause, or date of last follow-up measured from time of study enrollment, assessed up to 60 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of toxicities (Phase II) - The analysis of toxicity will focus on estimates of the rates of chemoradiotherapy-phase DLT and rates of maintenance phase toxicities. Estimates will be obtained using life-table methods, with an event defined as the first occurrence of a primary toxicity. Patients who have progression or recurrence of disease will be censored in these analyses. Appropriate adjustment will be made to the rates estimates to account for potential effects of the initial vorinostat dose selection. Categorical measures will be described by percentages with binary confidence intervals and frequency tables.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 60 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>MTD of vorinostat, defined as the maximum dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during chemoradiation, graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) (Phase I) - Categorical measures will be described by percentages with binary confidence intervals and frequency tables.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 7 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in H3 and H4 acetylation levels in PBMCs - Degree of acetylation in peripheral blood monocytes will be divided into quartiles and coded as none, mild, moderation or marked. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the biological/laboratory measures and the changes in these measures across time-points. Exploratory analyses to correlate the biological/laboratory measures with disease outcome will be performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to up to 7 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in NHEJ activity in PBMCs - Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the biological/laboratory measures and the changes in these measures across time-points. Exploratory analyses to correlate the biological/laboratory measures with disease outcome will be performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to up to 7 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Levels of DNA repair proteins in paraffin-embedded blocks, measured via immunohistochemistry or Western analysis - For immunohistochemistry from tumor blocks, the intensity will be graded from 1 to 3; for Western analysis, a percentage of the intensity relative to the tumor with the highest level will be measured. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the biological/laboratory measures. Exploratory analyses to correlate the biological/laboratory measures with disease outcome will be performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>OS (Phase II) - Mean and standard deviation will be used to summarize continuous measures; log transformation may be considered when appropriate. Log rank tests will be used to explore the prognostic significance of a categorical factor on OS. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to explore the effect of a continuous marker on OS, and will be used for exploratory multivariate analysis examining the effect of the predictor of interest with adjustments for other patient characteristics or risk factors.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time to death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat and to see how
      well it works when given together with radiation therapy followed by maintenance therapy with
      vorinostat in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
      (a brainstem tumor). Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor
      cells. Giving vorinostat together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.</summary>
