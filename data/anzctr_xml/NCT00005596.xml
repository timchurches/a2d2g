Experimental: Arm I - Patients receive IT methotrexate on day 1 followed by methotrexate IV over 20 minutes followed by methotrexate continuously over 23.6 hrs on wks 7, 10, 13, 16,19, and 22. At 42 hrs after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion, patients receive oral leucovorin calcium every 6 hrs for a total of 3 doses. Patients also receive oral mercaptopurine daily beginning on wk 5 and continuing until the completion of consolidation therapy; oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-7 of wks 8 and 17; and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 of wks 8, 9, 17, and 18.

Experimental: Arm II - Patients receive methotrexate IV over 4 hours on weeks 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22. At 42 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion, patients receive oral leucovorin calcium as in arm I. Patients also receive mercaptopurine, dexamethasone, vincristine sulfate, and IT methotrexate as in arm I.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in outcome in children receiving multidrug delayed-intensification therapy - The overall plan is to accrue for 3.1 years or until all accrual goals have been met, whichever occurs first. Since power is determined by event-rates, lower or higher than expected event rates could lead to an amendment to alter the accrual goal. This consideration will be made independent of arm-specific outcome, in order to eliminate bias</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is
      not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy is more effective for acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing four regimens of combination
      chemotherapy to see how well they work in treating children with newly diagnosed acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.</summary>
