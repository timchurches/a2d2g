  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to either the therapy group, where participants will receive Recovery Therapy (a variant of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for psychosis) in addition to standard case management, or to the control group where participants will be monitored over a similar period while receiving standard case management.

Those participants randomised to the therapy group will receive a Recovery Therapy intervention which involves the implementation, as needed by the client, of one or more of the following elements:
1. Introduction or enhancement of techniques for better coping with persisting positive symptoms
2. Adoption of a more adaptive explanatory model of their disorder by clients
3. Strengthening of positive beliefs of self within a reality framework
4. Implementation of practical strategies for relapse prevention
5. Progress in resolution of personal/emotional issues impeding adaptation

The duration of the intervention will be 12 to 24 sessions of therapy over a maximum 12 month period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will systematically apply a specialist version of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), known as Recovery Therapy, to a random sample of patients with psychotic disorders. Previously, the therapy has been developed and efficacy established, but the extent of applicability to (unselected) mental health service patients is unknown. The main aim is to establish the extent to which this therapy is acceptable and effective for mental health service clients. A secondary aim is to develop guidelines for the conduct of such therapy in public mental health settings.</summary>
