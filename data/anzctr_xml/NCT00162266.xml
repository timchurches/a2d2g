      <outcome>ACR-N Area Under The Curve (AUC) on Day 180 and Day 360 - The AUC for ACR-N is the measure of the area under the curve of the mean change from baseline in ACR-N. The trapezoidal rule was used to compute the AUC. The ACR-N AUC was compared between the two abatacept treatment groups and the placebo group using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for 6- and 12-month data (Day 180 and Day 360). This allowed for the assessment of subject response throughout the study. See Measure Description in Outcome Measure 18 for a definition of ACR-N.</outcome>
