  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, non-randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center post-market
      clinical follow up study whereby patient undergoing routine cataract surgery will have
      bilateral implantation of a recently introduced TGA (Therapeutics Goods Authority, Australia)
      approved trifocal intraocular lens FineVision Evo (PhysIOL, Li√®ge, Belgium). The primary and
      secondary effectiveness data for visual acuity, defocus curves, contrast sensitivity and any
      adverse events will be collected.</summary>
