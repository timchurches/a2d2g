  <interventions>
    <interventions>Liposomal Cisplatin 200 mg/m2 in 1 lt of dextrose for 8 hours infusion combined with Paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 infusion for 3 hours every 2 weeks for 9 cycles. Treatment was administered once every 2 weeks (on day 1 repeated on day 15th, then 29th and so on for 9  cycles).</interventions>
    <comparator>Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and 250 cc normal seline combined with Paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 for 3 hours infusion. Hydration with 1 lt normal saline and 1 lt electrolyte. The cytotoxic drygs were given once every 2 weeks at a lower dose than that given every 3 weeks. The every 3 weeks treatment dosis is 100 mg/m2 for Cisplatin and 175 mg/m2 for Paclitaxel. (These doses have been used in other studies of the past. It is not a third arm of the present study). Both agents were given every time for 9 courses unless disease progression was observed before treatment courses were completed.</comparator>

      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (Pfs) and survival. The time from treatment start until the date of disease progression. It was mainly assessed by computerized tomography and also chest x-ray and clinical evaluation. Survival was assessed from treatment start to death or to the time study was closed.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients are randomly assigned into two treatment arms. Randomisation was performed according to the method of random permuted blocks within strata. Dynamic balancing by center is to be also performed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival distribution and the log-rank for the comparison of the treatment arms. The allocation was based on the stage of disease and was done by a statistician. Allocation was concealed since it was done by central randomisation by phone.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Liposomal Cisplatin has shown to be less toxic than Cisplatin. Dimished side effects such as nephrotoxicity and GI tract toxicity. The present study was to detect mainly the response rate between the two drugs combined with Paclitaxel.</summary>
