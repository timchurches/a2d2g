  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lemonade therapy consisted of 120 ml concentrated lemon juice (5.9 gram citric acid) mixed with 2 liters water consumed throughout each day and last for 8 years.
The patients were asked to comsume enough fluid to urinate at least 2 L daily.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>mean change in urinary citrate level.Baseline study included 2 24-hour urine samples, followed by 2-hour fasting urine sample collected on the morning of the following day along with a venous blood sample. Urine was kept refrigerated during collection and analyzed for calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, uric acid, citrate, oxalate, and creatinine. Urine volume was measured for both 24-hour urine collections, and urinary pH was determined immediately post-voiding urine samples. The patients were studied at least 8 years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients were followed in an outpatient setting yearly, at which time abdominal x-rays and noncontrast abdominal/pelvic computerized tomography, a 2 24- hour urine sample and venous blood were obtained for the same tests as before treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Citrus fruits and juices are a known natural source of dietary citrate. Of all the citrus juices, lemon juice appears
to have the highest concentration of citrate. Therefore, lemonade therapy has been proposed as a potential treatment forpatients with hypocitraturia. We prosspectively evaluated the impact of long-term lemonade therapy on urinary metabolic parameters and stone formation in patients with hypocitraturic nephrolithiasis.</summary>
