  <interventions>
    <interventions>1A- Subjects that are randomised to the Walk Group (WG) or Walk Feedback Group (WFG) will attend a Pulmonary Rehabiltation program, 3 times a week for 8 weeks.  They will complete overground walking training only, supervised by a physiotherapist.  This will start at 30 minutes and will be progressed by 5 minutes every 6th session until a maximum of 45 minutes is reached.
Trial 1B -Following the completion of the supervised walking training, both the WG and the WFG subjects will be asked to complete a further 12 months of home-based training.  Subjects will receive a package comprising written instructions to walk for 45 minutes, with rests as necceasry on at least 3 days each week, a scoring system for self assessment of breathlessness and effort, and a weekly diary card to record the number of days of walking trianing each week and the total number of minutes walked each week.  In addition the WFG will be given a pedometer to use during the home based training with further instrcutions to walk a minimum number of steps on at least 3 days each week whilst still achieving the duration of 45 minutes.  The WFG will be contacted by telephone every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and their exercise training will be adjusted according to the number of steps achieved in the immediate past two training sessions.  In the 3 to 12 month period, telephone contact will be made every month and training adjusted as above</interventions>
    <comparator>1A: Participants medical management will be optimised at baseline in accordance with the Australian and New Zealand guidelines for the management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPDx plan).  This will include an individualised COPD action plan, from the Australian Lung Foundation templaate, that will describe medication use when stable and during an exacerbation.  Medication use will vary on a case by case basis.  This group will not perform any exercise taining.
1B: Particpants receive a package comprising written instructions to walk for 45 minutes on at least 3 days each week, a scoring system for self assessment of breathlessness and effort, and a weekly diary card to record the number of days of walking trianing each week and the total number of minutes walked each week</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim is to establish sound scientific evidence of the effects of ground walking training in people with COPD.  The secondary aim is to evaluate whether novel feedback strategies can improve long term adherance to exercise training for people with COPD in order to gain important health benefits and markedly reduce health resource use and costs.</summary>
