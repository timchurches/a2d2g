  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cognitive rehabilitation involves enhancing an individual's capacity to process information
      to improve their everyday functioning. One common form of intervention is computerised
      cognitive training (CT); however, efficacy results have been mixed. This research aims to
      investigate a novel method for enhancing outcomes from CT through combining CT with
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive and painless form of brain
      stimulation. In this study we aim to determine the efficacy of this approach through
      comparing in a randomized controlled study tDCS combined with CT versus CT and tDCS alone in
      healthy participants. We hypothesise that tDCS combined with CT will have greater
      generalisability effects than the other conditions.</summary>
