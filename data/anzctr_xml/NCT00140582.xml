    <summary>-  Objectives

             -  Primary objective: To evaluate in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma the
                benefit of maintenance therapy with rituximab after induction of response with
                chemotherapy plus rituximab in comparison with no maintenance therapy

             -  Secondary objective: To evaluate response rates, event driven survival endpoints
                (EFS, PFS, OS) and quality of life of four different chemotherapy regimens combined
                with rituximab, with or without maintenance with rituximab, for first line
                treatment of advanced stage follicular lymphoma.

        -  Study Design This is an international open-label, multicentre, randomized study with two
           treatment phases. In the induction phase patients have to respond to 1st line induction
           treatment in order to be eligible for randomization to the second phase of maintenance
           treatment or observation. After the maintenance period patients will be included in the
           follow up phase for 3 years.</summary>
