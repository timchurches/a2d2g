  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall objective of this study is to identify a 60 minute cognitive battery, for
      subsequent use in clinical trials, that detects cognitive deficits in early HD and late
      pre-manifest HD compared to controls, and that has a potential to show drug induced
      improvements.</summary>
