             If the 3rd PSA value is less than the 2nd PSA value, than an additional test for
             rising PSA is required to document progression. (For the purposes of the nomogram
             calculator, the last PSA value recorded prior to initiation of the intervention will
             be considered the baseline PSA)

          -  On Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) with a Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)

          -  If cardiorespiratory abnormalities are identified, please refer the patient to his
             managing physician for further assessment and diagnosis.

          -  Note: To assist practitioners with delivering valid CPET assessments, patients nearing
             exhaustion should achieve a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of =1.1.

          -  RER is not a criteria of the test. This objective measure should only be used to
