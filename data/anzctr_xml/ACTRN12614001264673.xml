  <interventions>
    <interventions>Home visits by trained professionals (3 visits; at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 months all of approximately the same duration ie 1-1.25 hour) to assess obeseogenicity of the home environment, provision of a written report for parents and ongoing support for the family to make lifestyle changes. By ongoing support we mean provision of evidence based practical strategies for improving healthy eating and physical activity in families.  Particular emphasis was in provision of advice in non-judgemental supportive manner, sensitive to socio-ecomomic determinants of obesity. This additional support was provided by phone-calls in between home visits 2-3. The total intervention time was 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group was wait-listed (ie received the intervention 6 months after the initial intervention group). During the wait-list time period the child may have been seeing a paediatrician, GP or other health care professional for weight management (ie standard care).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child's dietary patterns using a validated instrument. Parents completed the 24-item Childrens Dietary Questionnaire (CDQ) which generates four continuous scores (i.e. fruit and vegetables, non-core foods, fat from dairy, sweetened beverages). Non-core foods are defined as foods that are not essential to meet nutrient requirements and contain excess energy, fat, sugar and salt. The CDQ shows acceptable reliability (ICC 0.5 to 0.9) and relative validity at the group level for the fruit and vegetables and non-core food scores (Cronbach alpha 0.62 to 0.72).

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child's physical activity patterns using a validated instrument. Child activity patterns were measured using an adapted version of The Outdoor Play and Small Screen Entertainment Checklist. Parents reported the average time children spent per weekday and weekend day (in hours and minutes) (i) playing outdoors, (ii) doing moderate-vigorous physical activity, and (iii) using electronic media such as television and computers for both. Six items were added to the original checklist to explore average time spent per day (iv) participating in physical activity and (v) using small screen entertainment. Times were averaged (weighted for type of day) to calculate (1) daily activity (vigorous physical activity + outdoor play) and (2) daily sedentary activity.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child's Body Mass Index (BMI) z score. child weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1kg and 0.1cm, using standardised scales and stadiometer. BMI was calculated (weight, kg/height, m2) and weight status determined by applying the IOTF cut-points. BMI z-scores were calculated using LMSGrowth Excel add-in which is based on 1990 United Kingdom reference data.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is utilising a randomised controlled study to determine whether a novel home-based intervention focusing on altering the home environment results in short-term improvements in dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviour patterns of children with obesity aged 4 -11 years. Eighty-four children, referred for management of obesity to Flinders Medical Centre (FMC), will be recruited over a two year period. Children will be randomised to receive a home-based lifestyle support intervention in addition to usual care by a paediatrician or to the control group (paediatrician care alone). Outcomes which will be assessed at six months after the intervention will include improvements in physical activity and dietary patterns of children. These outcomes will be assessed using both direct (accelerometer data) and indirect (questionnaire data) methods. The study hypothesis is that obese children enrolled in this study will have better dietary patterns, physical activity and sedentary behaviour patterns at 6 months from initial assessment compared to a control group of obese children receiving standard care</summary>
