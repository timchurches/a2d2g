      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Regurgitation (Double-blind Phase/ Baseline Observation Carried Forward)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 8</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Weight-for-Age Z-Score (Double-blind Phase/ Baseline Observation Carried Forward) - Body weight was measured with the participant unclothed and before a feeding during each office visit. In the analysis of weight data, weight will be transformed to the weight-for-age Z-score using World Health Organization Child Growth Standards, taking into account the infant's age and gender (Borghi E, 2006).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 8</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in I-GERQ-R Total Score (Double-blind Phase/ Baseline Observation Carried Forward) - The Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire-Revised (I-GERQ-R) is a 12-item questionnaire that is completed by the primary caregiver at every office or telephonic visit. It has a weekly recall and the items cover the frequency, amount and discomfort attributed to spit-up, refusal or stopping feeding, crying and fussing, hiccups, arching back and stopping breathing or changing color. The total score is calculated as the sum of all 12 scores for the individual questions, and ranges from 0 to 42. A higher value indicates a worse outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 8</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in in Weekly Average I-GERQ-DD Total Score (Double-blind Phase/ Baseline Observation Carried Forward) - The Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire-Daily Diary (I-GERQ-DD) is a 9-item daily diary that the primary caregiver will be instructed to complete every evening at the same time interval after the participant has gone to sleep for the night. The I-GERQ-DD contains 3 subscales: the Regurgitation subscale, the Eating Behavior subscale and the Discomfort subscale. Each of the 9 items will be assigned a numeric score. The total score will be calculated as the sum of all 9 items, and ranges from 0 to 37. A higher value indicates a worse outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 8</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Daily Average Number of Episodes Related to Each Volume of Regurgitation During the Double-blind Treatment Period</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Weekly Average I-GERQ-DD Regurgitation Subscale Score (Double-blind Phase/ Last Observation Carried Forward) - The Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire-Daily Diary (I-GERQ-DD) is a 9-item daily diary that the primary caregiver will be instructed to complete every evening at the same time interval after the participant has gone to sleep for the night. The I-GERQ-DD contains 3 subscales: the Regurgitation subscale, the Eating Behavior subscale and the Discomfort subscale. The Regurgitation subscale will be calculated as the sum of the 3 questions regarding regurgitation (Questions 1, 2, 3) and will range from 0 to 13. For each subscale score, a higher value indicates a worse outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 8</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Weekly Average I-GERQ-DD Discomfort Subscale Score (Double-blind Phase/ Last Observation Carried Forward) - The Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire-Daily Diary (I-GERQ-DD) is a 9-item daily diary that the primary caregiver will be instructed to complete every evening at the same time interval after the subject has gone to sleep for the night. The I-GERQ-DD contains 3 subscales: the Regurgitation subscale, the Eating Behavior subscale and the Discomfort subscale. The Discomfort subscale score will be calculated as the sum of the 3 questions regarding discomfort (Questions, 7, 8, 9) and will range from 0 to 12. For each subscale score, a higher value indicates a worse outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 8</timepoint>

The I-GERQ-DD contains 3 subscales: the Regurgitation subscale, the Eating Behavior subscale and the Discomfort subscale. The Eating Behavior subscale score will be calculated as the sum of the 3 questions regarding eating behavior (Questions 4, 5, 6) and will range from 0 to 12. For each subscale score, a higher value indicates a worse outcome.</outcome>
