  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a translational research project exploring the recommended depression screening practice in the acute setting. 6 RNs will be screening participants with ACS for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during their admission in a Coronary Care Unit. The nurses will screen patients in the time that they would perform usual care. Following 6 months, focus group discussions will explore the practical aspects of screening, potential barriers to implementation and the capability, opportunity and motivation of staff to change practice.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The qualitative data generated will be analysed using Framework Analysis. This method of analysis has been specifically designed for applied policy research where the aim is to gather information with a potential to create actionable outcomes. Its primary objective is to describe and interpret what is happening in a particular setting. The prinicple of Data Saturation will determine the sample size. In keeping with qualitative research methods, no sample size calculation was performed.</statisticalmethods>
