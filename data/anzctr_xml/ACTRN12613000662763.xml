    <interventions>The trial is a 2X2 factorial design and compares 4 groups.Two of the groups will be prescribed one regimen of exercise, and the other two groups a different regimen of exercise. In addition, two of the groups will receive placebo laser, and the other two groups active laser.  The exercise protocol is heavy load eccentric exercise twice per day, 7 days per week for 12 weeks, as per Alfredson et al 1998. Two types of exercise to be used; eccentric loading of the calf muscles with knee straight, and to maximize the activation of the deep calf muscle with the knee bent.
Each of the exercises to include 15 repetitions done in 3 sets (3 X 15 twice per day with knee bent and knee straight).
In the beginning the loading consists of body weight, subjects stand on their toes with all their body weight on the injured leg.  The calf muscles are loaded by having the subject lower the heel beneath the forefoot.  No following push up onto the toes is allowed; the non-injured leg is used to get back to the start position. Subjects are told to go ahead even if they experience pain and are only allowed to stop if the pain becomes disabling (greater than 4/10 on the visual analogue scale).
When subjects can complete the exercise without pain they must increase the loading by adding extra weight.  This can be done by filling a backpack with successively more weight or by using a weight machine.
 laser protocol is twice per week for 4 weeks; parameters are 10W output power, pulsed at 100Hz, for 30 Secs, delivering 150J to the medial, lateral and posterior aspects of the Achilles tendon, for a total time of 1:30 min, total energy delivered 450J.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis will be conducted blinded to group allocation on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis using SPSS statistical software. Differences between allocation groups at baseline with respect to demographic and clinical variables will be examined to assess the effectiveness of randomization.  Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using baseline scores as the covariate will be the statistical test used. 
From a previous pilot study data,(Tumilty et al 2008) using the change scores at 12 weeks and the participants evaluation of what constituted a minimal clinically important difference, the sample size calculations for a repeated measures design using ANCOVA and the VISA-A as primary outcome measure are obtained. Assuming a significance level of alpha= 0.05 (two-sided) and a standard deviation of 20.25, an RCT with a sample size of 16 participants in each treatment group and three follow-up measurements will have a power of greater than 0.8 to detect a minimal clinical important difference of 16 on the VISA-A. Allowing for 20% drop-outs, 20 participants per group (80 participants in total) will be required. This number will also be sufficient to assess the interaction of LLLT and eccentric exercise as power calculations for this interaction with the 2X2 design, moderate effect size (0.5) and alpha set at 0.5 gives a sample size of 17 per group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objectives of this study is to determine the most clinically effective regime of eccentric exercise for Achilles tendinopathy, and to determine if any extra benefit can be gained from adding laser therapy in combination with exercise. The hypothesis being that eccentric exercise twice per week for 12 weeks combined with laser therapy twice per week for 4 weeks will have superior outcomes and be more effective.</summary>
