  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this project is to determine whether pulmonary rehabilitation undertaken at home, delivered using internet-based technology to enable participant interaction and provide supervision of exercise, is at least as effective as hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation in improving health-related quality of life, breathlessness and exercise capacity in people with chronic respiratory disease. People who agree to take part in the study will be randomly allocated to undertake pulmonary rehabilitation at either a hospital-based group or in their home, with internet-based supervision.
Remotely supervised telerehabilitation at home will be conducted twice a week for 8 weeks, in groups of 4-6 participants at a time. Participants will be able to see and talk to each other and be monitored continuously by the supervising physiotherapist. The home-based training program will consist of stationary cycling and light weights for the arms and legs. Resistance training will utilise functional activities such as sit to stand from a chair and upper limb weights. Exercise training will be prescribed to achieve 30 minutes of endurance training in each session. Participants will be encouraged to perform an additional 3 unsupervised sessions each week, which will be documented in a home diary that is reviewed weekly. Exercise will be progressed according to a standardised protocol. Prior to commencing exercise training, participants in the home-based group will receive a visit from a physiotherapist to ensure safe use of equipment. All equipment required to undertake telerehabilitation will be supplied by the study investigators for the duration of the rehabilitation period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Traditional centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation. Participants in the control group will undergo a standard outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. Directly supervised, centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation will be conducted twice a week for 8 weeks in groups of 8-12 participants. Participants in the group will be able to interact with each other and will be monitored continuously by the supervising physiotherapist. Centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation will consist of stationary cycling, walking (treadmill or corridor) and light weights for the arms and legs. Exercise will be progressed according to a standardised protocol.  Resistance training will utilise functional activities such as sit to stand from a chair and upper limb weights. Exercise training will be prescribed to achieve 30 minutes of endurance training in each session. Participants will be encouraged to perform an additional 3 unsupervised sessions each week, which will be documented in a home diary that is reviewed weekly. Exercise training will be standardised across all centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation sites with the use of a protocol for prescription and progression.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Continuous variables will be analysed by fitting linear mixed models, controlling for recruitment centre and baseline values as required. The relative risk of non-completion will be determined. All data will be analysed by intention to treat. An additional per-protocol analysis will also be conducted to reduce the risk of Type 1 error, as recommended in the CONSORT Extension for reporting of non-inferiority and equivalence trials. Alpha will be set at 0.05. Expert biostatistical oversight will be provided by one of the associate investigators.

If there is truly no difference in the change in the dyspnoea domain of the CRQ at the end of 8 weeks of telerehabilitation or traditional pulmonary rehabilitation, then 128 participants are required (64 in each group) to be 80% sure that the 95% confidence interval will exclude a difference in means of more than 2.5 points. This is the MID for the dyspnoea domain of the CRQ (Jaeschke et al 1989) and assumes a standard deviation of the change in CRQ dyspnoea of 4.8 points (Holland et al 2004). In our previous trials we saw 10% attrition at end of rehabilitation; we will therefore randomise a total of 142 participants. 

This sample size will also give sufficient power for secondary outcomes:
*  6-min walk distance: If there is truly no difference in 6MWD at the completion of 8-weeks centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation or telerehabilitation, a total of 108 participants will be required. This sample size was determined by the 95% confidence interval excluding a difference in means between the two groups for 6MWD of more than 30 metres (Holland et al 2014), assuming a standard deviation of change in 6MWD of 53 metres (Holland et al 2010). 
*  Endurance Time: If there is truly no difference between in the change in constant work rate endurance time on cycle ergometer, then 52 participants are required to be 80% sure that the 95% confidence interval will exclude a difference in means of more than 150 seconds. This is the MID for endurance time for patients with COPD (Laviolette 2008) and assumes a standard deviation of 184 seconds (Laviolette 2008).
*  Completion: Data from our centres indicate that only 65% people who are referred to pulmonary rehabilitation take up the referral and complete the program. Previous studies have documented completion rates for telerehabilitation programs of over 90% (Dinesen et al 2012, Piotrowicz et al 2010). Using a conservative estimate of 85% completion, 128 patients will be required to detect a difference in completion rates between telerehabilitation and traditional pulmonary rehabilitation.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), bronchiectasis and asthma, are characterised by breathlessness, reduced exercise tolerance and impaired quality of life. Flareups of chronic lung disease are common in people with this condition and often lead to admission to hospital and decline in lung function, imposing considerable burden on patients and the healthcare system. Pulmonary rehabilitation is known to be effective at improving exercise tolerance and function, and helping to prevent flareups particularly for people with COPD. However, it is often difficult for people to access these group exercise training programs due to issues surrounding transport and lack of access to programs, particularly in regional areas of Australia. Advances in internet technology and accessibility have made it possible for people to receive specialist medical care and rehabilitation therapy directly to their home. By using readily available equipment such as an exercise bike and iPad it is possible for people with chronic lung disease to undertake a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program in their own home. However, whether this kind of training is as effective as hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation is unknown.

This project aims to determine whether pulmonary rehabilitation undertaken at home, using internet-based technology, is at least as effective as centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation in improving quality of life, breathlessness and exercise capacity in people with chronic lung disease. People who agree to take part in the study will be randomly allocated to undertake pulmonary rehabilitation at either a hospital-based group or in their home, with internet-based supervision. 

At the beginning and end of the 8 weeks of the intervention phase, and at 12months post completion of pulmonary rehabilitation, participants will undergo measurements of health status and exercise capacity. Hospital medical records and GP records will be reviewed to determine the frequency of acute chest infection and to identify hospital admissions and treatment of acute infections. This will be tracked for 12 months for all participants.

It is hypothesized that:
1. Home-based telerehabilitation will provide clinically significant improvements in health-related quality of life, exercise capacity and symptoms which are equivalent to those seen in centre-based rehabilitation.
2. Telerehabilitation, delivered using our low cost model, will be more cost-effective from a societal perspective when compared to centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation for chronic respiratory disease.</summary>
