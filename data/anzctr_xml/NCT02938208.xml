  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This investigation is a prospective non-blinded and non-randomized clinical investigation.
      This investigation is designed to evaluate the performance (leak and comfort) as well as
      participant's overall acceptance of the Jupiter mask amongst OSA participants. A total number
      of up to 15 OSA participants who currently use full face masks will be recruited for the
      trial.</summary>
