Ratings of 1 - 10 mean the participant is in persistent danger of severely hurting self or others (e.g., recurrent violence) or persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death. Ratings of 91 - 100 indicate no symptoms, and the participant exhibits superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities. Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement in functioning.</outcome>

A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in death, a life-threatening adverse event, hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may require medical intervention to prevent any of the previous results.
Protocol-defined adverse events requiring expedited reporting included skin rash, hypersensitivity reaction, emergent suicidal ideation or suicide attempt, and psychosis.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Young Mania Rating Scale Total Score - The YMRS is a clinician-rated, 11-item checklist used to measure the severity of manic episodes. Information for assigning scores is gained from the participant's subjective reported symptoms over the previous 48 hours and from clinical observation during the interview. Seven items are ranked 0 through 4 and have descriptors associated with each severity level. Four items (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive behavior) are scored 0 through 8 and have descriptors for every second increment. The total scale is 0-60. A score of =12 indicates remission of manic symptoms, and higher scores indicate greater severity of mania. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in severity of mania.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Total Score - HAM-A measures the severity of anxiety symptoms. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in severity of anxiety.</outcome>

Responses to each item are added to obtain a total score to determine the severity of insomnia. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in severity of insomnia.</outcome>
