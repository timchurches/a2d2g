  <interventions>
    <interventions>The composition of saliva is very similar to tears. Minor salivary gland harvested from the lips and implanted into the eyelid to help produce saliva which alleviate dry eye disease.


Grafts of the labial/buccal mucosa with attached minor salivary glands will be taken. A full thickness mucosal graft together with attached salivary glands will be harvested and placed in povidone. As glandular density per surface area is highest in the lower lip, labial mucosa from the lower lip should be taken but the buccal and upper lip can also be used as donor site if required.

The recipient bed will be prepared by everting the lower eyelid and an injection of saline or anaesthetic will be administered to allow for separation of the conjunctiva from the underlying Mullers muscle. An incision will be made in the lower conjunctival fornix before the graft is cut to shape and sutured into the lower conjunctival fornix. A bandage contact lens will be applied or, if this is to be avoided, grafts will be held in place with two horizontal running prolene 4-0 sutures along their upper and lower horizontal border. Both sutures will then be passed transpalpebrally out to the skin and externalised ends tied together. Antibiotic eyedrops and pressure bandages will be used for up to 1 week post-operative.

The surgery will only be performed once and will last about 120 minutes

Post-operative treatment will include application of topical antibiotics and lubricants 4-8 times daily for 2 weeks, after which sutures can be removed (if prolene used).</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients having minor salivary gland transplant will be compared to healthy individuals. The healthy individuals will not receive any intervention. Tear composition will be analyzed and a standardized questionnaire is used to assess subjective symptoms of dry eye for both patients with dry eyes and healthy individuals.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is been carried out to investigate if transplanting minor salivary glands into the eyelid will provide adequate symptomatic relief from severe dry eye disease. Studies have shown that the composition of salivary secretions is fairly similar to that of natural tears, thus making it a promising potential source of tears for patients with severe dry eye disease. If the procedure is successful, it will restore a natural tear film to the eye, and help prevent the symptoms of dry eye including pain, visual disturbance and light sensitivity. If successful it will also reduce or even remove the need for artificial tear drops.</summary>
