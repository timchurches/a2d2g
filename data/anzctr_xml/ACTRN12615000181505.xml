  <interventions>
    <interventions>Longitudinal clinical trial, utilizing a randomized double-blind cross-over design. The study duration will be 22 weeks, consisting of: 

Weeks 1-4: normalization (exercise + placebo)
Week 4-5: baseline testing (no exercise / no supplementation)
Week 5-13: Block 1: 8 week exercise plus supplement (placebo or wool derived protein) intervention
Week 13-14: 1 week washout period for testing (no exercise / no supplementation)
Week 14-22: Block 2: 8 week exercise plus supplement (placebo or wool derived protein) intervention
Week 22: post-intervention testing

Normalization: Participants will commence the exercise programme during this period, and all participants will consume the placebo supplement before and after each exercise sessions, and again mid-afternoon. On week 4 all primary (glucose infusion rate) and secondary outcome measurements will be taken, and used as the pre-intervention time-point

Randomization: participants will be allocated to begin the study with either WDP or placebo using the Minimisation method of randomisation. 

Supplement: The supplement will be delivered as a chocolate-milk like drink and health bar, to be consumed 3 times per day (pre-training, post-training, mid-afternoon). Each serving of the protein supplement will contain 18 g wool derived protein, 10-25 g carbohydrate, 2-4 g fat. To ensure adherence the participants will be required to complete a 3-day dietary recall each time the visit the laboratory for testing. The supplement will only be consumed on the exercise days, and not during non-exercise days.

Exercise: Exercise Physiologists will supervise 5 days/week intermittent high-intensity mixed-mode, group-based exercise program designed to achieve a fixed-rate 1% gain in exercise load/week. Each training session will be approximately 60 minutes in duration, including:

Warm-up:10 min light cardio machine exercise and stretching
Days 1,3, 5: aerobic (stationary cycle) exercise, comprising 10 x 1-min intervals (70-90% of peak power)
Days 2, 4: circuit training (10-30% of the exercise 1 repetition maximum) emphasising the legs
Cool-down: 5-10 minutes of stretching to cool down

Subjects will be required to attend a minimum of 36 sessions over the 8 weeks, and will be provided with the opportunity to complete any missed sessions on weekends.

Compliance: The participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days, and complete 3-day diet diaries on at baseline (week 4), block 1 (weeks 9 and 13), block 2 (weeks 18 and 22).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin sensitivity will be assessed with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with a primed continuous infusion of insulin at 120 mU/m2/min (Tam et al, 2012) to achieve endogenous steady-state insulin concentrations and ensure complete inhibition of endogenous-glucose production. An intravenous catheter will be placed in an antecubital vein for infusion of insulin and glucose. A second catheter will be placed anterograde in a dorsal vein of the contralateral hand for blood draws throughout the clamp to establish steady state glucose infusion. The hand will be placed in a rotating-air heating box at 55-65?C for arterialization of venous blood, which will be verified by achieving a hand skin temperature of 37-39?C and the bright-red colour of the blood. A 25% glucose solution will be infused at a variable rate to maintain plasma glucose concentrations between 5.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. The steady-state period will continue for at least 60 min. The mean rate of exogenous glucose infusion during the last 30 min of the 60-min steady state period and between 2 and 2.5 h, will be used to define the glucose infusion rate. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimate was based upon the primary outcome, glucose infusion rate (GIR) from analysis of the first completed cohort in the first study in this series (HDEC ref: 13/NTB/69). The statistical rationale and calculations are from Hopkins et al (Med Sci Sports Exerc, 2009. 41: 3-13). The minimum meaningful effect size was set at 23%, a statistically significant outcome following 3 months of diabetic medication (Derosa et al., Metabolism, 2009. 58: 1059-66). GIR has not been measured following chronic amino acid supplementation; however, the improvements in HbA1c, fasting and postprandial blood glucose recorded in T2DM participants following 8 weeks of supplementation (Solerte et al., Am J Cardiol, 2008. 101(11A): 69E-77E exceeded improvements documented in another study comparing the effect of 3 months treatment with hypoglycaemic medication in poorly controlled diabetes (Derosa et al., Metabolism, 2009. 58: 1059-66). In aforementioned supplementation study GIR improved by 23%. In our hands, the estimated typical error of 60 min GIR under similar experimental conditions was 33%. Using magnitude-based inference with the smallest important change of 23%, gives 14 in a crossover, which is sufficient power to yield a 75% likely clinical benefit. If the effect is 14%, there will be sufficient power to declare smallest worthwhile adoption ratio likelihood (66:1) of 25% possible benefit &lt;0.5% harm. Therefore, sixteen participants will be recruited, allowing for a 15% dropout. This study will provide good pilot evidence for the effect size. 

The between group effect of treatment will be analysed using mixed linear models via the Proc Mixed utility in SAS (SAS, Cary, NC). Fixed effects within the models will be treatment and time. Random effects (covariance matrix) will be subject, treatment; additional random effects may be added following evaluation of other sources of variability. The baseline values will be added as a covariate to adjust for between-subject variability. Parametric data will be log-transformed prior to analysis, which allows for changes to be expressed as percents and manages heteroscedasticity to adjust residuals to normally-distributed data. Clinical inference and inference to mechanisms outcomes will be via the method of magnitude-based inference.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Skeletal muscle in Type 2 Diabetics (T2DM) exhibits a number irregularities which may act as barriers to insulin signalling and glucose handling, including: decreased skeletal muscle mass, oxidative stress, decreased microvascular blood flow, and decreased mitochondrial content. Dietary amino acids stimulate vascular and skeletal muscle adaptations that have been associated with improved metabolic flexibility. Previous studies have typically derived these dietary amino acids from dairy sources; alternatively, wool derived protein (WDP) is rich in selenium and in precursor amino acids found in glutathione, both critical agents in cellular antioxidant processes. Preliminary findings in rats suggest that WDP supplementation attenuates oxidative stress and improves metabolic flexibility. Therefore, the current study will determine whether chronic WDP supplementation enhances the effects of exercise training on systemic glucose disposal and insulin signaling. Further, we will investigate mechanic pathways, including antioxidant capacity and free-radical stress, microvascular blood flow and capillarity, and mitochondrial respiratory function. These findings may support a novel, cost-effective and practical intervention for T2DM rehabilitation.</summary>
