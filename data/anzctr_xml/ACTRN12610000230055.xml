  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The need for endotracheal intubation in the first 24 hours after birth. Specific criteria have been established for the delivery room (need for cardiac massage, apnoea after 60 seconds of positive pressure ventilation, poor respiratory effort and heart rate &lt;120bpm). After 10 minutes of age/once in the nursery any  evidence of poor oxygenation [judged by CPAP pressure of 8cmH20 and 40% oxygen but peripheral oxygen saturations or SpO2 &lt; 85%]), the infant can be intubated.</outcome>

    <concealment>Sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes will be opened prior to the birth of an extremely preterm infant (24 to 29 weeks gestation inclusively). Infants will be allocated one of two interfaces; either the face mask or nasal tube to be used with the Neopuff Infant Resuscitator to stabilise the infant in the delivery room</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation will be stratified by gestational age (24-25 weeks) and (26-29 weeks) and sequence generated by variable block size. The randomised sequence will be generated using statistical software by an independent statistician.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most newly born extremely premature infants will receive help to establish breathing by the attending health professional. Face masks are standard but leak and this may lead to ineffective ventilation. Nasal tubes have been shown to improve chest wall movement in older infants and in more mature newly born infants was associated with less aggressive resuscitation. We hypothesize that nasal tubes may be gentler and hence better in stabilising the lungs of a newly born premature infant.</summary>
