    <interventions>Eligible participants will be randomised to the study in 2:1 ratio to either Experimental group or Standard group.

The experimental group will receive veliparib capsules 200mg per oral two times per day for 6 weeks with concurrent radiotherapy (60Gy/30 fractions) followed 4 weeks later by a 6 month course of adjuvant temozolomide capsules (150-200mg/m2* per oral days 1-5, every 28 days) given concurrently with veliparib capsules (40mg per oral two times per day).

The standard treatment group will receive radiotherapy (60Gy/30 fractions) for 6 weeks plus concurrent temozolomide capsules daily per oral (75mg/m2) followed 4 weeks later by a 6 month course of adjuvant temozolomide capsules per oral (150-200mg/m2*) days 1-5 every 28 days

* During the adjuvant treatment phase all patients will start to receive temozolomide capsules at dose level 150mg/m2 per oral once daily days 1-5 in the first cycle of therapy. If this dose level is well tolerated, then the dose of temozolomide should be increased in subsequent cycles to 200 mg/m2. If the dose is not escalated in cycle 2, then the dose of temozolomide should remain at 150 mg/m2 for all 6 cycles.

To ensure appropriate control on the distribution of experimental treatment the Pharmacy Department at participating institutions will maintain a record of veliparib study drug received from the sponsor, the amounts dispensed for each patient, the amounts of study drug returned and the amounts destructed. Patients assigned to the veliparib study drug arm will be asked to return unused and empty study drug containers at each return visit to assess compliance to the treatment. Temozolomide is part of standard of care and drug dispensing and compliance will be monitored according to local hospital practices.

The radiotherapy treatment is standard of care and consists of a conventionally fractionated regimen, delivering a total dose of 60Gy, in a once daily schedule of 2 Gy per fraction for a total of 30 fractions, completed optimally in 6 weeks but up to a maximum of 7 weeks.

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>One hundred and twenty patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to the experimental and standard treatment arms, respectively. The randomisation will protect against selection bias and allow response to be estimated in a contemporary control group but no formal comparison between the randomised arms is planned. 

Eighty patients on the experimental arm will have 80% power at alpha equal to 0.1 to detect an increase in response rate (proportion alive and progression-free at 6 months) from 53% to 65% using Flemings one-stage design. 

A safety and feasibility analysis will be conducted when 60 patients have completed radiotherapy. The intervention is declared feasible if overall accrual achieved within 18 months, adequate treatment adherence (e.g. at least 70% of patients on experimental arm completed at least 70% of the treatment) and less than or equal to 30% of patients on the experimental therapy experience a grade 3 or 4 adverse event. If this is achieved, further patients will be enrolled to a total of 120 (80 on experimental and 40 on control arm). If these safety and feasibility conditions are not met then consideration will be given to stopping or modifying the study. If the study did stop at that point it would provide initial estimates of efficacy (approximately 40 patients on the active intervention would have 80% power at alpha equal to 0.1 to detect a large increase in response rate from 53% to 70%). Correlation with the DNA repair protein signature will be explored</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a combination of veliparib with radiotherapy, followed by a combination of veliparib with temozolomide (a chemotherapy), to treat patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (a type of brain tumour).

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are a person who is recently diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (brain tumour), underwent surgery (or have been scheduled to undergo surgery) for this diagnosis and are considered for further treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide treatment.

Study details:
If you like to join this study you will first be screened by your specialist to see if you meet the eligibility criteria to participate in this study. If you are deemed eligible to participate you will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of two possible treatment groups:
Group 1 will receive veliparib together with radiotherapy for 6-7 weeks, followed by a 4 week treatment break, which is again followed by a 6 month treatment with a combination of temozolomide and veliparib.
Group 2 will receive receive temozolomide together with radiotherapy for 6-7 weeks, followed by a 4 week treatment break, which is again followed by a 6 month treatment with temozolomide.
Your chance to receive the group 1 treatment is twice as high as to receive the group 2 treatment.
Participants will be asked to attend clinic visits every 2-4 weeks during the treatment period and then two times more (1 month and 3 months after having received the last treatment). During these visits the specialist will assess the status of your glioblastoma and your physical and mental health, and ask you about your well-being. Participants will also be asked to undergo tests and procedures, such as blood testing, urine testing, scans, and questionnaire completion and to give tissue samples for laboratory research.</summary>
