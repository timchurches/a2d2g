  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to test the impact of a community-based program aimed at promoting healthy eating and physical activity on changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) in primary school students. The hypothesis is that a community development/health promoting schools approach will reduce the levels of overweight and obesity in this group.</summary>
