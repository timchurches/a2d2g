  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: In patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) depression is common, chronic and more severe than in other groups of cardiac patients. Unfortunately, at the present time in this group of patients, depressed mood is rarely screened for, let alone treated. Many patients have a mild form of depression minor depression that is debilitating with consequences that are anything but minor.  We have data that demonstrate that depression (both major and minor) is a marker of a worse future health, including death, in CHF patients. However, these data do not conclusively answer two questions: 1. Does providing antidepressant medication for people with heart failure and depression improve their mood?  2.	Does improving mood with antidepressant medication also improve physical functions related to heart health? Aims: This study, therefore, aims to test the hypothesis that treatment with an antidepressant medication (escitalopram) can improve minor and major depression in depressed patients with CHF. The study will also examine whether by reducing depression, other known medical risk factors that are related to both depression and CHF are changed at the same time. A third part of the study will examine whether there are longer term benefits to hospitalizations and longevity, and finally, genetic testing will done to assess the role of certain genes in the response to treatment.</summary>
