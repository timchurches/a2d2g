  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a multi-center, single-agent, open-label, Phase I accelerated dose escalation study of APG-1387.  Initially, single patient cohorts will be evaluated and doses of APG-1387will increase by 50% until = Grade 2 drug related toxicity is observed, at which point dose escalation and cohort rules will follow a modified Fibonacci 3/6 Phase I design.  Allowances for intra-patient dose escalations are provided.  Treatment cycles will begin at 0.3 mg of APG-1387 administered via intravenous infusion for 30 minutes on Days 1, 8 and 15, then take oneweek treatment off; each dosing cycle is 28 days.  Doses could be modified depending on toxicity and PK results based on discussions with the Investigators and Sponsor. If no DLTs are observed by the end of Cycle 1, the dose of APG-1387 will be increased in subsequent cohorts, at 0.6 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.5 mg, 4.0 mg, 7.0 mg, 12 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg accordingly. Patients will be treated with APG-1387 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient withdraws consent.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the safety and tolerability of APG-1387, including determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), when intravenously administered to patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. The Response to treatment will be evaluated by using RECIST (Response evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) after every 8 weeks of treatment by using the appropriate imaging technique (CT,MRI,X-Ray). The assessment of the size of lesions over time will give an indication of the status of the disease. Safety and Tolerabilty will be assessed throughout the study by close monitoring of blood results and the condition the patient is in. Regular visits to the study site are planned to ensure close monitoring of patient health.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The patient will attend the study site 4 times during each treatment cycle. During Cycle 1 the patients health will be closely monitored at each visit by taking blood samples,measuring vital signs, conducting a Physical Exam and ECG and assessing the ECOG performance status. From cycle 2 onwards these assessments will be done at Day 1 of each following cycle. At each visit -regardless of cycle - any adverse events and/or new concomitant medication will be discussed with the Patient.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of APG-1387 - this will be done by taking blood samples at specified timepoints. Plasma will be stored for analysis.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>PK samples will be taken during Cycle 1 at Day 1 (9 samples) and 24 hours post-dosing (Day 2), Cycle 1 Day 15 (9 samples) and 24 hours post dosing (Day 16)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PDy) effects of APG-1387 in study subjects - assessment by collection of Blood and Tissue samples
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples (5 mL per sample) for PDy analysis will be collected into heparanized glass collection tubes at pre dose Day 1, 24 hours post dosing (Day 2), Day 8 and Day 15.
Tumor tissue samples will be obtained by collecting a fresh punch biopsy (approximately&gt; 3 mm) from the patient before and post treatment between Day 8 and Day 15.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas - by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors (RECIST)</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST will be assessed every 8 weeks until the patient is withdrawn from the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To support selection of suitable tumor type(s) for the next stage of clinical development, based on PDy and preliminary efficacy data

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to establish the safety and best tolerated dose of a new investigational drug called APG-1387 in participants with advanced cancer. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and have been diagnosed with an advanced solid tumour or lymphoma. 
Study details
All participants in this study will be treated with a new investigational drug called APG-1387. This drug blocks tumour growth by promoting cell death (a process called apoptosis) in cancer cells and attempts to stop the cancer cells from spreading further throughout the body. This drug has not previously been tested in humans. APG-1387 has undergone extensive testing in various animal models (including rats and monkeys) and human cancer cell models in the laboratory. APG-1387 will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion (i.e. directly into the vein) on Days 1, 8 and 15 of study participation. The first group of participants will receive a dose of 0.3 mg of APG-1387, and if tolerated the dose will be increased for subsequent patient groups. Participants will be regularly monitored until they reach their endpoint (disease progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent) in order to determine safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of treatment. The results from this study will be analysed to see if it is worthwhile for this new drug to be tested in future studies involving larger numbers of cancer participants.
