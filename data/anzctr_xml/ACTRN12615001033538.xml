  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants receive both treatments in a random order. Participants are randomised to receive either a single dose subcutaneous injection of 1.75mg of PT-141 or placebo, followed by a two week wash-out period and then a single dose subcutaneous injection of 1.75mg of PT-141 or placebo. Participants will have exposure to the PT-141 drug within the research premises here in the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney. They are not allowed to go outside the research premises while the drug is active, which will take 45 minutes from drug administration.</interventions>
    <comparator>Single dose subcutaneous injection of 1.75mg of placebo. The placebo is composed of 2.5% (w/v) glycerin (United States Pharmacopoeia [USP], multi-compendial, vegetable-grade) in sterile water for injection, USP, adjusted to pH 5.0 with either hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide as necessary.  </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this proposal is to conduct the first study of the impact of subcutaneous injection of PT-141 on key mechanisms involved in social communication in healthy adults. We hypothesize that PT-141 will, in comparison to an identical and matched placebo: increase gaze duration  and fixations to key face regions, improve accuracy and the speed of identification of facial emotion recognition, increase heart rate variability, and improve accuracy of response to social cues.</summary>
