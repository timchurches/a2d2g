    <interventions>Traumatic brain injuries are common, estimated to affect 107 in 100,000 Australians per year. Of these 80% sustain a mild-moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  A wide range of cognitive, behavioural and affective symptoms occur as a result of the biomechanical forces to the brain. The acute and long lasting impact of mTBI on brain activity is not well characterized. 

Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) can be used as a tool to identify the neurophysiological mechanisms associated with mTBI symptoms. Furthermore, it allows the association between cognitive impairments and the functional integrity of the neural areas underlying these symptoms to be investigated.

An EEG is a recording of the brains electrical activity and is a commonly used tool to investigate aspects of brain functioning. After recording some EEG whilst the participant sits still with their eyes open or closed we will use a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device to assess brain activity. This is done by placing a handheld magnetic coil over the participants scalp while they are seated in a chair. The magnetic field generated by the coil is able to painlessly stimulate nerve cells in the brain. The TMS protocol is 75 single pulses at 0.2Hz with an interstimulus interval of 5 seconds. Single pulse duration is approximately 6.5 minutes.

Thirty mTBI participants and 30 age and gender matched controls will attend three testing sessions across a 6 month period to capture acute, sub-acute and chronic symptoms post injury. A neuropsychological assessment and TMS/EEG recording will be conducted at each time point. Total testing session will take approximately 3 hours and will be conducted by a trained PhD student under the supervision of a Clinical Neuropsychologist. Analyses will be conducted between groups to assess for differences in brain activity and within groups to investigate recovery in mTBI and test-retest reliability in controls. By improving our understanding of how changes in brain activity relate to impairments and recovery of function, targeted therapeutic strategies to modulate these may be developed.</interventions>

      <outcome>TMS-EEG data.
TMS-EEG is performed by stimulating the scalp over the DLPFC while simultaneously recording brain activity via surrounding EEG electrodes. The TMS pulse produces a neurophysiological response in the underlying cortex, referred to as the TMS evoked potential (TEP), which is recorded on EEG and the TEP amplitude gives an index of cortical excitability.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measures will be neurophysiological, i.e. the differences in cortical activity between mTBI participants and controls. A linear mixed-effect model will be used to analyse the group x time interaction. If a significant interaction between group and time is observed, post hoc between group analyses will be conducted to see where the difference lies. The dependent variables will be TEPs, EEG coherence at rest and during the n-back task. 
Secondary outcome measures will be neuropsychological. Separate repeated measures ANOVAs will be used to compare neuropsychological measures across time in both groups. Pairwise comparisons will be conducted as follow up for any significant results of the analysis of variance. The dependent variables will be the individual neuropsychological tests (include assessments of working memory, attention, processing speed etc.). Bivariate correlations will be used to examine the relationship between neuropsychology measures and cortical activity in both groups.
Finally, to investigate whether mTBI alters the brains response to TBS, EEG coherence will be compared within group and between groups. Furthermore, the effect of TBS on neurobehavioral performance will be assessed by comparing n-back performance (measures of accuracy and reaction time) pre and post TBS.

All statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS Version 20 and p-values &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

30 participants will be included in each group. This sample size has been determined based on previous research within a traumatic brain injury population group. No sample size power calculations have currently been performed.

In summary, the aim of this study is to investigate changes in cortical activity, and the relationship with cognition, during recovery post mTBI using TMS-EEG.
