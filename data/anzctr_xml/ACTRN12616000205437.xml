  <interventions>
    <interventions>A cross-sectional observational study design will be used to assess the functional independence of older adults (n=90) living in the community within 12 months of being discharged from inpatient rehabilitation. </interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be functional independence. Because there is no consensus on which is the best measure of function in the community, 2 measures will be used and compared; the FIM and the Frenchay Activities Index (FAI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any time between discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and 12 months following discharge. This will provide a spread of time points to map function over time (compared to function measured as part of routine practice at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation).   </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Potential predictors of function will also be assessed. 
Personal/ demographic potential predictors such as: age, sex, co-morbidities and diagnosis during rehabilitation (reason for admission to rehabilitation) will be assessed by reviewing participant hospital records and will be confirmed during the patient interview. </outcome>
      <timepoint>These factors will be assessed at the same point in time that functional independence is assessed. This will be different for each participant but will be any time between discharge from rehabilitation and 12 months post discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rehabilitation length of say (days) will be assessed as a potential predictor of function. Rehabilitation length of stay will be determined by reviewing the participant's hospital records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Rehabilitation length of stay will be determined at the point of discharge from rehabilitation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hospital re-admissions will be assessed by reviewing the participants medical records (for admissions to the same health service) and on patient interview (by asking about hospital presentations to any hospital). 
Re-admissions will be recorded as number of re-admissions and total number of overnight stays spent in hospital.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Re-admissions will be assessed at the same point in time that functional independence is assessed - any time between discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and 12 months following discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional independence on discharge from rehabilitation will also be assessed as a potential predictor of function in the community. 
This is routinely assessed using the FIM at the rehabilitation facilities and recorded in the participants medical record. This outcome will therefore be assessed by reviewing the medical records. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Function on discharge from rehabilitation is generally assessed within 24 hours prior to discharge at the rehabilitation facilities.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Usual physical activity levels will be assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the same point in time that functional independence in the community is assessed - any time between discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and 12 months following discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Falls will be assessed by reviewing hospital records (for falls within hospital) and by asking the participant to recall any falls since they have been discharged home (falls in the home/community). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Falls will be assessed at 2 time points: falls during the inpatient rehabilitation period (by assessing medical records for the inpatient stay) and falls in the community (which will be assessed at the same point in time that functional independence is assessed - any time between discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and 12 months following discharge)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Need for follow up rehabilitation services (e.g allied health services) will be assessed by review of hospital records and by asking the patient if they were referred to, or have needed to see any health professionals related to their rehabilitation stay since being discharged.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the same point in time that functional independence is assessed - any time between discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and 12 months following discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Living situation will be recorded as either: living alone, living with spouse or living with family/others. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the same point in time that functional independence is assessed - any time between discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and 12 months following discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>To be eligible for inclusion participants need to be: community-dwelling, English speaking older adults (65years or older) who have received inpatient rehabilitation for any health condition at the health service within the previous 12 months </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Older adults will not be eligible if they live in high or low level residential care as we are focusing on functional independence that allows older adults to remain living independently in the community. 
People with cognitive impairment (as assessed by a score of more than 2 errors on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) will not be eligible to participate as they will not be able to take part in the questionnaire process (which relies on recall). </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Functional status (FIM and FAI) of participants will be plotted against time post rehabilitation.
Percentage of participants obtaining the highest or lowest possible scores on the FIM and FAI will be calculated to assess for floor and ceiling effects.
Multiple regression analysis will be used to assess the ability of a set of personal (age, sex, rehabilitation diagnosis, co-morbidity), rehabilitation (length of stay, falls during rehabilitation and FIM at discharge) and community (living situation, physical activity levels, falls in the community, hospital re-admissions and need for follow-up therapy) factors to predict function in the community. Using the equation: n &gt; 50+8m, where m is the number of independent contributing factors, our estimated sample size is n=90, with a maximum of 5 independent factors per analysis (as there are 5 potential predictors in the community factors). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Little is known about how patients function in the community following discharge from rehabilitation. Despite the assumption that patients will continue to improve on their own, limited data suggests that they do not. We will assess the function of older adults living in the community within 12 months of being discharged from inpatient rehabilitation. Analysis will identify factors associated with ageing well in the community and factors that predict functional decline. This will provide important data to aid rehabilitation clinicians to tailor their care to optimise function and prevent functional decline.  </summary>
