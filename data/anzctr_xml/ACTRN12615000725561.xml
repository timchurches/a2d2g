  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparison of the performance of antimicrobial melimine coated contact lenses to standard marketed contact lenses with 2 week extended wear basis. Subjects will wear a test melimine coated antimicrobial lens in one eye, and the control uncoated marketed lens in the other eye (extended wear means uninterrupted day and night wear). The contact lens material is same, Etafilcon A. The total duration for innervation is 3 months and will include total 7 study visits that will confirm the adherence to intervention protocols. After the study finishes, subjects will be followed up after 1 month (with own spectacles/contact lenses) to rule out any delayed effects.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a contralateral study. Which means participants will be wearing antimicrobial (test) contact lens in one eye and commercially available control contact lenses in the other eye (randomly allocated). So, the eye with control contact lens will serve as the control treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ocular health of subjects, evaluated by detailed slit lamp examinations, ocular signs and symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed after 1 day, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 4 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate the safety of surface-modified lens wear (e.g. no increases in bulbar/limbal redness, corneal/conjunctival staining during lens wear compared to control lenses)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Throughout the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore retention of anti-adhesion activity of surface-modified lenses against bacteria in the laboratory after 2 weeks of wear. Worn contact lenses will be collected aseptically at the end of lens wear and will be checked in the laboratory to assess its retention of antimicrobial activity.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months visit, </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine changes to the normal cultivable microbiota of the conjunctiva during the lens wear. Worn contact lenses will be collected in a sterile vial from participants using sterile gloves. Contact lens collection will follow the standard contact lens removal procedure from eye. Eye swabs will be collected from the eyes following the standard ocular swabbing technique. Participants will be asked to look down and the exposed white of the eye will be gently rubbed using a sterile cotton bud pre-moistened with sterile saline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months visit</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>*Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent.
*Be at least 18 years old, male or female.
*Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator.
*Have vision that is correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses/spectacles.
*Require contact lens correction in each eye between -0.75 and -6.00 D inclusive.

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>*Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
*Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Gravess disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosis. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
*An active corneal infection or any active ocular disease that would affect wearing of contact lenses;
*Use of or a need for any therapeutic ocular medication at enrolment (that would be required to be discontinued during the study);
*Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse manner or risk providing a false positive.
*Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
*Previous corneal refractive surgery.
*Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the study products.
*Currently enrolled in another clinical trial or participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks.
*Pregnancy or lactating (Testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient).
