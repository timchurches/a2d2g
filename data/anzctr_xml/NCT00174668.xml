             mixture of 70/30 or 75/25. "Stable" means no change in regimen and no more than 30 %
             change in dose. Optionally, the subject can have been treated in addition with
             metformin according to its current official product information leaflet, treatment

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary objective:

      The primary study objective is to demonstrate superior efficacy of an intensified insulin
      regimen with insulin glulisine and insulin glargine to a two-injection conventional insulin
      regimen in terms of change in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), from baseline to endpoint.

      Secondary objectives:

      Secondary study objectives are to compare the intensified insulin regimen with insulin
      glulisine and insulin glargine to a two-injection conventional insulin regimen in terms of
      blood glucose (BG) values (fasting, pre-/postprandial (ppBG), nocturnal, mean daily, fasting
      plasma glucose), daily BG profiles, BG and HbA1c response rates (predefined), hypoglycemic
      events, adverse events, change of late diabetes complications, weight, body-mass-index,
      course of total daily insulin dose and adjustment, blood lipid profile, microalbuminuria,
      standard lab and quality of life/treatment satisfaction.</summary>
