  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this research is to compare the outcomes in  cardiac surgery patients who have sternal fixation using stainless steel wires (current practice at The Alfred) with patients who have sternal fixation using Zipfix cable ties (intervention).

Applying the Zipfix cable ties involves using 5 biocompatible cable ties looped around both halves of the sternum using a removable needle, then they are tightened to pull the sternal halves back together.  The remaining length of the cable tie is then cut using a specialized cutting device. 

Cardiac surgeons will perform the sternal closure on patients using the Zipfix system.  </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Using a continuous definition of pain from the visual analog pain scale, a reduction of pain by 50% between groups is considered to be clinically significant. From a previous study involving massage in cardiac surgery patients with a mean pain score of 2.6 and delta value of 1.20, in order to detect a 50% reduction in pain with alpha level 0.05 and power 0.8 requires 54 patients. With a drop out rate of 10%, this would be 60 patients per group.

Therefore 60 patients per group would be adequately powered to detect a clinically significant difference in outcome measures. This will require enrollment of 120 patients in the study.

Visual analog pain scores will be analysed between groups comparing means between the two groups (t-tests).

Sternal instability will be analysed by a simple chi square analysis comparing proportions for the three categories of instability.

A multivariate analysis will be undertaken to account for confounding variables (ANCOVA).

The level of statistical significance will be set at a p-value &lt;0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current standard practice at The Alfred Hospital involves closing the sternum following cardiac surgery with stainless steel wires.  Alternative sternal closing techniques also exist, however to date closure of the sternum using stainless steel wires remains the standard technique because of its low cost.  The cable tie method of sternal closure however is a widely used sternal closure technique that is used as a standard method by many surgeons in Australia and around the world, as this method potentially provides better stability of the sternum and less postoperative sternal pain.  The aim of this research is to compare the outcomes in patients who have their sternum closed either with the Zipfix cable ties or stainless steel wires.  The researchers will investigate whether patients who have their sternum closed with Zipfix cable ties experience less pain compared to patients that have their sternum closed with stainless steel wires.  They will also determine whether patients who have their sternum closed with the cable ties have reduced sternal mobility in the early postoperative period. 

We hypothesize that use of the zipfix system for sternal closure after cardiac surgery improves sternal stability and reduces post operative pain, compared to conventional stainless steel wires. </summary>
