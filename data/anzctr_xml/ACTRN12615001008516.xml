    <interventions>The MTMM bi-directional cannula is a novel femoral arterial cannula that has been developed to improve standard retrograde perfusion without compromising distal limb flow during peripheral femoral cannulation for Cardiac Surgery.It is inserted on a single occasion by the cardiothoracic surgeon under direct vision into the femoral artery 5-10 minutes prior to institution of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). It remains in situ until approximately 15-30 minutes after the patient is taken off CPB. The patient may be on CPB for up to 240 minutes (but the most common duration is between 90-120 minutes). </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety - adverse events, adverse device events. The main potential risk is vessel damage requiring surgical repair. As the cannula is inserted under direct vision, if the vessel is injured it will be identified immediately and a surgical repair will be undertaken straight away. Dislogment of the cannula during CPB is a possible risk which could lead to blood loss. This would be identified immediately and would be rectified by repositioning the cannula under direct vision.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to test a novel cannula that permits blood flow up and down the leg (called bi-directional) when placed in the femoral artery for the purposes of connecting patients to cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery.

As the cannula needs to be large to allow for a large volume of blood that must pass through the ECMO machine, the diameter of the cannula is almost the same as the diameter of the femoral artery so there is little room around the cannula for the blood to flow down the leg. Complications can arise due to poor blood flow down the leg which may result in irreversible damage to structures in the leg.

The use of a second downstream cannula or sewing a side graft are methods used to prevent complications from poor blood supply to the lower leg by providing a dedicated blood supply. These techniques are cumbersome, time consuming and require additional equipment. As a result current standard practice involves the use of an upstream femoral cannula only, relying on the very small amount of blood that will flow downstream around the cannula to keep the leg viable.

It is hoped that the use of the novel bi-directional femoral perfusion cannula in cardiac surgery will lead to an improvement in current practice by providing a more reliable continuous blood flow down the leg during cardiopulmonary bypass.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the MTMM bi-directional cannula in the cardiac surgery setting and to determine whether this cannula provides adequate downstream blood flow to the limb to avoid complications from poor blood supply.</summary>
