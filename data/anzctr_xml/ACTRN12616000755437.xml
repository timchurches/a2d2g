  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomized trial comparing two treatments for urge incontinence
Arm 1: an anticholinergic  drug trospium chloride given daily for 6 months.
Arm 2: surgical plication of the cardinal/uterosacral ligaments plication- this is a minimally invasive a day care operation. The operation takes about 25-30 minutes and performed via the vagina. It involves two small incisions in the vagina. The ligaments are located and repositioned with 2 sutures only. The vagina is closed and the patient is sent home on the same day with very  minor limitations as to what they can or cannot do. The urologist delivers the intervention with minimum 5 years experience;

Monitoring 
of compliance:   by drug returns
of treatment success:  by the UDI-6 and where relevant CRADI-8 questionnaires at 6 weeks, 12 weeks 26 weeks also, the number of patients who completed the treatment.

    <statisticalmethods>Power 95% CI with 1% significance, 192 total (96 each arm) required.
Paired binary response data (per-patient presence/absence of a specific sign/symptom before vs. after surgery/anticholinergic treatment) in the total study cohort were analyzed with a McNemars test, with a null hypothesis of no treatment effect. 
The GraphPad Quickcalcs platform was used for this analysis (http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/mcNemar1/). The sample size (https://www.statstodo.com/SSizMcNemar_Pgm.php) was deemed sufficient to assume a Chi-squared distribution. The Chi-square was calculated with one degree of freedom. 
Post-hoc estimation of the study power was performed, assuming an alpha error equal to 0.01 (https://www.statstodo.com/SSizMcNemar_Pgm.php). In all cases the estimated power for this comparison exceeded 0.95.

To evaluate differences between the proportions of patients showing or not a specific sign/symptom when treated with different  techniques (CL/USL reinforcement vs. anticholinergics), the Z-ratio and the 95% confidence interval for the difference between independent proportions were calculated.
 
The Vassar Stats platform was used for this analysis (www.vassarstats.net).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is known that anticholinergic drugs are slightly more effective than placebo and the majority of treatments are discontinued because of side effects.  It is also known since 1993, that symptoms of urgency, nocturia, pelvic pain and other symptoms are potentially curable in up to 85% of cases with a minimally invasive day-care operation which tightens the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments. The minimally invasive nature of the operation makes it ethically possible for a trial to be performed. A multicentre trial (RCT) testing these two methods in patients presenting with urge incontinence (i.e., uncontrolled wetting with urge two or more times per day). The fate of these (and other) symptoms will be monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 26 weeks with scientifically valid questionnaires UDI-6, CRADI-8 and so as to allow for variability in the results, number of incidents  for urge and nocturia: good day average day and bad day.  </summary>
