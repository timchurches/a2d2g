  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a psychological intervention for treating co-occurring anxiety and depression in patients with Parkinsons disease in comparison to treatment as usual.  The secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of the psychological intervention on carers levels of distress and burden. 
Study design	: Blinded RCT with two conditions: CBT and Treatment as Usual.
Planned sample size:	N = 40 (n = 20 for each condition).
Selection criteria:	Inclusion criteria are participants aged 50 years and over with a diagnosis of Parkinsons disease and patient reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms (Geriatric Anxiety Inventory &gt;6) and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale -15 scores &gt; 5). The patients spouse or carer will be invited to participate. The exclusion criteria are the presence of active suicide ideation, psychos is, substance abuse, uncontrolled bipolar disorder limited English literacy or significant cognitive impairment (2 or more errors on the Six Item Screener for Cognitive Impairment). Use of psychiatric medication will be required to be stabilised one month prior to study entry.
Study procedure:	Written and informed consent will first be gained for both the participants and carers. Participants and caregivers will complete the self-report measures. Suitable participants will be randomly allocated (via a computer generated randomisation list allocated to sealed envelopes) to receive the intervention face to face or treatment as usual. At the end of 10 weeks, participants and caregivers will recomplete psychometric measures, as well as again I month after treatment has finished (1 month follow up). 	Participants and carers in both treatment groups will complete all psychometric measures pre-, post- and 1 month post intervention. Patients who received CBT will complete the consumer feedback interview at the end of CBT.
Analysis plan: Analyses will be conducted using intention-to-treat. Categorical data will be analysed via chi-squared tests, and continuous data with parametric or equivalent non-parametric tests including mixed linear models. 
Duration of the Study	June 2016  June 2017 (including follow-ups)
