  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive mobile phone text messages for 6 months. For Phase 1 (the first 3 months), participants in the intervention group will receive a text message every day at a random time between 7 am and 6 pm. The text messages will provide information, motivation and support on physical activity, nutrition, weight, and diabetes self-management. Participants who smoke tobacco or take medication for diabetes (ie tablets or insulin) will also receive an additional message on smoking and medication adherence each fortnight. For Phase 2 (3rd to 6th month) participants will receive the text messages four times per week. The information in the text messages is based on validated guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes, advice from academic and clinical experts, and the published literature. The delivery of the text messages will be unidirectional. The messaging software will provide a report on the delivery of messages to participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual care; this will generally include standard advice and treatment from their doctor, diabetes specialists or other health professionals. Participants may also receive resources and services from their local diabetes service; and state and national organisations for people with type 2 diabetes.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a text message intervention on lifestyle risk factor modification and diabetes self-management for people with type 2 diabetes. 
A pragmatic randomised controlled trial will be conducted in the Illawarra Shoalhaven. The intervention group will receive mobile phone text messages for 6 months; the messages will provide information, motivation and support on physical activity, nutrition, weight, smoking cessation and diabetes self-management. The control group will receive usual care. 
The primary outcome measure will be HbA1c; secondary measures will include physical activity, nutrition, body mass index, blood lipids, and medication adherence. 
A sample of 340 will be needed in the trial. People will be recruited through various sources such as the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (Ambulatory and Primary Health Care, hospitals &amp; the Diabetes Service), general practices, local newspapers, pharmacists, podiatrists, and Diabetes NSW. 
People will be eligible to participate if they: have type 2 diabetes (range 7.5%-11% HbA1c); have a mobile phone; are between 18 and 75 years old; able to read and speak English; and have medical clearance from their doctor. Exclusion criterion will be pregnancy.</summary>
