  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent important discoveries reinforce the idea that CFS is associated with gut flora imbalances.  However, the idea that this can have a major effect on sleep and daytime functioning requires further supporting research.  This project will determine whether those participants with CFS who, at baseline, are highly gram-positive (determined via stool analysis and indicative of abnormal gut functioning) and respond to antibiotic treatment (such that the amount of gram positive flora is reduced below a certain threshold) also demonstrate significant and ongoing improvements in sleep, daytime activity, mood and self-reported fatigue symptoms.   
 Eligible participants will follow a baseline, treatment and follow up protocol, across a total of 22 days.  The treatment phase involves taking a course of the antibiotic, Erythromycin, for 6 days.   
 This is an open label pilot research program which aims to determine whether this treatment leads to improvements during treatment and follow up phases, compared to assessments made in the baseline phase. A second Bioscreen stool analysis will also determine whether reduced gram-positive status has been achieved in the gut.
