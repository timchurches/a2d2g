  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low bone density is a strong risk factor for fracture, but 80% of fractures occur in women without low bone density. We plan to investigate whether zoledronate, an effective osteoporosis treatment, can be given very infrequently by injection to prevent bone loss and spinal fractures in women with normal or only mildly low bone density. 
The proposed study is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial to be carried out over a period of ten years. 1050 post-menopausal women, aged 50-60 years, will be randomly assigned to receive either infusions of zoledronate or an inactive agent (placebo) at baseline and at five years. There will be three treatment groups- women who receive zoledronate at baseline and five years, women who receive zoledronate at baseline and placebo at five years, and women who receive placebo at baseline and five years. The main outcomes are occurrence of new spinal fractures and changes in bone density. Participants will have study visits every 5 years, and phone or email visits every six months, and at baseline, five years, and 10 years, participants will have a measurement of bone density and xrays of the spine.</summary>
