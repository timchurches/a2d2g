  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Accumulation of Disability (SAD) - EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that qualifies disability in participants with MS. It assesses 7 functional systems (visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder and cerebral) as well as ambulation. EDSS total score: 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS). As measured by EDSS score, SAD was defined as increase of at least 1.5 points for participants with Baseline score of 0 and increase of at least 1.0 point for participants with a Baseline score of 1.0 or more; and the increase persisted for at least the next 2 scheduled assessments, that is, 6 consecutive months. The onset date of SAD was date of first EDSS assessment that began 6 month consecutive period of SAD. Participants who did not reach SAD endpoint were censored at their last visit. Percentage of participants with SAD, estimated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, was reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annualized Relapse Rate - Relapse was defined as new neurological symptoms or worsening of previous neurological symptoms with an objective change on neurological examination, attributable to multiple sclerosis that lasted for at least 48 hours, that were present at normal body temperature, and that were preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability. Annualized relapse rate was estimated through negative binomial regression with robust variance estimation and covariate adjustment for geographic region using observed number of relapses as dependent variable, the log total amount of follow-up from date of first study treatment for each participant as an offset variable, and treatment group and geographic region as model covariates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Were Relapse Free at Year 2 - Participants were considered relapse free at Year 2 if they did not experience a relapse from the date of first study treatment to study completion at 24 months. Percentage of participants who were relapse free at Year 2, estimated using the KM method, was reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Year 2</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score at Year 2 - EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that qualifies disability in participants with multiple sclerosis (MS). It assesses the 7 functional systems (visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder and cerebral) as well as ambulation. EDSS total score ranges from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS). Change was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from value at Year 2.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Year 2</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score at Year 2 - MSFC is a multidimensional measure consisting of quantitative tests of ambulation (Timed 25-Foot Walk), manual dexterity (9-Hole Peg Test; 9HPT), and cognitive function (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test; PASAT). The MSFC score was calculated as the mean of the Z-scores of the 3 components. A Z-score was calculated by subtracting the mean of the reference population from the test result, then dividing by the standard deviation of the reference population. Higher Z-scores reflected better neurological function and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. An increase in score indicated an improvement (Z-score range: -3 to +3). Acquisition of disability was measured by change from Baseline in MSFC score at Year 2.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Year 2</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Time Constant 2 (MRI-T2) Hyperintense Lesion Volume at Year 2 - Percent change in MS lesion volume as measured by MRI-T2 scan was calculated from MRI-T2-weighted scans as the following: (lesion volume at 2 years - lesion volume at Baseline)*100/ (lesion volume at Baseline).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Year 2</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of two different doses of
      alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) as a treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), in
      comparison with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif®). The study enrolled participants who
      had received an adequate trial of disease-modifying therapies but experienced at least 1
      relapse during prior treatment, and who met a minimum severity of disease as measured by
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants had monthly laboratory tests and comprehensive
      testing every 3 months.</summary>
