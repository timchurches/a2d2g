  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will wean antidepressnt medication between 35 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, and then restart at one week post partum.  The medications given will be any SSRI/SNRI medications given orally at dosage equivalents of up to 60mg of citalopram daily or 375mg of Venlafaxine daily.  In many cases the participants will already be on the medications prior to being enrolled in the trial.  In the group that weans they will continue their medication on a daily basis for as long as clinically indicated; usually at least twelve months post partum</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparison groups - One group to wean and cease antidepressants at 35 weeks of pregnancy and one group to continue to term; group that weans will recommence antidepressant treatment at one week post partum and continue for as long as clinically indicated, usually at least telve months post partum.
Also control group of general population antenatal patients not receiving antidepressant therapy</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose of the study is to examine mother and baby outcomes following exposure to antidepressant medication during pergnancy.  Patients will be asked to either continue antidepressant  medication up until and after delivery; or to wean medication at 35 weeks of pregnancy and recommence at one week post partum.  The primary hypothesis is the women who continue their medication through delivery will have fewer depressive symptoms. The secondary hypothesis is that babies exposed to antidepressant medication to term will be more likely to have discontinuation symptoms such as jitteriness and irritability</summary>
