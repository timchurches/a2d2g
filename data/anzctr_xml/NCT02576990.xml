  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, participants with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell
      lymphoma (rrPMBCL) or relapsed or refractory Richter Syndrome (rrRS) will receive
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475). The efficacy of pembrolizumab in the treatment of rrPMBCL and rrRS
      will be evaluated. The primary study hypothesis is that intravenous (IV) administration of
      single agent pembrolizumab will result in an Objective Response Rate (ORR) of greater than
      15% using the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria (Cheson, 2007) by
      independent central review.</summary>
